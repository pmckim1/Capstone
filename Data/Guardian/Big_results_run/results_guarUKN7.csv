2016-07-15T05:00:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May heads to Scotland for talks with Nicola Sturgeon,"Theresa May will travel to Edinburgh to meet Nicola Sturgeon on Friday, in what will be the new prime minister’s first visit since taking office. Following her unsparing cabinet reshuffle, May will meet Scotland’s first minister at her official residence, Bute House, where the prime minister has said she intends to emphasise her strong personal support for the Union, as well as her commitment to fully engaging with the Scottish government in the coming Brexit negotiations.
Speaking before the visit, May repeated her pledge to protect the “precious bond” of the United Kingdom, which she first made on the steps of Downing Street on Wednesday. “I believe with all my heart in the United Kingdom – the precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This visit to Scotland is my first as prime minister and I’m coming here to show my commitment to preserving this special union that has endured for centuries.” May also promised the Scottish people that her government “will always be on your side”. “Every decision we take, every policy we take forward, we will stand up for you and your family – not the rich, the mighty or the powerful. “That’s because I believe in a union, not just between the nations of the United Kingdom, but between all of our citizens. Whether it’s reforming the economy or strengthening our society, we are going to build a better Britain and a nation that works for everyone – not just the privileged few.” Speaking to the BBC’s Reporting Scotland on Thursday evening, Sturgeon said that it was incumbent on supporters of the Union to prove that this was the best way of protecting Scotland’s interests following the vote to leave the EU.
The SNP leader insisted: “I am determined to protect Scotland’s interests – many of our interests are now at risk because of the Brexit vote. The question is can I do that through the UK processes. It may reach a conclusion that independence is the only way to protect those interests.” “For those who advance the UK there is an onus of responsibility in light of the referendum to demonstrate that the UK is capable of protecting Scotland’s interests. I’m determined to find options within the UK context and process to do that.” Earlier on Thursday, Nicola Sturgeon described as “deeply disappointing” the comments made by the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, when he said that he could not envisage a scenario where Scotland has a different relationship with the EU from the rest of the UK. Speaking on BBC Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme on Thursday, Hammond insisted that “the best future for Scotland is inside the United Kingdom economy” and that Scotland should be part of a UK-wide position of negotiating “from outside the European Union”. He also dismissed the idea that Scotland would have a separate relationship with the European single market. Sturgeon said: “I have been absolutely clear on this issue – the people of Scotland voted decisively to stay part of the European Union and their wishes must be respected.” “That includes respect from the UK government, which is why Philip Hammond’s comments are deeply disappointing – I very much hope the new prime minister will be more open to constructive discussion.”"
2016-07-15T10:28:12Z,uk-news,UK news,97 Lea Bridge Road: a case study of redevelopment in east London,"One of the most ambitious goals of Sadiq Khan’s mayoralty is to substantially increase the proportion of homes he considers “genuinely affordable” included in new London property development schemes. James Murray, his innovative deputy for housing, has set a long-term goal of a 50% average across the capital as a whole, which would be far more than Boris Johnson secured. How will Labour man Khan’s administration feel about a project recently approved by Labour-run Waltham Forest Council that proposes only 21%? The site in question is at 97 Lea Bridge Road E10, a main road through Leyton and Walthamstow near Waltham Forest’s boundary with Hackney, not far from the Olympic Park (or, as it happens, from where I live). At present it contains two-storey warehouses and a four-storey commercial building. A clothing distributor, a furniture store and an MOT service centre are among the tenants and about one third of the space is now vacant. Developer Lea Bridge Hill LLP wants to replace these buildings with 300 dwellings, just over half of them two-bedroom flats. They would stand in nine blocks ranging in height from five storeys to 18. Of the 300 units, 62 would fall into the “affordable” category as defined in national government policy (Khan’s definition is set to be a bit more stringent, but that is down the line). Twenty-four of those 62 would be from the “intermediate” part of the affordable spectrum - presumably for shared ownership, aimed at households on low-to-middle incomes - and 38 would be for “affordable rent”, a tenure for people eligible for social housing but whose rent levels are almost always higher than for traditional social housing. The planning officers’ report says the mix of homes proposed has been “carefully designed to optimise housing delivery on site” and that, whilst including 28 three-bedroom homes and one four-bedroom one, it recognises “the likely demographic of future occupants – young professionals and couples taking advantage of the excellent transport links into central London.” The switch of the site from light industrial to primarily residential use is seen as both logical and made possible by the recent re-opening of the Lea Bridge railway station, which connects directly to Stratford, the very heart of east London’s Olympian development boom. The council sees the Lea Bridge Road project as helping to form a new “gateway” into the borough in a location where tall buildings are deemed acceptable within the designated Olympic fringe “growth area”. It is intended to also include shops, a gym and, potentially, a GP surgery. As things stand there will also be 60 underground car parking spaces and 540 cycle parking spaces, almost all of them for residents. A segregated cycle lane is planned for Lea Bridge Road, and will go right past the site as part of its ongoing mini-Holland status, secured under Mayor Johnson. The council granted permission for the scheme subject to the signing of a Section 106 agreement under which the developer would accept certain obligations, in the usual way. The list of these includes financial contributions towards local employment and training (£741,923), road junction improvements (£600,000), tree planting (£201,795), air quality improvement projects and monitoring (£80,430) and shop front improvements (£50,000), as well as the 62 affordable homes. Does the 97 Lea Bridge Road scheme represent a good deal for the borough and for London? Will it be acceptable to Labour Mayor Khan, whose blessing for it must be obtained? Although it was approved by Waltham Forest on 7 June, just over a month after Khan’s election on 5 May, it still needs a green light from him. The scheme evolved under his Conservative predecessor, whose Greater London Authority (GLA) planning officers had it presented to them last November as part of what is known as a Stage 1 referral to the mayor. Mayoral powers allow the blocking of large schemes that don’t meet the requirements of the overarching London Plan, but Johnson’s stance was generally supportive. The planning process is now very far advanced. There have been some objections from local people, including the group Architects E17 which takes a close interest in Waltham Forest planning decisions. The low quantity and type of affordable housing has been questioned, as has the proposed height and density of the flats. The Waltham Forest planning officers’ report records that an assessment they had done of the developers’ assessment of the financial viability of the scheme confirmed that the amount of affordable homes included was the most that could be extracted for the numbers to stack up. A “review mechanism” has been suggested to potentially allow more to eventually be included. The report also acknowledges that, at roughly 375 units per hectare, the current London Plan “density range” is exceeded. However, this is judged appropriate next to a new station because the application is deemed to have met the requirement of being “exemplary in all other respects”. GLA officers considered the exceptional height of the highest blocks acceptable “given the proximity to the new station, the importance of Lea Bridge Road and the changing context of the area”. They also addressed the fact that “at upper levels the distance between the blocks narrows to approximately 10 metres at the closest point”. This may seem alarmingly adjacent. However, the GLA decided that “the positioning of balconies and bedroom spaces generally allows sufficient distance and privacy between living spaces”. I asked Waltham Forest if they could explain more fully why only 21% of the housing in the application is affordable - sometimes a low figure is justified by industrial sites being contaminated and costly to demolish, for example. The council did not oblige, but said that the affordable percentage it had secured across the borough as a whole in the last financial year had been a very high 65%. The mayor’s office said that, whilst it was aware of the council’s decision on 7 June, the Stage 2 referral of the application, which triggers the mayor taking his final decision on the plans, has yet to be made. This will happen in due course, following what I understand to be some continuing conversations about aspects of Stage 1. After it happens, Mayor Khan will have 14 days in which to decide whether to let Waltham Forest’s conditional approval of the application go ahead, tell them to refuse it or appropriate it for his own determination. Whatever happens next will be enlightening."
2016-07-15T11:16:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Jo Cox funeral brings thousands of mourners on to streets,"The people of Batley and Spen have turned out in their thousands to pay their respects to the MP Jo Cox, who was murdered outside an advice surgery last month.
As the hearse carrying Cox’s wicker coffin reached Heckmondwike, where Cox grew up in West Yorkshire, children from a primary school threw white roses at the car. The MP had visited Norristhorpe junior and infant school at the start of the year after hearing that its choir had performed at the Royal Albert Hall in London. “She said she wanted to hear them sing, so she came in for an assembly and they performed for her,” the year two teacher Kim Wharton said. The choir sang at the memorial for Cox in Batley last month on what would have been her 42nd birthday, performing Love Shines A Light and Ain’t No Mountain High Enough.
On Friday, the children stood solemnly by the side of Westgate in their blue jumpers as the cortege passed. Some were only a few years older than Cox’s son, Cuillin, five. He and his sister, Lejla, three, were in the back seat of one of the funeral cars, with their father, Brendan, as they drove towards Batley for a private service. Lejla waved at the crowd, as young children are taught to do: an innocent gesture which prompted tears among many of those lining the road. Heckmondwike was silent as the cortege approached, with just the sound of a helicopter above. Yorkshire Bank staff stood outside the branch in their uniforms, while employees at Betfred stood at the window, unable to leave the bookmakers unattended. A lady from Fultons Food stood guard in her tabard outside the discount shop, head bowed as the cars passed. Someone had attached a poster to lamp posts and traffic lights, with a drawing of Cox protected in a plastic wallet. “Today I pledge to #LoveLikeJo” read the message, alongside a quote from her maiden speech: “Far more unites us than divides us.”
On the morning of the funeral, Brendan Cox wrote about the mass killing in Nice, France, on Twitter.
Many in the crowd had a personal story of meeting Cox. Jason Yarrow, 48, a travelling salesman, had a photo on his phone of the MP meeting his six-year-old son, Will, at his Beaver group. “Will had got a bit upset because they took a group photo with Jo and there was a bigger boy in front of him, and he worried he wouldn’t be seen,” Yarrow recalled. “So Jo made a special effort to have another picture taken, just the two of them.” In the shot, Will and the MP are making tiger claws with their hands, with Cox sending the camera a mischievous grin. Yarrow’s family live in Birstall, where Cox was shot and stabbed outside the library on 16 June. Thomas Mair, who has been charged with her murder, was arrested on their street.
Another constituent, Janet Hartley, recalled the MP knocking on her door before last year’s general election. “Other politicians get other people to do it but she came herself,” the 57-year-old carer said. “She took time to listen to you, even if you were telling her about quite personal, private things that had nothing to do with the government.” Cox had visited Hartley’s grandchildren’s school the morning she was killed, she said, and her eight-year-old granddaughter had been left “devastated” by events. A-level students Nawami Jasm and Natalie Burggy, both 17, said they had come from Leeds to pay their respects and brought sunflowers. “I never met Jo but she seemed a happy person and sunflowers are happy flowers,” Jasm said. Deanna Dove, 76, was holding a red and a white rose. “Red for love and white for Jo: a true Yorkshire rose,” she said. “We will never forget her. She was tough, like Yorkshire people are. Very, very strong. We will take her to our hearts for ever.”"
2016-07-15T12:48:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Rail minister resigns as Southern commuter chaos continues,"The rail minister Claire Perry, who has been the public face of the government during the outcry over Southern railway’s failures, has resigned. No reason was given by the Department for Transport for her resignation, which happened on Thursday evening after a fractious week in which she admitted she was “often ashamed to be the rail minister”. In a Commons debate on Tuesday about Govia Thameslink Railway, which owns the Southern franchise, Perry said: “If I thought it would help by falling on my sword, I would. This feels like a failure.” While problems at Southern predate an industrial dispute that started last year over the role of guards or conductors on trains, the cancellations have worsened since strike action was called by the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) and staff sickness rates rose earlier this year. Southern said it would press ahead with changes to conductors’ jobs, which have been resisted by the RMT on grounds of safety and fears of job losses. Perry made an offer on Sunday to unions to guarantee the presence of a second staff member on trains into the next franchise term. But the RMT said the announcement raised more questions than answers. Perry, the Conservative MP for Devizes, had been rail minister since July 2014. Southern introduced an emergency timetable on Monday, cutting 341 trains a day to try to create a more predictable and resilient service, after a wave of cancellations and delays had caused fury among commuters.
On Friday, Southern announced it would be restoring 16 of those services after a relatively reliable week, with 80% of scheduled trains arriving on time, compared with about 60% when the normal timetable was running. Restored services include some of the trains serving south-east London to Tulse Hill and along the south coast from Seaford and Lewes. Southern’s passenger service director, Alex Foulds, said it had “fine tuned” the deployment of available train crews. “The journey to restoring the railway to a better level of performance still has some way to go but we are encouraged that the new timetable is a first step in that direction,” he added. The disruption caused to commuters’ journeys prompted a demonstration at Victoria station, London, on Monday, while MPs of all parties and the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, have called for Govia to be stripped of the Southern franchise. Despite Southern missing targets and being fined for its performance, the government had resisted calls to take over the franchise. Perry repeatedly said she she would not countenance such a move. In transport questions in the Commons on 30 June, she said: “In my view, changing the franchise would do nothing. Everybody has to work together. There is a highly experienced management team already in place.” While ministers blamed unions for disruption, commuters have often appeared most critical of Southern management. Monday’s protesters also demanded the government faced up to “its responsibility to hold Southern and GTR to account”. View along the line According to commuters at Redhill station, in a part of Surrey whose residents rely heavily on Southern, the emergency timetable has proved more predictable but at a cost. Kate Hayes, 55, from Nutfield, connects daily to London on the 6.46am at Redhill when her Tonbridge branch line train makes it in time. On Thursday morning, trains were running smoothly through Redhill with only slight delays: “This is a good day but often it’s a disaster.” Since Monday, “it’s been more reliable, yes – but not convenient”, she added. Fellow commuter Fran Dobson, said: “Our worry is that they say it’s temporary but could soon be permanent.” Already, timetable alterations have forced Dobson to change trains twice to return home to pick up her child and she factors in an extra hour after being constantly delayed. Both seem more resigned now than furious. Dobson said: “There’s not much anger but it’s past that stage.” But neither blames the staff or the strike. “It was a bad service before all this,” said Dobson. Jonathan Ricketts, 34, cycles to Redhill although he lives in Reigate. He said: “I don’t risking getting the train from there. At night it’s absolute chaos.” Nuala Read, 45, commutes to London Bridge from Reigate. “Since the new timetable it’s been a bit better. But often it’s hours: not just two hours on the train, it’s being told it’s cancelled, being kicked off it, and not being able to get on the next one, after a 10-hour day. I was walking up the stairs at East Croydon, thinking, I feel like cattle, a piece of meat. You shouldn’t have to think about trains, they should be in the background. I’d move, but who wants to buy a house in Reigate now?” Season tickets cost £2,696 a year for the 21-mile journey to London. Jonathan Hanley, 34, has returned to commuting with a £258 monthly ticket for a short-term contracting job, and seemed calm waiting for his train. He says he habitually arrives for an early service in case it is cancelled. “The thing is, I’m used to it, mate,” he said. “It’s gone downhill, but it’s so atrocious, you get to a point where there’s nothing you can do. You’re held to ransom. But you get told off if you shout at people, so I have a little internal rant or something.” Up and down the line from London to the south coast, the frustration among commuters using Southern is equally palpable. “It’s a lot of stress,” said Jonny Glynn, standing on the platform of Haywards Heath on Tuesday evening, waiting for a delayed Southern rail train home to Lewes. “It sounds like a little thing but until you’re experiencing it, you have no idea what it’s actually like: to wake up and have no idea if your train is actually going to be there, whether you’re going to get back.” Andrew Millard, an IT engineer who commutes from Littlehaven to London, said at least once a week a journey that should take 50 minutes takes two hours. He too has taken to building in contingency time for services inevitably going wrong. “You can never be certain because there’s always last minute cancellations, so for last hour of work I’m constantly checking the app.” Martin Swain is a broadcast engineer who travels from Horley to London Bridge. “It’s been pretty traumatic to be honest, the service has been appalling since Christmas,” he said Martin Swain. A journey that should take 40 minutes to an hour has stretched to 90 minutes, or sometimes as much as three hours during recent delays and cancellations. “At first I was blaming the guards for work to rule, then I was blaming Southern and then ultimately I start to blame the government because I hear they’re using this as a test case to push through policy that will affect other railway users elsewhere,” Swain said. Many have had to reschedule lives, pay out of their own pocket for taxis because of services running late or ending prematurely. While some did claim from Southern delay repay – for trains more than 30 minutes late – they said the compensation was meagre. Katie Bullard, a secondary school teacher in London who travels between Tulse Hill and London Bridge, said: “As a teacher, it’s not like I can phone in if I’m late. Kids need to be taught, so it’s a significant impact, and expensive, because cover teachers cost a lot of money. It’s very frustrating … Frankly I think the government isn’t stepping in where it should be.”"
2016-07-15T13:44:35Z,uk-news,UK news,'London isn't just one people': the international families at home in the capital,"Belarus Iryna Kushniarevich, 35 I came to London in 2004, when I was 23. I never thought I would want to move away from home. The dean of my university in Minsk had suggested I study in Moscow, but I needed better English. One of my university professors lent me the money to study in London; the plan was to stay a couple of months, then apply to Moscow University.
When I arrived, I couldn’t speak or understand a word of English. My school was in Queensway, which isn’t the cheapest part of London. I found a job in a Greek restaurant in a basement which had a guy playing the piano. I studied during the day and worked at night, but it wasn’t enough money, so I got another job serving breakfast in a hotel. I would work there from 6am until 11am, then I had school until 3pm, then from 4pm until 2am I worked in the restaurant. I went to Moscow for one year. I had already met Andrzej, who is Polish, and who stayed behind in London. One of the reasons I decided to come back was for him; there is a tension between Russian and Polish communities in Moscow, so living there would have been uncomfortable for us. I asked a business professor at my university what I should do and he told me that, with my education, the only option I had was to return to London – that was the city that would value it. I am now a strategic account director at a fashion consultancy. I enjoy living here. I definitely do not identify as pure Belarusian, or British; I would say my identity is closest to that of a Londoner. Living here, you don’t need to travel the world; it’s so globalised, it almost doesn’t have a nationality. My parents, who are visiting us, are very supportive of me living here – my dad loves the politeness of London. But since the vote to leave Europe, I get the feeling people don’t want foreigners where I live. I don’t feel at home. If I was English, I would probably also say, “I don’t want these people here.” I know it’s a very closed-minded view, but I don’t know how I would act given the same choice. Greece
Panagiota Strigopoulou, 46 I lived in Greece until I was 23, so I’ve been living in London for 23 years now. I come from Corinth, west of Athens. I lived in Paris for a year, but I found it hard to integrate, so I decided to come here and work as an au pair. I’m now a full-time mother, though I’m looking for a job at the moment. Before that, I was an office manager at a business advisory service. For me, London is the European capital. I found Greece a bit traditional, and felt more accepted by British people; I felt my personality and my work were valued here. I didn’t hang out with Greek people, and even now I’ve got friends from many countries. I find it interesting, exciting and positive that we’re like the United Nations – I didn’t find that in Paris. I was also very interested in the arts, and there’s so much going on here. Now I’d say I feel partly British, partly European, partly a Londoner, partly Greek; I’ve got four identities. Five, really, since my son, who’s four, is half Nigerian and I’d like him to learn Yoruba and embrace his culture. The last time I visited Greece was three years ago, so my mother could see my son. I don’t think I could live there. I really feel London is Europe’s America,because there are so many opportunities, but I don’t know what’s going to happen now. I feel very sorry for the people who voted to leave, because it shows narrow-mindedness and bigotry, and I think the Murdoch press pushed a lot of that. Austria/Ireland
Agnes Lennon, 41 In Austria, I did a dressmaking apprenticeship, but after five years I didn’t want to touch a needle or thread again; I’d had enough of it. So in 1995 I came to London to study contemporary dance and choreography. One of my first impressions was how many people there are here; I remember ending up with a massive headache because I couldn’t process it all. I didn’t intend to stay, but then I met Danny. I started making costumes for the National Theatre, then I worked in the Royal Opera House’s costume department. After we had the kids, I decided not to go back. We run a business together now, building scenery for theatre and television. It’s a big adventure, and we’re really proud of it. When Danny and I got married, I thought, oh God, there is a decision being made. I was really aware that the fact I married Danny probably meant I would stay: he was born in east London, to an English mother and Irish father. When I turned 40, I had lived 20 years in Austria and 20 years here. When I go to Austria now, I notice my parents and sister often don’t understand the topics I talk about. Yet being here you always get identified as the Austrian – you never quite escape that. People hear your voice and say, “Oooh, I can’t quite place your accent. Where are you from?” I speak German to the kids, but sometimes find it hard to have the energy at the end of the day. My parents visit, and we go twice a year. I like living in London a lot, so I’m hugely disappointed about Brexit. I’ve felt really low for two weeks. My gut reaction was, “I’m not sure I want to live in England any more.” But I didn’t think of going back to Austria: our business and family are here. Before the referendum, I’d never have entertained giving up my Austrian citizenship for British, but I can’t vote here, and the longer I stay, the worse I feel about it. Chile
Ana Tordecilla, 50 I arrived here when I was 10. My dad, a miner, was imprisoned under the Pinochet regime for being a communist. He was tortured, electrocuted; he had nails put through his fingers. I remember when we visited him in prison, I had to smuggle in limes, because he wasn’t allowed them and kids didn’t get searched. I will never forget my mother saying, “Put these under your jumper – your dad needs them for a salad.” When we left the country, all I knew was we had to pack our stuff and wait for my father at the airport. I remember seeing him being escorted by police; he was wearing navy blue trousers, a green jumper my mother had knitted and a stripy blue shirt. I didn’t know what London was. I had never seen an aeroplane – I just knew we were getting into something that would fly in the sky. We stayed in Shepherd’s Bush, in a hotel with other Chilean asylum seekers. Families took turns to cook. We didn’t speak any English. My dad went out and bought tins of what he thought was beef, and we made a casserole. We later found out it was dog food. We’ve been in London for 40 years now and it’s my home, but I don’t really feel like a Londoner. I still speak Chilean Spanish and I cook Chilean food. I think once Chilean, you’re always Chilean. Maximilliano, 28 I’ve lived here all my life. London isn’t just one people, it’s a mix; my mother is Chilean and my father is Jamaican-Chinese, so I’m basically a Londoner. But we want to move to Spain, so my partner and children are learning Spanish. Brexit has made us want to leave sooner. I am a personal trainer, but I could be a fitness instructor or a lifeguard in Spain. The British embassy there has released a video saying foreigners living in Spain can stay, but I’m worried that in two years they will decide we need visas. I am a Londoner, but I’m more Chilean than anything. When it comes to the World Cup, it’s Chile. I have the Chilean flag on my wall. I know my country’s history and what my family have been through. Nigeria
Joe Ogunmokun, 28 Mum moved here from Nigeria when she was 19, predominantly for educational purposes, though quite a lot of extended family were here already. She married my dad, who is also from Nigeria, in 1987. He left the country and never came back. I was born in Hackney, near enough to the Bow bells that I can call myself a cockney. My last visit to Nigeria was when I was about 13. When you’ve got immigrant parents, they tend either to want you to immerse yourself in British culture and almost forget your heritage, or they isolate you and bring you up as strictly from their part of the world. The way my mum went was “immerse yourself”.
Most of my pals are white. We moved to quite a middle-class area in Muswell Hill. But, as I grew up, I started to realise being black did make me different: racial profiling, racist abuse, attitudes towards you because of the colour of your skin – the things my mother had warned me about and I had dismissed. When I was 17, I was coming back from a party with a couple of white female friends. We stopped off at a kebab shop and some coppers asked to speak to me. They said that down the road a car window had been smashed and I fitted the description given by a witness: black male with black jacket, black trainers and black jeans. Based solely on that, I was arrested – I didn’t even get to eat my kebab – and spent 15 hours in a cell. That was my first real incident of being pigeonholed as a black male. But, overall, London is a haven. My ex-girlfriend’s parents lived in Devon and everyone is nice and polite, but it’s also obvious that you are one of the few black people they have seen. I’m conscious of not jumping on the bandwagon that Brexit has been a win for the fascists, but it is scary to see the fallout. A black friend who lives in Leeds posted that he was on the bus, accidentally brought out the wrong pass, and while he was looking for the right one someone said, “We didn’t let you in this country to waste our time.” It’s scary that people are using this as an excuse to vocalise their insidious thoughts. China/Mauritius
Michael Yee-Chong, 51 My grandfather was Chinese. He migrated to Mauritius when he was 12, by himself. He wanted to travel, conquer the world, find money and return home – but he never did. He made his way through China to Hong Kong, and got a right of passage to Mauritius, which was a British colony. I was always proud of my name, Yee-Chong, but I found out a few years ago that when he landed in Mauritius, they said, “What’s your name?” and he just made it up. He had 11 kids, and sent the five boys to Europe to study medicine. At the time, Britain was crying out for people to study medicine, especially dentistry. So my father came to the UK from Mauritius on a boat that took about 36 days, studied dentistry in Durham, then came down to London where he met my mother; she’s London Caucasian. Most people see me and think I’m Chinese or Thai; they don’t see the mix. I remember as a kid feeling alienated and just wanting to blend in, but I’m proud of my mixed heritage now, and so are my children. But I wouldn’t stick my neck out further than saying I am a Londoner. I remember when I was a kid, filling in my passport, and my mother said, “You can’t say you’re English.” I said, “Why not?” and she said, “Because you’re not 100% Caucasian, you have to say you’re British.” She denies it now, but I remember. I went to Mauritius as a child, and eight years ago for my grandmother’s 100th birthday; a little TV company turned up to film her and give her a cheque for $40. She passed away six months later. I’m hoping to get my children and my dad, who’s 84, over there for Christmas. The vote to leave Europe is a shame. It just became a race vote, middle England saying, “Pull up the drawbridge.” We’re an island, but we are affiliated to the rest of the world and part of Europe. To isolate yourself from all that is really bad, and just gives people permission to be xenophobic. I haven’t experienced any racism since the vote. If anything, I’m worried about travelling round Europe. I wonder how they’ll put up with English people now. Bosnia
Edita Becvkic-Solak, 46 The war started 12 days after Vivien was born. We arrived with three suitcases, £100 and a baby. Vivien’s father is half Catholic, half Serb, and I am Muslim, so there was no life for us there. When we got to London, we had just a bedroom and shared the kitchen and bathroom with other people, but it didn’t really matter. The main thing was to be safe and for Vivien to have a normal childhood. We had £75 a week. After buying nappies and this and that, you were left with £5, and you’d think, “Should I call home? What’s my priority?” Frozen burgers from Iceland was the cheapest thing you could buy: from 24 burgers you could make meatballs, pasta – it was tough, but you got on with it. I’ve never bought frozen burgers since. Until she got the paperwork, my mother never felt safe. If I bought something, she would have a go at me: “Why are you buying that when you’ll just have to leave it behind?” Vivien I have always known why we came here, but I didn’t understand the importance of it until a few years ago. I’d look it up and think, I was involved in something huge that changed the course of history and politics in my region for ever. My father came here as a tea boy, serving the corporate world; now he’s a boss at a global news company. Mum moved here with a baby; now she’s a senior retail manager. Neither has formal qualifications: it was all through determination and hard graft. That’s quite inspirational. I’ll never feel 100% English because, although I grew up here, I had a very different upbringing from my British friends. I never understood the Sunday roast – we don’t do them. I won’t ever feel 100% Bosnian, either, because when I go back I’m an outsider. I speak the language fluently but not colloquially, so can’t always understand. Even our clothes are different. I am angry about Brexit. It’s scaremongering, lies, nationalism and psychological manipulation. I met a Scottish guy at a party. “We voted Brexit – we want all the immigrants out!” he said. I told him I was an immigrant. He said, “You can stay. You sound English.” Philippines
Rosemarie Joy Fernandez, 37 I moved here from the Philippines 10 years ago. I went to Bournemouth to study photography, because the fashion photographer Nick Knight went there. I’m now working for his longtime printer, which is amazing; I ended up working for the person I wanted to work for. I’m going back to the Philippines this month for work, launching a small publishing project. It’s a collaboration with a photographer who lives up in the mountains and has been documenting the tribes for more than 30 years. I’m trying to bring whatever I’ve learned here in England to the photographers over there, who don’t have the same production values. My family in the Philippines think I have an English accent; English people think I have an American accent. There is an Elvis Presley song, Stranger In My Own Home Town, that I often think is quite apt: everything can feel so familiar, but at the same time everything has changed, and it’s what happens to London every day. Places become more gentrified; buildings are there and the next day they’re gone, but the people stay the same. My husband is a sound engineer, so both our industries are based in London – for now. I don’t know how the vote to leave Europe will affect our work. My boss’s daughter and his wife both voted out, my colleague’s wife voted out – and I’m really, really gutted, because I love working here. Now I feel, “Am I meant to be here?” It feels like a general rejection of what London is: an international city, with people coming in and out. I feel disheartened. I am a Londoner because I have a family here. I am married to somebody from Leeds, and our little boy was born here. London is a place of possibility – where if you have your heart set on something, it can happen. Bangladesh/South Africa
Simone, 50 We are Londoners, but in terms of heritage I am from Bangladesh and my husband is from South Africa. He left because he had exposed corruption in its arms industry. I came to Britain in 1971 during the war of independence, when I was five. My parents and grandparents also had a history here going back to the 50s. My mother came to school here; my father studied law and was a barrister here. I don’t really remember Bangladesh. My brother does, because he was torn away from primary school. We had to learn English; my first memory of London is watching Play School, the kids’ TV programme, and seeing the images and not understanding a thing. I was just telling my son how different London is now. I know there is still a lot of racist abuse, but he doesn’t experience it in his daily life. I remember being called a Paki and running after kids who were picking on my younger brother. My mother remembers feeling gutted once, when I was very young, and I asked if I could go into the washing machine so I could be less brown. Yet she can’t remember anything negative when she was first here, before the 70s; people would stop her in Golders Green and touch her hair, saying, “Such beautiful black hair.” I visit Bangladesh regularly for work and to see family, but I absolutely feel a Londoner. What makes you you is really more about your values, and I feel at home here. It’s hackneyed but true that London is a big mix of diversities: my daughter has just left the house with a group of friends, one of whom has Jewish and Muslim parents, one has Korean parents, one has English parents, one has two mothers – I think that’s wonderful. There’s a level of diversity that really is exceptional. I think Brexit is a sad moment. As an economist, I have despaired at how the EU has functioned; it is not transparent, it is frankly corrupt, so there are a lot of things about the EU I don’t approve of. But the sentiment that has driven the exit is really worrying. I feel depressed about the underlying “us and them” attitude that has driven people to this. • Are you a Londoner and willing to be photographed for this project?

2016-07-15T14:00:25Z,uk-news,UK news,London tiler convicted of rape and murder of teenager 34 years ago,"A former tiler has been convicted of the rape and murder of a teenage girl nearly 34 years ago after spending half a lifetime working and living in the same borough of London in which he committed the crime. James Warnock, now 56, was found guilty by jury at the Old Bailey on Thursday of raping and strangling 17-year-old Yiannoulla Yianni, known to her family as Lucy, when she was home alone in Hampstead on the afternoon of 13 August 1982. Her family broke down in tears as the jury took just over two hours to find Warnock guilty. Warnock, who went on to have two children with his wife after the murder, was arrested in December last year on suspicion of making indecent images of children at his home in Harrington Street, two miles from where he took Lucy’s life. Detectives took a routine swab test from Warnock upon his arrest and a week later the results returned a match on the national DNA database with samples taken from Lucy’s body and the crime scene nearly 34 years ago. The verdict could not be reported until Warnock entered guilty pleas to six charges of making indecent images of children between 2013 and 2015. “We were really beginning to think the perpetrator was either dead or it was such a long time past that he had to be abroad or we might never find them,” said DI Julie Willats, who took on the case in 2013. “It was the science that has solved this one.” Lucy, who was also known by schoolmates as Noodles, was waiting for O-level exam results from Quintin Kynaston school in St John’s Wood and was considering a career as a beautician or in banking. The former Woolworths shop assistant enjoyed reading, watching television, styling her hair with an old-fashioned dryer, and taking Greek dancing classes. On the day of the attack, Lucy had been with her parents Elli and George Yianni at their shoe repair shop minutes from their home. Lucy’s mother had sent her ahead to start preparing a leg of lamb for supper, planning to join her soon after. At around 2pm, a man in his early 20s was spotted chatting with Lucy on her doorstep and 20 minutes later, a neighbour heard a scream. When the parents arrived home half an hour later, they found Lucy’s jewellery scattered on the stairs, and they called out to her but were met with silence. Upstairs, in their bedroom, they were confronted with a horrific scene: they found Lucy on their bed, half naked and dead. Despite a high-profile police appeal, which included a reconstruction by Maria, Lucy’s sister, the crime was never solved. Warnock, who had married Lynne Abrahams a year before the murder, lived in Taplow Tower in Adelaide Road at the time – a short walk from Lucy’s home. He moved away a short while after to start a family with Abrahams, whom he went on to divorce in 2003. Yiannoulla’s heartbroken father died in 1988 without ever seeing justice for his daughter. Her mother, however, is now 86 and despite ill health gave evidence during Warnock’s trial. “Her father died a few years later, he never really got over it,” Willats said. “While he was alive he even wrote to the prime minister and the commissioner at Scotland Yard begging that the investigation is never closed and it never has.” Witnesses at the time described the man on Lucy’s doorstep as being in his early 20s and possibly “Mediterranean-looking”. Artists impressions and e-fits were created, which officers now believe presented an accurate likeness of Warnock. More than 1,000 witness statements were taken in the case which has been periodically reviewed. A small number of arrests were made but were based on routine elimination rather than meaningful leads. When Willats took on the role, faced with an absence of CCTV or mobile phone records, tools to which modern policing has become accustomed, she adopted “old-fashioned” detective techniques. Following up on an old tip that a mysterious character dubbed “Tony the Barber” had murdered Lucy, Willats searched old copies of the Yellow Pages in the British Library and even trawled through an archived episode of comedy-drama Minder to case out key locations. When the match came back from the DNA database, Willats initially met the breakthrough with disbelief. “I got a text when I was at the theatre in January this year,” she said. “I was sitting there with my mum and I couldn’t wait for the interval, it was a really good show but I just wanted to get outside. I was thinking this can’t be right, it must be a mistake.” In a police interview, Warnock admitted he knew Lucy, having first noticed her when he took a pair of boots to be repaired at her father’s shop. Warnock claimed they would go for walks, sit on park benches and over time their relationship became more intimate, telling the court in front of Lucy’s disbelieving family he had sex with her on about 10 occasions. Asked what he looked like in 1982, the defendant told police: “How can I put it? Er John Travolta?” He claimed he had never seen any coverage of Lucy’s death because he did not read newspapers or watch the television. But medical evidence revealed Lucy had been a virgin when she was raped. “The story he creates is unbelievable,” Willats said."
2016-07-15T15:31:32Z,uk-news,UK news,May tells Sturgeon Holyrood will be 'fully engaged' in EU talks,"Theresa May has assured Nicola Sturgeon that she will not trigger article 50 until “a UK-wide approach” has been agreed for negotiations to leave the European Union. The prime minister was speaking after a nearly hour-long meeting with the Scottish first minister, who has pledged to consider all options for maintaining Scotland’s membership of the EU, including a second independence referendum. Sturgeon, who described their discussion as “constructive and very good”, said she envisaged a good working relationship developing with May. However, she also reiterated to the new prime minister that she would continue to consider a second independence referendum as an option to protect Scotland’s interests post-Brexit. In a striking change of tone to that she used with David Cameron, Sturgeon said: “The prime minister and I have big political disagreements but we are both women who approach business in a similar way, so I think we can have a good working relationship notwithstanding those political differences.” May’s choice of Edinburgh for her first official visit as prime minister highlights the Westminster government’s sense of urgency about keeping the UK together after Scots voted 62% to 38% to remain in the EU.
The two women posed briefly for photographers outside the first minister’s official residence, Bute House, before beginning their meeting. It was only the third time that the pair had met, and their first formal one-to-one meeting. After the talks, May told broadcasters outside Bute House: “I’m willing to listen to options and I’ve been very clear with the first minister today that I want the Scottish government to be fully engaged in our discussions.” Describing the talks as positive, she added: “I have already said that I won’t be triggering article 50 until I think that we have a UK approach and objectives for negotiations – I think it is important that we establish that before we trigger article 50.” Sturgeon said later that she was “very pleased that Theresa May said that she was absolutely willing to consider any options that the Scottish government now brings forward to secure Scotland’s relationship with the European Union”. “These negotiations have yet to take shape and the UK government don’t yet know exactly how they will proceed from here, but there is an agreement that Scottish government officials will be very closely involved in discussions to give shape to this process and will be involved in that process. Crucially, and this is the most important point from my point of view, is that that process will be open to considering options that the Scottish government brings forward.” The SNP leader said that she had told the prime minister that she would continue to examine every option possible to protect Scotland’s interests. She said: “I’ve said previously that if we want to protect our relationship with the European Union then Scotland may have to consider becoming an independent member. If it proves not to be possible to fully protect Scotland’s interests through the UK process then the prime minister knows that a second independence referendum is of course on the table. “However, I’ve also been consistently clear that I want to examine all options for protecting Scotland’s position, protecting our interests, protecting our relationship with the EU. That’s why I’ve assembled a team of experts that will advise me on the options that might exist, and it was very important today to get a commitment from the prime minister to listen to options that the Scottish government will bring forward.” But May’s official spokeswoman insisted that the prime minister believed the issue of Scottish independence had now been settled. Before the meeting, she said: “It will be an opportunity to discuss how they are going to work together. An opportunity for the prime minister to underline to the first minister that she does want to make sure the UK government fully engages with the Scottish government on discussions around leaving the European Union. “And with regard to a second referendum, the prime minister’s view is that we have already had a referendum. It was legal, and fair, and the result was decisive.” After meeting Sturgeon, May went on to attend a Conservative party event where she was introduced by Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Tories, who was a strong supporter of May’s candidacy for leadership of the Westminster party."
2016-07-15T15:46:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Former police officer jailed for 18 years for raping two women,"A former police constable who worked as a family liaison officer has been jailed for 18 years for raping two vulnerable women. Jeffrey Davies, a father of two, drove one of the victims to the top of a remote Welsh mountain and attacked her, and told the other she would not be believed if she reported him. Davies, 45, was jailed for three years in 2013 for sexually assaulting two victims of domestic violence but was prosecuted again after the women he had raped saw newspaper reports of his conviction. After the latest conviction, the independent police complaints commissioner for Wales, Jan Williams, said: “He was a sex offender hiding within the police service committing fundamental breaches of trust placed in him as a police officer.” Jailing Davies at Cardiff crown court on Friday, Judge Jonathan Furness told him: “The arrogance you displayed is a feature of your behaviour to these women. You felt you were untouchable. You have not shown a shred of remorse or concern to these victims.” Davies, a former South Wales force officer, met one of the women when she collected her teenage sons from the police station. He drove her to the top of a mountain and raped her outside the car. When she told him: “No, please. Why are you doing this?” he replied: “It will make you feel better.” Susan Ferrier, prosecuting, said: “She felt ashamed, confused. She trusted him because he was a police officer. It was something which played on her mind constantly, and she blamed herself for getting in his car.” In a victim impact statement, the woman said the incident had had a “dramatic effect on her life”. She added: “I kept it to myself for 10 years. I didn’t know if anyone would believe me.” Ferrier said the second woman was involved in a short-lived relationship with Davies. Months after it ended, Davies called at the woman’s house while drunk to smoke cannabis with a relative of hers. She allowed Davies to spend the night on her sofa, but he entered her bedroom and raped her. Davies, from Aberdare, south Wales, denied all the charges. After the verdict, Chief Supt Dorian Lloyd, head of South Wales police professional standards department, said: “Our thoughts are with the victims of Jeffrey Davies. “To go through a court case of this nature as a victim of rape or sexual assault takes great courage and my hope is that today’s guilty verdict will provide some sense of closure to the victims and their families. “Davies was dismissed from South Wales police in 2013. He abused his position as a police officer and gave no regard to the traumatic effect that his actions would have on his victims. These were vulnerable women who, having encountered Davies, found themselves subjected to an appalling abuse of trust.”"
2016-07-15T15:59:42Z,uk-news,UK news,London mayor Sadiq Khan joins Gatwick bosses in call for new runway,"Gatwick’s campaign to win approval for a second runway has been boosted as the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, joined executives at the airport calling on the new prime minister to back expansion at Heathrow’s rival. The event came as Gatwick announced a further £200m to improve its terminal facilities, and a day after Theresa May’s new cabinet promoted several figures who oppose Heathrow’s third runway. Khan said Gatwick had “put together a formidable plan that is a fantastic display of their confidence in London”.
He added: “The new prime minister has a very important decision to make regarding new airport capacity, and I urge her to rule as swiftly as possible in favour of a second runway at Gatwick, which would bring substantial economic benefits.” While Khan had already made his support for Gatwick known, the event marks the first time since the Airports Commission was established in 2012 that a key political figure has shared a stage with executives at the contending airports to declare their partisan support. Gatwick’s chief executive, Stewart Wingate, said: “As Gatwick rapidly approaches full capacity, this increased investment paves the way for our second runway project. It is now clear that only Gatwick can deliver the runway Britain needs to boost international competitiveness and trading links at a time when it is most needed, and we can do that before 2025.” The debate over where to build a new runway around densely populated London has been raging for more than 25 years, with environmental opposition to expansion at Heathrow preventing earlier proposals being developed there. David Cameron had promised to make a decision by the end of last year on whether a new runway should be built at Britain’s largest airport, Heathrow, or Gatwick, but then backed away from a controversial issue that divided the Conservatives. The Airports Commission recommended in July last year that a third runway at Heathrow should be built, but in December the Department for Transport (DfT) announced that further investigation into noise, pollution and compensation was needed. Last month the DfT said the decision had been deferred until “at least October” following Cameron’s resignation as prime minister. A Heathrow spokesman said the Airports Commission had disagreed with Khan, adding that Brexit loaded the dice further in favour of the west London location. “Following an independent, £20m, two-and-a-half-year deep dive into the issue of airport capacity, they confirmed that Heathrow expansion could provide the capacity the UK needs more easily and quickly than any other option. “Brexit makes the commission’s conclusion that, with Heathrow expansion, ‘the benefits are significantly greater for business passengers, freight operators and the broader economy’ even more persuasive.” However, campaigners believe that the tide has turned against Heathrow. The campaign group Hacan republished archive material which showed that the new prime minister fiercely opposed the third runway in 2009, telling constituents: “We need a better Heathrow, not a bigger Heathrow.” The chancellor, Philip Hammond, declared his support for Gatwick in an article in his local constituency newspaper in 2013, while the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the education secretary, Justine Greening, have long opposed Heathrow expansion. Hacan’s chair, John Stewart, said: “There must now be a real question mark over a third runway. Heathrow will argue that its proposals now offer more to residents than the 2009 plan, but these archives make very clear that we have a prime minister who has expressed strong opposition to Heathrow expansion.”"
2016-07-15T16:40:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Police searching for missing author Helen Bailey ‘find body’,"Police investigating the disappearance of the children’s author Helen Bailey have found what is believed to be a body within the grounds of her home in Royston, Hertfordshire. A 55-year-old man from Royston who was arrested on Monday has been re-arrested on suspicion of murder and is being questioned at Stevenage police station. “Helen’s family have been updated of this significant development and are continuing to receive support from specialist family liaison officers,” said Det Ch Supt Paul Fullwood, the head of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit. “As you can fully appreciate, this will be an extremely difficult time for them and they have requested their privacy be respected at this time.” Bailey, 51, who wrote the Electra Brown and Daisy Davenport series, was reported missing by her partner, Ian Stewart, 55, on 15 April, four days after he said he had last seen her at home. A man was arrested by Hertfordshire police on Monday on suspicion of murder, disposing of a body in a manner likely to obstruct the coroner, and theft of money belonging to Bailey. He was released on bail on Tuesday as police officers continued to search the home Bailey shared with Stewart and his two sons, as well as their holiday home in Broadstairs, Kent. Friends initially said they believed the author may have gone there for “some time to herself”. The couple’s large detached house with outdoor swimming pool has been cordoned off with a high metal fence. Forensic officers in white suits have been seen inside and a tarpaulin tent has been set up at the front of the house. As well as writing children’s fiction, Bailey set up a blog, Planet Grief, where she described her struggle to cope with the sudden death of her husband, John Sinfield, who drowned during a holiday in Barbados in 2011. Her memoir of her grief, When Bad Things Happen in Good Bikinis, was published last year, and recounts how she met Stewart, whose wife died in 2011, through a bereavement group. Stewart told police officers that Bailey had left a note saying she needed some time to herself and was going to Broadstairs. After a few days, Stewart said he visited the Broadstairs property and discovered she was not there. Bailey was seen walking her dachshund Boris in Royston on the afternoon she vanished, and there was a possible sighting of the next day, 10 miles away, walking along a road in a “bedraggled” state. She has not contacted friends or family, used her mobile phone or withdrawn cash. In May, one month after she was last seen walking her dog, which is also missing, Stewart issued a written appeal. “You bring so much to so many people in ways you don’t even realise,” he said. “You not only mended my heart five years ago, but made it bigger, stronger and kinder. Together we learned to live with our grief and move forward with our lives, but never forgetting. Now it feels like my heart doesn’t even exist.” Shelley Whitehead, Bailey’s bereavement counsellor, said she was “absolutely gutted” when she learned an arrest had been made. “My overwhelming feeling is I feel sick to my stomach,” she said. “She was a brilliant writer, she was accomplished in everything she did. She cooked magnificently, she baked magnificently. She wrote wonderfully. She would have you laughing and crying in the turn of a sentence. As her coach I got to really understand and love this woman, who was resourceful and loved to make a difference. She would speak to anybody, she was very approachable.”"
2016-07-16T13:39:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Trident: what you need to know before the parliamentary vote,"Four Vanguard-class nuclear submarines carry the US-made Trident ballistic missiles that give the weapons system its collective name and which each have the capacity to deliver up to 12 thermonuclear warheads. The principle of continuous at-sea deterrence ensures at least one submarine is always on patrol, but only the British prime minister can authorise a missile strike. A safe within each vessel contains a sealed letter from the prime minister instructing the commanding officer about what to do in the event of a catastrophic nuclear attack that destroys the British government.
In 2006, a Ministry of Defence white paper estimated the cost of replacing the vessels to be between £15bn-£20bn. The following year MPs backed the then Labour government’s proposal to begin designing a new fleet of Successor-class submarines. Costs were revised upwards in 2011 when the programme reached the next design phase but the coalition government that came to power in 2010 deferred the final manufacturing decision until 2016. The Conservative party reaffirmed its commitment to replacing the fleet in its manifesto for the 2015 general election, which it won. The MoD has earmarked £41bn for the submarines in its latest costings; £3.9bn was spent during the design stages. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament said the total cost will be at least £205bn.
The Vanguard-class fleet operates out of the deep-water naval base at Faslane on the Clyde, but also makes use of the US navy’s base at Kings Bay in Georgia. Lockheed Martin Space Systems manufactures the Trident missiles at its factory in Sunnyvale, California. BAE Systems, Babcock International and Rolls-Royce are the main industrial partners in the Successor-class project.
The MoD has stated that maintaining and sustaining Trident supports more than 30,000 UK jobs. Approximately 2,200 people across the MoD and all three companies are currently working on the Successor programme, of whom more than 50% are engineers and designers. Jobs are expected to peak at 6,000 during the build phase and involve an estimated 850 British companies in the supply chain.
The UK has the smallest stockpile of nuclear warheads among countries recognised under the terms of the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons as having atomic weapons. Among these countries, the UK is also unique in relying on a single nuclear weapons system – Trident. There are nine known nuclear powers, chief among them the US and Russia, which retain formidable stockpiles despite substantial disarmament programmes. Pakistan, India and Israel are not party to the non-proliferation treaty."
2016-07-16T22:00:23Z,uk-news,UK news,"After decades in dire straits, Whitley Bay leads renaissance of northern resorts","Dire Straits sang in 1981 about Whitley Bay’s Spanish City pleasure beach, where lead singer Mark Knopfler first heard loud rock music. Twenty years after the song, Tunnel of Love, hit the charts, Spanish City’s domed Edwardian concert hall closed and fell derelict. Now the seaside resort, like many of its northern contemporaries, is gearing up for an ambitious renaissance.
The site of Spanish City is teeming with workmen restoring it to its former glory – part of a masterplan to turn the dilapidated town’s fortunes around. The past decade has seen a striking revival in the fortunes of southern English seaside towns, notably Margate, Hastings and Whitstable. That has made their northern counterparts, such as North Tyneside’s Whitley Bay, set their sights on their own renewal after decades of neglect that resulted from the collapse of the tourist trade in the 1980s. Whitley Bay has an ambitious £36m regeneration plan for the seafront. Patrick Melia, chief executive of North Tyneside council, sits on a bench in front of the Spanish City dome, as diggers create the foundations for a hotel being built alongside it, and recalls going to Whitley Bay prom as a boy. “It was very prosperous from the 50s to 70s, then deteriorated,” says Melia. “But we’re hoping that by investing and bringing the promenade back to life we bring the town back to life.” Work on the dome will begin next month and Spanish City will reopen for summer 2018. Soaking up the sun on the beach, on the first truly summery day of the year, Liz Aitchison, 67, a retired care services officer who has lived in Whitley Bay since 1981, says: “People don’t want to go into Whitley Bay because it’s scruffy. It’s a shame because it’s a beautiful coastline. But the council’s made a massive difference along the beach and if it draws more people in, I’ll be thrilled to bits.”
The recent fall in the value of sterling has provided a boost for the domestic travel industry, and figures from VisitEngland show that in 2014-15 overnight visits to English seaside towns grew by 7% to 19.36 million. However, visits to northern seasides fell 11% to 1.77 million. Last week the British Hospitality Association called for a “seaside tsar” to oversee the resurgence in the country’s coastal towns. If anywhere encapsulates how once-glamorous resorts have turned to poverty, it is Blackpool. The town that was a beacon of fun for half of England now has the highest proportion of neighbourhoods – one in five – in the most-deprived 1% in England. As part of a three-year plan called Destination Blackpool, the town is doing its best to appeal to holidaymakers again. Margate’s regeneration has been largely attributed to the success of the Turner Contemporary gallery, opened in 2011, and the Dreamland theme park, reopened as a high-class heritage attraction last year. Blackpool is hoping to emulate those moves by promoting its own Grundy Art Gallery and creating a museum in the old Winter Gardens, dedicated to Blackpool’s history as a destination for entertainment. Next May English National Opera will perform Gilbert and Sullivan’s Mikado over 10 days – the company’s first performances outside London since 1982.
The museum’s director, Belinda Betts, says the attraction will help renew a sense of pride in the town. “And it will be a major visitor attraction – a grownup museum, but with a sense of fun. We can’t go back to the past, but there are art installations on the sea defences, the museum, a Comedy Carpet [a huge artwork celebrating comedy catchphrases and writers] on the prom. Blackpool is evolving.” The signs are positive, but it is a slow evolution – the museum will not open until 2020 – and it may yet fail, as other projects have done. Urban Splash, a leading architectural firm specialising in regeneration, failed to get its ambitious eight-year plan to renew Morecambe seafront off the ground. Travis Elborough, author of Wish You Were Here: England on Sea, a history of English seaside towns, says: “The northern resorts have trailed behind those in the south, which have relaunched themselves as artistic hubs. It’s been slower because they don’t have the same dependency on London. But places like Scarborough, which I’m a huge fan of, have fabulous architecture, interesting history, and have had a lot of lottery money spent on their heritage, so there is artistic regeneration going on. “On the other hand, Blackpool’s big draw for a long time was the stag crowd and to have the duality of places like it becoming a sophisticated, arty destination is not the easiest balance to meet.” It will take skill to pull it off. One project that has managed this balance of past and present is Morecambe’s annual Vintage by the Sea festival, created by the designer Wayne Hemingway. On 3-4 September, for the fourth year running, festival goers will sport tweeds and dance the foxtrot, as their predecessors did in the 1950s. Hemingway was born in the town in 1961 and is immensely fond of it. “It was a very exciting place,” he says. “It always felt like a holiday – Bedlam in a good way.” And after recent decades when the town’s overarching mood was “misery”, he feels more hopeful than he has for a long time: “Like a lot of seaside towns, it’s on the up, a renaissance – not at the pace of Margate, but it’s a Morecambe renaissance.” He points to new art installations and landscaping on the seafront. “If you invest in culture – like Margate did with the Turner and Dreamland – it brings people. It can never go back to the glory days but if you’re there on a day with a colourful sky you still fall in love with the place.” COAST TO COAST Scarborough, North Yorkshire The Alpamare water park opens on 28 July.

2016-07-17T11:46:44Z,uk-news,UK news,SNP urges Theresa May to delay vote on Trident renewal,"The SNP urged Theresa May to delay Monday’s vote on Trident renewal, as thousands of people gathered in 37 towns and cities across Scotland over the weekend to protest against the continuation of the UK’s nuclear deterrent at Faslane. Referring to the “unprecedented political turmoil” of the past few weeks, the nationalists’ Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, said: “Having spent the best part of a month engaged in backstabbing, score-settling and navel-gazing, neither the Tories nor Labour are in any fit state to be giving proper scrutiny to decisions as important as this.”
Robertson, whose 54 SNP MPs will all vote against renewal, warned May against using Trident as “a political tool with which to try and embarrass divisions in the Labour party”. Although the UK Labour party affirmed its support for the deterrent at last autumn’s party conference, this spring aides to the leader, Jeremy Corbyn – who has always been outspoken in his opposition to Trident – suggested that Labour no longer had a policy in favour of renewal because it was under review. Meanwhile, Scottish Labour delegates voted overwhelmingly against renewal at their own party conference last year, despite the leader, Kezia Dugdale, remaining in favour of the policy. Robertson said: “Theresa May has made big commitments about a new style of government. I would urge her to put her words into action by showing that the Tories’ political games around Trident are a thing of the past – and allow MPs, and the public, the fully informed debate that they deserve.” The timing of Monday’s vote was initially decided by David Cameron, before the Conservatives’ leadership contest was truncated by Andrea Leadsom’s withdrawal. But May herself has since backed the early vote, describing it as “sheer madness” not to renew the deterrent given the variety of security threats facing the UK. The vote is still a procedural step away from the “maingate” decision, which MPs are also expected to be asked to vote on, which fully sanctions the Ministry of Defence proceeding to manufacture of the new submarines.
Robertson added that MPs needed to know the full costs of Trident renewal before they came to an informed decision, arguing that the widely used £167bn figure was based on partial information released by the UK government, while CND’s estimate was closer to £205bn. “It would be both morally and economically indefensible for the UK government to commit to spending hundreds of billions of pounds on weapons of mass destruction – even more so at a time when they are cutting funding for public services. “The enormous cost of Trident appears to be spiralling out of control. Before MPs can come to an informed view, they must have access to full costs across the lifetime of the programme.”"
2016-07-17T12:52:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Liverpool waterfront heritage status at risk as mayor rejects UN plea,"The world heritage site status of Liverpool’s waterfront is in jeopardy after the city’s mayor, Joe Anderson, rejected a plea by UN cultural chiefs to halt development in the city. Unesco recommended placing a two-year moratorium on new development within the world heritage site and its “buffer zone”, which includes much of the city centre. Anderson refused to comply with the cultural body’s request, saying that heritage status should not stifle growth in the city. Liverpool city council said Unesco’s recommendation, if implemented, would put hundreds of millions of pounds worth of investment and jobs at risk by sending out the message that Liverpool had “shut up shop and was closed for business”.Anderson said he would be writing to the UN body informing it that the city would not be complying with its request. He said: “Part of the problem that we face is if we go out and say to people: ‘Please come and invest in our city,’ but then say: ‘You can’t put in a planning application for two years’ – then our growth is going to suffer. “What I am saying in my letter is that we have a track record of protecting heritage and that speaks for itself. We value the heritage status but we can’t let it stifle the growth of our city. People ... come here for so many reasons – our culture, yes, our buildings, and because we are open and developing.” But officials have warned that Liverpool’s waterfront, whose buildings – including the Three Graces – inspired the creation of the Bund in Shanghai, could lose its heritage site status if it fails to comply. The city earned the designation from Unesco in 2004 in honour of its historic importance to the growth of the British empire and to European emigration to the US. But the waterfront was placed on a list of endangered world heritage sites in 2012 because of proposals to redevelop the docklands. Heritage campaigners recently went to court in a fight to stop the demolition of 10 historic buildings near Liverpool Lime Street station in the buffer zone. But the local authority said the number of historic buildings at risk of being lost is at a 25-year low and Historic England said the city is an example of best practice nationally.
A council spokesman said: “Liverpool remains open for business and all planning applications will continue to be determined in the usual way in line with national planning policies and guidance. “We can’t place developments in large parts of the city centre on hold as it would send out completely the wrong message to investors, cost jobs and leave us open to expensive legal challenges by developers. “We are working with the government, who make representations on behalf of world heritage sites at the Unesco committee, to look at how best to resolve the situation.” The council said the suggested moratorium would put three large development schemes at risk, including an £80m residential skyscraper planned for Princes Dock, a £60m project to build two student accommodation towers near the main train station and a new ferry terminal. The world heritage site covers six areas of the city and most of its landmarks, including the Pier Head and Albert Dock. On the Pier Head stand the Royal Liver building, the Cunard building and the Port of Liverpool building, collectively known as the Three Graces. They were built as a testament to the city’s great wealth as a trading port in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Unesco says in its citation that Liverpool is the supreme example of a commercial port at the time of Britain’s “greatest global influence”."
2016-07-17T14:30:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Labour split deepens as Thornberry urges MPs not to back Trident,"Labour’s internal split over renewing the Trident nuclear programme was reinforced on Sunday as the shadow foreign and defence secretaries urged their party to abstain from a vote in parliament on its renewal this week, while leadership challenger Owen Smith said he would back the government and Jeremy Corbyn said he would vote against. The House of Commons will spend much of Monday debating the government’s decision to replace the fleet of nuclear-armed submarines. The vote was decided earlier this month by David Cameron as a way to put the decision “beyond doubt”. But the debate has threatened to exacerbate divisions within Labour. The leader, Jeremy Corbyn, opposes renewing Trident but many of his MPs take a similar view to Smith, and official Labour policy is to back the renewal. The party is in the midst of an internal review of its nuclear weapons policy.
In a joint article for the Guardian, Labour’s shadow defence secretary, Clive Lewis, and Emily Thornberry, promoted from shadow defence to shadow foreign secretary following mass resignations from Labour’s frontbench, said the vote was “shameful” and “a political game”, when parliament could have been discussing the Nice attacks and the coup in Turkey. “There is nothing new in this debate – a vote in principle was agreed in 2007 – and nothing whatsoever will happen as a result,” they write. “It is being held simply to sow further divisions inside the Labour party. The Tories know that those with strongly-held principles on either side of this debate will vote with their consciences, and the media will turn that into a fresh Labour crisis.”
Labour MPs, say Lewis and Thornberry, “should treat this government and this vote with the contempt they deserve”. “There are clear principled and practical reasons why Labour MPs should refuse to vote with the government on Monday,” the pair say. “They propose an open-ended commitment to maintain Britain’s current nuclear capability ‘for as long as the global security situation demands’. Such a vague, indefinite commitment precludes any possibility of Britain ever stepping down the nuclear ladder and contributing to global multilateral disarmament.”
In the piece, they add: “We will be abstaining from this ludicrous exercise, and getting on with the real job instead.” Labour whips are expected to grant MPs a free vote because of the ongoing policy review.
But Smith, the former shadow pensions secretary who is, with the former shadow business secretary Angela Eagle, challenging Corbyn for the party leadership, said on Sunday he would back Trident renewal. Speaking on BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show, Smith said while he had once been a member of CND, he now argued for more general disarmament.
“I’m a multilateralist and I believe that the world has actually got more volatile and more insecure over the last few years,” he said. Smith said he had changed his mind 15 years earlier, and now believed the UK’s nuclear capability should be kept “until we can use it as a bargaining chip to get everybody to get rid of their nuclear weapons”.
Asked whether he would order a nuclear strike as prime minister, which Corbyn said he would not, Smith replied: “You’ve got to be prepared to say yes to that. It was a mistake of Jeremy to say that [he would not]. I understand, it’s a terrible thought for anybody. “I think the world has got more volatile – we’ve got to stick with what we’ve got and renew it, if that’s the advice of the security services. And it’s awful that we’ve got to do that, but I’m afraid it’s true.”"

A member of the public called the police at 9.20am on Sunday after discovering a man’s body. A statement on the Conference South club’s website said: “It is with the deepest sadness that the directors of the club have to announce the sudden passing of managing director Colin Taylor. Our thoughts and prayers are with Colin’s family and friends at this time.” Taylor, 62, had been a director at the club for 15 years, having been appointed in 2001, according to a company records website. A Thames Valley police spokeswoman said: “At this stage there appear to be no suspicious circumstances and a file is being prepared for the coroner. The next of kin has been informed and the family have asked for privacy at this difficult time.” Fans paid tribute to Taylor on social media. Wayne Holden tweeted:

2016-07-17T15:22:39Z,uk-news,UK news,Trident renewal: would Â£205bn be a price worth paying?,"The Trident nuclear weapons programme, which MPs are set to vote through on Monday, is so expensive that the Ministry of Defence has until now been coy about releasing an overall estimate of the cost. The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, estimates the cost of replacing the four nuclear submarines at £31bn, compared with previous government estimates over the past decade of £15bn and £20bn. The MoD, aware of the potential for overrun, has put aside an extra £10bn in a contingency fund. Fallon’s estimate is only for the replacement of the submarines and does not take into account other parts of the programme. There is no estimate of the cost over the estimated 30-year lifespan of Trident, and the MoD declines to offer one.
The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament puts the overall cost over the 30 years at £205bn. Reuters, in an analysis last year that was disputed by the MoD, put the cost at £167bn. It has become more of an issue at a time when budgets not only elsewhere in Whitehall but at the MoD itself are under strain. There are senior military staff, serving as well as retired, who would rather see the money directed towards conventional forces. And that is not just those from the army and air force. Inside the navy too, there is debate about spending so much of the budget on Trident and two aircraft carriers while the surface fleet has been drastically reduced.
In 2006 the Labour government committed in principle to renewing the Trident programme. Initial assessments have been completed and now MPs get to decide. A solid majority in the Commons are in favour. One of the main arguments of supporters of Trident is that the world is unstable, pointing to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the unpredictability of North Korea. The former chief of defence staff Lord Richards was among those questioning the value of the UK nuclear arsenal, but told the Guardian last year he had changed his mind because this was a “very troubled era”.
Nuclear-armed missiles could be fired from land or air but the long-held argument for submarines is that they are harder to detect. The Liberal Democrats, while part of the coalition government with the Conservatives, argued that the UK did not need four submarines and the number could be reduced to three. But those in favour of Trident said four were needed to ensure at least one was always at sea, and anyway one fewer sub would not make a substantial difference to the cost. Another argument, which explains the support of the unions and companies involved in building the submarines, is that 30,000 jobs are reliant on the programme going ahead.
Among the counter-arguments is that the decision does not have to be made this year or even in the next few years. The date by which the replacement submarines had originally been scheduled to be operational has slipped further and further back, and is now set at the early 2030s. Opponents of Trident argue that this could be pushed back, and the life of the existing fleet extended further. The Oxford Research Group, which includes a retired major general, Patrick Cordingley, argues in favour of delay, especially against a background of austerity. Cordingley is in the camp that argues that at a time of austerity, Trident should not be ringfenced and its value should be tested against new ships, planes, tanks and infantry.
A recent argument that is gaining ground is that the raison d’etre for submarines – that they cannot be detected – is being undermined by new technology and that underwater drones, surveillance of wave patterns and other advanced detection techniques are in danger of making them redundant. If the technology does not exist at present to find submarines, there is a strong chance it will by the time the subs become operational. On the potential loss of 30,000 jobs, those opposed to Trident counter that the money could be used for other building programmes such as more ships, and that there is a case for job diversification. This article was amended on 18 July 2016. An earlier version said Trident missiles could be fired from land or air. Such missiles are too big to be fired from the air; it should have said nuclear-armed missiles could be fired from land or air. This has been corrected."
2016-07-17T16:40:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Death of black teenager sparks protests in Liverpool,"Protests have been held in Liverpool following the death of a black teenager while he was detained by Merseyside police. Mzee Mohammed was detained following unconfirmed reports that he was acting in an “aggressive and erratic” manner and carrying a knife in the Liverpool One shopping centre. In video footage that has emerged since Mohammed’s death he is seen lying face down, barefoot, surrounded by paramedics and police officers wearing blue plastic gloves. He is lying motionless, apparently unconscious, and appears to have his hands cuffed behind his back, while he is being treated by paramedics.
The footage, which appears to have been taken on a mobile phone and lasts for more than five minutes, was released to the Liverpool Echo. Over the weekend Mohammed’s mother, Karla, paid tribute to her “baby boy” and disputed the police version of events during a Black Lives Matter protest in the city. The movement, currently sweeping America and the UK – with demonstrations throughout the country since the fatal shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling by police officers in the US – came to Merseyside on Saturday afternoon. To chants of “Justice for Mzee”, Karla and Mohammed’s sister Melissa led a walk from the city’s main train station to the shopping centre followed by about 300 people. On Wednesday evening police attended the busy shopping centre after a number of calls from the public. Merseyside police said the 18-year-old was behaving in a way that made officers “more concerned about his own wellbeing, rather than the damage he could do”. Police said the teenager was being detained by the shopping centre’s security staff when they arrived and that he suffered “a medical episode” at about 6.30pm, while in the custody of police at the scene. But during the protest Mohammed’s mother made continual criticisms of Merseyside police and their handling of her son. At the protest Mohammed’s mother told the crowds: “I want to ask the Lord to see justice for my son. “I will not rest, I will walk in my son’s shoes until I get answers, and anyone who had a hand in my boy’s death will be brought to justice.” She added: “My son will not be a number or a statistic. His death will not be in vain.” Chants of “Black Lives Matter, Mzee’s Life Mattered” were shouted out as the march snaked through the city centre. At the Bombed Out church in the city, Karla added: “I pray with my heart no mother or father go through what I am now. “I would not wish this on my worst enemy. You can’t take the memories, the pictures … my son was not an animal, he was a human being.” Investigators from the Independent Police Complaints Commission have spoken to the officers involved in the incident and have taken statements. On Friday, the police watchdog said a postmortem on the former Shorefields school pupil had taken place, but results were inconclusive. More tests, including toxicology checks, will now be carried out which should determine a cause of death. Mohammed is due to be buried in Jamaica."
2016-07-17T18:26:35Z,uk-news,UK news,"UK may impose cut-off date on EU migrants, says Brexit minister","The government could set a retrospective cut-off date for permitting overseas EU nationals to remain in the UK after the country leaves the union, the minister responsible for the negotiations, David Davis has warned. Appointed last week to the new role of secretary of state for exiting the European Union, Davis said it might not be possible to warn in advance when this date might fall, as the “sheer generosity” of rights granted to EU nationals could prompt a surge in new arrivals.
“One way of dealing with it could be saying: ‘OK, only people who arrived before a certain date get this protection,’” he told Sky News’s Murnaghan show on Sunday. “There are other ways too.” Davis, a long-time Eurosceptic who had been off the Conservative frontbench since 2008 – when he stepped down as shadow home secretary in a protest over civil liberties – said being too specific in advance could cause difficulties. “If you set a date, that’s when you start the rush,” he said. Theresa May was the only one of the Conservative leadership candidates to say she would not pre-emptively guarantee the rights even of foreign EU nationals already living in Britain before the referendum. It brought complaints from opponents, notably the shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham, that she was using EU nationals in the UK as “bargaining chips”. A Labour motion calling for rights to be guaranteed passed the Commons earlier this month, but is not binding.
Davis said on Sunday that any deals on people in the UK must be done at the same time as arrangements about the 1.2 million Britons living elsewhere in the EU, as it would stop “anybody being used as bargaining counters”. It was important not to make any early promises to people living in the UK, Davis said. “If we make a very generous settlement, as I’d like to do, then people are going to say: ‘Oh but then that’ll attract lots more people in because they want to beat the deadline.’
“And so what I’ve said is, let’s deal with that issue when we come to it. One way of dealing with it could be saying: ‘OK, only people who arrived before a certain date get this protection’ – there are other ways too. But we’ve got to do it within the law as it stands because at that point we’ll still be within the European Union. “Bear in mind this is only an issue if there is a surge in people arriving, and I don’t think that is by any means certain.” Davis dismissed the idea that speaking even hypothetically about a cut-off date for residency rights could spark a movement of people to the UK. “No it won’t be like that,” he said. “If you set a date, that’s when you start the rush.” There was no new Labour response to Davis’s comments, but the SNP described them as shameful and indicative of a “nasty party cabinet” under May. Davis accepted that a cabinet headed by May, who campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU, and including prominent Brexit supporters such as him, Boris Johnson and Liam Fox, meant there would be tensions over the exit strategy. Davis suggested the UK could trigger article 50, which would begin the formal two-year process of leaving the EU, “early next year”. May has indicated a longer process, saying she hopes to create more national consensus on a post-Brexit future first.
In another issue likely to dominate his new role, Davis said Scotland would not be able to unilaterally halt Brexit, and dismissed the proposal by Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, that her nation could remain in the EU even as the rest of the UK leaves. “I don’t think that works,” Davis said. “One of our really challenging issues to deal with will be the internal border we have with southern Ireland, and we are not going to go about creating other internal borders inside the United Kingdom.” He added: “The aim here is to try to address the concerns of people who are basically remain people, who say: ‘Well, we are worried about inward investment, we are worried about trade with Europe, we are worried about all sorts of things.’ “And we will try as best we can – they can’t have a veto because there are 17.5 million people who have given us a mandate, they have told us what to do, we can’t disobey it – but what we can do is to try to do what we can to minimise any disruption or turbulence or problems.”"

The crash happened at the Breighton aerodrome near Hull. The casualties were all male and had suffered various head, back, chest and leg injuries.
Humberside police were called to the scene at 6.07pm. A force spokesman said the injuries were serious but not life-threatening. Two people were taken by air ambulance to Hull Royal Infirmary and Leeds General hospital respectively, and three others were driven to hospital. The spokesman said: “Numerous emergency services were in attendance. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) will be leading the investigation to establish what caused the crash.” North Yorkshire Fire Service said all of the passengers were out of the helicopter by the time rescuers arrived. The Yorkshire Air Ambulance Service said both its helicopters were sent to the crash site. Breighton Aerodome is a former second world war heavy bomber base and cold-war nuclear missile launch site. It is now the home of the Real Aeroplane Company, a collection of classic planes, and the Real Aeroplane Club, whose members own and operate many unusual aircraft. The wreckage of the crashed helicopter, said to have come down on grass at the side of the runway, has been taken away."
2016-07-18T05:00:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Met police officers could face sack after black firefighter was Tasered,"Three Metropolitan police officers face disciplinary proceedings that could lead to them being sacked after an off-duty firefighter was allegedly abused and shot with a Taser because he was black. The officers face a disciplinary panel starting on Monday on charges of gross misconduct, which is further alleged to be racially motivated, the Guardian has learned. They deny the charges. Edric Kennedy-Macfoy, 32, said police had behaved like “wild animals”, dragging him from his car and subjecting him to a violent attack that culminated in him being shot with a Taser. Since the incident in September 2011, one of the accused officers has been promoted by the Met. Kennedy-Macfoy says he approached the officers in Harrow, north London, to help identify a young man who had thrown a rock at a police van after a late-night melee. He says officers suddenly turned on him, and he believes he was targeted because of his skin colour. The disciplinary charges against the three officers – PCs Mark Gatland and Daniel Roberts and Insp Sutinderjit Mahil, who at the time was a sergeant – followed an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The Met said it was alleged that Gatland “used unreasonable force and discharged a Taser without warning and that on both occasions his actions were motivated by racial discrimination and/or racial stereotyping and so treated the victim less favourably.” The force said it was also alleged that Roberts and Mahil each used “abusive and offensive language and that racial discrimination and/or racial stereotyping motivated this”. Kennedy-Macfoy told the Guardian he was dragged from a white Audi he had been driving, and the officers encircled him and shouted abuse. He said he replied calmly and showed his palms to the officers, telling them: “Listen guys, I haven’t done anything wrong. I’m a firefighter – I work with you lot and I just want to explain something. I’ve showed no aggression towards any of you.” He said of the disciplinary proceedings: “I can only hope and pray that the truth finally prevails and that justice is now done. After everything I’ve been through I find it very difficult to call on the police for assistance at a time of need. Racism in the police is something I’ve seen and suffered throughout my life. It’s a disease that can only be cured by police forces rooting it out from within.” The new prime minister, Theresa May, highlighted racial discrimination in the justice system as she took office last week, saying outside Downing Street: “If you’re black, you’re treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you’re white.” Kennedy-Macfoy was cleared of obstructing police after a two-day trial at Brent magistrates court. The disciplinary hearing against the officers will be held in private and is scheduled to last three weeks. Kennedy-Macfoy is expected to testify. The IPCC said: “The IPCC investigation into a complaint made by Edric Kennedy-Macfoy relating to his arrest by MPS officers is complete. We have shared our findings with the MPS professional standards department and Mr Kennedy-Macfoy’s solicitors. Three MPS officers are now facing gross misconduct hearings and as such it would be inappropriate to comment on the findings of the investigation.” The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to bring criminal charges against the officers. Kennedy-Macfoy’s lawyer, Shamik Dutta, said: “My client has done all he can to bring these matters to the attention of the authorities. He must now place his faith in the police misconduct tribunal.”"
2016-07-18T06:00:03Z,uk-news,UK news,"Scotland should look to ally with Nordic nations, not EU, says legal expert","Scotland could succeed as an independent country outside of the UK and the EU, a constitutional expert has said, advising it to ally with Nordic countries instead. With Spain threatening to veto any future independent Scotland from joining the EU, the woman who drew up Iceland’s post-crash constitution said the Scots should not fear being outside Brussels’ sphere of influence.
Katrin Oddsdóttir, elected to draft a new Icelandic social contract after the financial collapse, said her country’s recovery showed that smaller nations could survive outside big unions. Speaking at the weekend following a lecture during the Galway international arts festival in Ireland, Oddsdóttir said that if there was a referendum to join the EU in Iceland, she would vote no – describing the union as a “gang” and a “bullying association”. On an independent Scotland, she said: “I still think the people of Scotland could do quite well as independent nation outside of the EU. Firstly, because the EU is in a cul de sac in a way as it facilitates global capitalism which is destroying everything. Scotland could be very progressive and say we will follow the path of Iceland and Norway, which are countries that trade with the EU but are not part of the Brussels camp. I think an independent Scotland should look further north towards Reykjavik and Oslo rather than Brussels. “My feeling is that Scottish people are looking further in terms of their country becoming independent and there is no condition that that future has to be as part of the European Union.
“Of course there are plenty of people who want to remain in the UK and many pro-independence people who want to join the EU. However, I am not sure Scotland could be really independent by being in the EU. In my opinion the Scots have nothing to fear being outside the EU like we are in Iceland. We got over our banking crisis and our disastrous recession ourselves and by our own efforts. “There is a great beauty and a great strength in being a small nation that is truly independent. Which means making your own decisions more freely.” In 2011 Oddsdóttir was elected by a national vote to be one of 25 experts and ordinary citizens tasked with creating a new constitution, which the Icelandic parliament has to decide whether or not to endorse after the country’s general election this autumn. It was drafted with checks and balances to ensure Iceland does not repeat the mistakes hat led to it allowing its banking system to get out of control. It also states that any move to dilute national sovereignty, such as by joining the EU, must be put to a referendum.
Oddsdóttir said that while Brexit was a mistake, the UK could continue to prosper. She said being in the European Economic Area free trade zone but not inside the EU was “the best of both worlds from an Icelandic viewpoint”.Oddsdóttir said that post-Brexit Britain could also learn from Iceland’s recovery as a non-EU nation. “I think Britain can more than survive because like Norway, like Iceland, a lot of countries outside of the EU are doing fine,” she said. “A lot of officials in Iceland have been saying after the Brexit vote that we can cooperate with Britain more. “Now of course we are a small country on the outside but there are many like us and Britain could now have new allies. Iceland has done fine standing on its own outside the EU. That is a lesson for the Scots if they go independent and it is a lesson to the UK overall. If you allow your people to really participate in your democracy, in your law-making, this is the only way to be able to keep your sovereignty whilst trading freely from the outside with the EU.” The Icelandic constitutional expert was speaking as part of the arts festival’s “first thought talks” series. On Friday night, Elvis Costello, playing a gig in the city for the festival, opened his set on the stage by telling his audience: “It’s great to be back in Ireland, it’s great to be back in Europe.”"
2016-07-18T07:21:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Emily Thornberry criticises Trident cost in post-EU vote financial climate,"Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has said it was reckless in the post-Brexit vote financial climate for the government to choose the most expensive route to renewing Britain’s nuclear deterrent. “Money is important, particularly at a time of financial stress,” Thornberry, who will abstain on the vote, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday. “I think it is reckless for us to plough on ahead with the most expensive of all the various options and there are step-downs we can take.” Labour MPs will split three ways at the vote on Monday afternoon, with the leader, Jeremy Corbyn, voting against Trident renewal. A range of frontbenchers and MPs may either abstain or vote in favour. Thornberry said she would be abstaining on the vote because it was the government “playing games with the Labour party and trying to embarrass us” when it looked likely Trident would be renewed in any event.
Labour party policy is in favour of renewal, though Thornberry had been undertaking a review of the party’s defence policy that had been scheduled to be delivered a fortnight ago. “We were going to deliver the week after Brexit, but Brexit happened and that has an effect on all of the factors,” she said. “The Labour party has to come to a collective decision by collecting evidence in a proper way.” The government says that replacing the Vanguard class of submarine, which carries the Trident missiles, with four new Successor class boats is likely to cost £31bn over 20 years, with a £10bn contingency. However, Thornberry said there had been no information about infrastructure and maintenance, or the warhead costs. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament puts the overall cost over the 30 years at £205bn, including in-service costs. “Any other decision that the government would make, the single biggest investment the government is going to make, you would expect them to go into some detail on cost,” she said. Labour MPs have been given a free vote on the issue. Clive Lewis, Labour’s shadow defence secretary, will also abstain. Many other Labour MPs, including Corbyn’s two challengers, Owen Smith and Angela Eagle, and the deputy leader, Tom Watson, say they will vote for renewal. Corbyn told the Guardian he was committed to voting against the deterrent and hoped to reverse Labour’s official stance on renewal over time. “I will be voting against continuous at-sea deterrent, because it rules out any compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty,” he said. “I’ve been involved in peace transformation all of my life, and I think we’ve got an opportunity to show leadership in the world. I recognise people are going to take some time to get into that position [unilateralism], but I ask them to look at the world as it is.” Thornberry said she accepted Corbyn would always vote for unilateral disarmament but criticised the government for not talking seriously about multilateralism, which she said had ground to a halt internationally. Watson said the three-way split in Labour was “partisan political game-playing” and called abstaining an “abdication of responsibility”.
Conservative MPs will be whipped to vote for the renewal, which was a 2015 manifesto pledge. Theresa May is expected to tell MPs as she opens the debate, which is expected to last almost seven hours, that no one can say for certain that Britain will not face a situation where the UK would need to use nuclear weapons. Giving up the nuclear deterrent would be a “reckless gamble, that would enfeeble our allies and embolden our enemies”, she will say. “The nuclear threat has not gone away, if anything, it has increased. It is impossible to say for certain that no extreme threats will emerge in the next 30 or 40 years to threaten our security and way of life.” The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, refused to specify whether there would be a situation in which Britain could use its nuclear warhead to combat a terror threat. “We use our nuclear weapons every day, it’s a continuous patrol,” he said. “That deterrent is out there. We need to make sure our adversaries, other nuclear states, rogue states or terrorists groups, we need to make sure that they are always unsure as to how we might respond and whether we might retaliate.” Fallon admitted the government had already spent public funds on designing the new submarines and some “long-lead” materials but said the majority of contracts for the supply chain would not be signed until MPs gave their backing. “The vote here is on the principle of having the four-boat replacement and that’s what we’ll be deciding tonight,” he said."

But for this week at least, Britons should be able to bask in warm sunshine, enjoy evening barbecues or saunter to the beach for a dip after work. Record highs of 27.6C (81.7F) were recorded in several parts of England on Sunday, edging ahead of the previous best of 27.4C set on 6 June. Temperatures for this week could hit the low 30s, with an outside chance of hitting 35C, according to the Met Office. “The warmest July day ever was 36.7C at Heathrow on 1 July [in 2015],” said Alex Burkill, a meteorologist at the Met Office. “Perhaps we’ll see a maximum of 35C this week, but that is unlikely. June was quite wet, but we did not see record-breaking rainfall, although some counties saw twice the average monthly rainfall, but it was not even in the top 10 wettest months.” It was wet enough though, that Wimbledon was forced to schedule play on the first middle Sunday in 12 years. For this week though, the belatedly fine summer weather – just in time for the start of the school holidays – is expected to continue through to the weekend. “There will be a decent amount of sunshine, although from Wednesday it won’t be as hot and there will some showers to look out for,” said Burkill. “There should be a bit of rain at the weekend but also sunshine, with temperatures above average in the low to mid-20s.” There should be some isolated thunderstorms this week, but temperatures are expected to largely remain above average for the time of year. Cloudier skies in Northern Ireland and Scotland bring the risk of heavy, thundery downpours on Tuesday and thundery downpours are forecast for some places on Wednesday, but it is expected to be warm and sunny elsewhere. The outlook for August is more of the same, with a few days of drier, more settled weather and the chance of continental air bringing the risk of humidity and thunderstorms. August can be one of the wettest months for some areas, particularly in East Anglia. In the bigger picture, 2016 is expected to break global records for the hottest calendar year, following record-breaking temperatures in 2014 and 2015. If so, it will be the first time since surface temperatures were measured more than 150 years ago that there have been three consecutive record-breaking hot years."
2016-07-18T10:34:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Boris Johnson may be the New Routemaster of British foreign policy,"The rise of Boris Johnson to become foreign secretary and the fall of the New Routemaster, the bespoke London bus he introduced to the capital’s streets, have some illuminating common themes. Both are tales of novelty and nostalgia, of risk and symbolism and of style over substance. Both demonstrate the staying power of a particular idea of Britain and Britishness that Johnson vividly personifies. Last week, Transport for London (TfL) announced that the last of the so-called conductors who work on six of the routes the New Routemaster serves, will be gone by September. They say this will save around £10m a year, contributing to the efficiency drive required by Johnson’s successor Sadiq Khan. It will also complete the erasing of a signature mark of the “Boris Bus”, the most emblematic policy he pursued in his eight years at City Hall. When Johnson first ran for mayor in 2008, his promise to commission a special bus that revived defining features of the original Routemaster was a conspicuous weapon in his battle to defeat the incumbent Ken Livingstone. “Red Ken” had done away with Routemasters and brought in articulated “bendy” buses. These were good at moving people around and popular with many passengers, but they offended traditionalists. Johnson depicted them as an alien contagion. His new bus, he claimed, would restore the glories of the old and combine it with the best of the new. And so it came to pass that the New Routemaster revived the original’s open rear platform, enabling passengers to once more board or disembark between stops. Johnson saw this feature as a political metaphor – a rebuke to health and safety nannying and a return to the freedoms of personal responsibility. The new style conductors would provide passenger assistance, even though in the age of one-person operation and the Oyster card their former primary function – collecting fares – had disappeared. At the same time, the New Routemaster would break new ground as the cleanest, greenest bus there was. This very Tory combination of throwback and innovation was captured in the New Routemaster’s Thomas Heatherwick design, a bold blend of pastiche and modernity. But that is the sole part of the “Boris Bus” manifesto still being honoured. Cleaner buses are becoming available off the peg. The open platform is being designed out. The faux conductors, already scarce, are to become extinct. Only the look of the New Routemaster survives from the 2008 prospectus. That will be around for quite a while. Before leaving City Hall, Johnson got Transport for London (TfL) to order a further 195 New Routemasters, which means 1000 of them will eventually operate on the capital’s streets. Under Johnson’s successor Sadiq Khan, TfL won’t be ordering any more, but neither will there be a cull of those already operating or in the pipeline. It could be ten years before the first New Routemasters are retired. They will proliferate in parallel with Johnson’s progress as the UK’s most public senior diplomat, a role for which many - not least in the foreign office, it seems - regard him as alarmingly unfit. Yet Johnson’s long, defiant history of giving offence to other countries is matched by his gusto as a conspicuous, gladhanding international salesman, touting the virtues of London overseas. The “Boris” persona, an unapologetic, comic throwback to an idealised Britishness of free-spirited independence and cheerful muddling through, can be deeply seductive, as his part in the Brexit campaign showed. If may be shallow, it may be maddening, it may be a triumph of illusion over achievement. It may be like the New Routemaster in many ways. But as a human vehicle of UK foreign policy, maybe that is all Theresa May wants it to be. Dave Hill is the author of Zac versus Sadiq: the fight to be London Mayor and is now writing a book about Boris Johnson’s time at City Hall. His previous coverage of the New Routemaster is archived here."

Harry Studley’s condition emerged as a couple appeared at Bristol crown court charged with grievous bodily harm. Jordan Walters, 24, has admitted unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on Harry. His partner, Emma Jane Horseman, 23, has not entered a plea to a charge that she aided or abetted him to commit the offence. The couple, of Hartcliffe, Bristol, appeared before judge Neil Ford QC, the recorder of Bristol, who pencilled in a trial date of 30 January for Horseman. The trial is expected to last three days. Walters, who appeared by video link, will be sentenced following the trial.
The judge adjourned the case, telling the defendants: “Mr Walters, you will remain in custody. Miss Horseman your bail will be extended on existing conditions.” A spokesman for Avon and Somerset police said Harry was in a “serious but stable” condition in hospital. Emergency services were called to a Bristol flat, where the boy and his mother were visiting, at 4.10pm on 1 July. Horseman will next appear at Bristol crown court on 30 September."
2016-07-18T15:23:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Woman jailed for 20 months after failing to prevent murder of son,"A woman whose boyfriend murdered her 17-month-old son by beating him with a garden chair has been jailed for failing to protect the boy. Chloe Thomas, 25, from Tonypandy, south Wales, was jailed for 20 months after admitting child cruelty towards Finley, who died after suffering a fractured skull and ribs. A postmortem also found Finley had cocaine and cannabis in his system at the time of his death, Cardiff crown court heard. Thomas’s partner, Sean Buckley, 28, has been jailed for life and told he would serve at least 17 years in prison. Sentencing Thomas, Mrs Justice Frances Patterson told her: “You had a duty to protect your son and have failed to do so. You were the closest to him but stood by and did nothing until it was too late. It was in his own home that Finley should have been safe. You still refuse to recognise the gravity of what Buckley did to your son. You failed to comprehend the importance of seeking medical assistance for your son and I note you said you would do nothing differently. You have been inadequate in your role as a mother. You are dangerous.” The court heard Thomas was “obsessed and infatuated” with Buckley despite him beating Finley. Roger Thomas, prosecuting, said Finley was a “vulnerable victim”, and his mother purposely ignored his suffering. After the final attack, paramedics were called and the couple told “wicked and deliberate” lies to hide the physical abuse the baby had suffered, claiming he had fallen down the stairs, the court was told. Thomas said: “The catastrophic injuries which resulted in his death were not from a simple fall but rather from a deliberate and abusive act by Buckley that had a devastating effect. Evidence shows Finley was subject to repeated assaults before he died.” The prosecutor said Thomas had abused her position of trust and had failed to seek medical help. “She was aware Finley was unwell and sought to close her eyes to what was taking place,” he said. The court heard a pre-sentence report describe Thomas as “posing a high risk to any child in her care”. Sally Howse, defending, questioned Thomas’s “intellectual capacity” to cover up her toddler’s abuse, but admitted the little boy had not been properly cared for. She said: “It’s clear that funds which should have been spent on that little boy were not spent on him but on drugs.” Howse added: “She has delayed grief reaction. Her attitude to Sean Buckley is still uncertain.” Thomas has insisted she did not give the child drugs directly but accepted he had been exposed to illegal substances. Howse said Thomas had been a “proud mother” before she began the relationship with Buckley. Des Mannion, head of NSPCC Wales, said he hoped a detailed case review would provide “much-needed answers” to the tragedy and prevent other children suffering in the future. He said: “Chloe Thomas failed to protect her own son from the horrific abuse he suffered at the hands of Sean Buckley – abuse which ultimately led to Finley’s brutal murder. Cases where a young child is murdered in these horrific circumstances are mercifully rare in Wales but we know that abuse and neglect take place every day in too many homes across the country, each damaging a child’s future. We all have a duty to look out for their welfare.”"
2016-07-18T15:44:19Z,uk-news,UK news,'No use as a military tool': Guardian readers for and against Trident,"As parliament debates on Trident on Monday, we asked our readers for their own views on the renewal of Britain’s nuclear deterrent. The debate, the first to be opened by new British PM Theresa May, highlights divisions within the Labour party, with the party set to be split three ways by the vote – those in favour, those against, and those who will abstain. Below is a selection of our readers’ views. Against renewal
‘Let’s leave the nuclear weapons to others, and build a new identity’
The whole problem with the renewal of Trident is that it seems linked to the historical standing of the UK on the world stage, rather than the necessity of having an independent nuclear deterrent. It’s a long time since we had the biggest navy in the world, patrolling the waters of our empire. And yet, we seem intent on staying in the nuclear weapon club, despite actively persuading others to not join. If we were brave, we’d leave the nuclear weapons to others, and build a new reputation, a new identity. Conventional armed forces, geared to providing peacekeeping and humanitarian outcomes across the world. Carriers that are able to facilitate large scale air-drops of food and aid. Troops to set up and defend safe areas. That could be our legacy, not that of the kid in the playground with the biggest stick. Graeme Anderson, 42, Kidderminster ‘Its sole purpose is to preserve our place at the top table of the UN’ It has no use as a military tool. I cannot envisage a circumstance in which any politician would order its use. Its sole purpose is to preserve our place at the top table of the UN. At a time of tight military budgets, far better to spend the money on intelligence gathering and planes for the two aircraft carriers. Indeed better defensive protection would come from an increased fleet of hunter-killer boats. These to be built, of course, in Barrow. This should be Labour’s position. David Jones, 69, Sheffield ‘I am opposed to nuclear weapons as a matter of principle’
I find myself a little reluctant to be against Trident, purely because living close to it I understand the role of the military in the economy. Before moving to Glasgow I lived in Lossiemouth where the RAF base there and at nearby Kinloss were both under threat of decommission. The economic impact simply by threat was real and long lasting. However, I am opposed to nuclear weapons as a matter of principle. They are a weapon no one with a conscience could fire. While I have misgivings about Jeremy Corbyn, I appreciated his honesty when he said he would never use the weapons if he were PM. Alongside the ethical considerations, I also believe in times of austerity we should not be spending billions on a weapon system that no one would realistically use. Emily Alldritt, 24, Glasgow ‘The debate has been horribly distorted’ In the modern world, the main threats to national security come not from states, but from terrorist groups. The “deterrent” value of nuclear weaponry against such widely dispersed and flexible groups is questionable, to say the least. How can we target nuclear missiles against our enemies if we can’t even be sure who they are? There has been a recent ramping up of anti-Russian rhetoric in the media, but it is increasingly clear that the geopolitics of the Great Game are irrelevant in the modern age. We need not worry about a nuclear exchange with Putin’s Russia, a country that is facing exactly the same threats that we are from international terrorism. The debate has been horribly distorted due to years of pro-nuclear discourse among politicians and in the media - for some reason, it is “radical” to want to disarm, whereas the “moderate” position is to retain weapons capable of killing hundreds of thousands of civilians in seconds. Andy Shaw, 27, Sheffield In favour of renewal
‘The security it provides is worth the cost’ I have mixed feelings on the subject of Trident renewal. I wish to see the number of nuclear warheads decrease and I hope the UK as well as other nuclear armed states will reduce their stockpiles. But I do believe that Trident should be renewed in some form, whether it continue to as a submarine based launch platform or become an aircraft delivery system. The cost of Trident and its renewal will be extremely high, but the security it provides not only to the UK but to our allies, especially within Europe, is worth the cost. Once again the UK would be shrinking its responsibilities in Europe and the world and would further the reliance of Europe on the US. We should be a leading voice in global security and the unfortunate reality seems that having an active nuclear arsenal is necessary to be part of it. Whilst I believe the UK should continue to maintain a nuclear deterrent, it should be reduced in partnership with other states, particularly other permanent members of the UN Security Council. Thomas Morgan, 23, Wiltshire ‘We cannot broker peace in the world with only carrots’ Trident is a statement about Britain’s place in the world, about our influence and about our willingness to face down the many regimes that only understand power symbols. Brexit has already diminished the UK’s influence in economic matters and decommissioning Trident would ensure our influence is removed from global military matters. We cannot broker peace in the world with only carrots - we need symbolic sticks too, not because we think such things should play a part in any kind of negotiations, but because others always will, no matter what principled position the UK were to take. The idea that the world would disarm because the UK does is just as deluded a narrative as the idea that Brexit will revive the UK’s manufacturing industry. No one on the left would disagree with Corbyn’s sentiment on the issue, but it is yet another example of his single-mindedness and willingness to selectively ignore any factors that do not serve his ideal position - a dangerous quality in any leader and a perfect example of how he does not even attempt to persuade or influence anyone who is not already in his bubble. Anonymous, 36, London ‘In this era of Trump, we need a trump card’ There is growing instability in the World. Since the end of the Cold War we have enjoyed a period of growth, stability, and relative security based on principled liberalism. The lasting global recession, Chinese and Russian expansionism, international terrorism, and malaise in strong political leadership has led to events such as Brexit and an increasingly aggressive and protectionist attitude, exemplified by politician such as Donald Trump. It is difficult to foresee what the politics of the next 50 years will look like, but the tangible risk is that instead of a more peaceful and harmonious world we will see increased division and cynicism. In such a world we need a trump card, which only the threat of nuclear weapons can fulfil. Rory Kokelaar, 32, Cardiff ‘Nuclear deterrence may not be quite as outdated as we would like to believe’ I want to see global multilateral disarmament, but I don’t see how unilaterally disarming could help in this regard. Instead it would deprive us of a vital bargaining chip in potential future negotiations. I also think that at a time of global unrest, it would be nonsensical for us to get rid of our nuclear weapons. We are already having to deal with the fallout of the EU referendum, and a potential Scottish Independence referendum, both of which will diminish us on the global stage. I think if we unilaterally disarm, we risk losing our seat on the UN permanent security council, and then we’ll lose our secular liberal voice on the international stage. This is not even taking into account the strange and scary way that some nation states are behaving on the global stage. I think this goes to show that nuclear deterrence may not be quite as outdated for us as we would like to believe. Then of course, there is the likely job losses that would result from a decision to scrap a trident successor: high tech, high skill jobs that are important to our country’s future. Obviously the money used to invest in a Trident successor could be used in other productive ways (and other potentially high tech/skill jobs), but the Labour plan to simply build the submarines and not fit then with nuclear missiles shows me that they don’t have the backbone, or the will, to come up with a reasonable and economically sensible alternative. All in all, I think this comes down to a pragmatic decision. Would I like our country to rid itself of nuclear weapons? Yes. Would this be helpful, productive, or wise given our current position and future objectives? In my opinion, the answer to the latter is an emphatic no. Sean, 22, Uttlesford"
2016-07-18T15:49:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Trident: airborne deterrent among options being considered by Labour,"Labour is considering at least five options for the future of Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent, including fewer submarine patrols or the introduction of new missiles carried by aircraft, the Guardian has learned. As MPs prepare to vote on replacing Trident on Monday evening, it is understood that Labour’s defence review has identified a series of alternatives that range from complete nuclear disarmament by the 2030s to replacing all four submarines on a like-for-like basis. The review, headed by the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, is ongoing as the party struggles to come up with a policy on the nuclear deterrent that satisfies Jeremy Corbyn, its deputy leader, Tom Watson, and its union backers. The Labour leader opposes renewal, while Watson and about half of the parliamentary party are in favour of replacing Trident, as do the overwhelming majority of the Conservative party. Labour’s split over Trident has grown following the election of Corbyn, a life-long opponent of nuclear weapons. He is at odds with many of his MPs over the future of the UK nuclear weapons system, which the government has estimated will cost £31bn to renew, and commissioned the review to look at its future. But the review, which is currently on hold, is believed to say that the case for replacing Trident is not wholly convincing and the case has not been made. It questions whether a “continuous at-sea deterrent” is the only form of viable form of nuclear deterrence, sources said. Sources said the review will consider at least four options for downgrading the UK’s nuclear capabilities. These include a reduced number of patrols, which could mean nuclear warheads being brought down to fewer than 100, down from the current 225. Under this option, only two or three submarines would be on patrol and there would be periods of months at a time that none was deployed at sea. Another option would be for submarines to be adapted so they can be used to carry both conventional weapons and nuclear warheads. This could involve carrying cruise missiles. Yet another under consideration has been to commission a nuclear deterrent that could be carried by aircraft, sources confirmed. The party has also not ruled out extending the life of the Trident submarines beyond 2030 or dismantling them without replacement. It has previously emerged in a leak to the BBC’s Newsnight that any future weapons system must satisfy five tests: it must offer a credible contribution to the UK’s defence; a credible contribution in the future as technology develops; demonstrate value for money; it should contribute towards the party’s support for multilateral disarmament; and contribute to British jobs and skills. The review states that it is extremely unlikely that the government would wreak the devastation of a nuclear war unless there is an “existential threat” to the UK, sources said. Asked to respond to the Guardian’s disclosures, a Labour spokesperson said Trident replacement is one of a wide range of options being examined. “The review is still examining a very wide range of options for our potential future nuclear capability and for taking concrete steps towards global multilateral disarmament, but has not yet reached any conclusions.” Defence experts said they were sceptical that such options would be viable, saying that similar options were considered and rejected in 2013 by a government review requested by the Liberal Democrats. The Trident Alternatives Review found that alternatives would enable the UK to be capable of inflicting significant damage on potential enemies. However, it concluded none of these alternative systems and postures offered the “same degree of resilience” as the current posture of continuous at-sea deterrence, nor could they guarantee a prompt response in all circumstances. Labour MPs will split three ways at the vote on Monday with Corbyn, voting against Trident renewal. A range of frontbenchers and MPs may either abstain or vote in favour. Tensions over the vote broke into the open on Monday as Watson suggested Unite union members whose jobs depend on a successor to the Trident programme could withdraw support for their leader Len McCluskey over his backing for Corbyn. He told the BBC’s World at One: “There you have Len McCluskey strongly supporting Jeremy Corbyn, who will be voting against the Trident programme tonight, which will put many defence workers in Unite out of their jobs if he gets his way. “So I think there will be consequences for the unions in this as well. There are executive elections coming up in Unite later in the year. If I was a defence worker in Unite and I was reading social media that Unite were about to give Jeremy Corbyn a quarter of a million pounds of my subscriptions, I would be furious today. “And I’m sure that that will lend to the division in the whole of the movement as we go forward.” Unite responded to the parliamentary vote by saying the government was playing politics and insisting it was about replacing the submarines that carry nuclear weapons, rather than the Trident deterrent itself. Ian Waddell, Unite national officer for aerospace and shipbuilding, said: “Time and again we have made it clear that this union will, without reservation or hesitation, defend every last job of our members in the defence industry. “To be abundantly clear, today’s vote is not about Trident – it’s about replacing our ageing Vanguard submarines with new successor submarines and tens of thousands of jobs rely on the submarine programme. “Our clear message to politicians is that this union will never support any public policy which sees our members and their communities thrown on the scrapheap. This position was reaffirmed by members from right across the economy and the country at our policy conference last week.” Thornberry said she would be abstaining on the vote because it was the government “playing games with the Labour party and trying to embarrass us” when it looked likely Trident would be renewed in any event. Thornberry’s review of the party’s defence policy had been scheduled to be delivered a fortnight ago but was suspended in the wake of the Brexit vote on 23 June. “We were going to deliver the week after Brexit, but Brexit happened and that has an effect on all of the factors,” she said on Monday. “The Labour party has to come to a collective decision by collecting evidence in a proper way.” The government says that replacing the Vanguard class of submarine, which carries the Trident missiles, with four new Successor class boats is likely to cost £31bn over 20 years, with a £10bn contingency. However, Thornberry said there had been no information about infrastructure and maintenance, or the warhead costs. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament puts the overall cost over the 30 years at £205bn, including in-service costs."
2016-07-18T17:14:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May would authorise nuclear strike causing mass loss of life,"Theresa May has said she would be willing to authorise a nuclear strike that could kill 100,000 people, as the House of Commons voted overwhelming to replace Britain’s Trident programme. The prime minister confirmed she would be prepared to press the nuclear button if necessary as she opened a debate about whether the UK should spend up to £40bn replacing four submarines that carry nuclear warheads. After more than five hours of discussion, parliament voted in favour of Trident renewal by a majority of 355 in a motion was backed by almost the entire Conservative party and more than half of Labour MPs. It was opposed by all Scottish National party MPs, the Lib Dems and Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong unilateralist who spoke out strongly against the plans during the deabte. Other members of Corbyn’s frontbench team, including the shadow defence secretary, Clive Lewis, and the shadow foreign affairs secretary, Emily Thornberry, abstained after claiming in a Guardian article that the government was turning an issue of “national security into a political game”. However, around 140 of his MPs - including leadership challengers Angela Eagle and Owen Smith voted in favour of renewing Trident, with many highlighting Labour’s historic position in support of a continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent. Forty-seven Labour MPs joined Corbyn in voting against Trident, while another 41 were absent or abstained. While Labour were split on the issue, the Conservatives have been hoping the Trident issue could help unify their party after a fractious EU referendum campaign. However, May attracted gasps during the debate when she made clear she would be willing to authorise a nuclear strike killing 100,000 people, when challenged by the Scottish National party about whether she would ever approve a nuclear hit causing mass loss of life.
Intervening in her opening speech, the SNP MP George Kerevan, asked: “Is she personally prepared to authorise a nuclear strike that can kill a hundred thousand innocent men, women and children?” May responded: “Yes. And I have to say to the honourable gentleman the whole point of a deterrent is that our enemies need to know that we would be prepared to use it, unlike some suggestions that we could have a deterrent but not actually be willing to use it, which seem to come from the Labour party frontbench.” Corbyn, the Labour leader, responded to May by making the case for nuclear disarmament, pointing out that the party’s pro-Trident position was under review. He gave his MPs a free vote during Labour’s ongoing defence review, which the Guardian understands involves at least five options ranging from complete replacement to disarmament by the 2030s. The three other options are reduced patrols and fewer submarines, missiles carried by aircraft, and adapted submarines to carry both conventional and nuclear warheads. Speaking in the Commons, Corbyn said there were currently 40 warheads, which are each eight times as powerful at the atomic bomb that killed 140,000 people at Hiroshima in Japan in 1945. “What is the threat we are facing that one million people’s deaths would actually deter?” he said, adding it did not stop Islamic State, Saddam Hussein’s atrocities, war crimes in the Balkans or genocide in Rwanda.
“I make it clear today I would not take a decision that kills millions of innocent people,” Corbyn told MPs. “I do not believe the threat of mass murder is a legitimate way to deal with international relations.” In contrast, May said it would be a “dereliction of duty” to give up Britain’s nuclear deterrent and pledged to keep to the Nato target of spending 2% of national income on defence while she is prime minister. Addressing the idea of downgrading the deterrent to a cheaper option, she said: “I am not prepared to settle for something that does not do the job.” May also took a swipe at anti-Trident MPs on the Labour frontbench and the Green MP Caroline Lucas, claiming they were therefore among “the first to defend the country’s enemies”. The cost of Trident renewal has been estimated at more than £40bn. “No credible deterrent is cheap,” said May. While the vast majority of Conservatives are in favour of renewing Trident, the Labour party is split three ways between those voting in favour, against and abstaining, while the SNP is firmly against.
Corbyn said the UK should follow other countries such as South Africa, Libya, Ukraine, Argentina, Brazil and Kazakhstan, which have shown they are serious about disarmament by giving up their nuclear programmes. “It is now time to step up to the plate and move rapidly towards disarmament,” he said. He was challenged by several Labour MPs as well as Conservatives. Jamie Reed, Copeland MP, claimed Corbyn was arguing against party policy. “For the first time I think ever we’ve witnessed the leader of theLabour party stand up at the despatch box of this House and argue against the policy of the party he leads. “This is unprecedented, moreover this reckless, juvenile, narcissistic irresponsibility makes me fearful for the future of the party that I love.” Another Labour MP, John Woodcock, said it was an “indictment of how far this once great party has fallen” that it was having a free vote on the issue. He said it showed contempt for the public and Labour members, and said such a lack of direction would have been “abhorrent” to the former leader Michael Foot, who was a unilateralist.
On the other side, a number of Labour MPs, the SNP and one Tory MP, Crispin Blunt, all spoke out against Trident. Brendan O’Hara, the SNP spokesman on defence in Westminster, said it was an “intolerable position” that nuclear warheads are kept in Faslane by a government the Scottish people did not elect. Another SNP member, Chris Law, read out a harrowing account of a Hiroshima survivor talking about witnessing her schoolmates die. “Some fell to the ground and their stomachs already expanded full, burst and organs fell out,” he said. “Others had skin falling off them and others still were carrying limbs. And one in particular was carrying their eyeballs in their hand.” Blunt, the chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said it was a “colossal investment in a weapons system that will become increasingly vulnerable”.
“This weapons system comes at the cost of the rest of our defence budget,” said Blunt, while criticising his own party for making it into a “political weapon” aimed at Labour. Corbyn’s anti-Trident position chimes with the views of Labour members surveyed on the issue but has caused tensions within the parliamentary party and with the trade unions. Tim Roache, head of the GMB trade union, called on Corbyn to abide by Labour party policy endorsing Trident renewal, and said 45,000 jobs around the country were dependent on the programme going ahead.
Roache, who supported Corbyn as leader, told BBC Radio 4’s The World at One: “The Labour party have a clear policy. The clear policy is that Labour will uphold an at-sea deterrent. “I would expect therefore all Labour MPs, including the leader of the Labour party – in fact, especially the leader of the Labour party – to uphold that current policy.” He said he would be balloting the GMB’s 640,000 members on whether they believed Corbyn was still the right person to lead the party. On the same programme, Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, warned of “consequences” for trade union bosses who continue to back Corbyn. “You have Len McCluskey [of Unite] strongly supporting Jeremy Corbyn, who will be voting against the Trident programme tonight, which will put many defence workers in Unite out of their jobs if he gets his way,” said Watson. “If I was a defence worker in Unite and I was reading social media that Unite were about to give Jeremy Corbyn a quarter of a million pounds of my subscriptions, I would be furious.”"
2016-07-18T17:19:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Full UK security review for large outdoor events under way after Nice attack,"A full review of the security measures in place for large outdoor events such as festivals and other public gatherings is under way in the aftermath of the deaths of 84 people in the Bastille Day attack in Nice, the home secretary has said. Amber Rudd told the House of Commons that extra security measures will be put in place, including the use of what is known as the “national barrier asset” when police assess there to be a risk of vehicle attacks.
Rudd said: “On Friday, following the attack in Nice, the police and the security and intelligence agencies took steps to review our own security measures and ensure that we have robust procedures in place, and I am receiving regular updates. All police forces have reviewed upcoming events taking place in their regions to ensure that security measures are appropriate and proportionate. “I can also tell the house that the UK has considerable experience in managing and policing major events. Extra security measures are used at particularly high profile events, including – where the police assess there to be a risk of vehicle attacks – the deployment of measures known as the national barrier asset. “This is made up of a range of temporary equipment – including security fences and gates – that enable the physical protection of sites.” The temporary security barrier system has been used since 2004 to protect high profile locations or events, such as party political conferences, from potential attacks involving the use of vehicles.
Large, modular, quick-assemble 9ft-high fencing has been used to protect the London Olympics, Nato summits and most recently the French end of the Channel tunnel to prevent incursions. In the Commons, Rudd’s condemnation of the attack received cross-party support including from the shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham, who said: “Unlike other attacks, this one wasn’t planned by a cell with sophisticated tactics and weapons. A similar attack could be launched anywhere at any time, and that is what makes it so frightening, and so difficult to predict and prevent.” He urged Rudd to protect police budgets in real terms and called for a review of the Prevent programme, designed to curb the spread of extremism but which he said was creating a climate of mistrust."
2016-07-18T18:35:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Mzee Mohammed death: Liverpool mayor promises transparent inquiry,"The mayor of Liverpool has sought to reassure the public that an investigation into the death of a black teenager who had been detained by police will be fully transparent, following a weekend of protests in Liverpool and London. Mzee Mohammed, 18, died on Wednesday evening after being detained by Merseyside police at the Liverpool One shopping centre. Officers were called to the scene following unconfirmed reports that Mohammed had a knife and was behaving in an “aggressive and erratic manner”. Police said they called an ambulance once it became clear that Mohammed was suffering “a medical episode”, and he was pronounced dead about an hour and a half later at Royal Liverpool University hospital. The mayor, Joe Anderson, acknowledged that the death had caused tension between the black community and the authorities in the city, and said: “The bottom line for me is that I will ensure – and [the police and crime commissioner] Jane Kennedy and the chief constable will also ensure – that there will be transparency around the [Independent Police Complaints Commission] investigation. “There will be nothing that is left out. The family will get to know first, rightly, what is there and there will be no attempt by anybody, as far as I’m concerned, to cover up.” Merseyside police said they received a call at around 6pm on Wednesday reporting that a young man had run into a house in the Toxteth area of Liverpool in a distressed state and left the address when he was seen by the occupier. Police then received further calls from the public describing a man with a knife at a number of locations throughout the city centre. Members of the public told the Liverpool Echo that they saw Mohammed at the shopping centre, barefoot and with a 12-inch knife, where he reportedly threatened a group of teenage girls before stumbling over. The shopping centre’s security staff detained Mohammed before the police arrived about 6.30pm. Merseyside police said the teenager was behaving in a way that made officers “more concerned about his own wellbeing rather than the damage he could do”. A police spokesperson said an ambulance was called shortly after their arrival and Mohammed was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead by doctors at 7.53pm. Mohammed was last seen by his family at 1.30pm, and his mother called emergency services to report him missing at around 10pm. The family were informed of the teenager’s death at around 1.30am. In video footage that has emerged since Mohammed’s death, he is seen lying face down, barefoot, surrounded by paramedics and a large number of police officers. He appears unconscious and has his hands cuffed behind his back.
Investigators from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) have taken statements from all the officers involved in the incident and they met Mohammed’s family on Friday to talk about their investigation. Mohammed’s family said that although the 18-year-old had been in trouble with the police before, he had sought to turn his life around, going back to college to get GCSEs in maths and English and aspiring to work as a chef. His mother, Karla, said her son was fit and healthy, did not take drugs and had no pre-existing medical conditions. Speaking at a Black Lives Matter protest in Liverpool on Saturday that was attended by 300 people, Mohammed’s mother said: “Anyone who had a hand in my boy’s death will be brought to justice. My son will not be a number or a statistic. His death will not be in vain.” Marcia Rigg, whose brother Sean died following a cardiac arrest while in police custody on 21 August 2008, attended a protest in London on Sunday in honour of Mohammed, and said seeing the video of him surrounded by police officers and paramedics brought back memories of her brother’s death. She said that eight years on, lessons had not been learned. “I was alarmed that he [Mohammed] appears to be fully unconscious, but his handcuffs haven’t been removed,” she said. “How can you bring someone medical attention when they’re in handcuffs?” Rigg said the decision to keep his handcuffs on behind his back would have restricted his breathing and prevented him from being put in the recovery position. “The IPCC should be seen to be cooperating and sympathetic with the family,” she said. “And officers and staff need to be interviewed in full, under caution, now. Officers would have had ample time to collude by now.” Results of the initial postmortem were inconclusive and more tests, including toxicology checks, will be carried out. Mohammed will be buried in Jamaica. Mayor Anderson said: “If I were to say to you that there were no problems with racism in Merseyside police, I would be saying something that I wasn’t confident about. But I would say that about Liverpool city council and I would say that about other institutions, so it would be wrong to single out the police.”"
2016-07-18T22:59:57Z,uk-news,UK news,Commons votes for Trident renewal by majority of 355,"Theresa May has said she would be willing to authorise a nuclear strike that could kill 100,000 people, as the House of Commons voted overwhelming to replace Britain’s Trident programme. The prime minister confirmed she would be prepared to press the nuclear button if necessary as she opened a debate about whether the UK should spend up to £40bn replacing four submarines that carry nuclear warheads. After more than five hours of discussion, parliament voted in favour of Trident renewal by a majority of 355 in a motion backed by almost the entire Conservative party and more than half of Labour MPs.
It was opposed by all Scottish National party (SNP) MPs, the Lib Dems and Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong unilateralist who spoke out strongly against the plans during the debate. Other members of Corbyn’s frontbench team, including the shadow defence secretary, Clive Lewis, and the shadow foreign affairs secretary, Emily Thornberry, abstained after claiming in a Guardian article that the government was turning an issue of “national security into a political game”. However, around 140 of his MPs – including leadership challengers Angela Eagle and Owen Smith – voted in favour of renewing Trident, with many highlighting Labour’s historic position in support of a continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent. Forty-seven Labour MPs joined Corbyn in voting against Trident, while another 41 were absent or abstained. While Labour were split on the issue, the Conservatives have been hoping the Trident issue could help unify their party after a fractious EU referendum campaign. However, May attracted gasps during the debate when she made clear she would be willing to authorise a nuclear strike killing 100,000 people, when challenged by the SNP about whether she would ever approve a nuclear hit causing mass loss of life.
Intervening in her opening speech, the SNP MP George Kerevan, asked: “Is she personally prepared to authorise a nuclear strike that can kill a hundred thousand innocent men, women and children?” May responded: “Yes. And I have to say to the honourable gentleman the whole point of a deterrent is that our enemies need to know that we would be prepared to use it, unlike some suggestions that we could have a deterrent but not actually be willing to use it, which seem to come from the Labour party frontbench.” Corbyn, the Labour leader, responded to May by making the case for nuclear disarmament, pointing out that the party’s pro-Trident position was under review. He gave his MPs a free vote during Labour’s ongoing defence review, which the Guardian understands involves at least five options ranging from complete replacement to disarmament by the 2030s. The three other options are reduced patrols and fewer submarines, missiles carried by aircraft, and adapted submarines to carry both conventional and nuclear warheads.
Speaking in the Commons, Corbyn said there were currently 40 warheads, which are each eight times as powerful at the atomic bomb that killed 140,000 people at Hiroshima in Japan in 1945. “What is the threat we are facing that one million people’s deaths would actually deter?” he said, adding it did not stop Islamic State, Saddam Hussein’s atrocities, war crimes in the Balkans or genocide in Rwanda. “I make it clear today I would not take a decision that kills millions of innocent people,” Corbyn told MPs. “I do not believe the threat of mass murder is a legitimate way to deal with international relations.” In contrast, May said it would be a “dereliction of duty” to give up Britain’s nuclear deterrent and pledged to keep to the Nato target of spending 2% of national income on defence while she is prime minister. Addressing the idea of downgrading the deterrent to a cheaper option, she said: “I am not prepared to settle for something that does not do the job.” May also took a swipe at anti-Trident MPs on the Labour frontbench and the Green MP Caroline Lucas, claiming they were therefore among “the first to defend the country’s enemies”. The cost of Trident renewal has been estimated at more than £40bn. “No credible deterrent is cheap,” said May.
While the vast majority of Conservatives are in favour of renewing Trident, the Labour party is split three ways between those voting in favour, against and abstaining, while the SNP is firmly against. Corbyn said the UK should follow other countries such as South Africa, Libya, Ukraine, Argentina, Brazil and Kazakhstan, which have shown they are serious about disarmament by giving up their nuclear programmes. “It is now time to step up to the plate and move rapidly towards disarmament,” he said. He was challenged by several Labour MPs as well as Conservatives. Jamie Reed, Copeland MP, claimed Corbyn was arguing against party policy. “For the first time I think ever we’ve witnessed the leader of the Labour party stand up at the despatch box of this House and argue against the policy of the party he leads. “This is unprecedented, moreover this reckless, juvenile, narcissistic irresponsibility makes me fearful for the future of the party that I love.” Another Labour MP, John Woodcock, said it was an “indictment of how far this once great party has fallen” that it was having a free vote on the issue. He said it showed contempt for the public and Labour members, and said such a lack of direction would have been “abhorrent” to the former leader Michael Foot, who was a unilateralist. On the other side, a number of Labour MPs, the SNP and one Tory MP, Crispin Blunt, all spoke out against Trident. Brendan O’Hara, the SNP spokesman on defence in Westminster, said it was an “intolerable position” that nuclear warheads are kept in Faslane by a government the Scottish people did not elect.
Another SNP member, Chris Law, read out a harrowing account of a Hiroshima survivor talking about witnessing her schoolmates die. “Some fell to the ground and their stomachs already expanded full, burst and organs fell out,” he said. “Others had skin falling off them and others still were carrying limbs. And one in particular was carrying their eyeballs in their hand.” Blunt, the chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said it was a “colossal investment in a weapons system that will become increasingly vulnerable”. “This weapons system comes at the cost of the rest of our defence budget,” said Blunt, while criticising his own party for making it into a “political weapon” aimed at Labour. Corbyn’s anti-Trident position chimes with the views of Labour members surveyed on the issue but has caused tensions within the parliamentary party and with the trade unions. Tim Roache, head of the GMB trade union, called on Corbyn to abide by Labour party policy endorsing Trident renewal, and said 45,000 jobs around the country were dependent on the renewal programme going ahead.
Roache, who supported Corbyn as leader, told BBC Radio 4’s The World at One: “The Labour party have a clear policy. The clear policy is that Labour will uphold an at-sea deterrent. “I would expect therefore all Labour MPs, including the leader of the Labour party – in fact, especially the leader of the Labour party – to uphold that current policy.” He said he would be balloting the GMB’s 640,000 members on whether they believed Corbyn was still the right person to lead the party. On the same programme, Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, warned of “consequences” for trade union bosses who continue to back Corbyn. “You have Len McCluskey [of Unite] strongly supporting Jeremy Corbyn, who will be voting against the Trident programme tonight, which will put many defence workers in Unite out of their jobs if he gets his way,” said Watson. “If I was a defence worker in Unite and I was reading social media that Unite were about to give Jeremy Corbyn a quarter of a million pounds of my subscriptions, I would be furious.”Labour have accused Theresa May, who led the debate in parliament, of using the vote “simply to sow further divisions inside the Labour party”. In total, 140 Labour MPs voted in favour of the motion and 47 against, with 40 absent and one abstention. Corbyn was challenged by several Labour MPs as well as Conservatives. Kevan Jones, a former shadow defence minister, highlighted the fact that the Labour leader had not kept to the pro-Trident policy agreed by the party’s conference and included in the 2015 manifesto. Vernon Coaker, a former shadow defence secretary, said the motion in favour of Trident was “reasonable and responsible”."
2016-07-18T23:01:17Z,uk-news,UK news,"National Trust launches Â£250,000 appeal for care of Trevose Head","An appeal has been launched to raise money to care for a headland that provides spectacular, sweeping views of the rugged north Cornwall coast – and a home to precious flora including wild asparagus. The National Trust is in the process of acquiring the 220-acre site at Trevose Head, near Padstow, which has been owned by the same family for a more than a century but has been put up for sale with a guide price of £3.5m.
There was a danger that the site, which includes sites of special scientific interest, could have been divided up and sold off in smaller lots. The National Trust had significant funds towards the purchase thanks to gifts bequeathed to the charity, but it needs to raise £250,000 for work such as bashing scrub, building new fences and opening up access by creating new footpaths. It intends to extend areas of existing wildlife-rich habitat and retain other parts as arable farmland. Nick Lawrence, assistant director of operations for the trust in the south-west, said: “This is a beautiful place, a true jewel on the north Cornwall coast. We have a great opportunity to ensure this piece of coastline is a fantastic place for both nature and people for ever. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to permanently secure and protect this headland for everyone to enjoy.” Trevose is a special place for wildlife. About 80 acres of the headland are within the Constantine Bay site of special scientific interest for its sea cliffs, maritime grassland and heath, as well as wet habitats.
The sea cliffs are of particular interest because of the presence of a number of rare and uncommon plants, most notably the globally rare shore dock and GB red list species wild asparagus. Other interesting plant life include rock sea-lavender, tree mallow and golden samphire. In addition, it is regarded as a fine spot from which to get glimpses of grey seals and peregrine falcons. There are also sites dating from the bronze and iron ages that may be worth exploration. Artefacts discovered on Trevose Head have included flint arrowheads and stone axes.
Tim Ryland, of the estate agents Lodge & Thomas, which is selling the land, said: “The owner of Trevose is delighted the National Trust has agreed to buy Trevose Head. It’s a place that is held dear and they wanted to ensure its future was secure. “They are confident that the National Trust will continue to care for it as the vendor has done for many years and will enable the local community and visitors alike to continue to enjoy this magnificent landscape.”"
2016-07-19T09:44:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Police appeal for witnesses after fatal hit and run in Cornwall,"Police are appealing for witnesses to a fatal hit and run collision after a woman’s body was found in a ditch in Cornwall. A member of the public called Devon and Cornwall police shortly before 4.45am on Tuesday following the discovery of the woman’s body on Trewiston Lane, St Minver. Officers believe the 45-year-old local woman was hit by a vehicle. The rural road has been closed and officers from the serious collisions investigation unit are carrying out a forensic examination of the scene. The woman’s next of kin has been informed. St Minver is close to Padstow and Rock, hugely popular holiday destinations and a favourite spot for former prime minister David Cameron. He and wife, Samantha, named their fourth child Florence Rose Endellion because they love holidaying near St Endellion, which is less than three miles from St Minver. Anyone who witnessed a collision between a pedestrian and a vehicle is asked to email 101@dc.police.uk or call 101, quoting reference 81 of 19 July."

2016-07-19T10:41:43Z,uk-news,UK news,UK to swelter in heatwave as temperatures near 34C,"The UK is expected to have its hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures as high as 34C on Tuesday. The mini-heatwave – the previous hottest day of the year was on Monday – has prompted Public Health England to urge people to look out for relatives and friends who may be particularly vulnerable to the heat.
Temperatures on Tuesday, which will hit the high 20s in Scotland and Northern Ireland but rise above 30C elsewhere, follow a sticky night, when the mercury did not fall below 19.7C in Plymouth on the south coast. “Yesterday was the hottest day so far with 30 degrees in London and today we are looking to exceed that,” said Met Office meteorologist Helen Roberts. “We’re possibly looking at 33C, possibly 34C. It’s likely to be in north London, maybe even in the Midlands.” She said that another sticky night was in prospect, possibly threatening the record highest overnight minimum temperature of 23.9C, recorded in Brighton in August 1990, or the previous highest July overnight minimum of 22.3C.
But the hot weather may be punctuated by heavy thunderstorms in Northern Ireland on Tuesday evening. These could extend to affect parts of Scotland overnight and possibly Wales, northern England and the Midlands on Wednesday. The Met Office has issued a yellow “be aware” warning of rain, which it said “could lead to some flooding of homes, businesses and transport networks. Disruption to power is also possible.” There could be nearly a month’s worth of rain in some areas. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs forecasts moderate air pollution across large areas of England, Wales and Northern Ireland on Tuesday, in light of the warm weather, with low levels elsewhere.
Where there is moderate air pollution it advises that children and adults with lung problems, and adults with heart problems, who experience symptoms, should consider reducing strenuous physical activity, particularly outdoors. Dr Angie Bone, head of extreme events at PHE, said: “For most people there’s nothing to really worry about. But for some people, such as older people, those with underlying health conditions and those with young children, summer heat can bring real health risks. This summer we’re urging people to keep an eye on those at risk and if you’re able, offer help to stay cool and hydrated.”
St John’s ambulance service also issued advice to avoid the most common conditions its first aiders come across when temperatures rise – cramping, fainting, sunburn and dehydration. Like PHE, it advised people to apply sun cream, cover up and stay hydrated. PHE also warned people to stay out of the sun between 11am and 3pm, avoid physical exertion at the hottest times of the day and stay in the shade. It also advised closing curtains to keeps rooms cool, opening windows and avoiding leaving people and animals in closed, parked vehicles.
The southern wind that has brought the warm weather from Spain is expected to change direction later in the week, with a westerly wind bringing cooler temperatures, although they will still be in the low-to-mid 20s on Thursday and Friday. The average daily temperature for July is 19.4C for the UK and 21C for England. The record maximum for July is 36.7C, registered at Heathrow last year."
2016-07-19T12:43:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Iraq war families crowdsource for funds to sue Tony Blair,"Family members of British soldiers killed in Iraq have launched a crowdfunding appeal to prosecute Tony Blair over his role in the war. Relatives aim to raise £150,000 to fund a legal assessment of the possibility of a private prosecution of the former prime minister and others, following the publication of the Chilcot report earlier this month. The report – the result of a seven-year inquiry into the 2003 war by Sir John Chilcot – was damning in its criticism of Blair, finding that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, that Saddam Hussain posed no imminent threat, and that both Blair and George W Bush had not exhausted all diplomatic options before resorting to invasion. The appeal is led by Reg Keys and Roger Bacon, whose sons L/Cpl Tom Keys and Maj Matthew Bacon were among 179 British service personnel who died during the invasion. Keys said that while some families had opted to move on, the campaign, under the banner of the Iraq War Families Campaign Group, spoke for the majority of bereaved relatives. “The families will be taking a civil prosecution against Tony Blair and anybody who is flagged up in [the report] who it is deemed viable and appropriate to pursue legally,” he said. Keys said the money would enable the families’ legal team, from the London firm McCue and Partners, to assess the 2.6m-word report and determine whether there are grounds for possible prosecutions.
“The police will not look at [the report], the government will not look at it, we cannot get legal aid to look at it,” Keys said. “There’s a lot of work involved, but we feel that [Blair] needs to be brought to account for this. He and the other peddlers of the deceit.” By midday on Tuesday, just 12 hours after its launch, the appeal had raised almost half its target of £50,000, which Keys described as heartwarming. The total target is £150,000 but sites set targets in £50,000-increments. “Our determination to find answers has been redoubled by Sir John’s excoriating view of the establishment’s tragic and error-strewn display,” said Bacon. “We must now ensure every iota of the report is analysed in depth, to determine whether there are potential legal cases to follow up. And to help us, we ask the British public to take action.” Blair defended his actions after the report was published, insisting he had acted in good faith, based on intelligence at the time that Iraq was developing WMDs. He vehemently denied that he had lied to parliament, saying: “I can look the nation in the eye and say I did not mislead this country.” Matthew Jury, the lawyer representing the families, said the appeal was “the only chance for justice” for the families and the British people. “The report told us what went wrong and who was responsible, but it was not a court of law. If they can, the families are determined to hold those individuals to account by bringing them to trial to answer for their actions,” he said. “Not just for them or their loved ones but to ensure that never again will our politicians act with such impunity in taking our country into an unjust war with such tragic consequences.”"
2016-07-19T14:40:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Report strongly criticises NHS investigation into boy's sepsis death,"Hospital bosses and doctors have been strongly criticised in an ombudsman’s report for their “total unwillingness” to accept that any view apart from their own could have been correct following the death of a three-year-old boy from sepsis. The report concluded that those involved leapt to the conclusion that Sam Morrish’s death was rare and unfortunate rather than being open to what turned out to be the truth – that his death was avoidable. As well as criticising the NHS trust involved in Sam’s care and other bodies, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) called for a “no-blame culture” to be built within the health service allowing leaders and staff to feel confident to openly investigate complaints. The ombudsman, Julie Mellor, is calling for a national accredited training programme for people carrying out NHS investigations to be set up. She said: “We hope that this case acts as a wake-up call for NHS leaders to support a no-blame culture in which leaders and staff in every NHS organisation feel confident to find out if and why something went wrong and to learn from it.” Sam, from Devon, died in December 2010 from sepsis following a catalogue of errors by GPs, hospital doctors and call handlers at NHS Direct, now replaced by the 111 service. NHS Direct call handlers failed to categorise Sam’s mother’s call as urgent, despite indications that his vomit contained blood. Even when medical staff at Torbay hospital, part of Torbay and South Devon NHS foundation trust, finally realised he was critically ill, there was a three-hour delay in giving him the antibiotics that could have saved his life. A review by the PHSO in 2014 found Sam’s death was avoidable and he would have survived with proper care and treatment. But Sam’s parents, Sue and Scott Morrish, called for a further investigation to find out more about what happened and how the boy’s death was investigated. In the latest review, the PHSO judged there was no attempt to cover up failings in Sam’s care but it strongly criticised the way his death had been investigated. The report, Learning From Mistakes, concluded those involved in the local NHS investigations were not sufficiently trained, aware of the relevant guidelines or sufficiently independent. It said: “We have found that those involved were not always suitably independent and that the organisations failed to co-ordinate and cooperate sufficiently with one another. “We have identified a failure to obtain appropriate information, a lack of timely statements being taken as part of any formal process and a lack of appropriate (and in some cases any) involvement and communication with both the family and the staff. “We believe a fundamental failure in this case was the organisations’ – in particular the trust – total unwillingness to accept that no view other than their own was the right one. “Those involved appeared to accept almost immediately the view that Sam’s death was rare and unfortunate rather than being open to other possibilities and, in doing so, asking open questions as part of a proper investigation that involved staff and the family. This was coupled with a general failure to accept that the questions the family were asking might have been reasonable ones.” It added: “Most importantly for the family, the organisations involved locally made no clear attempt to seek continuous improvement and identify lessons from this case together. Tackling the current defensive culture and fear of blame requires soul searching and bravery at every level from politicians to system leaders, organisational leaders, clinical leaders and frontline staff.” The report criticised the investigations carried out by NHS Direct, a GP’s surgery and an out-of-hours provider of GP services as well as the trust. It said: “Mr and Mrs Morrish complained that the NHS investigation processes are not fit for purpose, believing that they are not sufficiently independent, inquisitive, open or transparent, properly focused on learning, or able to span organisational and hierarchical barriers, and that they exclude patients, their families, and junior staff in the process. In relation to the investigations undertaken after Sam’s death, we agree.” The Morrishes welcomed the report. In a statement, they said: “When our son Sam died suddenly and unexpectedly we trusted that no stone would be left unturned in trying to understand what had happened and why. We were told that Sam had died of something rare, fast-acting, hard to spot and therefore very hard to treat. “In the months that followed we were shown kindness but we were simultaneously excluded from investigations. As questions accumulated, they were increasingly left unanswered. “When we asked why Sam had been sent to the wrong hospital, shoulders were shrugged. When we asked why, after five months, investigations hadn’t been completed, we were told ‘not to pick a fight with the NHS: you won’t win’.“We need to shift away from a culture that perceives people like Sam as unlucky, and the bereaved as a problem to be managed. It shouldn’t be left to patients, or grieving families to drive the process for learning.” Mairead McAlinden, the chief executive of Torbay and South Devon NHS foundation trust, said: “Sam’s death was a tragedy, and we have made many changes in the past five years to support staff in recognising and responding to signs of sepsis and to improve how we engage with patients and their families. “We have sincerely apologised to Sam’s family for our failings in his care and in our communications with them, and we owe it to them to demonstrate how we have learned from their devastating loss.” The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said: “The tragic death of Sam Morrish shows why it is so important we listen to patients and families – no other family should have to go through what they have, and we are determined to build the safest healthcare system in the world. “The launch of the new healthcare safety investigation branch [HSIB] earlier this year marks an important step in improving the quality of local investigations and raising standards, which will allow staff to speak up and improve care for patients.” Ombudsman Mellor said the HSIB was a step in the right direction, but would only investigate a small number of cases."
2016-07-19T14:49:54Z,uk-news,UK news,Military chiefs analysing Chilcot report 'line by line' to learn lessons,"Military officials are going through the 2.6m-word Chilcot report “line by line” to learn crucial lessons in the face of its damning criticism of the way UK troops were deployed in the US-led invasion of Iraq, a crossparty group of MPs has been told. Key problems identified by Chilcot included the failure to challenge the views of ministers and senior commanders and the dangers of “groupthink”, Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, told the Commons defence committee on Tuesday. However, he declined to commit himself when asked whether the findings of the MoD’s postmortem would be made public. Among a long list of failings, the Chilcot report concluded: “It was not sufficiently clear which person or department within the MoD had responsibility for identifying and articulating capability gaps.” Brigadier Ben Barry, retired, whose written statement to Chilcot has still not been published, told the Guardian on Tuesday the report failed to hold anyone to account about the slowness in responding to the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), such as roadside bombs. “The chief of defence staff, permanent secretaries (top civil servants) and defence ministers have not been asked the necessary hard questions on this,” Barry added. Barry, now a land warfare expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, also challenged Chilcot’s claim that cutting the size of the army following the invasion had no damaging effect on operations in Iraq. “There would have been more available if the infantry had not been reduced,” he said. “There is no danger that any decision of that magnitude will be taken ever again by a handful of people in the prime minister’s study,” Fallon told MPs, referring to the sharp attacks on Tony Blair’s style of “sofa government” in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq.
Whitehall’s joint intelligence committee had since been enhanced “with more independence built in to assessments”, Fallon added, referring to the way MI6 relied on a very small number of sources to back up its now-discredited reports on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. As Fallon was giving evidence to the MPs, relatives of some of the 179 British troops killed in Iraq launched a public crowdfunding appeal to pay for lawyers to potentially sue those responsible. The Iraq War Families Campaign Group wants to raise £150,000 to fund legal work. Reg Keys, whose son died in Iraq, said: “The public support the families have received over the years has been unstinting. With the [Chilcot] report’s publication, we now have the evidence that may mean individuals could now face trial.” Their ire is directed at Blair. However, in a little-noticed passage of the report, Chilcot says Gordon Brown, then chancellor, “should have ensured that estimates of the likely overall cost of a UK intervention in Iraq, for military and civilian activities during the conflict and post‑conflict period, and the wider implications for public expenditure were identified and available to ministers and cabinet”. The report also refers to what it calls “optimism bias”, and one of the most senior individuals displaying this tendency was Des Browne, defence secretary from 2006 to 2008. “Mr Browne repeatedly downplayed the negative aspects of the situation in Iraq and failed to ensure the dissemination of a full and unvarnished version of the truth on the ground in Iraq. In four instances, Mr Browne gave an unbalanced account of the situation in Basra to the prime minister, cabinet or parliament.” However, it was Brown who tried to speed up the supply of much needed equipment, including helicopters."
2016-07-19T16:33:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Spalding shooting: man believed to have killed his wife and daughter,"A man is believed to have shot and killed his wife and daughter near a swimming pool in Spalding, Lincolnshire. Lance Hart, 57, who worked at a builders’ merchants, killed Claire Hart, 50, and their daughter Charlotte Hart, 19, with a shotgun near Castle swimming pool in the market town before turning the weapon on himself, according to local reports. Officers and paramedics tried to save the two women, whom they found gravely injured at about 9am on Tuesday. The man was already dead. No shots were fired by police. Police said they were not looking for anyone else in relation to the shooting. They said it was not being treated as a terrorist incident. Residents spoke of hearing a number of loud bangs followed by a flurry of emergency vehicle activity shortly after. “From what I understand, a man shot himself and his family,” one person who did not want to be identified told the Press Association. “We have heard it’s a self-contained incident.” Supt Paul Timmins said: “We believe a shotgun was involved in the incident and are currently investigating the circumstances of this tragic incident. We believe all those involved were known to each other. Clearly, a situation such as this for a small community like Spalding is hard to comprehend.” A builder working nearby said he had attempted to resuscitate a “very badly injured” older woman. “I ran across the car park, jumped over the fence and went to help,” he said. “When I arrived, there was only me and another lad from the swimming pool who was trying to help. There were three people injured. It looked like the man had done the other two and done away with himself.” The man, who declined to be named, said: “There was a man, an older woman, and a younger woman. They looked like a family. The man was already dead when I got there. The older woman was very badly injured and I tried CPR on her while the guy from the swimming baths tried on the younger woman.”
Chris Hammond, 68, who lives close to the swimming pool, said: “About 9.30am, I was sweeping the path, all these ambulances and police cars came just then and the ambicopter [ambulance helicopter]. “I was frightened. Then the armed response teams got out with their submachine guns. I thought it was best to keep out of the way. My daughter lives in town and works for a solicitors. They were told to keep everyone inside. It did shock me.” John Tippler, 86, whose house is yards away from the pool, said: “The only thing I heard, which I didn’t take note of at the time, was three bangs. I can’t say exactly when that was, about 9am. I only took notice of them because my dog looked up and I reassured her. I didn’t think of them being shots.” He said that despite the police activity, he was only alerted to the tragedy when his son called from Cambridge to check that he was all right. “I usually take the dog for a walk through that area in the morning but it happened we had been earlier today and gone a different route,” he said.
A number of residents thought the shots they heard had come from a nearby gunsmiths, where guns are sometimes fired in the backyard to test them. One man, who did not wish to be named, said he had lived in the area for about 40 years and never heard of any previous shootings. Gary Taylor, a South Holland district council member whose ward includes the swimming baths, said the area was in shock. “I was there at the swimming baths just last night and then this morning I heard that this has happened. It’s totally shocking,” he said. “It’s not an area that has any guns or gang crime whatsoever. It’s a very peaceful, safe, residential area so everyone is in total shock. The council is trying to reassure people … the gunman has apparently shot himself.” On Tuesday afternoon, a large police cordon remained in place around the area of the swimming pool. A forensics investigation vehicle was present and a tent had been erected in the car park. A number of police cars as well as a fire engine remained on the scene. Officers raided a house in Hatt Close, Moulton, Spalding, though it was not clear if it was linked to the shooting. A police spokesman said: “We can confirm that there has been a firearms incident on Pinchbeck Road in Spalding, in the vicinity of the Castle swimming pool, in which three people have been fatally wounded, including the suspected offender. There is an ongoing police investigation and at this stage we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. “There is no indication that this is a terrorist-related incident and no shots have been fired by police. We would urge members of the public to stay away from the area at the present time.” A spokesman for East Midlands ambulance service said three people had died from gunshot wounds. He said paramedics were called at 9.04am. “Our ambulance crews and paramedic officer were sent to the emergency and told to approach with caution,” said the spokesman. “Upon arriving at the scene our paramedics treated three patients who had gunshot wounds. Despite the best efforts of everyone at the scene the patients were pronounced dead. This is a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the friends and families of those involved.” The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted his condolences.

2016-07-19T17:52:47Z,uk-news,UK news,"PM should highlight positive immigration aspects, Notts PCC says","Theresa May should speak out about the positive impacts of immigration, to counter the hostile narrative preventing integration, the police and crime commissioner for Nottinghamshire has said. Speaking at the first citizens’ jury to examine the impact of the government’s plan to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees, Paddy Tipping criticised the “unhelpful and negative comments” made by senior government figures over immigration and Muslim communities. Tipping said he was concerned about the “increasingly hostile environment to new arrivals and indeed to established communities” in Nottinghamshire.
Hate crimes had gone up 11% over the last 12 months, he said. Since the Brexit vote, there had been an increase in reported incidents. The numbers were “relatively low” but they were under-reported, Tipping said. “There are real fears in the Muslim community that they are being picked upon,” said the commissioner. “Since 9/11, things have been getting worse. Some of the rhetoric from politicians around terrorism hasn’t helped.” Tipping said that, in order to help those on the ground advance the integration of refugees and asylum seekers, May needed to be proactive. “The prime minister has been very good on stop-and-search, around recruitment and retention of black and ethnic minority officers,” he said. “She’s good on that but really she needs to say more about the positive impacts of immigration. We’ve created our own problems by telling people there are problems that can’t be sorted out. We can sort it but we need to tone down the rhetoric. We need to talk about successes.” Speaking after the hearing, Tipping would not be drawn on individual ministers, but said: “You could run through a list of cabinet ministers who have said things about Muslim communities and about the increase in immigration that sets a negative tone. For those of us who want to build strong communities, that creates a hostile climate, a negative climate that makes it very difficult.” Asked by Nottingham Citizens’ Commission on Sanctuary, a panel of community and faith leaders, what police were doing to increase trust and confidence among minority communities, Tipping said the percentage of black and minority ethnic (BME) police had increased in the last four years, to better reflect the wider community. Nottingham police force is 14% BME, with 26% of all cadets from BME communities, he said, while stop-and-search rates for Nottingham were the lowest in the country. About 35% of Nottingham’s 310,000 population are BME, according to the 2011 ONS census. The commission was set up by Nottingham Citizens, a local branch of Citizens UK, a local alliance of civic society institutions, in response to what they said was a community-led desire to help refugees. It held its first hearing on Tuesday, as the archbishop of Canterbury and the Home Office launched a scheme to encourage members of the public, community and faith groups to sponsor refugee families settling in the UK. Nottingham, one of the first places to resettle the first vulnerable Syrian refugees that came to the UK after Christmas, has been generally welcoming of refugees, with numerous civic agencies keen to help them integrate, the commission heard. The city has taken in 95 of the first 1,000 Syrian refugees to be resettled as part of David Cameron’s promise to take in 20,000 by 2020. But there were community tensions, particularly in outlying villages, such as the former coal neighbourhood of Mansfield, where facilities have been badly hit by austerity measures. In nearby Brindsley, with a long history of rightwing activists, a banner was erected, proclaiming: “Refugees are not wanted in Brindsley.” Tipping said police had good intelligence on rightwing groups, including the Nottingham Casual Infidels, the group investigated by police after reports of a negative Facebook post following the fatal shooting and stabbing of MP Jo Cox in June. Tipping reported low levels of racial tensions in the inner city, but in areas that were more isolated and fragmented, with fewer facilities. “We need to do more thinking,” he said. The panel also heard from councillor David Mellen, of Nottingham city council, who echoed Tipping’s concerns. He said: “There aren’t the facilities in small market towns, in places like Mansfield. We need to do it in a way that doesn’t make people who are vulnerable more vulnerable.” There were pressures on housing stock and on other services, the panel heard. Councillor Nicola Heaton, of Nottingham city council, who has portfolio for community services, said there was a formal “saturation zone” based on the number of asylum seekers in housing stock but there was pressure to exceed it. Areas like Arboretum and Hyson Green, where G4S house refugees, because of cheap, large housing stock, presented “challenges in terms of services and also of community cohesion”. Heaton said tensions were not all race related, but stemmed from austerity and misunderstanding of local rules over rubbish collection, which could be addressed. The chair of the Nottingham & Nottinghamshire Refugee Forum, Leo Keely, said he gets 300-400 people through the doors every week and “we get virtually no comments on hate crime”. He said: “We should be proud of how the city has responded over the years.” Lydia Rye, senior organiser for Nottingham Citizens, said there had been a “clear call” from the community since the body of toddler Alan Kurdi was washed up in Turkey in September 2015, to do more for refugees. The commission, set up to address that, would produce a list of recommendations in October, she said. “The challenge is how to support the community to do that meaningfully,” Rye said. “Families need to build a life and make friends. How do you support the 40-odd organisations to help do that? Especially when the public conversation at a national level is about making it harder?” The commission’s first hearing, at Trent Vineyard church, in Notts, also heard from the Nottingham clinical commissioning group, the City of Sanctuary and, in a closed session, from G4S, the security company that houses refugees."
2016-07-19T18:19:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Amber Rudd aims to reduce UK immigration to 'sustainable levels',"A question mark has been placed over the future of the government’s target to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands before the next election after the new home secretary said her goal was to bring it down only to “sustainable levels”. The latest figures published during the EU referendum campaign showed net migration to Britain hitting near-record levels of 333,000 in 2015 and Amber Rudd’s latest refusal to endorse the specific target provides a hint that it may soon be dropped by the new cabinet. Theresa May sparked speculation during the EU campaign that she wanted to distance herself from David Cameron’s target when she failed to mention it in her only campaign speech and questioned in a television interview whether it was possible to set a particular time period for the target. Speaking after attending the first cabinet meeting chaired by May, the home secretary declined to endorse the specific target in a BBC interview despite being asked twice if it still existed. The first time Rudd was asked if she could give a commitment to get mass migration down to the tens of thousands in the future, she replied: “Well, what the prime minister has said is that we must bring migration down to sustainable levels. So that is what is going to be my aim at the moment.” Pressed as to whether the target still existed, she said: “I am going to stick to my comment which is about bringing it down to sustainable levels. That has to be the most important thing for the country.” When the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, was later asked whether Rudd’s comments indicated the target was about to be dropped, he said his colleague was “entirely right to be careful about committing to numbers” because the government “does not want to be in a position where we are disappointing people again”. Downing Street also downplayed speculation that the target is about to be ditched, saying: “The prime minister does see sustainable levels as down to the tens of thousands. The prime minister’s spokeswoman added: “Sustainable levels is an approach and a language that has been used repeatedly by the Home Office in the past. The prime minister has used it herself. There isn’t a change,. “The emphasis on ‘sustainable’ reflects the fact that this is about looking at what is the right level for our country, what communities across the country can cope with, pressure on public services, looking at all these issues.” Rudd’s vague language prompted Labour to call for a Commons statement to clarify the future of the target while the Liberal Democrats claimed she had given a clear indication it was about to be ditched. In an interview with ITV’s Robert Peston during the referendum campaign, May used a similar formula to Rudd, saying: “I still believe that we should have that goal of bringing immigration down to sustainable levels.” However, May added: “What I have also discovered over the last six years is that this is somewhere where you’re constantly having to work at it, so you can’t just set a time period.” She warned that a pre-Brexit surge might further jeopardise such a precise target: “We know, for example, if we’re looking ahead over the coming months and years once we get the issue of the EU negotiation sorted, the right deal for Britain, we may very well see in the run-up to that, people wanting to come here to the UK before that exit happens, so there are factors you can’t always predict what the timing and numbers of those will be.” Against this, May has previously argued to continue the net migration target and has strongly resisted attempts by cabinet colleagues to dilute it by removing overseas students from the definition. The Liberal Democrats’ home affairs spokesman, Alistair Carmichael, said: “Amber Rudd has done the right thing by seriously hinting that Theresa May’s ridiculous and failed net immigration targets will be ditched. “It is to be hoped that she will now change other aspects of government policy. “An early indication of a willingness to allow EU nationals to remain in the UK post-Brexit would show that she is in control of her department and not being remotely controlled by Downing Street.”"
2016-07-19T18:23:27Z,uk-news,UK news,'Northern powerhouse' minister to create elected Sheffield mayor,"The new minister for the “northern powerhouse” has signed off a plan to create an elected mayor for the Sheffield city region in one of his first acts in the role. Speaking at a meeting of MPs in parliament on Tuesday morning, Andrew Percy, MP for Brigg and Goole, said: “It’s very nice, as a proud Yorkshire man, for one of my first acts as minister to be devolving power away from Westminster and some funding up to Yorkshire, where it will be better dealt with.” Percy was appointed minister in charge of the northern powerhouse project in Theresa May’s frontbench reshuffle upon arriving in No 10. He replaced James Wharton, MP for Stockton South, who was moved to the Department for International Development.
A new mayor for the Sheffield city region will be elected to a three-year term in May 2017 and will oversee transport budgets, franchised bus services and strategic planning. Following the election in 2020, people will serve in the role for four-year terms. In October last year, the then chancellor, George Osborne, agreed a devolution deal with the Sheffield city region combined authority, which includes the Labour heartlands of Rotherham, Sheffield, Doncaster, Bolsover and Bassetlaw, and has a population of just over 1.8 million. In a 2012 referendum, people in Sheffield voted not to have an elected mayor and the Labour party has been critical of Osborne’s devolution deals for simply imposing an extra layer of bureaucracy on local government with no extra funding. At a delegated legislation committee meeting in parliament, where the creation of the new role was approved, Sarah Champion, Labour MP for Rotherham, criticised the deal, saying the £30m of funding that was promised was not new money, but money that had already been earmarked for local authorities. “We’re no better off than we were before,” she said after the meeting. “The whole northern powerhouse thing just feels very hollow to me … This is seen to be a step in getting devolution but it’s not. It’s actually Westminster telling us that we have to spend our money on the things that they want us to spend it on.
“I think there’s a very strong argument for us to have a seat at the table because I really feel that the north doesn’t get consulted or taken seriously down in Westminster. So if the mayor is someone who can be on a par with a minister, for example, and be arguing as strongly, that’ll be great. But for them to have power they need to have their own money and at the moment they haven’t.” Separately on Tuesday, devolution in the north-east appeared to hit a roadblock as council leaders voted to seek further assurances about EU funding. Paul Watson, the Sunderland council leader and chair of the north east combined authority, said the loss of EU funding would have a significant impact on the region. The north-east council leaders sought assurances from the government immediately after the Brexit vote, but on Tuesday they voted to seek further reassurances from Sajid Javid, the new communities and local government secretary."
2016-07-19T18:51:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Thunderstorms and blood rain forecast after UK's hottest day of year,"Temperatures across much of the UK broke the 30C mark on Tuesday, the hottest day recorded this year, exceeding temperatures in the Caribbean, Saudi Arabia and the Sahara desert.
The Met Office said Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, registered the highest temperature, at 33.5C. It said heavy thunderstorms were due to hit the north of England and Scotland on Tuesday night, but the hot weather was predicted to continue to the weekend. Some rail services were cancelled or disrupted as train companies warned of buckled tracks. In London, commuters faced sapping heat on tube trains and buses. By midday in St James’s Park, Westminster, the mercury had reached 32C. Green spaces were packed as workers found excuses to leave their desks. Hampstead Heath’s leisure and events manager, Paul Maskell, said the heath had never been busier, and Parliament Hill lido had to turn people away.
“In 21 years of working here, I have never seen such a sheer volume of people coming to the heath to sunbathe or find a shady spot under a tree,” Maskell said. “It seems absolutely everyone has taken the day off in London. No one at all seems to be going to work.” He said the heath’s swimming ponds – where water temperatures reached a record 24C – were also in high demand. He added: “We took the decision to close the lido as there were hundreds of people queuing outside in severe heat, and we had thousands come in through the day.” The sunshine meant a busier day than usual for the emergency services, who issued warnings about the dangers of some ways of trying to beat the heat. On Monday in Staffordshire a 46-year-old man died after jumping into a canal, apparently to cool off, and on Tuesday in Brighton two men were rescued from the sea after hiring jetskis, losing control and crashing into one another. Meanwhile in Banbury, Oxfordshire, the fire brigade were called to deal with a blaze in a sewing machine shop. They said sunrays concentrated through a magnifying glass in the shop window had set material alight.
London Ambulance Service said that on Monday it received more than 300 category-A calls, which means paramedics respond under blue lights to seriously ill and injured patients. The service’s medical director, Dr Fenella Wrigley, said the soaring heat had caused problems for people already in poor health.
She added: “We have seen an increase in calls because people forget to stay hydrated, and the heat can exacerbate heart and breathing conditions. Older people, the very young and people with pre-existing conditions are more at risk, so please check on friends, family members and neighbours who are vulnerable. “We urge everyone out enjoying the sunshine to drink plenty of water, stay in the shade to keep cool, cover up, carry any essential medication with them and drink alcohol in moderation.” In Scotland, temperatures were in the high 20s as far north as the Highlands, and peaked at 28.3C in Prestwick, Ayrshire. A forecaster at MeteoGroup has said that on Wednesday there is a chance of a phenomenon known as “blood rain”. The meteorological quirk happens when dust from the Sahara desert is blown into the atmosphere and then falls on Britain in thundery showers. Scotland can expect thunder, lighting strikes, hail and flash floods as two bands of rain sweep in from the Atlantic on Wednesday. The Met Office forecaster Alex Priestley said: “We have been liaising with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and they’re prepared for dealing with any issues that may arise.” The Met Office said UK temperatures were expected to fall over the weekend. The hot weather has some way to go to match the heatwave of 1976, when a maximum temperature of 32C or more was recorded on 15 consecutive days a phenomenon known as “blood rain”. The meteorological quirk happens when dust from the Sahara desert is blown into the atmosphere and then falls on Britain in thundery showers. • This article was amended on 21 July 2016.

2016-07-19T18:58:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Met 'may be overly targeting BAME youths as gang members',"The Metropolitan police may be overly targeting black and ethnic minority youths as gang members, resulting in them being treated more harshly by the courts, prisons and justice system, a review has found. The concerns centre on figures showing nearly 90% of youths classed as gang members by Britain’s largest force are black or from other ethnic minority backgrounds (BAME) – which is considerably in excess of their proportion in the population. The review is being led by the Labour MP David Lammy and was ordered by David Cameron when he was prime minister. The work continues despite the change in Downing Street. Concerns centre around the Met’s database of gang suspects, called the gangs matrix. Figures for 2016 show that of the 3,626 people listed on that database, 78% were black and a further 9% were from other ethnic minority backgrounds. Ethnic minorities make up 40% of London’s population. The figures cover people known to be in a gang, suspected of involvement, or at risk of joining a gang. Lammy said the effects are that someone can get a longer sentence and be treated more harshly throughout the criminal justice system. In a speech, he said some cases may be mistaken, with youths wrongly labelled as gang members not knowing how to be cleared of the stigma. Speaking in London last Friday, Lammy gave the first clues as to the direction in which his review is heading. He said: “We have, therefore, a journey through the system in which suspected gang membership can affect decisions at each turn, from charging, to conviction, to sentencing, to treatment in prison and rehabilitation in the community. “And we have the gang matrix as the source of much of the information used by other actors in the justice system. Prisoners I have spoken to in both adult prisons and youth offending institutions have often been frank about their involvement in criminality. “But the same people have often also been insistent that they were mislabelled as gang members by the police and then subsequently by the rest of the justice system.” For the Met’s figures to be correct, there would have to be 360 white gang members across all of London’s 32 boroughs. The issue was referenced by Theresa May when she took office last Wednesday. In her speech outside 10 Downing Street she highlighted racial discrimination in the justice system and said: “If you’re black, you’re treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you’re white.” Lammy gave the example of a parent who adopted one black and one white child. Both got into trouble and enmeshed into the criminal justice system. “But it was the black child who had wrongly been tagged with the label of ‘gang member’ and the label had stuck,” the MP said. “The parent and his adopted son had no idea how to remove the label – and his name from the gangs matrix.” Lammy added: “One member of a youth offending team told me that her team would routinely make decisions based on the information they were given about gang membership. “Decisions, she said, were being made without challenging where the information came from, or whether it was reliable and up to date.” The full report is expected to be given to May early next year. Lammy’s inquiry is being staffed and supported by civil servants in a sign of how seriously the government is taking it. Lammy said gang members carry out half of all shootings in the capital and he said many victims came from ethnic minority backgrounds. But the MP added: “But the concern I have heard – repeatedly I must say – is that young people from ethnic minority backgrounds are also being tagged with the ‘gang’ label in ways they do not feel is justified; and that this tag can have real consequences for the way the criminal justice system deals with those individuals.” Lammy is the MP for Tottenham and Wood Green – the seat of riots in 2011 that spread to become the worst in modern English history. Cameron’s claims that gangs were behind the disturbances was overplayed, with strained relations with police and other social factors playing a part. Lammy said: “When four in five people on the gangs matrix are black – and that database currently informs decisions throughout the criminal justice system – it is something that someone in my position has a duty to scrutinise closely.”"
2016-07-19T22:25:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Three stabbed in Hyde Park as water fight turns violent,"Police in riot gear were deployed in Hyde Park in central London on Tuesday after an event originally described as a free party and water fight turned ugly – with one officer stabbed and another injured after being hit with a bottle. The violence started earlier in the afternoon when a crowd of young people began gathering in the park on what was the hottest day of the year so far. According to witnesses posting comments on social media, a largely good-natured crowd were told to disperse by police officers, prompting some to start throwing bottles. Later in the evening two members of the public were taken to hospital suffering from stab wounds. The two police officers were also treated in hospital and subsequently discharged. Images posted on social media show scores of young people gathering as police officers, many carrying riot shields, tried to clear the area. The crowds did not disperse until 2.20am on Wednesday, police said. One video on Twitter, posted by an account called ‘YT_Bricks’, showed parts of the disturbances and can be heard saying “... they are throwing bottles at Fed cars ... they are mashing up the Fed cars.” Earlier this week, flyers had been distributed on social media advertising a free party, which brought hundreds of young people into the area. The unofficial event follows large parts of the park being closed to the public last week as the royal parks hosted their British Summer Time concerts, featuring stars such as Stevie Wonder, Pharrell, Carole King and Massive Attack. There had been anger expressed by residents living nearby at the noise of the gigs, and by community activists at the fact what was once a public open space was now being used to make promoters and the royal parks large sums of money while blocking off access to local communities. At 10pm, the Metropolitan police said they were still dealing with “disorder”. A police spokesperson confirmed two officers suffered injuries – one stabbed and another hit with as bottle – and that two others were also reported to have been stabbed and had been taken to hospital. A statement added: “Police in Westminster were in attendance at Hyde Park, by the Serpentine, from 3pm after a large number of people gathered for a spontaneous ‘water fight’. “At around 8.40pm, parts of the increasingly large crowd become hostile to police and items – including bottles – were thrown towards officers.” Westminster Conservative councillor Glenys Roberts, said many residents in areas around Hyde Park felt increasingly disenfranchised by the use of the park during the summer for commercial events, and that free parties could be a response to them. She added: “The concerts are a great nuisance. Many feel strongly that the park is a free space that should be open to everybody. The concerts do not even seem to make enough money to repair damage to the grass or improve the park for the enjoyment of all.” A spokesperson for The Royal Parks said “Event organisers pay for reinstatement of the park after events. The Royal Parks holds concerts to bring in the much needed self-generated funding to keep the parks in the amazing state that millions of people enjoy every year. Over the past 10 years we’ve seen our government grant reduce by about 50% so these funds are vital to the upkeep of Hyde Park. “Just 11 per cent of Hyde Park is taken up for the concerts and during that two-week period that area is open more than it’s closed with a range of free activities taking place during the week. We have worked hard with our event partners to minimise any disruption and this approach has meant that complaints have reduced year on year. And 2016 was no exception.” • This article was amended on 22 July 2016 to append a quote from The Royal Parks."
2016-07-19T23:01:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Police watchdog criticises force over delays in children's cases,"A police force has been criticised by independent inspectors for not always responding quickly enough when children are at risk of sexual exploitation. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary said the delays by Devon and Cornwall police could result in children being put at risk of significant harm, and the causes needed to be tackled promptly. In one case flagged up by HMIC, a 13-year-old girl alleged she had been sexually assaulted by a woman with whom she had been in a relationship. There was a delay of 10 days before the investigating officer spoke to the complainant, and another two months passed before a suspect was arrested. The report said: “Despite concerns about the victim’s vulnerability to CSE [child sexual exploitation] being recorded on police systems several months before this …there was still no evidence of a safeguarding or protective plan being implemented for the victim despite clear signs of her obvious vulnerability.” Another case that worried inspectors involved a 12-year old boy who had been groomed for sexual exploitation by an adult family friend. The HMIC said the initial response to arrest the suspect and safeguard the victim was appropriate. But it added: “There was no evidence of any consideration being given to the wider risks posed by the suspect to other children. Despite police records showing the suspect had previously held a number of roles supervising children (including as a Scout leader, which he was asked to leave because he had taken children on trips without permission), no further investigation was undertaken to assess wider risks or to identify further potential victims.” In a third case, a 14-year-old boy had been reported missing more than 40 times and had attempted suicide. Police records indicated that information had been shared with the local authority and the risk of CSE had been considered. But there was no evidence that any longer-term safeguarding plan had been considered to protect him from further harm.
HMIC published an initial report on Devon and Cornwall police last year as part of a rolling programme of child protection inspections of all police forces in England and Wales. A post-inspection review was carried out in April 2016. In its report on this review, published on Wednesday, HMIC said the force had made some improvements in relation to how it recognised and responded to CSE and had introduced additional vulnerability training for all frontline staff. Wendy Williams, of HMIC, said: “Following our second inspection, it was clear that Devon and Cornwall police is committed to improving how it protects children. We found examples of good practice in how it recognises and responds to child sexual exploitation, and its risk assessment of vulnerable children. “However, the force still faces challenges which it must overcome to ensure children are protected in all areas. We found delays to child protection investigations, as well as delays in responding to cases where children were at risk of sexual exploitation. These delays can result in children being at risk of significant harm, and need to be addressed promptly.” Det Sup Keith Perkin, head of public protection, said: “We are pleased that the HMIC has recognised clearly in their report our commitment to improving how we protect children, and that they are encouraged by the progress the force has made since they first visited us in 2015. “There are always areas to focus on and the report gives us clear direction on how we can further protect children; the good news is much of that work has already started. “We have provided training to over 2,000 frontline staff and continue to train more to ensure that the force can effectively respond to and investigate child protection concerns. We have also invited 50 officers into a central safeguarding team who will focus on and improve our assessment of risk to children; we also work closely with youth agency forums across the force to help us effectively intervene, sooner. “Devon and Cornwall police have also agreed upon a new protocol which directly deals with children when it is necessary to keep them in custody after they have committed an offence; this new protocol will see us work with local partners to ensure these children are placed in appropriate accommodation wherever possible.” Perkin added: “Whilst this report is largely positive and we are already implementing a number of the recommendations made by HMIC, we are fully aware that there is more to do.”"

Jack Pullen was in the river Etherow when he got into difficulty on Tuesday afternoon. Greater Manchester police (GMP) said they had recovered the body of the Longdendale high school pupil from the river in the village of Broadbottom, Tameside, shortly before 5.45pm. Officers said that while the river appeared shallow and calm there might have been strong undercurrents and hidden hazards beneath the surface. Greater Manchester police are investigating reports that the youngster became trapped between a bridge and a log. Throughout the morning heartbroken family members and friends paid tribute to Pullen, who recently completed his final year at school. Flowers were placed near the scene with one message saying: “Jack I hope you rest in peace mate. Sleep tight xxx.” Friends also posted comments on social media. Bethany Roters posted a photograph shortly after his death with the message: “Rip to one of my gorgeous best friends!! Can’t believe your (sic) gone I’ll never come to terms with This!! “You always cheered me up and put a smile on my face. I am gutted it doesn’t seem real. Can’t believe we spoke this morning and now this happened just can’t stop crying. I’ll never forget you. Love you so much Jack Pullen.” This morning she posted: “My angel. Love you loads babe!!” Lizzie Dawn posted: “Gone far to soon such a sad time for everyone who knows Jack. I can’t imagine how the family are feeling. My heart goes out to them all he was a sweet and caring young lad. “RIP Jack Pullen.” Jake Arrowsmith posted on Facebook: “RIP Jack Pullen. So sad what happened. It’s not fair that you have been taken away from your loved ones and your life.” Another friend wrote: “This is so surreal! I love you lots mate, rest in paradise.” Police helicopters were spotted above the scene near Broadbottom Road, about three miles east of Hyde, on Tuesday evening. GMP officers and Derbyshire constabulary attended the scene along with the fire service and paramedics. GMP’s underwater search unit was also deployed. DI Andy Sandiford said: “We have launched an investigation into this tragic incident, which appears to have begun with a group of friends playing in the river on a hot summer’s day. “A team of detectives are investigating the incident and have concluded that there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the boy’s death. “The family of the boy are being supported by specially trained officers during this difficult time.” No one else was taken to hospital. The coroner’s office confirmed an investigation is being held into his death and an inquest will be taking place."
2016-07-20T10:53:55Z,uk-news,UK news,"Leeds council leader warns that 2,000 jobs are at risk","Sajid Javid, the new communities secretary, has been urged to reverse major cuts to town hall budgets after Leeds city council warned that 2,000 jobs could be axed in an attempt to balance the books. Judith Blake, the council leader, said up to 15% of its workforce face redundancy in the next four years as the city strives to save £400m. In a strong statement before a crucial cabinet meeting next week, Blake urged Theresa May and Javid to “consider a change of direction in relation to deficit reduction and potential future funding for local government”. Councils across England have been forced to make severe cuts since 2010, when grant funding for local authorities was cut by a fifth – more than twice the level of cuts to the rest of the UK public sector.
In Leeds, government funding will have been cut by £214m between 2010 and the end of the current financial year. Increased demand on services means the council will have had to deliver a total saving of about £400m by March 2017, Blake said. In a warning that more services will be cut, Leeds council bosses suggested residents could pick up litter to help reduce the demand on street cleaning. Residents were also advised to check on elderly neighbours to free up social workers. Blake said: “We look forward with interest to what direction the new government takes in the autumn statement in relation to deficit reduction and its impact on funding for vital public services. “However, the current grant settlement as it stands means it will be incredibly difficult to continue to protect those services. That said, as a council we will do all we can to minimise the effect of the cuts on vulnerable people as well as on our own workforce.” The council said it would review all services to see where savings could be made and that up to 2,000 jobs would need to be shed in the next four years. Blake added: “Our aim is for Leeds to remain a caring and compassionate city built on a strong economy focused on tackling inequality and promoting opportunity for all. “This remains a massive challenge given our projected financial position up to 2020, which is why were are in the process of reviewing our services and senior management arrangements, looking for ways to make income or reduce costs.” A breakdown by the FT of council spending over the past five years revealed that local government services are creaking under the weight of growing demand as local authority budgets have been cut by £18bn in real terms since 2010 – with at least another £9.5bn expected by the end of the decade."

2016-07-20T11:27:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Birmingham wall collapse: inquiry looking into criminal liability,"Detectives are continuing to investigate whether there is any criminal liability for the collapse of a wall at a recycling plant in Birmingham that crushed five workers to death, a coroner has heard. A team of 20 detectives is piecing together what happened when the men were buried under several tonnes of rubble at Hawkeswood Metal Recycling on the morning of 7 July. Inquests for the dead, four of whom were from the Gambia and one from Senegal, were opened and adjourned at Birmingham coroner’s court on Wednesday. The detective leading a joint police and Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigation gave an update on the “complexities” of the inquiry and said: “It’s an investigation to establish where there is criminal liability.” The senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, Louise Hunt, said the investigation would take some time to conclude and adjourned the inquest. DI Harry Harrison, of West Midlands police, told the coroner the recycling plant, which has been sealed off since the incident, could be handed back to Hawkeswood Metal as early as Thursday.
Harrison said: “Documentation has been seized from the company offices and statements taken from those on site at the time. Liaison with the Crown Prosecution Service [CPS] has commenced.” It is believed all five men lived in Spain before moving to Britain and that all were married with children. They came separately to Birmingham, going on to work at Hawkeswood Metal through an external agency. A sixth man suffered a broken leg but managed to pull himself free after tonnes of metal and concrete fell on the crew. The identities of the dead men were taken from fingerprint records held with passport details by immigration authorities in Spain. The Senegalese man was identified as Ousmane Kaba Diaby, 39; the other men were identified as Almano Kinteh Jammeh, 45; Bangally Tunkara Dukaray, 55; Saib Sumbundu Sillah, 42; and Mahamadou Jagana Jagana, 49. It took two days for emergency crews to safely remove the rubble and recover the victims’ remains. Tributes flooded in for the men from their families, friends and members of Birmingham’s 10,000-strong Gambian community. West Midlands police and HSE officials are investigating what caused the structure – made up of several 1.5-tonne blocks – to collapse on the men. Detectives are expected to question the owners of the recycling site amid concerns about its health and safety record. In February, there was a large fire at the 700-tonne scrap metal recycling plant. In April 2010, the firm was fined £50,000 for breaching health and safety regulations after a worker’s arm was broken when it got trapped in a piece of machinery."

Witnesses said a caravan at the park near Blackpool was taped off by police on Monday evening and officers remained at the scene until Tuesday morning. The girl was treated by paramedics before being taken to Blackpool Victoria hospital, where she died, said a spokeswoman for Lancashire police. Officers are treating the child’s death as unexplained and are awaiting results from a postmortem to establish the cause of death. The ambulance service was contacted at about 9.40pm on Monday, after the young girl was reported to be unresponsive, at the Cala Gran holiday park in Fleetwood, Lancashire. A spokesperson for Lancashire police said: “The ambulance service contacted police after a 12-year-old girl was found unresponsive at the scene by paramedics. The girl was taken to Blackpool Victoria hospital for treatment but sadly died a short time later.” No arrests have been made.

2016-07-20T15:09:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Murder inquiry launched after three deaths at Aberdeen tower block,"A man and a woman have been found murdered after police were called to a disturbance at a tower block in Aberdeen, which also resulted in the death of a second man who is believed to have fallen from a balcony after emergency services attended the scene. Police confirmed they are investigating reports that one of the men fell to his death from a balcony of the 19-storey Donside Court flats in the Tillydrone area, north of the city centre. The police investigations and review commissioner has been asked to review the circumstances, as officers were present at the time the man died. Neighbours reported that dozens of officers attended the scene after emergency services were called to reports of a disturbance in a flat at about 8.15pm on Tuesday. A blue forensics tent has been erected inside a police cordon at the foot of the building, close to the main entrance. Neighbour Susan Smith told BBC Scotland that police had initially gone up to the flat carrying what looked like a battering ram. “There were loads and loads of police cars. I’ve never seen so many police cars. Four ambulance vans,” she said. “They took a lassie out and they were still trying to give the guy CPR. Then they put a tent up and the next thing forensics arrived. The police actually went in with a great thing like a battering ram at one point. Then they went in with stretchers and a chair thing – and came out with them empty.” DCI Keith Hardie from the major investigation team said: “We have launched a thorough investigation to establish the full circumstances of what happened last night. “Officers attended at Donside Court following reports of a disturbance and found the bodies of a man and a woman within a flat. Both of these deaths are being investigated and treated as murder. “At this stage, we can also confirm that a second man died at the scene a short time after officers attended. The circumstances of this death are likewise being investigated. Given that officers were present at the time of the death, the procurator fiscal has instructed the police investigations and review commissioner to review the circumstances. “I would like to reiterate that at this stage we are not looking for anyone else in relation to these deaths and I would like to reassure the public that this is a contained incident and there is no wider threat to the community. There will continue to be a police presence in the area as we continue with our investigation into this incident and I want to thank the community for their patience.”"
2016-07-20T15:22:53Z,uk-news,UK news,"British strawberries could be wiped out by Brexit, farming leaders warn","The quintessentially British strawberries and cream synonymous with events such as Wimbledon and Glyndebourne could be lost from the traditional summer fare because of Brexit, farming leaders have warned. Suppliers of native crops – including cucumbers, apples, raspberries and blackberries – could go out of business because of potential bans on EU migrant workers. The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) is seeking an urgent meeting with the Brexit minister, David Davis, to discuss special measures for migrant seasonal workers while the industry body British Summer Fruits (BSF) has warned that unless the government finds a way to keep migrants growers will sell up and move to France or elsewhere in the EU.
The £1.2bn industry relies virtually 100% on workers from Europe because British workers “do not want to get up at 6am and work on their hands and knees all day”, said Laurence Olins, chairman of BSF. “It would be a total disaster if British strawberries and other berries disappeared, but that is what is at stake,” Olins said. Ali Capper, the NFU’s horticulture board chairwoman, has asked for an urgent meeting with Davis, to discuss a special visa system for foreign migrants working on farms. A shortage of migrant workers in 2007-08 resulted in crops being unharvested, jeopardising the businesses of suppliers to supermarkets, hotels and restaurants. “I don’t think this time we will see crops left to rot. Farmers will make a decision not to grow them or to move,” said Capper. Previously, a government seasonal agricultural workers scheme (Saws) allowed Romanian and Bulgarian migrants to work on farms for up to six months at a time, but this expired following the two countries’ full accession to the EU. In a letter to Davis, Capper said labour shortages were an immediate challenge as there had been increasing difficulty recruiting British workers to farms, whether it was during the harvest season or for permanent positions. “Non-UK workers are vital to my business and my industry,” Capper wrote, telling Davis that farmers can plan their crops up to 10 years in advance.
An apple farmer, Capper said she was currently planning on taking out one of her orchards next year and replenishing it with new tree stock but cannot do that unless she is absolutely confident she can get the workers to pick the fruit. “Farmers plan three to five to 10 years in advance; they are planning ordering plants now for 2017 and beyond and can’t do that unless there is certainty,” she said. It would be a castastrophe if there were no longer British strawberries or apples on the shelf, she said. Olins said most fruit in supermarkets was foreign 10 or 15 years ago, but the industry had made huge strides and now 100% of strawberries, raspberries and blackberries were British between May and October. “We are self-sufficient in fruit. Why would we want to turn the clock back 10 or 15 years? British consumers have demonstrated they want a union jack on their berries. This is a £1.2bn industry. Berries are the most popular fruit in the UK now. We represent 20% of the sector – we are not a minor industry,” said Olins. He said berry farmers would not switch to potatoes or another crop harvestable by machine but would sell up and move elsewhere in Europe. “They are specialists.”
An estimated 30,000 EU workers come to Britain every year for the harvest season, and this migration is typical of the sector across the world. “All first-world economies employ foreigners to pick, pack and plant fruit. This is not unique. Canada, Australia even Spain employs migrants because their own citizens don’t want to do the work,” said Olins. “There is an absolute requirement that the government has some sort of solution in place for seasonal work. It’s not just horticulture, it’s the care sector, hospitality sector and so many other places that are dependent on migrant workers,” said Rob Orme, chief executive of Concordia, a charity that recruits EU migrants for farm work. “We cannot produce affordable food without a workforce that’s happy to handpick in the field or orchard,” he said."
2016-07-20T15:52:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Crucial fleet of global-combat frigates is indefinitely delayed,"A new fleet of frigates, described as “global combat ships” designed to play crucial roles, has been delayed indefinitely, the Ministry of Defence has said in testy exchanges with MPs over huge financial and technical problems facing the navy’s surface vessels. Delays in building the Type 26 frigates – a project promised by David Cameron before the 2014 Scottish independence referendum – is threatening shipbuilding jobs on the Clyde in Scotland. The project’s problems come on top of serious mechanical failures in the navy’s new fleet of Type 45 destroyers. Key tasks of the navy’s frigates and destroyers include protecting two new large aircraft carriers now being assembled in Rosyth as well as Trident nuclear weapons submarines approaching and leaving their base on the Clyde.
“I can’t give you a time or a date,” Tony Douglas, the MoD’s top official responsible for military equipment, said on Wednesday after he was asked by MPs on the Commons defence committee when the frigate design would be approved. “It could be next year.” Harriett Baldwin, a new junior defence minister, told the MPs: “We do not know yet.” Douglas added later that the MoD was “now in the heart of negotiations” with BAE Systems, designer and manufacturer of the frigates. The number of planned new frigates has already been cut from 13 to eight, though the MoD has the option to build five smaller and cheaper general-purpose vessels. One of the problems is how to make the frigates as quiet as possible to make it harder for them to be detected by Russian submarines. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, described the delay as a “disgraceful betrayal and a breach of the promise made in the [independence referendum]”.
Admiral Sir Philip Jones, first sea lord and head of the navy, told the MPs that one problem was the cost of designing quiet ships. Asked if the navy could manage with fewer surface ships than the current planned total of 19, he told MPs that it would have to tailor the number to the tasks that could be carried out. His predecessors have described even the 19 figure as “totally inadequate”. Nearly £2bn has been earmarked for the frigate project, Douglas told the committee, which heard there was a £750m gap between the estimated initial cost and the funds that have been been allocated to the project because of defence budget pressures. These pressures are more likely after the Commons on Monday approved the building of four new Trident submarines at an official cost of at least $31bn but which, many experts say, could be significantly higher. Julian Lewis, Conservative chair of the defence committee, warned that delays could lead to more money being spent on the new frigate fleet and on extending the life of the existing Type 23 frigate fleet. He reminded the MoD of previous navy “disasters”, including those involving the Astute class of nuclear-powered submarines. The navy’s new fleet of Type 45 destroyers, which cost £1bn apiece, has also encountered serious and embarrassing mechanical failures. Jones said that although the destroyers were designed for hot climates, their resilience had “degraded catastrophically”, with problems in high summer in the Red Sea and the Gulf.
He said the destroyers could not operate “all of the time, in every place, every day of the year”. But he added that they had provided an “almost continuous presence in the Gulf”. Gary Cook, GMB regional officer and chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, described the news as “an absolute abandonment of responsibility not just to those people who are worried about their jobs but to the security of the nation”. “The Royal Navy is crying out for those frigates, but there doesn’t seem to be any leadership at all at the MoD. They need to find the money and get these ships built for the workers, the Royal Navy and the nation,” he said. Describing how Upper Clyde shipyard workers had faced continual job insecurity since the independence referendum, Cook added: “These workers need some leadership and continuity. How do we tackle the shortfall in terms of work now that these ships have been delayed again? The Westminster government clearly feels that workers in Scottish yards are fair game.” The SNP’s defence spokesman in Westminster, Brendan O’Hara, said that it would be unforgivable if Clyde ship workers had to pay the price for Brexit and spiralling Trident costs. He said: “When I asked about the scale and range of cuts to the defence budget because of Brexit and the huge cost of Trident I got no answer. Today, Harriett Baldwin has given us part of the answer. Her comments about the Type 26 programme will have been no comfort to the workers on the Clyde who now look like they are facing an indefinite delay. “The enormous cost of Trident appears to be spiralling out of control – and it would be completely unacceptable and unforgivable if the Clyde yards had to pay the price for the Tory obsession with Trident, a weapon of mass destruction that 58 of Scotland’s 59 MPs opposed this week and an economic black hole caused by Brexit.’’ A government spokesperson said later: “The UK government is committed to building ships on the Clyde and to the Type 26 programme. Over the next decade, we will spend around £8bn on Royal Navy warships and, because Scotland voted to remain part of the UK in 2014, will continue to be an important manufacturing base for them.” Defence officials added that the £750m gap between the estimated initial cost and the funds that have been been allocated to the frigate programme because of defence budget pressures was identified by an independent expert, not by the MoD."
2016-07-20T16:34:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May appears to drop migration target deadline in first PMQs,"Theresa May appeared to drop a deadline on her target of getting net migration down to the tens of thousands by the time of the next election in 2020, at the end of her prime minister’s questions debut, in which she mocked Jeremy Corbyn over the challenge to his leadership of Labour.
At the end PMQs, May told MPs “it will take some time” to bring net migration to Britain, which stands at 333,000 on the latest figures, down below 100,000. Previously the target had been to cut it to that level by 2020. Although May has talked for some weeks about reducing net migration to “sustainable levels”, that was in the context of an ambition to be achieved by the time of the next general election in 2020. A Conservative rightwing backbencher, Philip Davies, called on her during PMQs to keep her promise to those who voted leave in the referendum to get immigration down to the tens of thousands. May replied: “The vote that was taken in this country on 23 June sent a clear message that people want control of free movement from the European Union. “I also remain firm in my belief that we want to get net migration down to sustainable levels and the government believes that is tens of thousands but it will take some time to get there. But of course we now have an added aspect of controls we can bring in on people from the European Union,.” May made this clear in July last year after the general election, when she told the Commons home affairs select committee: “We have the target of the tens of thousands. It’s the same target. The aim is to meet it by the end of the five-year parliament.” Afterwards, however, May’s spokeswoman reaffirmed her commitment to the Conservatives’ migration target. “The prime minister is absolutely clear that she’s committed to getting immigration down to a sustainable level; in our view that means tens of thousands rather than hundreds of thousands.” She added: “The manifesto stands.” In a performance that walked a fine line between caustic and openly crowing, May exploited divisions within Labour over Trident to thank the 140 Labour MPs “who put the national interest first” by defying Corbyn and voting on Monday to renew the nuclear weapons system.
Amid raucous shouts and cheers from Conservative MPs, May responded to Corbyn’s welcome to her new role by contrasting her status as the Tories’ second female prime minister with Labour’s lack of any woman leader. She added, in sarcastic reference to Corbyn’s poor poll ratings: “I look forward to the exchanges he and I will have – I hope we will be having the exchanges over this dispatch box for many years to come.” Asked by Corbyn about issues including housing, racial injustice and economic insecurity, May also repeatedly referred to her first words outside Downing Street as prime minister, in which she talked about lessening economic and social divides. “It is correct that if you are black you will be treated more harshly in the criminal justice system,” she said in response to one question from Corbyn, while ignoring another section of it that quizzed her about racially insensitive comments by her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. Answering another question about low levels of housebuilding, May said she would head “a government who will be governing for everybody in this country”. May’s most concerted – and clearly pre-scripted – mockery of Corbyn came in response to a question about insecure employment. The prime minister answered with a reference to bad bosses.
“I suspect there are many members on the opposition benches who might be familiar with an unscrupulous boss,” she said, as the cheers and shouts from her MPs rose in volume. “A boss who doesn’t listen to his workers. A boss who requires some of his workers to double their workload. Maybe even a boss who exploits the rules to further his own career. Remind him of anybody?” Corbyn did not rise to the insult, saying, with obvious anger: “We are sent here to represent people. And there are many people in this country struggling with insecure jobs, with low wages.” He continued: “I know this is very funny for all Conservative members, but I don’t suppose that too many Conservative MPs have to go to a food bank in order to supplement their family table every week. I think we should reflect on these things.”"
2016-07-20T17:23:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Is there such a thing as riot weather?,"Temperatures in London this week hit more than 30C. Buses and tubes turned into greenhouses, clothes stuck to skin and tempers frayed. So when a water fight in Hyde Park descended into violence - with three people, including a police officer, stabbed - the news felt as inevitable as it was unwelcome.
From the 1981 riots in Toxteth and Brixton, to those in Oldham in 2001, to the countrywide ones in 2011, hot weather seems to be a catalyst for civil violence. From Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet (“For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring”) to Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing (where violence breaks out on the hottest day of the year), it’s a belief echoed through centuries. But is it true? Psychologist Lance Workman, from the University of South Wales, says there is a relation between rising temperature and civil disturbances. Crime and riots increase between 27C and 32C – but after 32C, “it’s as though people are too hot to bother”. Workman thinks the cause could be both physiological and psychological. Sunshine, he says, leads to an increase of serotonin, sudden boosts of which can lead to increased irritability, while aggression can be caused by frustration and an inability to control things - such as our temperature. Not everyone agrees. Psychologist Chris Cocking, from the University of Brighton, says: “Describing riots in terms of individuals snapping doesn’t explain why crowds get involved.” He points out that riots can occur in winter, as did the Russian revolution. Cocking believes the link between disorder and hot weather is much looser - people are just more likely to congregate outside in hot weather. “When the police do briefings before big demonstrations, they pray for rain because fewer people come out,” he explains. Individual skirmishes can increase when people stay out on summer evenings and drink, but many public summer events are peaceful, and don’t end in attacks on the police. “What is crucial is how the police manage a particular crowd,” he says. “You need a trigger incident - for the police to treat the crowd in a way [that the crowd] perceive to be illegitimate and indiscriminatory.” He says one problem is that most of the public order tactics the police use – for instance kettling – are, by their very nature, indiscriminate. When they invoke public-order tactics, it unites the crowd, because they feel they have been treated as one - and that treatment is illegitimate.” Looking at the events in Hyde Park, for instance, Cocking points out that while the water fight spontaneously began at around 3pm, the disorder erupted hours later. Meanwhile the reports that the crowd were chanting “black lives matter”, he says, highlight a wider social angst - from the deaths of black men and women at the hands of the police in the US, to the distrust of the police in London felt by many in ethnic minority communities. Sometimes, it seems, we make our own weather."

Fazal Hossenbux, 54, was last seen with the two six-year-old boys at 3.30pm on Tuesday at a children’s nursery in the Thornton Heath area. The Metropolitan police said they were concerned because the man suffers from a number of health issues, but did not give further details. They have appealed for help from the public to determine the whereabouts of Hossenbux – who is known to frequent the Southend-on-Sea area – and his sons.
He is described as Asian, 1.67m (5ft 6in), with receding grey hair and a grey beard. His sons are named Farden and Farhan. The police said that Fazal, who is separated from the twins’ mother, had been given permission to pick the boys up from nursery. He was expected to collect them and return them to her home but has vanished with them. Anyone who has seen Hossenbux or his sons, or may have information about their whereabouts, is asked to call the police on 101 or the Missing People helpline on 116 000."
2016-07-20T18:42:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Met puts extra police on patrol to curb spread of London disturbances,"Scotland Yard said on Wednesday that it would put extra officers on the streets as it tried to stop a spread of disturbances that included violent clashes with youths at three events across London. The extra officers would be deployed throughout London after the clashes on Tuesday night amid sweltering summer heat appeared to catch police by surprise. Clashes between officers and hundreds of youths occurred at three separate London locations and police publicly said they wanted information about any further planned disturbances. During Tuesday evening’s trouble, members of the public and a police officer were stabbed, and a supermarket and McDonald’s restaurant were looted. Police said extra officers would be deployed up to the weekend and that no more leave would be allowed to ensure the Met had sufficient officers to quell any disorder. Police are investigating the disturbances on Tuesday at a party in Hyde Park, an unlicensed music event at a Hackney council estate and a water fight in Burgess Park, south London, on the hottest day of the year. All three unlicensed events were promoted on social media. Tuesday night’s trouble is concerning for police chiefs, who are hoping they have learned the lessons after riots in 2011 began in Tottenham, north London. Then, fanned by a lack of understanding on the part of police of the seriousness of the situation, the trouble spread across London and then England. As well as extra officers, the Met by Wednesday afternoon issued pictures of suspects sought in connection with the trouble in and around Hyde Park and said that detectives were trawling through CCTV and video footage shot by its officers and members of the public. Commander Nick Downing appealed for public help for “any information about future plans for such disorder”. He said: “Tonight, we’ve increased the number of police officers on duty, and cancelled any more leave so we keep extra officers out on our streets right through until the weekend.” Later the Met police said a 15-year-old boy was arrested in Burgess Park on Wednesday night on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon, but that there was no disorder similar to the violence on Tuesday evening. There had been a considerable police presence in the park following the stabbing of two teenagers on Tuesday. Downing said the three events on Tuesday were unplanned and that police had acted proportionately but had been faced with violence: “A lovely day in the capital turned violent in Hyde Park, Burgess Park and Stamford Hill last night after spontaneous events turned nasty and people attacked each other and the police. “We put in place a graduated policing response at each site, after talking to the people present failed to stop the situations.”
The violence at Burgess Park also spilled out to a nearby supermarket, where members of a crowd of about 200 people looted goods and two customers were injured. There were reports, too, that a branch of McDonald’s was shut down at Marble Arch, close to Hyde Park. Scotland Yard said it did not think the disturbances at Hyde Park, the Stamford Hill estate in Hackney and at Burgess Park were linked, but they acknowledged the similarities as they urged people to rethink attending unlicensed events. Police said the events at Hyde Park and Stamford Hill were unlicensed music events, while the event at Burgess Park was “a large gathering where people had started fighting”. In a bid to thwart further disturbances, Met chiefs have deployed a multi-pronged strategy. It is hoped extra officers will quickly quell or deter trouble, but they are also political cover in case of fresh violence on the streets, showing that police chiefs had taken the situation seriously. The Met also said its homicide and major crime command was leading the hunt for troublemakers and would use “their resources and expertise to quickly identify, arrest and bring to justice those who committed crime, including grievous bodily harm, robbery, criminal damage and violent disorder”. A third element was a direct appeal to parents and guardians to stop their children going to unlicensed music events. Commander Ben-Julian Harrington said: “If you are a parent and know your child is going out tonight, check that where they are going is safe for them. It’s quite simply not worth the risk to go along to an event that could quickly spiral out of control.” At Hyde Park, about 2,000 people attended an event promoted on social media as “Bashment in the park” – a reference to a form of Jamaican music – although police said it was a “spontaneous water fight”.
Five officers were injured, including one who was stabbed and another who was bottled, while three members of the public were wounded. Initial reports said two members of the public were stabbed but no further details of their identities or condition were provided. The Met said officers came under attack after attempting to stop participants setting up a sound system and the force is reviewing video footage shot from helicopters as well as from CCTV. Witness video has since emerged on social media showing some members of the crowd shouting “black lives matter” as the disorder escalated. Another clip, seen by the Guardian, appears to show a man stabbing another man in the middle of the street. Harrington said: “If you have any footage that may help, or any information, then please get in touch with us.” He added: “What took place wasn’t a group of people out enjoying the sunshine but crime and disorder, which is unacceptable. Officers are out on duty today and we want everyone in London to have a safe and enjoyable day. “If people are going to go to unlicensed or spontaneous events then please think very carefully: they are simply not safe. You do not have the protection of attending a well-organised and safe event. Parents and guardians are urged to think carefully about whether these sorts of events are where you want your children to go.” Police officers remained at Hyde Park until crowds dispersed at approximately 2.20am on Wednesday morning. Mobile phone footage shared on social media showed young people vaulting over the counter of McDonald’s in Marble Arch, as crowds spilled out of neighbouring Hyde Park. Families with children were in the branch as food and drink were looted, and staff were forced to retreat to a back room to wait for police, who were called at 9.15pm, the fast-food chain said.
A McDonald’s spokeswoman said: “I can confirm that our Marble Arch restaurant was closed for a period on the night of 19 July due to customers entering the kitchen area. “Police were contacted by the restaurant team who attended and dealt with the situation, allowing us to reopen shortly after.” As the disorder in Hyde Park continued, about 500 to 600 youths were gathering in Burgess Park, Southwark, to take part in a water fight advertised via social media. Small groups started fighting around 5.45pm, police said, escalating into a “large disturbance” in the park that spilled out into the nearby streets, with a crowd totalling between 1,000 to 1,500 people. Two 16-year-old boys were stabbed. Neither suffered life-threatening injuries, though one remains in hospital. At 8pm, officers were sent to a supermarket on nearby Dunton Road after reports of a group of up to 200 people damaging the store and stealing items. Two female customers suffered minor injuries but did not require medical assistance. In north London, riot police were pelted with bottles and debris as they attempted to break up an illegal music event near Malvern House in Stamford Hill. About 400 revellers attended the block party, obstructing the roads to traffic as sound systems were set up in the street. Police officers spoke to the unlicensed event organisers but the party continued, so Scotland Yard deployed the territorial support group, the force’s specially trained unit for dealing with spontaneous public disorder.
Dramatic images and video emerged on social media showing officers arriving in riot gear with makeshift missiles showering down on them. A statement from the Met said: “Bottles and objects were thrown at police from the crowds in the area. Some officers suffered minor injuries, none required hospital treatment. Three police vans were also damaged.”"
2016-07-20T20:26:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Shami Chakrabarti declines to deny offer of peerage by Labour,"Shami Chakrabarti, who chaired Labour’s independent inquiry into antisemitism, has declined to say whether she was offered a peerage by the party. The former director of human rights group Liberty appeared on the Jewish YouTube channel J-TV to speak about her report, commissioned by Jeremy Corbyn after a spate of antisemitism accusations involving Labour members.
In her interview, Chakrabarti was asked by her interviewer, Alan Mendoza, if she would accept a place in the House of Lords and stumbled over her response, saying: “I don’t know whether I want to talk about my future ambitions at this point.” Mendoza, the founder of the conservative Henry Jackson Society thinktank, asked more directly: “Have you been offered a place in the House of Lords?” Chakrabarti replied: “You can ask the question and I’m going to evade it at this point.” A spokesman for Corbyn said: “We don’t comment on Labour party nominations to public bodies or recommendations for political appointments.” Oliver Anisfeld, the channel’s founder, said Chakrabarti’s refusal to deny that she was offered a peerage “raises certain questions – all she had to do was say ‘no’, assuming she hadn’t, but she was uncomfortable and evasive”. Diane Abbott, the shadow health secretary, said she did not know if Chakrabarti had been offered a peerage, but said her work as a human rights campaigner meant she deserved a seat in the Lords. “I don’t think it would be improper at all, Shami has an incredibly distinguished career, she is just the sort of person who should be going into the Lords,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “If you look at her record at Liberty, and you look at her defence of human rights and civil liberties, she’s exactly the right sort of person.” Asked whether it might look as if Chakrabarti had been offered the peerage while conducting an independent review, Abbott said: “The ‘look of it’, in my opinion, is one of the most distinguished women in public life is going into the Lords, that is entirely appropriate.” In May, Chakrabarti said she had joined the Labour party on the day Corbyn asked her to carry out the review, saying she wanted to have “the trust and confidence not just of the Labour leadership, but of party members. “It is a judgment call, but I thought that was the most honest thing to do – to be clear that I was undertaking this because I do believe in the values of the Labour party and want to see them promoted not just in the Labour party, but in the world.” Chakrabarti’s review found that Labour was not overrun by antisemitism, Islamophobia or other forms of racism, but made several recommendations, including that members should avoid comparisons with Hitler and the Nazis, especially when referring to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She also said epithets such as “Zio” and “Paki” had no place in Labour party discourse. The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it had mixed feelings about the review, saying it had failed to explore the history of the link between the left and anti-Zionist antisemitism, and gave little detail on what anti-racism training for party members and officials might look like. More questions could soon arise for the Labour leader over antisemitism in the party. Jan Royall has told the Guardian she expects to publish her full report of allegations of antisemitism at Oxford University Labour club, and then expand it to look at allegations at other universities. There had been disquiet within Labour and the Jewish student community that the party’s national executive committee only released an executive summary and 11 recommendations."
2016-07-20T20:27:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan seeks Transport for London takeover of Southern,"London’s mayor has urged the government to let Transport for London take control of the troubled Southern rail franchise. Sadiq Khan said passengers were being “held hostage” by continued delays and disruption. Southern has cancelled more than 300 trains a day in the wake of staff shortages, illness and industrial action. It runs services from Victoria and London Bridge to Brighton, Southampton and many other centres in Sussex and Kent. It is part of Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which includes Gatwick Express, Great Northern and Thameslink services.
Khan told the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, that thousands of passengers who could not get to and from work were “understandably furious”. “There is no doubt that the franchise must now be in default, and I have previously called for your department to step in and take control ... I now offer to go one step further and put my senior TfL team in charge of the Southern franchise until we get a permanent resolution,” he wrote in a letter. Manuel Cortes, head of the TSSA rail union, said putting TfL in charge of Southern “would be a fast and efficient way to restore a proper level of service for long-suffering passengers who have been through hell these last few months” . The RMT union general secretary, Mick Cash, said both passengers and staff were being held hostage and called for GTR to be removed. He denied there had been unofficial industrial action by his union’s members. “What there is is a total and abject failure by GTR to recruit enough staff to fill rosters,” he wrote for the Guardian. That problem has been compounded by a chronic shortage of rolling stock, Cash added.
“Technically, GTR doesn’t have a franchise; it has a management contract with the DfT in charge and all the risk carried by the taxpayer. The notion that the government can’t take action to sling Govia out is just nonsense,” he wrote. “It is now down to the government to act, strip GTR of its contract, bring in Directly Operated Railways and end this scandal that shames our country’s transport services.” The rail minister, Paul Maynard, said the RMT was holding passengers to ransom in both England and Scotland with its “completely unacceptable actions”. “The situation with Southern services must improve and I am pleased that it is beginning to reinstate some of the trains suspended to manage the impact of the RMT action,” he said. Caroline Pidgeon, Liberal Democrat transport spokeswoman for the London Assembly, said the answer was removing much of the franchise from Govia and giving it to London Overground to run. Florence Eshalomi, her Labour counterpart, said: “A TfL takeover is a sensible step towards addressing the problems plaguing Southern, which the government have so far been content to kick into the long grass.” There was more misery for rail passengers on Tuesday night when Brighton station was temporarily closed due to overcrowding after signalling and track problems. A Southern spokesman apologised for the delays: “Train services across the whole of the south of England were affected by heat-related infrastructure problems yesterday, with many London terminals also experiencing crowding and delayed trains.”"
2016-07-20T21:25:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan and the battle against bad landlords,"Siân Berry, Green Party member of the London Assembly, is conducting a survey of the growing number of people in the capital who rent accommodation from private landlords - about 2.3 million of them and counting. Berry would like there to be a renters union to help strengthen the hand of tenants coping with poor conditions, insecurity and unreasonable rents. A private renter herself, she says she’s lived in half a dozen different flats and houses since moving to the city, coughing up half her income in the process. Her present landlord seems to lack a decent plumber. Sadiq Khan became London mayor in May pledging to improve London’s burgeoning private rented sector (PRS). His manifesto says he’ll set up a London-wide, not-for-profit lettings agency for the benefit of good landlords and tenants alike, make it easier for boroughs to bring in landlord licensing schemes and name and shame bad landlords online. It also promises he’ll “fight for the mayor and London councils to have a greater say in strengthening renters’ rights over tenancy lengths, rent rises and the quality of accommodation”. How is he getting on so far? At mayor’s question time on Wednesday, Khan said he’d been making his case to government to be given the greater powers he requires, beginning with helping boroughs with licensing. Labour AM Tom Copley, another private renter, drew Khan’s attention to an increase in the number of London children living in temporary accommodation and said that “40% of Londoners who enter temporary accommodation do so because of the end of an assured, short term tenancy”. This, he said, underlined a need for “more stability” for tenants within the PRS, especially in light of the general economic uncertainty resulting from Brexit. He asked: “Is control over tenancy now on the table in terms of devolution?” Khan said, reasonably enough: “Who knows?” He revealed that it hadn’t been on the table of the previous communities secretary, Greg Clark, with whom progress on housing issues in general had been good. Now someone else, Sajid Javid, is in the job. My guess is it won’t be on his table either. Copley then asked Khan about progress with his London Living Rent policy, which would see a new PRS tenure introduced in the capital for some new homes, with rents pegged to one third of average local earnings - a lot lower than the current norm. “A lot of that boils down to the deal we can make with DCLG [Department for Communities and Local Government],” Khan replied. “I’m due to speak to new secretary of state later this week. I hope to meet him shortly.” Copley asked if the London Living Rent policy could be implemented without government co-operation. “Good question,” replied Khan. His answer, in short, was that it could be realised through borough planning agreements right away. Housing market experts have not demurred, telling the Financial Times that incorporating such rent-indexed dwellings within “affordable” obligations wouldn’t be hard. But more such homes could be supplied in London if that deal Khan is seeking to strike with the government is a good one. We’re talking money, we’re talking subsidy. Surprise, surprise. Khan also underlined his wish to “help renters by rooting out the minority of bad landlords who let the whole sector down”. This recognition that most landlords aren’t crooked or inept has not gone unnoticed by the Residential Landlords Association (RLA), whose members have backed his “name and shame” plan. The RLA opposes landlord licensing, arguing that it doesn’t tackle the criminal element and takes up borough time that would be better spent making more effective use of enforcement muscle they already have. The RLA won’t be alone in spotting that new housing minister Gavin Barwell has been a firm critic of licensing. The fact that Barwell, who is the MP for Croydon Central, has also been made minister for London may seem to bode ill for Khan. That said, a commitment to nobbling out-and-out villain landlords is common ground and in line with the more positive provisions of the Housing and Planning Act. RLA policy director David Smith argues that borough officers sometimes don’t fully understand the existing powers at their command, which are quite complex. And, as ever, there’s a shortage of resources. He thinks the mayor could address this by, for example, “seed funding a programme for enhanced enforcement in a couple of boroughs as part of his drive to improve standards”. Smith feels his early interactions with the new City Hall regime have been useful. Siân Berry, meanwhile, says her Big Renters Survey has already collected “some genuine horror stories”. Both could contribute to Khan’s attempts to improve London’s PRS. Building broad alliances is one of the ways London mayors get things done."
2016-07-20T23:01:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Files on Mark Thatcher's dealings in Oman to remain secret for now,"Despite prime ministerial promises about lifting restrictions on the publication of historic documents, large numbers of files have been withheld from the latest releases to the National Archives. Royal and security files; the proceedings of the Profumo inquiry; the Peter Wright “Spycatcher” case; most defence records; Anglo-Irish negotiations; documents on “Mark Thatcher and the Omanis” and Soviet relations have all been retained by Downing Street. The reluctance to make material available to researchers and the public at the National Archives in Kew coincides with the transition from a 30-year to a 20-year release rule introduced by Gordon Brown. The last Labour prime minister had declared in 2007: “It is time to look again at whether historical records can be made available for public inspection much more swiftly than under the current arrangements.” Allowing more recent material to be released may, however, be encouraging the normally retired civil servants who “weed” the files, taking out material still deemed to be excessively sensitive, to adopt a more cautious approach. At the same time release dates of files have become increasingly uncoordinated as Ministry of Defence and Foreign Office documents have been delayed by the need to concentrate on the migrated colonial archives hidden at Hanslope Park in Buckinghamshire. The latest batch of Cabinet Office and Prem (prime minster’s) files mainly cover 1986 to 1988 but many date back further. Among the list of files published by the National Archives, there are 45 containing transcripts of evidence from Lord Denning’s 1963 inquiry into the Profumo affair. They are closed for the somewhat arbitrary period of 84 years and therefore due for release in 2047.
There are also 32 Cabinet Office files on the Peter Wright Spycatcher case from 1986 and 1987, most of which are said to be “temporarily” retained by the department. Files listed as Prime Minister: Cementation contract: Mark Thatcher and the Omanis, Prime Minister: Mark Thatcher and the Omanis: other allegations against Mark Thatcher and Prime Minister: Request by electronic data system to employ Mark Thatcher have all been retained. Also missing from Kew are: Royal Family: Procedures for members of the Royal Family taking up jobs and other commercial appointments; Proposals relating to the papers concerning the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936; Royal Family: Career of Prince Andrew, Duke of York and Visits by the Queen to the security services. Commenting on the Mark Thatcher files, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “A small number of records have been retained because they contain personal data about individuals and sensitive information relating to other countries. This is in line with the requirements of the Public Records Act.” The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, called for the Mark Thatcher files to be released. He said: “Sunlight is the best disinfectant and this decision is ludicrous. If certain sections still compromise national security or foreign relations after all this time, they should be redacted. Given the topic, it seems more likely that this is a move to avoid embarrassment. “There is no legitimate reason for these papers to not be in the public domain and I urge the Cabinet Office to think again.” A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “There’s been no change in policy regarding the files that are being retained. Files are being released more regularly. There is always a small number of files that will be withheld in line with the Public Records Act.” That allows material relating to security and other areas to be retained. Nonetheless, some surprises have come to light through papers released to the National Archives in Kew: • The former Labour prime minister Harold Wilson had proposed visits to the Soviet Union vetoed several times by Thatcher’s administration. In October 1982, Lady Marcia Falkender, his former private secretary, wrote to No 10 asking if he might visit on behalf of the GB-USSR Association, of which he was president. A letter on behalf of the foreign secretary, Francis Pym, discouraged his travel plans on the grounds that it would send a signal that “Britain no longer took so serious a view of [the Soviet] actions in Afghanistan and also of their complicity in the maintenance of martial law in Poland. As you know the government’s policy remains no high level political contacts except where these are deemed particularly advantageous.” Four years later, Wilson ran into different objections when he proposed visiting Russia in late 1986. The Foreign Office informed Downing Street of the plans. The FCO letter objected to the trip because the company involved in hotel construction he was planning to accompany had a poor commercial reputation. The second reason given was that: “Lord Wilson’s own failing memory and increasing tendency (demonstrated during his last visit in 1983) to indulge in irrelevant and repetitive reminiscences … It is rather sad that we should be put in this position which we should much prefer to avoid; but Lord Wilson shows no sign of calling a halt to his overseas travel.” Wilson died of Alzheimer’s disease in 1995.
• Thatcher’s press secretary, Bernard Ingham, advised the lord chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, about the dangers of of allowing the media to talk to judges. Writing in March 1988, he explained: “The issue needs to be handled very carefully indeed because there could scarcely be a worse time for adopting a more liberal approach. The media become more rather than less trivial, sensational, inaccurate and irresponsible. Consequently the attached note is austere. It is, as you will see, based on the belief that judges have far more to lose from familiarity with the media.” • Thatcher expressed concern in one cold war file in 1988 about the dangers to British pilots if Soviet air defences deployed lasers to blind pilots, noting on one memo: “I hope it has by this time found effective protection?” Charles Powell, her foreign affairs adviser, sent her a reassuring memo informing her that work on protective goggles had been going on since 1982 and laser eye protection would soon be available for RAF air crew. • Thatcher’s government nearly broke down because so many ministers went off on their travels during her first summer in power. A memo circulated in May 1980 to senior ministers across Whitehall by Clive Whitmore, the principal private secretary at No 10, mingled entreaties with the firm smack of authority. “Before these [holiday] plans get too advanced,” he cautioned, “the prime minister has asked me to draw her colleagues’ attention to the need to ensure that government business can continue to be discharged efficiently during the recess. “It often proved difficult,” he added, “in the summer and early autumn of last year to hold cabinet or main cabinet committee meetings because so many ministers were away from London.” Whenever ministers left the capital and the journey back took more than an hour and a half, they were required to record their absence and contact details on a form."
2016-07-20T23:01:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Denis Thatcher wrote to BBC over 'disgraceful and libellous' satire,"A satirical story broadcast on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about Margaret Thatcher legalising hard drugs prompted her loyal husband, Denis, to savage the corporation in a furious private letter to the chair of the governors. The prime minister herself took legal advice about the “mini-saga”, entitled Thatcherism: The Final Solution, which was broadcast on Radio 4 in mid-January 1988, and considered whether she should instruct lawyers to sue for defamation, files released to the National Archives in Kew on Thursday reveal.
The item had been written by a listener, Vincent Hill, in a competition for mini-sagas – stories composed in no more than 50 words. In an exaggerated parody of Tory free-market economics, he imagined the political consequences of a libertarian approach to heroin. The compressed story read: “Ingenious: Individual choice must be paramount. With growing confidence she legalised hard drugs. Prices fell sharply. Legitimate outlets replaced bankrupt drug syndicates. Crime figures plunged. Crematorium shares surged. City populations thinned as the weak spirited succumbed. Unemployment vanished. Only the worthiest survived. Nobody could complain. The unfit died of freedom.” Thatcher’s principal private secretary, Nigel Wicks, wrote to the law officers’ department seeking advice. He asked whether the tale was defamatory. “It is not the prime minister’s normal practice, or indeed wish, to send solicitors’ letters to media organisations which issue statements which defame her,” he explained. “But I wonder whether this item might not be an exception to the PM’s normal practice?” Thatcher’s office was told by the law officers’ department at the Royal Courts of Justice that the story was indeed libellous. The offending passages included: “The Final Solution”, in its inherent connotation; “the unfit died of freedom”, with its innuendo of intention to secure the death of the “unfit”; “crematorium shares surged”, which was said to be “particularly revolting … in its innuendo that this was a consequence desired by the prime minister” ; and “She legalised hard drugs”, which “personalises her as the target for the sting and not mere Thatcherism”. The prime minister evidently decided not to pursue legal action. Her private secretary recorded that she did not want to consult lawyers who specialised in defamation. But the matter did not end there. On 18 January, her husband, using his own 10 Downing Street stationery, dispatched a sternly worded letter to Marmaduke Hussey, who was chairman of the BBC’s board of governors. “Dear Duke,” Mr Thatcher wrote. “With deference may I ask you to study the enclosed manuscript (extract) of the Radio 4 Today programme. The extent and depth of political bias in the BBC is a matter of opinion, but this is a disgrace by any standard, however low. “I cannot believe that the management of a public broadcasting system can continue to employ a producer who publishes so foul and deliberate an untruth against anyone or on such a subject. Surely such gross professional misconduct can neither be excused or condoned?” He signed it: “Regards to you both, Yours ever, Denis.” Denis Thatcher, who was normally careful to keep out of public affairs, rarely appears in the prime ministerial files. Wicks, the private secretary, however, noted that Mr Thatcher had crossed Hussey’s name off a guest list for a public reception a few days later. The civil servant suggested that Hussey should be invited so that the prime minster could talk to him about the “disgraceful” episode. “You could then have a quiet word with him about the mini-saga after the reception,” he suggested. But the note was returned with a comment from Denis, explaining his action. “I only crossed out [his name] because I did not think a general reception is (a) suitable for Duke [because he used a stick and might have had difficulty standing for a long time] (b) important enough. I did discuss with PM.” Denis Thatcher explained that he had already privately written to Hussey. “Never in the history of public broadcasting,” he added, “has so foul a libel been published against ANYONE let alone a prime minister.”"
2016-07-21T04:30:36Z,uk-news,UK news,"The coronation of King George IV â€“ archive, 21 July 1821","Ever since the public meeting held on the 27th of June, to consider of the proceedings to be adopted in Manchester, for celebrating the Coronation of his Majesty George the Fourth, the Committee have been indefatigable in their exertions to complete the arrangements necessary for giving to the day a high degree of interest and importance. On Monday the oxen and sheep designed for distribution amongst the populace, having been decorated with ribbons, were paraded through the principal streets of the town. They appeared to be very fine cattle; but this exhibition of them seemed to be regarded with considerable distaste. It was not possible to avoid thinking how soon the poor animals were to be slaughtered; and the seeing of them decorated for death like the victims of old for the altar, presented to many minds the carnivorous propensities of our race, under circumstances of more than ordinary repulsiveness. On Wednesday morning, preparations for the approaching gala day commenced in every quarter. On the outskirts of the town, in fact, whatever opportunity presented itself, from the Crescent in Salford to Ardwick Green, stands and stages were erecting for the accommodation of spectators. We were quite surprised to see the number of these, and looked with considerable dread at the slight construction of many of them. It appeared, however, that they had excited the attention of our municipal officers, and that proper persons were appointed to take care that they were effectually secured. At the New Market, in Shudehill, at Camp Field, and at the Salford Cross, men were busily engaged in putting up the grates where the oxen and sheep were to be roasted, whilst others were busily employed in spitting the animals, and disposing the ale for distribution. In various quarters of the town, the innkeepers and publicans were exhibiting sheep, which they purposed roasting on the following day, whether for their own benefit, or that of their customers, it is not for us to decide. Some of these exhibitions were worth notice, for the ludicrous incongruity of the devices by which they were accompanied. One publican hung out, at a three story window, a black-faced sheep, with its horns gilded – a tobacco pipe, and a silver tankard in its mouth.
It was at midnight, for the clock had but just struck twelve, when the celebration of the day commenced by the firing of cannon; and the cheers of some nocturnal revellers were echoed far amid the silence of the hour. The bells presently struck up a merry peal, and, with the cannon, which were continually discharged, served as larums to rouse our immense population to prepare for the enjoyments of the day. At a very few minutes past six, the children of the different charity schools, attended by their teachers and friends of the institution, and those of the Established church by a number of the clergy, began to assemble in St. Ann’s Square. Precisely at half past seven they set out for Ardwick. The children entered the Green and were arranged within the rails, on the margin of the canal, in the order which they had held in the procession. The girls of the different schools, or interests, preceded the boys throughout. When they had all taken their stations, the children gave several cheers, the effect produced by which was novel and interesting. They then sang in very good style and with great effect, the song of “God save the King;” after which, they returned to their respective School Rooms, where refreshments were given to them. We have seldom witnessed a scene which gave us so much pleasure, as that which we have now been faintly attempting to describe. The immense number of the more humble class of our fellow subjects in this vicinity, who are receiving from the care and charity of their wealthy and benevolent neighbours, a valuable and well grounded education – the important moral advantages which this education involves – the cleanly appearance of the dress, both of boys and girls, but particularly of the latter – and their quiet and orderly demeanour – all these together gave birth to a train of reflections, and hopes of a most gratifying and animating character. He, indeed, who could look upon such a scene without emotion, must have been more or less than man. The Guardian – founded two months previously and running to only four pages – covered George IV’s coronation in London and Manchester’s grand procession, and bemoaned the ‘disgraceful scenes’ that followed the distribution of meat and beer."
2016-07-21T05:00:00Z,uk-news,UK news,"Garden bridge may need taxpayer bailout once built, report says","London’s planned garden bridge could end up reliant on public money to cover running costs once built because its proposed business plan is wildly optimistic and riddled with untested assumptions, according to an expert report on the project. Dan Anderson, who runs a consultancy that advises tourist attractions and similar destinations, said the business plan for the proposed 367-metre link across the Thames was possibly the least robust he had seen in 20 years in the industry. “I’ve never seen one that is so obviously weak,” said Anderson, of the Fourth Street consultancy. Most such projects normally needed lottery funding and thus had their business plans scrutinised, he said. “This one just seems to have sailed through with very little challenge.” The Thomas Heatherwick-designed structure, to run between Temple on the north side of the river and the South Bank, is forecast to cost £175m. Of this, £60m will come from public money – half from the Department for Transport and half from Transport for London.
The project received heavy backing from Boris Johnson as London mayor, but his Labour successor, Sadiq Khan, has since pledged that no more public money will go to the bridge and last week halted some existing spending ahead of a review. But Anderson, a critic of the bridge who undertook the 44-page report without being commissioned, said Khan’s pledge was likely to be unrealistic. Anderson’s analysis of the business plan produced in March by the Garden Bridge Trust calculates that although the trust predicts a £232,000 net profit in the first year of operation, a more realistic outcome is a £165,000 loss. A more gloomy set of assumptions brings a projected loss for the year of nearly £1m. A predicted near-£500,000 profit in year five is more likely to be a small loss, the report says. Anderson argues that much of the trust’s projected income from donations is based on models taken from museums and galleries, whereas the bridge is billed as primarily a transport link for pedestrians – 65% of users are forecast to be regular commuters unlikely to use voluntary contactless donation points. “Simply making this key adjustment reduces projected income by some £200,000 per annum,” Anderson writes. Similarly, he argues that projections for fundraising and sponsorship include “virtually no explanation of what the Garden Bridge Trust will do to raise these funds”. Museums and palaces can offer donors discounted admission, or entry to areas otherwise closed to the public, but the garden bridge will be open to the public and thus has little scope for offering extras.
As an example of the seemingly fuzzy approach to finance, Anderson notes that income from contactless donations was initially overestimated by £175,000 because the wrong projection for visitor numbers was used. The mistake was corrected in a later version of the business plan, but the shortfall was simply made up by increasing projected sponsorship income, something Anderson called “typical of a target-driven business plan that is insufficiently supported by relevant research”. The report notes that the business plan also fails to consider costs from £20m of the TfL money, which has been turned into a long-term loan. Although the loan is exempt from interest for five years, it does feature an inflation index of up to 2% a year, which is not fully accounted for. The business plan was so flawed, Anderson told the Guardian, that he assumed the trust was largely working on the assumption that it would be bailed out by the taxpayer if needed. So keen was the trust to get the bridge built, he said, that it had abandoned possible funding methods in order to placate critics – for example, by giving away commercial revenues from the south landing of the bridge to the housing trust that has the lease on the relevant land. “At every stage they took the path of least resistance, and the consequence was they made a sequence of decisions that effectively gave away all of the downstream commercial potential,” Anderson said. “It just feels like they’re not interested in the operational viability. It’s very short-term. The primary objective is get it built, and the future will sort itself out.” A spokeswoman for the Garden Bridge Trust said that the organisation believed it had a “clear and robust business plan”, adding that the March version was a draft that would be revised, partly because Khan reduced the number of days per year the bridge could be closed for corporate events. “The revised plan will be subject to scrutiny by Lambeth and Westminster councils and the mayor’s office,” she said. “The report forms part of the planning conditions requiring approval before construction can start. “The trust fundamentally believes that the garden bridge is for Londoners and for everyone, and therefore it would not be right to charge people to cross the bridge.”"
2016-07-21T08:41:32Z,uk-news,UK news,MoD faces questions over soldier's death after Brecon Beacons exercise,"The Ministry of Defence is again under scrutiny over how it keeps personnel safe in very hot weather following the death of a “superfit” young soldier who took part in a march near where three men died from heat illness during a previous SAS selection exercise. Cpl Joshua Hoole, 26, a member of the Rifles infantry regiment and a veteran of two tours of Afghanistan, had just finished an eight-mile test march in the Brecon Beacons in south Wales on the hottest day of the year when he collapsed and died. Police officers, the Health and Safety Executive and the military are involved in investigations to find out why Hoole, who was due to marry his long-term girlfriend later this year, fell ill. The incident on Tuesday has worrying echoes of the July 2013 tragedy in which three SAS candidates died following a gruelling test in searing heat.
The MoD was strongly criticised by the men’s families and the coroner at their inquest for failing to understand the danger that extreme heat can pose, and the government promised that lessons had been learned. Families of the SAS candidates on Wednesday expressed concern and sorrow at Hoole’s death. Bryher Dunsby, whose husband, Cpl James Dunsby, was one of those who died three years ago, said: “I would like to offer my heartfelt condolences and my love to Joshua’s fiancee, family and friends following another tragic death in training at Brecon.” In a statement released to the Guardian, she said: “I sincerely hope that all the inquiries into this incident are conducted promptly, with truth, integrity and total transparency by the MoD.” John Craig, Hoole’s grandfather, said the MoD had so far given the family very little sense of how he died, but that he suspected dehydration and exhaustion must have been involved. Craig, who explained how Hoole came from a line of soldiers, told the Guardian: “I know what the Brecon Beacons are like because I worked as an instructor there in the 1950s. It’s very rugged terrain and yesterday you had the heat of the day at six in the morning.“I served, and his father was a sergeant major in the Devon and Dorset regiment. Josh was twice in Afghanistan and also in Iraq with the Special Boat Service,” Craig said. “He was a beautiful grandson. He was a dedicated soldier. He always wanted to be top dog. He was a superfit boy.” If it turns out that heat was involved in Hoole’s death, it will focus attention on what the MoD has done since the three SAS candidates collapsed on and around Pen-y-Fan, the highest peak in southern Britain, which rises high above the town of Brecon. Madeleine Moon, a member of the defence select committee, said it would be calling in MoD chiefs to question them on what changes had been made. “How did this happen on yet again the hottest day of the year?” she said. “They’ve got to be as transparent as possible. They are going to have to give some sort of explanation to the public.” The MoD has said it is too early to say exactly what caused Hoole’s death. It is known that he was one of about 20 soldiers who took part in an eight-mile march on lanes around the school of infantry in Brecon. They left at 7am – at which time the temperature in the area was 17.6C. They returned at 9am, by which it had risen to 22.3C. Each soldier was dressed in full army combat clothing and boots and they were carrying 25kg rucksacks – but the march was not seen as a difficult one and did not involve severe climbs. The soldiers carried water and there were water stations along the route.
The exercise was organised by Hoole’s own regiment to make sure he and other candidates were fit enough to take part in a demanding platoon sergeants’ battle course, which is run by the school of infantry. An army source compared the march to an MOT – an annual test to make sure soldiers had a basic level of fitness. The SAS exercise is much more gruelling and soldiers do it individually. Hoole and his colleagues did the march as a squad and it was completed within the stipulated two hours. On their return to the school of infantry, Hoole collapsed. Civilian paramedics were called shortly before 9am but could not save him. Hoole’s stepmother, Carol Jeffreys, wrote on Facebook: “Rest easy soldier. My beautiful stepson. Can’t believe it. Will always love you. So very proud of you. Thoughts with your family and fiancee. RIP Josh.” The defence minister Mike Penning said: “The safety of our personnel is our absolute priority and, while deaths in training are rare, any death is a tragedy. “As well as a police investigation, a service inquiry will take place. My thoughts and prayers are with the soldier’s family, friends, and colleagues at this difficult time.” The Tory MP Johnny Mercer, a member of the defence select committee and a former army officer, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday: “It is a tragedy for the young man and for the family, but there is no indication that this has any similarities with the 2013 [incident] at this stage. “The details that have been released [show] this march took place in the morning, the temperature was nothing like the temperature at the time of the 2013 incident. This was a regular combat fitness test, something that soldiers will do regularly. We need to let the professionals find out what happened and see what lessons can be learned. “Train hard, fight easy is the motto and we do train hard. But deaths in training are not acceptable and we need to look after our people.” In July 2013 three reservists, Dunsby and L/Cpls Edward Maher and Craig Roberts, died after an SAS test march. The coroner who heard their inquest, Louise Hunt, said a “catalogue of very serious mistakes” were made. The MoD was given the maximum sanction possible – a crown censure – and only escaped prosecution by the HSE because it has crown immunity."
2016-07-21T12:29:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Same-sex marriage to become legal from Friday in Isle of Man,"Same-sex couples will be able to marry in the Isle of Man, 24 years after gay sex was decriminalised on the island. A new law from Friday will also allow heterosexual couples to have civil partnerships instead of marriages if they prefer. The Isle of Man’s marriage (same sex couples) bill 2016 was promoted by Allan Bell, the island’s chief minister, who has been in a gay relationship for over 20 years. “This has been a long, long journey,” Bell, 69, told the Guardian this week. “This bill gives equal validity to relationships between same-sex couples as heterosexual ones and proves that the love of two people will overcome everything.”
Bell said he had no plans to marry his partner imminently but that he hoped there would be a queue outside the register office on Friday, as well as religious institutions not exempt from the act. Church of England ministers do not have to marry gay couples under the new law. The island’s bishop, who sits in the Manx parliament’s upper chamber, was one of a handful of representatives to oppose equal marriage. The bill was welcomed by the island’s LGBT community, including Alan Shea, who in 1991 caused outrage on the island by dressing as a concentration camp inmate on an important national holiday to draw parallels with Nazi persecution of homosexuals. One man called him a “bum blaster” on camera during the stunt on Tynwald Day, while soldiers could be heard hissing at him en masse. At that point, anyone caught having gay sex faced life in prison. Shea said he was delighted, if surprised, at the new law. “I’m still in shock that it’s come through,” he said. “I never thought it would actually happen, when you think how things were just 25 years ago, when you consider the hatred and bigotry we used to face.” Bell was one of a number of politicians who faced insults in the House of Keys, the directly elected lower branch of Tynwald, the parliament of the Isle of Man, when arguing for decriminalisation of homosexuality. In one particularly fraught session a politician said that to legalise gay sex would “lead to a charter for wimps and perverts to further infect society”. Shea and his partner, Stephen Moore, entered into a civil partnership four years ago. They plan to swap it for a marriage in the new year. “We’ll let the younger ones who haven’t already got a civil partnership go first,” he said. Shea’s concentration camp costume (actually striped pyjamas from Marks & Spencer) is now in the Manx museum. Moore said Bell deserved enormous credit for advocating gay rights throughout his 30-year political career, but said: “Politicians may have been persuaded but the battle for hearts and minds goes on.” The bill was passed in April by the Tynwald, the Isle of Man’s parliament, but needed to be rubber-stamped via the Queen. Although the Isle of Man is not part of the United Kingdom, it is a crown dependency, so the reigning monarch must still grant royal assent via the privy council. The Queen granted the bill royal assent last Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the privy council said on Monday. A few formalities must then be completed in order for the new act to come into force on Friday. The new law was welcomed by the human rights advocate Peter Tatchell, who last year lobbied the Isle of Man chief minister to legislate equality in civil marriage and civil partnership law. “Congratulations and thanks to the people and government of the Isle of Man. Their new legislation is even more progressive than the UK. Instead of segregated marriage laws for gay and straight couples, they have a single civil marriage law that applies to everyone regardless of sexual orientation,” he said. “The Isle of Man has also opened up civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples; in contrast to the ban that exists in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. These changes catapult the Isle of Man to the forefront of legal equality for straight and gay couples.”"
2016-07-21T15:13:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Thatcher files show how Iran's shah was denied UK asylum,"Newly released documents by the National Archives in Kew have shed more light on Margaret Thatcher’s decision to deny the deposed shah of Iran asylum in the UK following Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution. In 2009 it was revealed that Britain had secretly dispatched an emissary to the Bahamas to relay a message to the shah, then living in exile with his family on the Caribbean casino resort of Paradise Island, that the UK was not prepared to give him sanctuary for fear of reprisals against its existing diplomats in Tehran. The newly released files, including secret communiques to and from No 10 Downing Street, reveal that the prime minister was supposedly so worried about the safety of British diplomats in Tehran that she wrote personally to a prominent barrister dissuading him from accepting the role of representing the shah.
The documents also show that Sir Denis Wright, an earlier UK ambassador to Iran, who had gone to the Bahamas under a pseudonym to avoid media attention, wrote a secret telegram to Thatcher’s office, saying: “Shah’s Iranian retinue now seems reduced to a handful of guards and/or servants plus a European nanny. There were black servants in the house.” More than 35 years after Iran’s Islamic revolution, details about much of what happened during and after those turbulent events remain hidden away, but unclassified documents released by the UK and the US in recent years have shown how quickly the west’s support for the shah – whose full name was Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi – faded away soon after the victory of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. In June, a row erupted in Iran over BBC Persian’s reporting of newly declassified US diplomatic cables that revealed extensive contact between Khomeini and the Carter administration weeks before the revolution. Khomeini returned to Tehran on 1 February 1979, two weeks after the shah fled Iran. The shah subsequently lived in exile, first in Egypt and then Morocco, and then a string of other countries including the US, Mexico and Panama. He died of cancer in Cairo in July 1980.
The new files show that the shah had wanted to stay in the UK for his children’s education. His request was firmly rejected by Thatcher, despite Britain’s earlier efforts at helping him, including facilitating his surreptitious passage from Morocco to the Bahamas. “The prime minister made it clear that she was deeply unhappy about the government’s inability to offer sanctuary to a ruler who had, in her view, been a firm and helpful friend to the UK,” reads a newly released letter from Thatcher’s office to the Foreign Office. “The PM is nevertheless very conscious of the need to avoid any risk to those British subjects remaining in Iran or to our embassy there.” Wright, who met the shah in the Bahamian capital, Nassau, then sent his assessment to the Whitehall. He added: “Shah’s house is within a wire compound where American security men were tumbling over each other. The house is clearly too small for Shah and his family ... I gathered ... that atmosphere is far from happy and Shah is longing to settle where his children can get proper education.” Lord Carrington, then foreign secretary, was particularly worried about the press finding out about Wright’s mission, which was meant to be secret. “If Denis Wright’s mission leaks to the press, we propose to come clean, ie admit he went to the Bahamas as an official emissary to discuss question of Shah coming to Britain,” he wrote to No 10. The Foreign Office said Wright had gone to explain the government’s position to the shah and to “explain the difficulties which his coming to Britain would present”. The Bahamas was said to be “swarming with journalists”, according to Wright. The shah was not pleased with the message and complained to the ambassador that he could not fathom why the UK took heed of a regime “which did not matter”.
Thatcher personally wrote to Lord Shawcross, a prominent barrister, saying she appreciated his loyalty to the shah but she believed he should not represent the shah in any international tribunal that might arise. “I believe that, were you to accept this brief, there could be very unwelcome effect on our own relations with Iran and possibly even the safety of our embassy staff in Tehran,” she wrote by hand. “The consequences for our relations, and our people in Tehran, could be serious. I am sorry to have to reply in this cautious vein, but given the suspicious and hysterical nature of Iranian opinion, I would not wish to run any unnecessary risks.” The British prime minister went on to say she thought the shah “was a good friend of this country” but her concern was “for the safety of our own people still in Iran”."
2016-07-21T16:45:50Z,uk-news,UK news,"UK immigration officers overwhelmed by illegal 'lorry drops', report finds","A surge in the number of people entering Britain illegally in the backs of lorries kept Home Office staff so busy last year that other immigration enforcement activities, such as tackling human trafficking, were almost completely halted in parts of England, an official watchdog has revealed. David Bolt, the independent inspector of borders and immigration, said the number of people who entered Britain in the back of lorries had risen threefold, from 2,411 in 2014 to 6,429 in 2015, the first official indication of the scale of last summer’s surge in clandestine migration to the UK. His report reveals that although Home Office staff coped with last summer’s surge in “lorry drops”, it came at the expense of other investigations including those against organised crime gangs involved in human trafficking, illegal working and sham marriages. Bolt said the surge meant that in the second half of 2015 in at least three areas – Kent and Sussex, the east of England and the east Midlands – little other operational activity was conducted. He said further difficulties could occur if Britain faced a similar surge in people entering the country illegally this summer. In his report he said most of the migrants encountered “in-country” had entered concealed in or on a heavy goods vehicle and had left the vehicle at its first stopping point in the UK. “This form of clandestine entry is commonly referred to as a lorry drop. Although there is no such thing as a typical lorry drop, in the period under review most of the migrants encountered were males under the age of 30, originating from Eritrea, Iran, Syria, Sudan and Afghanistan,” he said. A Home Office spokesman said the report acknowledged that the summer of 2015 had seen extraordinary pressures as a result of the EU migration crisis. He said tens of millions of pounds had been invested in extra security at the French ports and a new international effort was being made to target human trafficking gangs. “There are clear signs that our approach is working: between 1 April 2015 and 31 March 2016, this has resulted in the disruption of 185 criminal networks involved in organised immigration crime,” the spokesman said. Contingency measures being taken in Kent included the provision of two mobile detention facilities and mobile welfare units, including supplying welfare packs to feed and clothe new arrivals. Bolt’s report was published as ministers announced the closure of the Cedars pre-departure accommodation centre near Gatwick airport, which was used to house families facing deportation from Britain. The centre was forecast to cost £6.4m last year but held only 14 families in its first nine months. The Refugee Council said the decision to use a “discrete unit” at nearby Tinsley House immigration removal centre instead was a “troubling, retrograde step”, on the basis that it was even less well equipped to care for children. The Cedars was operated in conjunction with Barnardos, the children’s charity. Cabinet Office ministers also announced on Thursday that an estimated 5,500 public sector staff whose jobs require them to speak to the public are to be given training to ensure they can speak fluent English or Welsh. The £5.8m programme is being implemented as a result of a Conservative party manifesto commitment and will cover public sector staff such as Department of Work and Pensions work coaches, council customer service staff and teaching assistants in schools. The Cabinet Office said BBC journalists were exempted from the requirement on the grounds that they had only limited interaction with members of the public."
2016-07-21T17:50:37Z,uk-news,UK news,Diplomats in UK 'avoiding prosecution for serious crimes',"Diplomatic officials working in Britain have allegedly used their immunity to avoid prosecution for serious criminal offences including child pornography and human trafficking, Boris Johnson has told parliament. The foreign secretary published a list of 11 “serious and significant offences” allegedly committed by people with diplomatic immunity in the UK in 2015, as well as an update on minor offences and traffic fines avoided by officials. A Mexican official is accused of taking indecent photographs of a child and threatening the child. Another allegation relating to the same country includes claims an individual showed a 13 to 15 year-old pornography. The Foreign Office would not confirm whether both incidents related to the same person. There was an allegation of human trafficking into the UK for domestic servitude, and a separate claim of human trafficking, slavery or forced labour, both relating to Saudi Arabian officials. Where diplomats are alleged to have committed serious crimes, the Foreign Office asks their government to waive diplomatic immunity, and where this is not granted they can ask the diplomat to leave the UK. But this means that in effect serious offenders are allowed to quietly leave without facing trial. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: “The UK government expects all foreign diplomats to abide by UK laws at all times and we take a firm line with diplomatic missions and international organisations whose diplomats commit offences. All alleged offences are investigated by the police or other law enforcement agencies. “In the case of the most serious alleged offences, the diplomat in question would be immediately withdrawn from the country unless they cooperate with any investigation under a waiver of immunity granted by their mission.” The Guardian understands that two diplomats were asked to leave the UK in 2015, and a further dependant of a diplomat was stripped of protections, which could help the police prosecute. A spokeswoman for the NSPCC said: “Nobody should be above the law when it comes to child sexual abuse crimes. It is important that the public see justice be served, and those who commit such appalling offences are brought to book.” An estimated 22,500 people in the UK are entitled to diplomatic immunity. The Foreign Office defines serious crimes as offences that carry a jail term of a year or more, as well as serious driving offences. The other incidents listed include driving without a licence or drunk-driving, and an allegation of aggravated bodily harm by a diplomat from Gabon. A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan police, the force most likely to investigate allegations of such crimes since Britain’s diplomatic community is based in London, said that although it is responsible for passing cases to the Foreign Office, it could not provide details of any of them. The list is published every year. It was revealed last year that a Saudi diplomat was alleged to have owned a gun. Also, a Saudi diplomat was alleged to have developed malware for fraud. In 2013, the list included an allegation of child abduction by a Pakistani official and another of domestic rape by a diplomat from Zambia. Other documents published by the foreign secretary revealed that diplomats have run up £96m in unpaid congestion charge fees for driving in central London, and more than half a million pounds in outstanding parking fines in London alone. The US tops the list for unpaid congestion charges, with £10.6m in outstanding bills. The US position is that the congestion charge is a tax and that it is therefore exempt, the US ambassador to Britain, Matthew Barzun, told LBC last year. Boris Johnson has history when it comes to tackling the issue: in 2011 when he was mayor of London, he reportedly asked Barack Obama for a £5m cheque to cover some of the bill, before an ambassador intervened. The embassies of Japan, Nigeria and Russia all have bills for unpaid congestion charges totalling more than £5m each. Paul Cowperthwaite, Transport for London’s general manager for congestion charging, said: “We are clear that the congestion charge is a charge for a service and not a tax. This means that diplomats are not exempt from paying it. “We continue to pursue all unpaid congestion charge fees and related penalty charge notices.”"
2016-07-21T17:51:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Police consider terrorism motive behind RAF abduction attempt,"Police are looking for two men described as “Middle Eastern” in appearance who allegedly attempted to abduct an RAF serviceman at knifepoint outside his military barracks, an incident they say may have been motivated by terrorism. Norfolk constabulary said on Thursday they were seeking two men aged between 20 and 30, and confirmed the incident was being treated as a botched abduction attempt. One of the alleged assailants leapt from a dark-coloured Ford Galaxy and tried to drag the unarmed serviceman towards the vehicle as he was going for a run near RAF Marham on Wednesday afternoon, police said. The serviceman fought back and knocked the attacker to the floor, at which point the second man allegedly got out of the car wielding a three-inch blade. As he went to help his companion, the victim ran away. At a press conference in Wymondham, Norfolk, Det Supt Paul Durham said the victim – who is married and in his late 20s – believed the first assailant shouted something, but as he had been listening to music the victim was unable to confirm what was said. Durham added: “What he reports is while he was running he becomes aware of the vehicle parked opposite him, but there was nothing about it that made him in any way suspicious of it, and it wasn’t until he was almost alongside it [that] he became aware of one of the occupants of the vehicle.” Police could not rule out that there were more people in the car, Durham said. “The attacker placed his hand on the victim’s shoulder and then on his wrist and started to pull him with a degree of force towards the vehicle,” he said. “Our victim resisted that, managed to break free, effectively fought free from that attack and rendered the first assailant – well, he effectively knocked him on the floor.” Durham said it appeared to be a pre-planned attack, but it was “too early” to be certain. “[The victim is] naturally very shaken by his ordeal, as you would expect.”The base remained on high alert, with officers on patrol and some roads still closed, but an event for families to celebrate the base’s centenary went ahead as planned on Thursday with a heightened civilian and RAF police presence, a base spokesman said.
The fact that the Norfolk constabulary is in control of the investigation suggests that, while terrorism is a possibility that cannot be discounted, at this stage there is no evidence to suggest that. If it was believed to be terrorism, a series of national agencies could be expected to be involved in the investigation or take it over, ranging from Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command to the domestic intelligence agency MI5, which leads the UK’s response to countering terrorism. Media reports have compared the attack with the murder of soldier Lee Rigby near Woolwich barracks in 2013, although in that case a car was used to first knock the victim unconscious. RAF Marham is home to four Tornado squadrons that have played a key role in the bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria. From 2018, the base will also house the F-35 Lightning II jet. Military personnel and bases in the UK have previously been the targets of terrorist attacks and plots. In April, two men were jailed for planning attacks on soldiers. The court heard that one of the men had used his job as a delivery driver to get close to several UK bases operated by the US military. Norfolk police said they were called just before 3.30pm on Wednesday to reports that two men armed with a knife had approached the serviceman near RAF Marham’s married accommodation. Assistant chief constable Nick Dean said: “The motivation of this incident remains unclear. We’re unable at this time to discount terrorism but I stress other lines of inquiry are equally as plausible.” Police released descriptions of the suspects earlier on Thursday. The first man was “between 20 and 30 years old, approximately 6ft tall, of athletic but stocky build, with dark hair which was long on top and [he] had a well-groomed beard. He was of Middle Eastern origin in appearance with a dark skin tone and wore dark casual clothing.” The second was “between 20 and 30 years old, but younger than the first suspect and of a slimmer build. He was approximately 5ft 10, clean shaven with short dark hair. He was also of Middle Eastern origin in appearance and wore a white T-shirt and dark shorts.” Durham added: “I’m keen to hear from anyone who may have seen the vehicle described in the King’s Lynn area, but particularly towards Marham between midday and 6pm [on Wednesday], and would urge anyone with information, no matter how insignificant it may seem to them, to call police on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.” The Mirror website published what it said was an internal Ministry of Defence memo describing the incident as an attempted abduction and warning personnel not to leave the base alone in uniform or clothing that identified them as having links to RAF Marham. It reported that the memo had been circulated to military and civilian staff at the base and posted on Facebook. Norfolk’s police and crime commissioner, Lorne Green, said: “We must not draw any conclusions as investigations are in their early stages and the constabulary and the military police are working closely together. The incident is under investigation and the police are rightly keeping an open mind. There is nothing to suggest one motive above another.” The MoD said security at all its bases was under continual review and it would be inappropriate to comment further."
2016-07-21T18:20:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Cybercrime figures prompt police call for awareness campaign,"Police chiefs have called for a national campaign against online fraud and other cybercrime on the scale of last century’s seatbelt and drink-driving campaigns in the wake of figures showing that one in 10 adults have been victims of such offences in the past year. Chris Greany, the City of London police’s economic command head, said that with around 1m cases reported to Action Fraud in the last year alone, it was not possible for all cases to be investigated. On Thursday the Office for National Statistics said there had been more than 5.8m incidents of cybercrime in the past year, far more than previously thought and enough to nearly double the headline crime rate in England and Wales. The first official estimate of the true scale of online shopping scams, virus attacks, thefts of bank details and other online offences was much higher than an initial ONS estimate in October last year, which put the annual figure at 3.8m, or 40% of all crimes. Greany said fraud now cost an estimated £193bn a year and with half of all crimes against people in the UK being committed from abroad, it was becoming more challenging for police to tackle. “Law enforcement agencies are becoming increasingly successful at targeting the most serious offenders; however, the scale of the challenge is such that prevention, and helping businesses and individuals protect themselves, is the only long-term way of combating the escalating threat,” he said. “That includes all industries taking proper steps to protect their customers from becoming victims of fraud.” Greany endorsed a call for a national fraud and cybercrime campaign on a par with the seatbelt and drink-drive campaigns of the 1980s and 90s to create a more internet-savvy society. Deputy chief constable Peter Goodman, the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead on cybercrime, said such offending was no longer a curiosity or a new specialism in policing. “The priorities for law enforcement are to make the UK a hostile place for cybercriminals to operate, improve the response to victims and develop capabilities in local forces. Transforming our response to these crimes is a challenge but it is a priority for investment in policing,” he said. In March the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, was criticised for suggesting bank customers who were victims of online fraud should not be refunded by banks if they had failed to protect themselves from cybercrime.
The ONS said one in 10 adults had been victims of cybercrime in the past year. The chance of being a victim was the same regardless of social class or whether someone lived in a deprived or affluent, urban or rural area. The 5.8m offences were made up of 3.8m fraud offences, including 2.5m incidents of bank and credit card fraud, and 2m computer misuse offences, including 1.4m virus attacks. The remaining 600,000 estimated offences related to unauthorised access to personal information, such as hacking of email, social media or other online accounts.
The latest overall figures, excluding online crime, in the 12 months to March 2015 showed there were an estimated 6.3m offences – 6% fewer than in the previous year. Police crime figures showed that the murder rate rose by 34 to 571, the highest in five years. This is still far below the peak in 2002-03, when 1,047 homicides were recorded, but the recent rise is one of the more authoritative indicators that Britain is experiencing an increase in violence. The 96 deaths at Hillsborough in 1989 will be added to the official homicide figures and included in the next set of crime figures after the inquests finished in April. Knife crime offences rose by 10% in the past year and gun crime increased by 4% over the same period. Incidents of harassment, including new categories of offence such as malicious communications online, social media abuse and revenge porn, had risen 90%, from 82,000 to 156,000. The police figures also showed a 27% rise in offences against the person and a 21% increase in sexual offences. Those figures include a 22% increase in reported rapes from 29,300 to 35,798. By contrast, the crime survey showed no significant change in the proportion of adults who said they had been a victim of sexual assault in the past year. The ONS said the 21% increase in sexual offences reflected both an improvement in police recording of the offences and a greater willingness of victims to come forward. But the overall picture of all crime – excluding the 5.8m online offences – according to the crime survey of England and Wales, which is regarded as the best measure of crime trends, showed a 6% fall to 6.3m offences involving adult victims in the 12 months to March 2016. The long-term trends in “traditional” crimes such as burglary, car thefts and criminal damage showed that the fall in crime since its 1995 peak had slowed down since 2005. The crime survey found there had been no change in the overall level of violent crime compared with the previous year.
The online crime numbers give the first official snapshot of the scale of the threat from online attacks and scams. However, ONS statisticians said it would be “misleading to conclude that this means actual crime levels have doubled, since the survey previously did not cover these offences”. The first estimate is based on a 9,000-strong sample size from six months of interviews from the crime survey. Only when the ONS has 12 months of data in January will the online crime figures be incorporated into the headline crime rate. Separate Home Office figures for police officer numbers show they fell by a further 3,126 last year to 124,000 – the lowest level since 2003.Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, said: “At long last, we have the true picture of crime in England and Wales and it puts the former home secretary’s record in a new light. “Our new PM [Theresa May] was fond of saying that crime is falling but, as people can see, crime has moved online and until now the official statistics haven’t shown that. Her complacent claims do not read well alongside these worrying increases in violent crime, sexual crime and homicide. “The only conclusion that can be drawn is that it is the wrong time to be cutting the police. The PM promised real-terms protection but has failed to deliver it. Now that decision is entirely within her hands, she must honour the promise that she made and protect frontline policing,” he said. The policing minister, Brandon Lewis, said: “As crime falls, we know that it is also changing. Fraud and cyber-offences are not a new threat and the government has been working to get ahead of the game, committing to spend £1.9bn on cybersecurity and cybercrime over the next five years. We have also established the joint fraud taskforce, bringing together law enforcement and the banking sector, while Action Fraud, the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau and the National Crime Agency are working to improve our response. “We welcome today’s experimental ONS figures on fraud and cybercrime – offences which we have always known were happening but were previously unable to quantify. Having an accurate national picture will be crucial to inform future action.”"
2016-07-21T18:21:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Names of two people killed in Aberdeen flats released,"Two people killed during a disturbance in a block of flats in Aberdeen have been named. The bodies of Keith Taylor, 43, and Tracy Gabriel, 40, were found after police responded to a call on Tuesday evening. A second man is understood to have died after falling from a balcony in the building. Taylor and Gabriel’s deaths are being treated as murder. The trio are believed to have been socialising together and drinking in Gabriel’s flat in the Tillydrone area before the deaths occurred. Neighbours called 999 when they heard a woman shouting and screaming for help, and police attended the scene. Shortly afterwards, the second man, who has still not officially been named, fell to his death, despite police efforts to save him. After entering the flat, officers discovered the bodies of Gabriel and Taylor, who was believed to have lived with his wife, Linda, next door. The families of the victims paid tribute to them on Thursday. Gabriel’s family said in a statement: “Tracy was a much-loved daughter, sister, mother, aunt and cousin. Born in Aberdeen, she spent most of her younger years in the Alford and Huntly areas. “She then moved to Aberdeen whilst in her 20s, and latterly lived in the Tillydrone area. She was well known in the community and well liked by her friends and family. She will be sadly missed.” Taylor’s family said: “Keith was a happy-go-lucky lad. He had a great sense of humour and was always laughing and joking. His dad taught him to scuba dive and they enjoyed many diving trips in and around the Moray coast. “Keith met his wife when he worked in Holland in the oil and gas sector. They then moved to Aberdeen and got married in 2013. He was a loving husband and was devoted to his mum and dad plus his older brother.” Ross Grant, a Labour councillor for Tillydrone, said several residents had been struggling to come to terms with the tragedy. “Tillydrone is a community in deep shock in light of the horrific incident which was witnessed by many nearby residents and families who were out enjoying the last of the summer sunshine on 19 July,” he said. “It is a close-knit community, everybody knows everybody, and residents love staying here. That makes an incident like this all the more upsetting. “I know that many residents have had trouble sleeping, and are dealing with vivid memories of what they saw and heard. But it is that same closeness in the area that will help residents to come to terms with the circumstances and move forward. My thoughts are very much with the loved ones of those caught up in this horrific incident.” The identity of the third person who died is expected to be officially confirmed by police on Friday. The case will be reviewed by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner because officers were in attendance when the second man died. A report has been submitted to the procurator fiscal in relation to all three deaths."
2016-07-21T20:06:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Commanding officer 'devastated' by death of soldier on Brecon march,"The commanding officer of a soldier who collapsed and died during training on the hottest day of the year – raising fresh concerns about how the military keeps personnel safe in extreme heat – has expressed devastation at the tragedy. Cpl Joshua Hoole, 26, described as “superfit” by his family, fell ill after an eight-mile training march in the Brecon Beacons national park. Three SAS candidates suffered fatal heat illness three years ago also in the same area. Hoole’s family is waiting for the results of a postmortem to find out how he died but they have said they are concerned that he was training in full combat gear on such a hot day. The Ministry of Defence released a photo of Hoole, from Ecclefechan, near Lockerbie in Scotland, and his fiancee, Rachael McKie, whom he was due to marry later this year. Major Dean Murch, officer commanding the Rifles Company, 1st Infantry Training Battalion, Infantry Training Centre, said: “We are utterly devastated, but our loss is nothing compared with that of his loved ones. His family have lost a son, a brother, a fiance and a very special friend, their grief will be inconsolable. “Truly the thoughts and prayers of every single rifleman in the regiment and all his colleagues at the Infantry Training Centre are with them in their hour of need, now and in the forthcoming days and beyond.” Hoole was one of about 20 soldiers who took part in an eight-mile march on lanes around the school of infantry in Brecon on Tuesday. They left at 7am, by which time the temperature in the area was already 17.6C. It had risen to 22.3C when they returned at 9am. Each soldier was dressed in full combat clothing and boots and they were carrying 25kg rucksacks, but the march was not seen as a difficult one and did not involve severe climbs. The soldiers carried water and there were water stations along the route. The exercise was organised by Hoole’s own regiment to make sure he and other candidates were fit enough to take part in a demanding platoon sergeants’ battle course, which is run by the school of infantry. An army source compared the march to an MOT – an annual test to make sure soldiers had a basic level of fitness that is much less gruelling than the SAS test. Hoole and his colleagues did the march as a squad and it was completed within the stipulated two hours. On their return to the school of infantry, Hoole collapsed. Civilian paramedics were called shortly before 9am but could not save him. The MoD has refused to speculate about why he may have died and inquiries have been launched by the military, the civilian police and health and safety officials. Defence chiefs were strongly criticised by a coroner over the SAS tragedy in July 2013 and the MoD was subject to a “crown censure”, the stiffest penalty it could be given. Lawyer Clare Stevens, who represented the father of one of the men who collapsed during the SAS test, said on Thursday: “It’s concerning that another soldier has died on what was the hottest day of a year in Brecon while on a training exercise. “We need complete transparency over what happened. What we need to know is whether the risk assessment that was carried out for the exercise in which Cpl Hoole was taking part was adequate. They need to start reassuring the public that they are taking health and safety seriously and that they are learning lessons when tragedies happen. Soldiers shouldn’t be dying in training.” Speaking to the BBC, Col Richard Kemp, who commanded British forces in Afghanistan, urged people not to jump to conclusions. He said: “It’s a great tragedy. I feel terribly sorry for his family and comrades. We don’t know whether it was related to heat, we don’t know what the cause was. It might have been a completely independent event. We don’t know. “I know for a fact the Ministry of Defence and the army have taken into account the tragic deaths during SAS selection. There was fault at the time. There may have been fault in this case. I don’t think we should prejudge it. I think we have to wait and see what happens. “The reality is that if soldiers don’t train hard in peacetime and during courses such as the one Corp Hoole was on then many, many more soldiers will end up dying in battle. That is why the British army trains in places like Brecon, which is rugged, tough terrain and sometimes in high temperatures.” Hoole’s grandfather John Craig told the Guardian he suspected dehydration and exhaustion must have been involved. He said: “I know what the Brecon Beacons are like because I worked as an instructor there in the 1950s.” The incident comes just three months after the defence select committee published a report calling for the MoD to be liable for prosecution for the deaths of armed forces personnel. The report said that since the start of 2000, 135 military personnel had died while taking part in training exercises – 89 from the army, 24 from the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, and 22 from the RAF."
2016-07-21T23:04:11Z,uk-news,UK news,EDF to decide on Hinkley Point next week,"EDF will finally decide whether to proceed with a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset next week. The French government-controlled energy giant said on Thursday night that its board of directors would meet on Thursday 28 July. The final investment decision on whether to build two reactors at Hinkley Point is on the agenda for the meeting.
EDF had said in April that it was delaying a final decision until September while it consulted with trade unions. The company has repeatedly delayed making a final decision on the project because of concerns about its £18bn cost. It said: “The two reactors at Hinkley Point would strengthen EDF’s presence in Britain, a country where its subsidiary EDF Energy already operates 15 nuclear reactors and is the largest electricity supplier by volume.” The company added that the project, Hinkley Point C, “is a unique asset for French industry as it would benefit the whole of the nuclear industry and support employment in major companies and smaller enterprises in the sector”. The French company said in April that its works council would be consulted on the terms of the partnership with the Chinese company, CGN. The Chinese group has said it would not go ahead on the project by itself if EDF drops out. The business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, said: “New nuclear is an essential part of our plan for a secure, clean and affordable energy system that will power the economy throughout this century. This is a welcome decision from EDF, and we look forward to the outcome.” Last month EDF managers told MPs that the company should postpone the Hinkley Point project until it had solved a series of problems with the reactor design and multibillion-euro lawsuits over delays on similar schemes. French unions have raised concerns about the cost of building the power station, but UK unions have strongly backed the project. The government argues that Hinkley Point C is a crucial part of the UK’s future energy mix as coal and older nuclear plants are shut down. It is expected to provide 7% of the country’s electricity demand when it becomes operational. It is due to be completed by 2025, but many regard that timetable as highly unrealistic given that reactors of the same design being built in Finland and France are running years behind schedule."
2016-07-22T11:31:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Ben Butler to appeal against conviction for murdering daughter Ellie,"A man who murdered his six-year-old daughter 11 months after the high court returned her to his custody is appealing against his conviction and life sentence. Ben Butler was sentenced to a minimum of 23 years in jail at the Old Bailey last month after being found guilty of a brutal assault on his daughter Ellie while minding her at home in south London. He claimed during his trial that he had been framed by the “establishment”, alleging that corrupt medical experts and prosecutors were determined to see him jailed because of an earlier conviction for an assault on his daughter when she was a baby. That conviction was overturned in the court of appeal and Ellie was returned to his care in November 2012 after a protracted high court case. It emerged on Friday that Butler, 36, had lodged an appeal against his murder conviction and sentencing on 13 July. During his trial, the court heard he had killed his daughter in October 2013 after battering her in a fit of rage, with the judge describing him as having an “evil temper”. Mr Justice Wilkie said in sentencing remarks that Butler was a “self-absorbed, ill-tempered, violent and domineering man” who had “wickedly” involved Ellie’s younger sibling in a cover-up by allowing the child to discover the body lying on the floor two hours after she had been murdered.
Ellie had head injuries so severe they were likened by experts to those found in a high-speed car crash. Her mother, Jennie Gray, was jailed for 42 months for child cruelty and for her part in the cover-up of her daughter’s death. Butler’s appeal bid emerged during a separate court of appeal hearing in relation to his case on Friday. The second most senior judge in England and Wales has been asked to decide whether a family court judge’s behind-closed-doors ruling relating to the murder should be made public. John Dyson, the master of the rolls and the head of civil justice in England and Wales, has ruled that the media can have access to a ruling made by a high court judge in 2014 on the death of Ellie. Seven media organisations including the Guardian made submissions to the court of appeal after a family court judge refused the press permission to publish the judgment on the death, on the grounds that Butler might in the future face a retrial. The media however continue to be barred from reporting on that judgment until agreement is reached on redactions made for legal reasons. It is not known if Gray has lodged an appeal."
2016-07-22T11:58:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Britons' unease about overseas travel drives surge in staycations,"As the peak UK holiday season launches with a combination of beautiful weather, security fears about some of the most popular overseas destinations, and the falling pound in the wake of Brexit, there has been a surge of interest in staycations. Coastal resorts and country cottage retreats around Britain are reporting a dramatic increase in bookings – Visit East Anglia reported that inquiries and bookings had risen by 25% in the last few weeks. Suddenly the prospect of hours in a traffic jam stuck behind a snake of caravans heading for the West Country seems less alarming than paying at least 10% more for a sangria or a café au lait. The sudden unease about overseas travel has been reinforced by recent terrorist incidents including the attacks in Paris and Brussels and the Bastille Day horror in Nice. In Turkey, one of the most popular destinations for UK travellers, tourist numbers are estimated to be down by more than 25% after earlier terrorist incidents and the instability in the wake of the attempted coup. The holiday plans of thousands more families were destroyed by the collapse of the budget holiday firm Lowcostholidays. They will lose almost every penny paid in deposits because the firm was outside the Abta or Atol protection schemes, and some desperate families have turned to crowdfunding to try to salvage their plans. TravelSupermarket – whose suggestions for staycationers include husky trekking in Yorkshire and admiring the northern lights from the Isle of Man – estimates that a family of four could face an increase of £245 in the cost of an overseas holiday because of the fall in the value of the pound.
The effect has been so marked that several low-cost airlines, including easyJet, have launched sales at what should be their peak profits time, to persuade holidaymakers to take to the skies. The easyJet chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said the combination of the falling pound, air traffic control strikes and the fear of terrorist attacks had severely dented consumer confidence. If the falling pound has made holidays abroad dismayingly expensive for Britons, it has also made the UK alluringly good value for other nationalities. Even before the pound tumbled against both the dollar and the euro, Visit Britain reported the best first quarter for inward holidays, with both tourist numbers and the amount they spent well up. Visits from the US, the most valuable single overseas market for Britain, were up 9% compared with the first quarter in 2015, visits from Germany were up 24%, and there were more than 500,000 visitors from Spain, a new record. Visitor numbers from China, the United Arab Emirates and Australia also rose.
“The weather has been kind to us,” said Patricia Yates, the director of strategy and communications at VisitBritain. “I think if the weather is good when the schools break up – and given the pattern of late bookings – people are more inclined to think let’s go and see what Britain has to offer. We hope they have a wonderful time.” The Visit Britain figures show increases across the board, in self-catering and hotel holidays, coast, country and city, and short breaks. Yates said this year’s surge in bookings built on a pattern of growth, with staycations up 7% overall last year. Apart from the attractions on offer, holidaymakers liked the certainty of budgeting for a UK holiday. “There has also been a real increase in quality,” she added. “TripAdvisor is now putting the UK second in the world after Italy – and that’s up from 15th place in 2005.” Inevitably, the Met Office forecast for the weekend and the next week sees the recent soaring temperatures and clear blue skies giving way to increased cloud and frequent showers."
2016-07-22T13:54:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Is sunbathing in undies OK? Stripping off during heatwave sparks debate,"As Britain basked in tropical conditions this week with temperatures soaring towards 35C (95F), people eager to make the most of the scorching heat took to parks and beaches across the country to sunbathe. But some sun worshippers went to extreme lengths to get a tan â€“ and the issue has prompted fierce public debate. Without having a bikini or swimming trunks to hand, many people left their workplaces early to enjoy the weather and were pictured trying to catch rays in just their underwear â€“ dividing opinion in the process. Dave Mason, 56, from Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, said it was unacceptable to strip off to underwear in a public place to get a tan. â€œI would not do it myself and I donâ€™t really want my grandchildren seeing that type of behaviour,â€� he said. â€œI really wouldnâ€™t feel comfortable with someone lying in a park with just their briefs on. Swimwear is marginally better but even that would be slightly strange in a park. Maybe, on a beach but not in a park or on a street.â€� Rian Ormrod, 34, from Manchester, said: â€œIt all depends on what type of underwear it is. If they had an Ann Summers crotchless type affair then that would be a touch odd, but if it was something quite normal then I canâ€™t see what the problem is. â€œI would not do it myself unless I was with friends but most underwear is exactly like swimwear â€“ just the material is sometimes slightly different.â€� With good weather on the way for much of the country on Saturday, others went on social media in their droves to comment on whether stripping off was socially acceptable. A slightly bemused andywg tweeted about a â€œlarge number of ladies sunbathing in Regentâ€™s Parkâ€�.
Twitter user Keely wrote:
Meanwhile, Derek Coe in Birkenhead said he was left â€œfeeling shockedâ€�, as he tweeted: â€œWomen on Price Street sunbathing in bra and knickersâ€¦ Only in Birkenhead lol.â€� Another Twitter user wrote:
The issue was also discussed on Quora, where one person asked: â€œWhy is it socially acceptable for women to wear bikinis in public but not underwear?â€� Most of those involved in the debate on the question-and-answer website seemed to be in agreement that swimwear was acceptable because it was designed to be worn as outerwear.
Will Wister wrote: â€œItâ€™s about connotations. Underwear connotes the state immediately prior to nudity, so if someone is wearing underwear, that person is essentially saying: â€˜Look at me Iâ€™m almost nude.â€™ â€œSwimsuits connote swimming at the beach or at a pool. The wearer is saying: â€˜Itâ€™s so hot and I just went swimming or might sunbathe later and Iâ€™m too lazy to change.â€™ â€œSo it has nothing to do with the amount of the body the clothing exposes and everything to do with what the clothing signifies.â€�"
2016-07-22T14:41:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Boy drowns in canal while 'tombstoning' in South Yorkshire,"An 11-year-old boy whose body was pulled from a canal may have been tombstoning with a group of friends, firefighters have said. The schoolboy – named locally as Subhaan Ali – is thought to have leapt 18ft (5.5 metres) from a bridge into the canal in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. In a separate incident, a woman drowned while playing in a river in Bedford with her children on Thursday night. The incidents sparked warnings from police and firefighters about the dangers of entering open water, amid heightened concern over the unusually hot temperatures and the start of the school holidays. Police were called after the schoolboy disappeared into the canal at about 7pm on Thursday. A search and rescue operation recovered the boy’s body at 11pm. Gary Willoughby, a watch manager at South Yorkshire fire and rescue service, told reporters at the scene that the boy had jumped 18ft from a bridge into the South Yorkshire navigational canal. However, police later said they had not yet determined how the youngster died. Willoughby said: “This 11-year-old boy was actually taking part in a pastime that boys of his age call tombstoning. Unfortunately, it’s aptly named. It’s jumping from unknown heights into unknown depths of water. “They tend to jump straight into the water. They don’t assess the water temperature, they don’t see if there are any dangers hidden under the water – shopping trolleys, cars, anything like that, any reeds they might get tangled in. They don’t even assess how deep the water is before they jump.”
Stewart Nicholson, South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue group manager, and Helen Lewis, acting ch insp of South Yorkshire police, stressed they had still not established how and why the boy entered the water. Asked specifically about tombstoning, both officers said they were looking at a number of lines of inquiry. Two hours before the boy disappeared police in Rotherham had urged people not to go swimming in open water. In a post on Facebook, the Rotherham North local policing team said it had dealt with numerous reports of such incidents in the first few days of the school holidays. Emergency services were concerned that the start of holidays, combined with the unusually hot temperatures, could prompt young people to engage in the activity. In Bedford, a body was found by police searching for a mother of three, thought to be in her 30s, who was last seen more than 14 hours previously when she was diving into a shallow part of the Great Ouse river. Police said the woman was having a picnic with her children, aged between three and 10, when she entered the water to try to help a person in distress. Bedfordshire police ch insp Nick Lyall said: “At some point she’s gone into the river to help somebody that’s in distress and we know now the tragic results of that.
“I believe the children were playing by the side of the river, but at the moment we are still trying to piece the rest of the circumstances together. The main witnesses are her young children.” Joe Vacchio, who lives nearby, said there were screams of “I can’t swim” before police and a helicopter arrived. He said the woman lives around the corner from the river and had been diving into the water off small islands with her three children. In a statement about the 11-year-old boy in Rotherham, a South Yorkshire fire and rescue service spokesman said: “We are all devastated by this tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family and friends of the boy who died.” The service said there had been 49 incidents involving rescuing people from open water since 2012. People died in three of those incidents. South Yorkshire police said: “Police received a report at around 7pm that a boy had been seen entering the canal, off Stone Row Way, but had disappeared soon after. “Specialist resources attended the scene, including South Yorkshire fire andrescue and the ambulance service. The body of the 11-year-old was found in the water at around 11pm. His family has been informed and they are being supported by officers. The circumstances are under investigation.” On Tuesday a 16-year-old boy drowned while playing with friends in a river in Greater Manchester on the hottest day of the year. Jack Pullen was in the river Etherow when he got into difficulty. Officers said that while the river appeared shallow and calm there might have been strong undercurrents and submerged hazards. Detectives are investigating reports that the boy became trapped between a bridge and a log."
2016-07-22T15:04:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Security alert false alarm at army camp follows RAF kidnap attempt,"A security alert that sparked a lockdown at a British army camp was a false alarm, it has emerged, as police said tensions were running high following the attempted kidnap of an RAF serviceman and the Bastille Day attack in Nice. Bulford military camp on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire was placed under restricted access after reports that three people had been spotted on a nearby ridge on Thursday with a “long-barrelled weapon”. But Wiltshire police said on Friday that the individuals concerned were located and it was confirmed they were not involved in any suspicious activity.
The alarm was sounded hours after police in Norfolk launched a search for two men described as “Middle Eastern” in appearance who allegedly tried to drag a serviceman into a car at knifepoint outside RAF Marham, near King’s Lynn. A week ago, 84 people were killed and 303 injured when a 19-tonne truck was deliberately driven by Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel into crowds celebrating Bastille Day in Nice. Vince Logue, Wiltshire police’s south sector acting inspector, acknowledged events had put members of the public on edge. “With recent events, both in the UK and abroad, it is understandable that we are seeing an increase in calls from members of the public reporting suspicious behaviour,” he said. “It is only right that we fully investigate calls of this nature. Thankfully, this incident turned out to be non-suspicious.” The search in Norfolk for the two suspects, aged between 20 and 30, continued on Friday after detectives said they could not rule out terrorism as a motive. Police have launched dedicated hotlines for anyone with information. One of the alleged assailants jumped out of a dark-coloured Ford Galaxy and tried to drag the unarmed serviceman towards the vehicle as he was going for a run near the barracks on Wednesday afternoon. He fought back and knocked the attacker to the floor, at which point the second man allegedly climbed out of the car wielding a three-inch blade. As he went to help his companion, the victim ran away.
At a press conference in Wymondham, Norfolk, on Thursday, Det Supt Paul Durham said the victim, in his late 20s, believed the first assailant shouted but as he had been listening to music he was unable to confirm what was said. Durham said: “What he reports is while he was running he becomes aware of the vehicle parked opposite him, but there was nothing about it that made him in any way suspicious of it, and it wasn’t until he was almost alongside it he became aware of one of the occupants of the vehicle.” Police could not rule out that there were more people in the car, Durham said. “The attacker placed his hand on the victim’s shoulder and then on his wrist and started to pull him with a degree of force towards the vehicle,” he said. “Our victim resisted that, managed to break free, effectively fought free from that attack and rendered the first assailant – well, he effectively knocked him on the floor.” Durham said it appeared to be a pre-planned attack, but it was too early to be certain. “[The victim is] naturally very shaken by his ordeal, as you would expect,” he said. The base remained on high alert, with officers on patrol and some roads still closed, but an event for families to celebrate the base’s centenary went ahead as planned on Thursday with a heightened civilian and RAF police presence. Assistant chief constable Nick Dean said on Thursday: “The motivation of this incident remains unclear. We’re unable at this time to discount terrorism, but I stress other lines of inquiry are equally as plausible.” RAF Marham is home to four Tornado squadrons that have played a key role in the bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria. From 2018, the base will also house the F-35 Lightning II jet. Police released descriptions of the suspects earlier on Thursday. The first man was between 20 and 30 years old, approximately 6ft tall, of athletic but stocky build, with dark hair which was long on top and had a well-groomed beard. He was of Middle Eastern origin in appearance with a dark skin tone and wore dark casual clothing. The second was between 20 and 30 years old, but younger than the first suspect and of a slimmer build. He was approximately 5ft 10, clean shaven with short dark hair. He was also of Middle Eastern origin in appearance and wore a white T-shirt and dark shorts. Durham on Friday said early CCTV inquiries revealed that there were a number of people walking on nearby Squires Hill, near to a branch of Costcutters, around the times of the incident and has appealed for anyone with information to come forward."
2016-07-22T16:41:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Inquest unable to solve mystery of DJ Derek's death,"Mystery is likely to forever surround the death of the legendary Bristol music figure DJ Derek, whose body was found in woodland nine months after he vanished. Police have ruled out foul play and his family said he would not have taken his own life but an inquest was told it had not been possible to establish cause of death because his remains had lain undiscovered for so long. DJ Derek – Derek James Serpell-Morris – went missing in July 2015 aged 74. After a high-profile search his remains were found in March in undergrowth close to Cribbs Causeway shopping centre about seven miles from his home.
Derek, dubbed the blackest white man in Bristol, was hugely respected and loved in the St Pauls area of the city, where he lived and worked as a DJ. He was friends with members of the band Massive Attack, played Glastonbury and appeared in a Dizzee Rascal video. Giving evidence at his inquest near Bristol on Friday, DC Carol Doxsey, of Avon and Somerset police, said: “Everybody we spoke to had only good things to say about [Derek]. Nobody had any problems with him.” Asked if there had been evidence that he had been a victim of assault, killed elsewhere and taken to the woods, or had taken his own life, Doxsey said: “No, nothing to suggest that.” The inquest heard a dog walker found his body. Doxsey added: “We were unable to say how he died or why he was in that location.” The assistant coroner Peter Harrowing was unable to establish a cause of death and recorded a short narrative conclusion. He said: “The deceased’s severely decomposed body was found in a wooded area and it cannot be known how the deceased came to be there.” He paid tribute to the DJ, saying: “Derek was clearly a very public character in some respects. “I am sure his passion and love of music touched the lives of all who knew him in that respect. I am sure he will be remembered fondly by all. “However there was also a private side to Derek. Aside from his music he was a very private person. We will never know how Derek came to be where he was.”
Speaking after the hearing, Derek’s great-niece, Jenny Griffiths, said: “I still don’t feel like we have full closure as we don’t know anything. I don’t think anything untoward could have happened, he was loved by too many people.” Ruling out suicide, she said: “He was too happy. He was talking about his retirement and his bus travels.” In April hundreds attended his funeral service at St Agnes church in St Pauls, where he had lived – and performed – since the late 1970s. Among the mourners was Daddy G from Massive Attack, who had known Derek for decades and once described him as “an ambassador for cultural exchange”. Derek was born in 1941 in Bristol, the son of a carpenter and a housewife. He first heard a black voice singing in the late 1940s when he tuned into US forces radio but his initial foray into the world of music was playing washboard in a skiffle group and drumming in a rock’n’roll band. Initially, his career was conventional. He became an accountant for the chocolate company Fry’s, and in the early 1960s discovered Jamaican music and began attending parties in St Pauls. It was a time of strained race relations but he was welcomed by members of the African-Caribbean community. Derek had a crisis in the late 1970s when he lost his father and his second marriage ended badly. In 1978, he moved into a dark basement flat with no central heating in St Pauls and quit his job. He lived in the flat for the rest of his life. He found work DJing at the Star and Garter, a pub popular with Bristolians of West Indian origin, under the name DJ Derek’s Sweet Memory Sounds, and introduced each record in Jamaican patois, which he had learned in a barber shop. By the mid-2000s he was regularly playing festivals. Some may have enjoyed the novelty value of a white, bespectacled former accountant who wore cardigans and bright waistcoats playing Jamaican music but Derek was genuinely admired and respected in the music world, even touring with Bob Marley’s legendary band the Wailers. When Derek introduced himself to Toots Hibbert of Toots and the Maytals, Hibbert said: “You don’t have to tell me who you are. You’re the white man who talks the people’s talk and plays the people’s music.”"
2016-07-22T17:05:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Welsh schoolboy dies on 560-mile cycling pilgrimage in Spain,"A Welsh teenager has died in Spain during a 560-mile “cycling pilgrimage” to Santiago de Compostela with his school friends. Michael Cura, 16, from Swansea, and his party were nearing the end of their charity trip when he collapsed and died. His school, Bishop Vaughan Catholic school, said it was devastated by the sudden death of the sixth-form student nine days into the journey. Michael was one of 21 pupils and eight staff members heading for Santiago de Compostela, north-west Spain, which is at the end of a centuries-old pilgrims’ route, the Camino de Santiago. In a letter to parents the school said pupils and staff were averaging 50-60 miles a day. It is understood that Michael, an altar boy at the Sacred Heart church in Swansea, was not involved in an accident and no other pupils were involved. His family have flown to Spain. Fr Jason Jones said: “The parish community of the Sacred Heart at Morriston are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden death of Michael. “The family and friends of Michael attended a special mass this morning before jetting off from Heathrow. He was a fun-loving, caring and committed altar boy and a helper for the disabled youth. A caring, greatly loved and popular young man who will be very missed. It is a very emotional time for the family and for the whole community.” School friends were due to return home without finishing the pilgrimage. A spokeswoman for Swansea council said: “The parents of the student are being supported to travel out to Spain. Following discussions with the pupils, staff and parents, the school has arranged for the remaining pupils and staff to return home tomorrow.”"
2016-07-22T17:25:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Hinkley Point C nuclear project expected to get go-ahead next week,"The Hinkley Point C nuclear project is poised to get the go-ahead from EDF next week in what will be a major boost to a new government trying to steady nerves on the economy after the British vote to leave the European Union last month. A board meeting of the French energy group on Thursday 28 July is expected to give a final investment decision in favour of building new reactors in Somerset despite internal divisions over the £18bn scheme. The decision has been repeatedly postponed, partly because of pressure from trade unionists on the board of the partly state-owned French group who claim EDF cannot afford the cost and risk of such a massive project in the UK. But Jean-Bernard Lévy, EDF’s chief executive, has the support of the British government to press ahead with a scheme that represents an important shop window for selling nuclear technology and expertise worldwide. EDF said it would discuss Hinkley Point C (HPC) – which involves building two so-called European pressurised reactors (EPR) – at its forthcoming board meeting and underlined the importance of building in Britain. “The HPC project is a major element of the group’s … strategy. The two EPR reactors at Hinkley Point would strengthen EDF’s presence in Britain, a country where its subsidiary EDF Energy already operates 15 nuclear reactors and is the largest electricity supplier by volume.”
EDF would not publicly commit itself to a decision in favour of the project, but nuclear industry sources said all company preparations were being made as if it was a done deal. “We are all expecting the go ahead next week,” the sources said. The timing could not be better for the UK government, which regards Hinkley as a flagship energy scheme despite criticism from the City about its massive cost. EDF insists it can build the project for £18bn but a complex system of subsidies agreed by the former chancellor, George Osborne, could cost the consumer up to £37bn, according to a recent estimate published on the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) website. His successor, Philip Hammond, has seized on a decision by a Japanese company to buy one of Britain’s leading technology companies, ARM, for £24bn as an example that the UK was still attractive to foreign investors. But Hinkley would be a much clearer vote of confidence by France and its Chinese partners and it should encourage other foreign nuclear companies such as Toshiba of Japan to press ahead with their own reactor plans. New capacity is needed to generate electricity in the UK at a time when old atomic and coal plants are being retired and there are fears of the lights going out.
Greg Clark, the business and energy secretary, said: “It’s clear that we are open for business as we come closer to sealing the deal on this major investment in British infrastructure and British jobs. “This is a welcome decision [to hold a board meeting] from EDF, and we look forward to the outcome.” Critics remained vocal. “It’s right that the UK should remain open for business but handing billions of energy bill payers money over to the French government for an outdated technology makes no business sense,” said John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK. “A possible final investment decision next week will only show that high-level post-truth politics trumps good sense. The type of reactor EDF wants to build at Hinkley hasn’t yet been shown to work. “For UK bill payers, the rationale for a massively over-priced power station like Hinkley has long since disappeared but all the key players are too embarrassed to stop it.” But Unite was supportive. Kevin Coyne, the union’s energy officer, said: “It has been a long journey, but we are within sight of the promised land – the making of the final investment decision for the Somerset plant. “The go-ahead is desperately needed on a number of grounds – to help keep the lights on in Britain in the decades ahead and as a fulcrum for the creation of thousands of jobs and related economic activity in the West Country.”"
2016-07-22T17:36:40Z,uk-news,UK news,London housing: Lambeth's Pockets of affordability,"It’s nice to do the Lambeth Walk. Any evening. Any day. On Thursday, the south London street made famous by the musical Me and My Girl was sauntered down by the elite of the capital’s housing geeks – politicians, borough planners, roving consultants - to see a frontier example of old-style, low cost London dwellings accommodating the very newest kind. The China Walk estate was built by the London County Council between 1928 and 1934, its completion achieved just three years before Noel Gay’s hit show was first performed. Today, an extra 70 units are being fitted into two spaces - a former car park and a garage space - among its half-dozen interwar blocks, built in Bedford, brought to the capital by truck and assembled on site at rapid speed. The developer is Pocket Living, which supplies compact one-bedroom housing for what it calls “city makers” – nurses, designers, teachers, engineers and other middle-income Londoners essential to the city – for prices that are least 20% below surrounding market levels. They call them “starter homes” because they’re sold to first-time buyers, but aren’t at this stage starter homes in the controversial government policy sense. Pocket is a commercial company that’s found a way to build sought-after flats that are ingeniously small for less money than others do. Modular construction (technical term) costs are slightly higher than the conventional kind because the structures must withstand the rigours of road travel. But they save time, and time is money. Pocket also gets its numbers to add up because it builds at high densities and works closely with local authorities to agree purchase prices for land that helps keep prices down. There are Pocket homes in Camden, Hackney, Ealing and Lewisham and elsewhere. Lambeth will have 126 of them in various places by the end of the year or just beyond. The prices of those on China Walk will start from £267,000 and be sold to people with household incomes well below the £66,000 top end of the eligibility range set by Boris Johnson for one and two-bed “affordable” housing. The exact figure has yet to be agreed with Lambeth, but the average Pocket purchasing household earns just up to £40,000 a year, which gives you an idea. China Walk is geographically the nearest Pocket has so far come to the hyper-expensive centre of town, which means the discounts need to be bigger if the homes there are to be within the price range of those squeezed middle-income earners they and Lambeth have in mind. The cheapest will be 35% less than comparable homes on the open market locally. To buy one, you need to have lived or worked in Lambeth for a year. There has already been heavy demand. Will these and other Pocket homes meet Sadiq Khan’s definition of “genuinely affordable”? A big clue lies in the presence at the Lambeth Walk gathering, held in the local Chandler Community Hall, of Khan’s deputy mayor for housing James Murray. He, Pocket chief executive Mark Vlessing and Lambeth’s cabinet member for housing Matthew Bennett spoke to the housing boffins from the stage. There’s some interesting background here. The former Mayor Johnson, through the Greater London Authority (GLA), lent Pocket, which receives no public subsidy, £22m interest-free back in 2013. The GLA and Pocket, along with London’s 33 local authorities, are also connected through Greater London Enterprise (GLE), a body which invests in and supports small businesses. The GLE bought shares in Pocket in 2013, reportedly the first time it had put money into a profit-making private housebuilder. It identified the company as “a key provider of housing for London’s intermediate market - those who earn too much to qualify for social housing, but are priced out of the open market” (see pages three and four). Murray has said the government’s 20% discounted starter homes, which can cost as much as £450,000 in London, look like struggling to make the “genuinely affordable” grade. However, Pocket’s properties, tailored to income groups who might also qualify for shared ownership homes, which Khan is keen to support, plainly find favour with him. It doubtless helps that a “restrictive covenant” applies to Pocket homes, meaning, in simple terms, that an owner can only sell on to someone else who meets the eligibility criteria agreed with the council. Pocket tells me this arrangement might need to be varied to some degree in the case of China Walk because the discounts there will be be so large, but that the general principle of a minimum 20% knock down in perpetuity will be maintained. The same does not apply to government starter homes, which can be sold by their initial owners for their full market value after just five years. Another attraction of Pocket homes for Murray and for boroughs alike is that they can be built quickly. The title of the Lambeth Walk event was: “Speeding up affordable homes for Londoners”. They can’t come speedily enough."
2016-07-23T06:00:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Nobody loves you when you're down and out,"Monday You find out who your real friends are very quickly when you’re on the way down in Westminster. Making his first appearance in the Commons since resigning as prime minister, David Cameron sheepishly took his place on the backbenches at the start of the Trident debate. A few MPs gave him a warm welcome; most ignored him. Much more important to make a good impression under Theresa May. Dave left after the opening speeches by May and Jeremy Corbyn, only to turn up again just before 10pm. He was given an understanding welcome by Ed Miliband. Nick Clegg still feels bitter about the way things turned out and kept his distance. George Osborne also turned up for the vote, looking surprisingly jolly and chatting to Alan Duncan. Either he’s a great actor or he’s enjoying the downtime. Not so Michael Gove, who has become the Typhoid Mary of the Commons. After May brutally axed every single one of his supporters from government, no one wants to be seen near him. So poor old Mike was left to sit all on his own at the far end of the chamber. Tuesday
The US press corps is renowned for being among the most deferential in the world and its members look on the British lobby hacks as a particularly feral hyena pack. So there was total amazement in the Foreign Office state room when Brad Klapper of Associated Press, the first American to ask Boris Johnson a question at his joint press conference with US secretary of state John Kerry, went for the jugular. Having begun by asking if insulting both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton was a sign of his intended diplomacy style, Klapper then accused him of telling outright lies during the Brexit campaign. At which point even Kerry began to look uncomfortable. Boris tried to make light of it in the manner in which he has shrugged off everything in the past by saying: “It was all a bit of a joke and I didn’t mean it anyway.” This looks set to be a much less successful tactic now he is foreign secretary. The very first question Theresa May was asked by the German press when she visited Angela Merkel was: “What were you thinking of when you appointed Boris Johnson to be foreign secretary?” Wednesday
The news that no football fan wanted to hear. Sam Allardyce has been chosen as the England football manager. Was there really no one else available? Even the most junior administrative post in the smallest of businesses goes through a far more rigorous and transparent interview and selection process than the English FA seems to have bothered with. The FA said it wanted to keep the period of instability to a minimum. Personally, I could have lived with the uncertainty a great deal longer, rather than suffering the certainty of Big Sam. I’ve been lucky that Big Sam has never actually managed my own team, though there have been times when the fans have been genuinely terrified that the chairman might appoint him, but I’ve had to sit through the mind-blowing dullness of watching Spurs play against a team whose sole objective is not to lose. I’d much rather Arsène Wenger had got the job. Arsenal fans moan about Wenger’s lack of trophies, but having someone in charge who knows how to lose in the quarter and semi-finals of major tournaments would have to be an improvement. Thursday
I’ve yet to download the Pokémon Go app but for the benefit of those who do care about these things, I’ve checked out if there are any Pokémon lurking around the corridors of Westminster. Technically, it is illegal to find out, as the game requires your cameraphone to be switched on, and filming is not permitted within the palace grounds. So entirely unofficially, after much investigation, I can tell you there are no Pokémon lurking anywhere so far as I can tell. But there is a PokéStop at the Oliver Cromwell statue, inside the railings near St Stephen’s Gate, though I’ve no idea if the general public can get close enough to it. There also appears to be a PokéGym at the very top of the Big Ben clock tower. Good luck with that one. Friday
As rare on the ground as Pokémon inside the Commons, are Labour MPs prepared to be seen out and about with Corbyn. At most party leadership campaign launches, the candidate comes mob-handed with the brightest and the best MPs they can rustle up. Not so Corbyn who turned up for his launch at the Institute of Education with just two, Kate Osamor and Rebecca Long Bailey, neither of whom has done anything particularly memorable since being first elected to parliament at last year’s general election. Despite this, Osamor now finds herself as shadow secretary of state for international development as more senior MPs refuse to serve under Corbyn as they believe he is unelectable. Except as party leader. We could now be entering a cycle of never-ending leadership campaigns in which Corbyn gets elected, the parliamentary Labour party passes a vote of no confidence in him and triggers another election. And so on. Things have got so bad in the shadow cabinet that ministers are having to double up; Dave Anderson is minding both Scotland and Northern Ireland while Emily Thornberry is now both shadow foreign secretary and shadow minister for Brexit. Thank God neither is that big a job. Digested week, digested: Stop Trumps"
2016-07-23T07:00:33Z,uk-news,UK news,'It's the hope that gets you': commuter diaries of the Southern rail nightmare,"Many train passengers have complaints about their local train service but an epidemic of delays and cancellations on Southern trains has driven commuters to despair. Southern, part of the wider franchise operated by Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) since 2015, has seen industrial disputes and staff shortages piled on top of major engineering works – and suffering passengers have had enough. Facing calls to be stripped of the franchise and with barely one in two trains running on time, GTR instigated an emergency timetable on Southern two weeks ago. We asked four regular commuters from Surrey and Sussex to tell us if the service has improved.. Kate Hayes
A communications director working in central London, 55, she travels in daily from the Surrey village of Nutfield, via Redhill, paying £3,776 for her annual ticket. Thursday 14 July I never used to bother claiming for late journeys in the evening; I am not hard up and I was fine rolling with the punches. But boy have I been angry! Tonight, hurrah, I have a seat on my favourite train home, the 1819. It used to be direct to Nutfield; since the reduced timetable I have to change at Redhill. There are no direct trains any more. But it is leaving on time. That, at least, is a huge improvement. Generally they don’t hold any connecting trains, and a missed connection is an hour’s wait. By 1858 we’re running 10 mins late – no hints why from the train staff … but we catch the connection and arrive only 15 minutes later than I would have been on a through train.
Friday 15 July 0634 to Redhill on time. All is running smoothly. Fridays are always quieter and chattier. I leave work earlier than I used to as the evening delays have really taken their toll. Made the 1819 from Victoria and things look good but then we are told there is no driver . At 1831 the driver turns up and off we go. The connection is held in Redhill – we run round and all make it. We celebrate only being 15 minutes late again. Monday 18 July Dodgy start to the new week. Arriving 12 mins late is depressingly acceptable by recent standards. In the evening it is pretty chaotic as expected. Barrier staff say they know nothing except that I have missed the 1932. Even by Southern standards this made me smile, because it is 1945. The 1940 leaves at 2009. Not a word from driver or conductor about the delay but I have a seat and we are moving. Tuesday 19 July Helpfully, as there are no trains to London Bridge, the Victoria train is formed of eight rather than 12 carriages. We are all standing, squashed, from Redhill. By Coulsdon South we are jammed, not just squashed . A driver apologises for the slow running of the train … there are dogs on the track. I can’t see the carriage door because I am jammed in by the lavatory. There is not an inch of space. Hot, subdued, resigned commuters get an apology at Victoria but no explanation for the lack of carriages. The evening is a disaster: the 2032 leaves at 2138. We arrive at Redhill 75 minutes late. The staff at Victoria had given up and were mostly invisible. Wednesday 20 July At home. Dentist. No train journey is some consolation for root canal treatment. Thursday 21 July Morning journey is uneventful – although there is a Southern “meet the managers” session at Victoria starting as we get in. A real human voice – the conductor, presumably – raises a significant titter in the carriage when reminding us of this, adding “assuming they arrive on time”. The managers can string a good sentence together, littered with apology and apparent sincerity. No answers though. Huw Merriman
The 43-year-old Conservative MP for Bexhill and Battle in East Sussex commutes to parliament most days on Southern and is a member of the Transport select committee, which has launched an inquiry on the rail passenger experience for commuters on Southern. His annual ticket now costs £3,776. Monday 11 July I board the 0643 from Crowborough which gets in to London Bridge on time. The rail minister, Claire Perry, appears before our committee. I explain to her that, to solve the industrial dispute, the unions want assurances over a second crew member being on the train but Southern can only agree to do so for the length of the franchise. The minister commits to the same assurance for the next franchise. This amounts to a 10- year guarantee on jobs and is good news. The minister and I then rush off to a meeting with other MPs who are waiting to be addressed by the new prime minister in waiting. With votes not expected until after 10pm, I stay in London rather than attempt a late commute and find myself stranded or on a bus journey until 1am. Tuesday 12 July Nothing eventful on my train service: my 1hr 40min commute runs to time. Wednesday 13 July Southern’s emergency service has been in play since the start of the week. In the select committee I was assured by Southern that suspending 15% of services would allow the remaining trains to run to plan. At Oxted, my train is mobbed because the next two Victoria services are cancelled owing to conductor shortages. A group of MPs whose constituencies are served by Southern obtain a debate in parliament. I ask for confirmation from the rail minister that she will be part of talks with unions and Southern to solve the industrial relations dispute. She agrees and adds that, if she thought resigning would help, she would fall on her sword. I return home on the 2008 – which runs late. Thursday 14 July I return home on the 1908 – which is running late. Friday 15 July A constituency day, driving across my 200 square miles. I am disappointed to hear that Claire Perry has resigned. She has always tried to champion our issues with Southern and is one of the most genuine ministers in Whitehall. Monday 18 July I travel in on the 0713 to London Bridge – delayed because of signalling problems. A new rail minister has been appointed; I am feeling that we will now be starting all over again. It is 30 degrees and hot. A large sinkhole opens up under the tracks at Forest Hill causing cancellation of all trains from London Bridge. Not Southern’s fault but more bad news for passengers. I stay over in London rather than risk the journey. Tuesday 19 July After votes, I head to London Bridge and board the 1908, which is actually running an hour late. We are lucky, no other Southern services seem to be running from London Bridge. In Brighton, the police have to be called due to civil unrest by commuters who have had enough. Wednesday 20 July I am speaking at a conference in my constituency with Peter Kyle, Labour MP for Hove. We both catch the 1245 to London but it is delayed so we miss our 2pm votes. At least we netted each other’s votes out! I head home on the 1908 which is … late! Hannah Little
The 23-year-old charity worker lives in Burgess Hill in West Sussex and has commuted since September to Farringdon on a combination of GTR’s Thameslink and Southern trains and pays £3,500 for an annual ticket. Tuesday 12th July I get a train about 7.30am every day to Farringdon, which gets me in the office for 9.10am if it’s on time, and back leaving at 5.30 to be at Burgess Hill about 6.50pm. I don’t have any kids or responsibilities at home so if I’m having a shit time I can’t imagine what it must be like for parents and carers. At first, the commute wasn’t too bad, but a really bad experience on a short-formed train where I fainted has made me extremely anxious about getting on busier trains. I’ve seen numerous people faint on the train. Today’s train arrived only two minutes late and I got a seat. It’s standing room only at Redhill as usual. Arrives into Farringdon eight mins late. The evening train is announced as short-formed three minutes before it arrives, so I wait for another train and change at East Croydon. There are lots of angry faces and disgruntled huffs from commuters. I arrive home 25 mins later than planned. Time lost today: 33 mins. Wednesday 13th July Relatively uneventful, two mins late in. The return service is an eight-coach train, thankfully – the train on the opposite platform to Bedford is announced as four carriages, where a group of 40 six-year-olds stands with their teachers frantically now asking how they’ll get back. Thursday 14th July Something must be wrong, on time! Friday 15th July Blissful day off. Alert on my phone tells me the train was 19 minutes late home. Monday 18th July AM – hot, humid and 13 mins late. PM – even hotter and more humid and 23 mins late. Time lost today: 36 mins Tuesday 19th July AM – 13 mins late again. PM, the hottest day of the year. Parked outside Gatwick for an hour as two concurrent signals fail and trains are just parked on the track. Air con not working properly, so crammed on a train for 2hrs 15m. I am 57 mins late in the end, arrive home over 3 hours after leaving the office. Time lost today: 70 mins. Wednesday 20th July AM – sit at Loughborough Junction for 25 mins due to a signal failure at Blackfriars. Arrive in 33 mins late and run to the office. Hot and frustrated. PM – stay for a drink after work and to de-stress from a crappy week of travelling already. Still arrive 10 mins late. Time lost this week, 149 mins (in 6 journeys!). Jonathan Ricketts
The health service manager, 34, lives in Reigate but cycles to Redhill to commute to London rather than risking the connection. He pays £3,464, including London zones 1-6. Thursday 14 July I’ve commuted for nine years on Southern: never an issue when I lived in Croydon with more trains, but I moved to Reigate in September and the commute has been nothing short of pain. I’m lucky that my partner is very understanding and stays at home with our six-month-old baby. Sadly I don’t get to see her much during the week as I often miss bedtime. Tonight I arrive at 2140 at Victoria station and decide to get a train that requires a change rather than a direct, in case the direct is delayed. Experience has taught me to get as close to home as possible while you can. Sure enough, as I wait for a connection I see that direct train was delayed: no explanation given. It is the lack of info that gets you. I get home to Redhill only 13 minutes late but in a panic not knowing when trains would run and what time I will get back. Friday 15 July Runs smoothly. Monday 18 July Should be 0704 – 0735. Reality 0711 – 0813. Home should be 18:19 – 18:58. Reality 1819 – 1912. I do a lunchtime check of trains to pick which one to aim for, as they often can be cancelled a few hours ahead. A sinkhole has been discovered at Forest Hill. No trains running from London Bridge to Redhill. Comical. Today’s board of reasons for delays are overrunning engineering works, amended timetable, sinkhole, and issues at Lewisham. Not even a mention of lack of train crew. I get on to the 1819 early, as it’s going to be busy with London Bridge passengers. I am stood jammed against a bike. Train completely packed, tempers fraying, many people unable to get on. Inevitably, the train leaves late as the guard is not on board. People are angry, unusually – normally they are just resigned and weary. I think after a relatively good week people got hope. Now it is being whipped away; as they say, it is the hope that gets you. Tuesday 19 July The 0704 gets in to London Victoria on time (well, now that they have changed the arrival time in the timetable to a little later). I go for the 1819 train from Victoria, getting on at 1815 when it is already packed. At 1820, the driver announces that the guard is stuck at Clapham and we have to wait for him before we can go. The guard announces he was delayed due to signalling problems at Cooksbridge – never heard of it. Further delay at Clapham as passenger gets her finger jammed in the door trying to cram on. At East Croydon a man loses it as people try to push past him to get off and other passengers have to calm him down. Twenty minutes late in the end."
2016-07-23T14:42:35Z,uk-news,UK news,RAF abduction plot suspects 'likely to have been part of team',"Detectives have said it is increasingly likely two men involved in an alleged attempt to kidnap an RAF serviceman last week were part of a larger team. The serviceman, who is in his late 20s, was jogging near RAF Marham, in Norfolk, on Wednesday, when two men described as being “Middle Eastern” in appearance sprang from a dark-coloured Ford Galaxy and tried to drag him into the vehicle at knifepoint. As the investigation enters its fourth day, Norfolk police said they believe there could have been more than two people in the Galaxy and have urged motorists to come forward.
Det Supt Paul Durham, from the Norfolk and Suffolk major investigation team, said: “While the victim only witnessed two attackers, there may have been more than two people in the vehicle and given the nature of the attack, it is likely they were part of a larger team. “This is important because I do not want to deter any potential witnesses from coming forward – it is the vehicle we are interested in, regardless of the number of people seen inside.” Durham said dashboard camera footage recorded by drivers in Marham or King’s Lynn area could be useful and urged motorists to review any video. The police cordon round the scene of the attempted abduction on Squires Hill was lifted on Friday and the road has now reopened. Police have appealed to shoppers at a nearby Costcutter store to come forward after CCTV revealed a number of people used the store around the time of the botched kidnapping. Detectives said they could not rule out terrorism as a motive and launched dedicated hotlines for anyone with information. One of the alleged assailants jumped out of the vehicle and tried to drag the unarmed serviceman towards the vehicle as he was going for a run near the barracks on Wednesday afternoon. He fought back and knocked the attacker to the floor, at which point the second man allegedly climbed out of the car wielding a 3in blade. As he went to help his companion, the victim ran away. At a press conference in Wymondham, Norfolk, on Thursday, Durham said the victim believed the first assailant shouted but as he had been listening to music he was unable to confirm what was said. Durham said it appeared to be a planned attack, but it was too early to be certain. “[The victim is] naturally very shaken by his ordeal, as you would expect,” he said. RAF Marham is home to four Tornado squadrons that have played a key role in the bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria. From 2018, the base will also house the F-35 Lightning II jet. Police released descriptions of the suspects. The first man was between 20 and 30, approximately 6ft tall, of athletic but stocky build, with dark hair which was long on top, and had a well-groomed beard. He was of Middle Eastern origin in appearance with a dark skin tone and wore dark casual clothing. The second was between 20 and 30 years old, but younger than the first suspect and of a slimmer build. He was approximately 5ft 10in, clean shaven with short dark hair. He was also of Middle Eastern origin in appearance and wore a white T-shirt and dark shorts."
2016-07-23T17:49:00Z,uk-news,UK news,"Think you’re hot? Spare a thought for Kuwait, as mercury hits record 54C","For those struggling to cope with Britain’s minor heatwave it’s an unfathomable idea, but temperatures in Kuwait reached 54C last week, a record for the eastern hemisphere and possibly the entire planet. A weather station in Mitribah, a remote area of north-west Kuwait, recorded the temperature on Thursday, with Basra, across the border in Iraq, reaching 53.9C (129F). The record has yet to be confirmed by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), which still has to receive the actual data from Kuwait’s meteorological department. The highest temperature ever recorded was in Death Valley, California, where the mercury is said to have risen to 56.7C on 10 July 1913. However, the validity of that figure has been debated by meteorologists.
The precise location of Mitribah is not clear. Weather station 40551 appears to be close to Camp Buehring, a US army base 40 miles from the Iraq border and close to the Udairi Range complex, a military training facility. Few people, apart from US service people, live in the area. Bedouin shepherds and camel herders are the only other inhabitants, and are seen by soldiers wandering through the firing ranges and abandoned vehicles that litter the landscape. Soldiers stationed in Kuwait made occasional forays on to social media to complain about the heat. Christan Reyes tweeted: “You know it gets hot in Kuwait when 100[F] degrees feels nice :^). the last few days it was mid-120s.” According to the UK’s Meteorological Office, the Mitribah weather station is automated. “It’s very unlikely that the site has a human observer,” a spokesman said. “Information from the station should be relayed directly to the main office. But it is a proper WMO station. “There was an issue with the sensors in 2010 but that seems to have been fixed.” The extremely high temperatures were recorded across Iraq, western Iran, Kuwait and northern Saudi Arabia. Weather Underground’s Dr Jeff Masters noticed the record-breaking quality potential in Kuwait, describing it as “a historic day”. Previously, the record was held by Aziza in Libya, with 58C, but the WMO later disqualified this as unreliable because the weather station was manned by an untrained observer and was located in an area that was unrepresentative of its surroundings. Quite how human beings can survive such extreme temperatures without the aid of air conditioning is hard to imagine. Heatwaves reaching just 45C have led to hundreds of deaths. In 2015 an estimated 780 people died in Karachi, and in Delhi hospitals often struggle to cope with the number of heatstroke cases. The dryness of the desert air is probably crucial for the Kuwaiti Bedouin. Humans can cool themselves with sweat and by sheltering from direct sunlight. In humid conditions, skin is unable to shed heat quickly enough through evaporation. In Iraq a new temperature record for two consecutive days was set at Basra airport, registering 53.9C last Wednesday and Thursday. The Iraqi government responded to the sweltering conditions by closing all government offices. The soaring temperatures have caused significant problems for the refugees who fled the fighting at Falluja. UN spokeswoman Caroline Gluck said refugees at camps in Habbaniya and Amiriyat al-Falluja were only able to sleep for one or two hours a night. Shortages of drinking water and intermittent electricity supplies were also causing health problems, said Gluck."
2016-07-23T19:13:26Z,uk-news,UK news,"Heathrow delay is harming economy, MPs warn Theresa May","Theresa May faces the first big challenge to her fledgling premiership as 36 Conservative MPs, led by the former party chairman Grant Shapps, demand an urgent decision on Heathrow airport’s expansion, warning that continued delay is damaging the UK economy.
Along with five MPs from rival parties, the Tory backbenchers claim that confidence in the government’s ambition of growing international trade is being eroded. The MPs, who belong to the cross-party British Infrastructure Group, write in a report that “a decision is needed, to show the new leadership’s mettle”. It says: “This report concludes that the government must select the new hub as a matter of extreme urgency. The decision on EU membership has not altered this fundamental fact. We believe this choice should be one of the first across the new prime minister’s desk.” Shapps, who was the party’s co-chairman until 2015, said: “Following Brexit, this decision is all the more important. We need to show Britain is open for business.” Last year, the independent Airports Commission, led by Howard Davies, recommended building a third runway at Heathrow on condition of a ban on night flights, a legally binding cap on noise, acceptable performance on air quality and legislation to rule out ever building a fourth runway. The proposed 3,500-metre runway, north of the existing two, is estimated to cost £18.6bn but would mean 250,000 more flights a year, providing a £150bn boost to GDP over 60 years and 70,000 jobs. Following the publication of the Davies report, the government postponed its decision, first to October 2015, then to June. After the EU referendum result and David Cameron’s resignation, the then transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, stated that a decision would not be made until a new leader entered office. A decision now appears to be unlikely before October. May’s government includes several members who fiercely oppose Heathrow expansion. Earlier this month, a deleted web archive revealed that the new prime minister repeatedly attacked plans for airport development in west London, while serving in the shadow cabinet under Cameron in the late 2000s. May, the MP for Maidenhead, said her constituents faced the “prospect of a reduction in their quality of life with more planes flying overhead”. The MPs write that, while not dictating to the prime minister on whether to green light expansion at Heathrow or its rival Gatwick, the decision on how to increase capacity in south-east England is now urgent:“Either Heathrow or Gatwick must expand.If Heathrow does so, it will have to fulfil various pledges towards regional aviation, including new domestic routes and a £10m route development fund. If Gatwick expands, it has similar promises to fulfil, though on a smaller scale.” The MPs say the government should also look to expand regional airports and cut airport passenger duty, which is “many times the rate of similar taxes in European competitors and trading partners such as the US. ”. They add: “The tax rate is higher than in any other country except Chad.” Airport passenger duty (APD) hinders exports, distorts the market and hits small carriers hard. As the UK seeks to forge new trading relationships post-Brexit, we can’t afford to maintain any barriers to trade, including APD. BIG believes that a lowered rate, by boosting the wider economy, would eventually be cost neutral for the Treasury.”"
2016-07-23T20:07:03Z,uk-news,UK news,"Theresa May wrong to link ‘honour’ killings and terrorism, say campaigners","Women in the UK are at risk of the “honour”-based violence that saw socialite Qandeel Baloch murdered in Pakistan by her brother, say campaigners who accuse Theresa May of failing to put into practice advice the government was given last year in a report on the issue.
The government has now missed all three deadlines for the recommendations made by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) in last December’s report, The Depth of Dishonour, looking at the police handling of such crimes. It found that only three of the 43 police forces in England and Wales were fully prepared to deal with “honour” offences, despite the high-profile murders of Shafilea Ahmed, a 17-year-old from Warrington killed by her parents in 2003, and Banaz Mahmod, a 20-year-old Iraqi Kurd from London, who was raped and murdered by her family in 2006. “I’m so disappointed the government appears to be stepping back, rather than stepping forward,” said human rights activist Diana Nammi. “Theresa May initiated this work when in the Home Office. It was groundbreaking. Now all that expertise is gathering dust. An oversight committee should have been appointed in March, yet nothing has happened. She hasn’t seen this through.” Nammi, of the group Ikwro, which runs a refuge and helpline along with counselling services for women and men in Arabic, Kurdish and Farsi in the UK, wants May to apologise for her suggestion in her first prime minister’s questions last week that the crimes against women be treated as terror-related. May’s comments were in response to Nusrat Ghani, Conservative MP for Wealden, who takes the opposite view to Nammi and wants the term “honour killing” abandoned. Instead she wants it described as an act of terrorism.
In her question to May, Ghani pointed to the 11,000 “honour” crimes in the UK recorded by police in the five years to 2014 and referred to the killing in Pakistan. “Extremism takes many forms, from the atrocity in Nice to the violent murder of Qandeel Baloch by her own brother justified as an ‘honour’ killing. Does the prime minister agree that such crimes are in fact acts of terror, not honour, and will she therefore direct that her new government shows the lead by ending use of the word ‘honour’ to describe these vile acts?” May said: “Extremism does take many forms. That’s why in the government’s counter-extremism strategy we’re looking very widely across the breadths of issues of extremism, including tackling the root causes of some practices within communities, such as the so-called ‘honour’-based violence. I absolutely agree there is absolutely no honour in so-called ‘honour’ based violence.” Nammi said the Home Office should not be misleading people and communities by linking gender violence in families to terrorism and extremism. “It is a cheap shot,” she said. “It will stop women coming forward if they think that they are somehow going to be treated, or their families treated, as a terrorist. This is completely wrong. “Obviously terrorists control women through violence, but women are at risk in Christian communities, in Sikh communities, in Muslim communities.” There is no honour in these crimes, but it is a term now understood across languages and cultures. It is the same words used in Farsi, in Urdu, in Arabic. This is a term women are familiar with; they know what it means. If they start hearing the word terrorism, they will not understand. This is a gender issue, not a counter-terrorism issue. We have to deal with and fight terrorism but we cannot link it to this violence against women.”"
2016-07-23T23:05:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Trident workers could be better employed elsewhere | the big issue,"I am inclined to agree with Tom Watson about Trident, but he is wrong to use the argument that jobs depend on it (“We must renew Trident – for economic and military reasons”). If Trident were not built, the resources that would have been spent on it would still be there. It would, of course, be soul destroying simply to continue paying those who had lost their jobs: other work should be found. After the second world war, redundant armament/aircraft factories made huge numbers of much-needed houses – “prefabs” – which, in spite of initial criticism, were very successful and lasted much longer than intended. In the present state of housing in the UK, something like that is needed: the building industry seems unable to cope. Geoffrey Bailey Taunton
Tom Watson approves of the UK’s weapons of mass destruction because they create jobs, make us safe and defend the countries of eastern Europe from being overrun by Russia. He tells us that “Putin’s Russia looms… Britain must play its part in holding it at bay”. In the unlikely event of Russia trying to invade a country in eastern Europe, would the UK attack it with nuclear weapons, thereby starting a world nuclear war that would lay waste to a substantial part of the planet? One would hope not. But we do not know who in the UK will have their finger on the nuclear button in future years. The only way to be sure of avoiding this catastrophe is not to have these weapons. We have an ample arsenal of “conventional” weapons to dissuade aggressors. Mr Watson tells us that the construction and replacement of Trident “will directly support more than 30,000 jobs in the UK”. Is manufacturing weapons of mass destruction the only way these jobs can be created? If we had 30,000 people manufacturing the machines we need to create sustainable energy, would this not be a more sane enterprise? Would this not ensure more job satisfaction in the workforce? Mr Watson claims we need these Armageddon weapons for our security. If that is the case, do the other 183 states on the planet that do not have nuclear weapons also need them for their security? Jim McCluskey Twickenham Reading the various Observer articles about Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the Labour party, you’d wonder why any sensible or decent person could ever support such an apparent disaster, at times portrayed as an inefficient, bumbling Mr Bean, otherwise as some sort of sinister, leftwing fascist. It’s all surprisingly simple and obvious, really – it’s because of the policies he represents. For instance, after years of neglect by Tory and New Labour governments, there is a desperate need for a massive programme of council house building. Corbyn has wholeheartedly supported council housing for years, whereas other Labour leaders have virtually ignored it. Supposedly leftwing Ed Miliband did not specifically mention council housing once during the whole of his dismal election campaign. Of the leadership contenders, only Corbyn opposes the massively expensive, strategically useless, deeply immoral Trident weapons of mass destruction and supports the very popular demand for the renationalisation of the rail industry. Along with a clear, unequivocal rejection of austerity measures, which have victimised the most vulnerable and prolonged the recession, these are the kind of issues that have led many of us to support Corbyn.

2016-07-24T15:06:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Bather feared dead after incident off Sussex coast,"One person is missing, feared dead, and two others have been transferred to hospital after an incident off the Sussex coast at Camber Sands. Emergency services were called at around 12.30pm to reports of a man missing while swimming. Two men were rescued from the water and given lifesaving treatment on the beach after suffering cardiac arrests. Both were airlifted to hospital. A third man is still missing. Rescue teams from Dungeness and Rye, coastguard rescue helicopters from Lydd and Solent, Rye RNLI lifeboat, beach lifeguards and police were all involved in the search, which was eventually called off at about 9.30pm on Sunday. Sussex police said that the three victims got into trouble as a result of the changing tide. Rumours that they had been caught in a smack of jellyfish were unfounded.
A spokesman for South East Coast Ambulance Service confirmed that two people had been rescued from the water and airlifted to William Harvey hospital in Ashford, having been resuscitated. He said both were in a life-threatening condition and that efforts to save their lives continued as they were on their way to the hospital. One was taken in the air ambulance, the other was transported by the coastguard’s helicopter, he said. Inspector Mark Evans, of Sussex police, said: “We are working to establish who these two men are and trace their family and friends. We are continuing to support the coastguard and RNLI as they search for the 19-year-old man from London who who is still missing. “It seems this [was] three people who got into trouble while swimming [as a result of] the changing tides and coastline.”"
2016-07-24T23:01:22Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May to rule out return of border checks between UK and Ireland,"Theresa May will reassure the first minister of Northern Ireland that there will be no return to border checks for people entering the UK from the Republic of Ireland despite Britain’s vote to leave the EU.
The prime minister will make the pledge to Arlene Foster during a visit to Belfast on Monday, during which she will also promise to engage with the region’s devolved administration in preparation for Brexit negotiations. Speaking ahead of the trip that completes a tour of all four parts of the UK within the first two weeks of her premiership, May said: “I made clear when I became prime minister that I place particular value on the precious bonds between the nations of the United Kingdom. “I want to assure the people of Northern Ireland that I will lead a government [that] works for everyone across all parts of the United Kingdom, and that Northern Ireland is a special and valued part of that union.” May said she wanted to underline her commitment to the Belfast agreement, arguing that “peace and stability in Northern Ireland will always be of the highest priority for my government”. She added: “I have been clear that we will make a success of the UK’s departure from the European Union. That means it must work for Northern Ireland too, including in relation to the border with the Republic. We will engage with all of Northern Ireland’s political parties as we prepare for that negotiation.” It is understood that May will support the position of the Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, that there will be no “hard border” between the two countries, which have a common travel area. Critics will question how that would be possible given the strong desire, particularly in England, to restrict freedom of movement after Brexit. There are currently no checks when someone passes from Ireland into the UK. Two days before the EU referendum last month, May said it was “inconceivable” that there would be no hard border in the event of Brexit. She told the BBC: “If we were out of the European Union with tariffs on exporting goods into the EU, there’d have to be something to recognise that between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. “And if you pulled out of the EU and came out of free movement, then how could you have a situation where there was an open border with a country that was in the EU and had access to free movement?” The debate over the Irish border comes as some Conservative MPs on the right of the party hit back at the suggestion that EU officials are considering plans to allow Britain to retain single market access alongside a seven-year emergency brake on freedom of movement. John Redwood MP said any such deal would betray the referendum result. “The UK did not recently vote for a slightly beefed up version of Mr Cameron’s attempted renegotiation with the EU. We voted to leave, to take back control of our laws, our money and our borders. Those phrases were repeated throughout the leave campaign, heard and understood by many, and approved by the majority of voters,” he wrote on a blog. “The rest of the EU is missing the point. There should be no negotiation over taking back control of these important matters.” Redwood said that when the Conservatives lost the general election in 2005, they did not try to overturn the result, take anyone to court or demand a rerun. “We accepted the verdict of the UK voters.” Ahead of May’s visit to Belfast, a legal challenge to Brexit is set to be launched in Northern Ireland by a cross-community group including former justice minister David Ford. The group’s solicitors have said they will bring a judicial review before the high court in Belfast unless May guarantees certain legal safeguards, in particular the statutory recognition of the Good Friday Agreement and that any Brexit deal has the assent of the Stormont assembly. The Green party leader, Steven Agnew, and the Social Democratic and Labour party leader, Colum Eastwood, are part of the legal challenge as well as senior Sinn Fein Stormont assembly member John O’Dowd. The letter, which will go to May and the Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, also demands that any agreement satisfies the requirements of EU law incorporated into the law of Northern Ireland, and says lawyers will take any aspect of their case which refers to EU law all the way to the Europe’s highest court, the court of justice of the EU."
2016-07-25T00:35:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Cancer charity fundraiser Kate Granger dies aged 34,"Kate Granger, a doctor who raised £250,000 for a cancer charity while terminally ill died on Saturday. Granger, 34, a doctor specialising in elderly medicine, died “peacefully and surrounded by loved ones”, her husband Chris Pointon confirmed on social media. Granger, from East Ardley near Leeds, was diagnosed with cancer in 2011, aged 29. Her health deteriorated in recent weeks and she spent the last part of her life being cared for at St Gemma’s Hospice in Leeds. She died on her and Pointon’s 11th wedding anniversary. Pointon announced her death on Twitter, saying: “Peacefully & surrounded by loved ones @grangerkate passed away yesterday. RIP my soul mate & TY. Love u 4ever...”
Granger started fundraising for the Yorkshire Cancer Centre, setting herself the goal of raising £250,000, a target she reached just three days before her death. Less than a week before her death, Pointon posted on social media, asking for people to help raise the final £28,000 needed to meet the target, which was met a few days later. As part of her fundraising efforts, Granger did a tandem sky dive and swum the length of the English Channel and her husband did a sponsored trek along the Great Wall of China. Granger shared her experience of cancer treatment quite publicly – blogging about the experience of having cancer, writing two books about the experience – The Other Side and The Brighter Side - and sharing her experiences on social media. She also started the #hellomynameis campaign, which aimed to improve the way doctors and nurses speak to patients. Granger described how during a hospital stay in 2013, she noticed that many staff looking after her, including the doctor who told her that her cancer had spread, didn’t introduce themselves before delivering her care. Granger said the campaign, primarily conducted through social media, was about more than just courtesy, but was the “first rung on the ladder to providing truly person-centred, compassionate care”. The campaign won the support of more than 400,000 doctors, nurses, therapists and porters across 90 NHS organisations. Granger was awarded an MBE for her services to medicine last year."
2016-07-25T06:00:30Z,uk-news,UK news,HMRC cleaners in Merseyside to strike in battle over pay,"Cleaners working at HMRC offices in Merseyside are going on strike on Monday in a fight to be paid the “national living wage”. Thirty workers employed by ISS to clean the buildings via a complex subcontracting chain are arguing that they are no better off despite the rise in mandatory hourly rate, which from April guaranteed workers £7.20 an hour, because their employer offset the increase by cutting workers’ hours. HMRC is the government department responsible for enforcing the NLW. Most of HMRC’s cleaners are on “poverty wages”, according to the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), and several qualify for benefits in the form of working tax credits. Two work for HMRC directly but top up their wages with second jobs as cleaners in the offices in the evenings after work. The PCS group secretary, Martin Kelsey, said ISS had made “cynical mathematical calculations to avoid allowing some of their lowest paid workers the meagre benefit arising from the new NLW”.
“They are a multinational corporate making hundreds of millions of profit a year refusing to pay a few people on absolute poverty wages a few pence an hour more. HMRC should not be in business with them directly or indirectly,” Kelsey added. The union maintains that the cut in hours has left workers under pressure to do more for less and unable to deliver a proper service. The dispute highlights the difficulty governments face in tackling low pay when a large proportion of employment is outsourced and chains of responsibility are opaque. George Osborne, the former chancellor, introduced the NLW of £7.20 an hour for those over 25 in April, saying people in the UK needed a pay rise, and that he wanted to reduce taxpayers’ bill for welfare payments to those in work but on pay low enough to qualify for working tax credits. HMRC said the pay of cleaners in its offices was not its responsibility. “HMRC greatly appreciates the work cleaning staff do in our buildings. As cleaning staff are employed by an external contractor who set the terms and conditions of their employment, HMRC has no involvement in this process over their pay,” a spokesperson said. The origins of the arrangement for HMRC buildings date back to 2001 when the department sold off its estate of more than 600 buildings to Mapeley, a Bermuda-based offshore company, as part of a private finance initiative. The deal was later condemned by MPs as bad value and as undermining HMRC’s position as a tax collector. HMRC leases back buildings from a subsidiary of Mapeley, and a further subsidiary, Salisbury FM, is contracted by Mapeley to manage the day-to-day running of the offices. Salisbury in turn subcontracts the cleaning to ISS, whose headquarters are in Denmark. Although little known, ISS is one of the world’s largest outsourcing companies, employing over 500,000 people in 77 countries. It doubled its profits last year to £250m and increased its dividend by 51% earlier this year. But the company declined to discuss whether its contract to clean HMRC offices allowed for increases in pay mandated by government. “Our contract with Salisbury is commercially sensitive and details are not made public. We do however have the necessary checks in place with our client to ensure the cleaning provision targets are reached and maintained,” it said in a statement. A spokesperson for Salisbury FM declined to comment on questions about provisions in its contract with ISS for an increase in costs as a result of the NLW, saying that workers’ terms were a private matter between them and ISS and that Salisbury’s contract with ISS was also private and confidential. Mapeley did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The HMRC cleaning dispute is one of several in which workers are fighting cuts to their terms and conditions imposed to offset the introduction of the NLW. A spokesperson for ISS denied that the cleaning service had been affected and said that it still met the specification in its contract with HMRC: “We are of course very disappointed that following several rounds of discussion, our cleaning people at HMRC decided upon this course of action. “We remain committed to seeking resolution to the various concerns raised by all of the relevant suppliers and stakeholders involved in this contract.”"
2016-07-25T08:04:37Z,uk-news,UK news,Prince Harry: I regret not talking about my mother's death sooner,"Prince Harry has drawn on his experience of losing his mother to highlight mental health issues, revealing that he regrets not talking sooner about how her death affected him. The 31-year-old spoke to footballer Rio Ferdinand, a father of three whose wife, Rebecca Ellison, died from cancer last year, about dealing with the death of a parent. Harry, who first spoke publicly three years ago about the impact of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in a car crash in 1997, when he was 12, told the former England and Manchester United footballer: “You know, I really regret not ever talking about it.” The exchange took place at a Kensington Palace barbecue attended by a number of sports stars hosted by Heads Together, set up by Harry with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to bring together eight mental health charities and organisations with the aim of tackling the stigma around depression and other mental health problems. Ferdinand, the athletes Dame Kelly Holmes and Iwan Thomas, and the cyclist Victoria Pendleton were among the guests. The prince told the BBC: “The key message here today is that everyone can suffer from mental health. Whether you are a member of the royal family, whether you are a soldier, whether you are a sports star, whether you are a team sport, individual sport, whether you are a white van driver, whether you’re a mother, father, a child, it doesn’t really matter.”
Ferdinand later told the broadcaster: “He’s [Harry] gone through different stages in his life that my kids are going to be going towards. So, to get some of his experiences is very rewarding for me and very educational in many ways.” Harry said later: “It is very easy to look at someone like Rio Ferdinand and say, ‘You get paid all the money in the world, you are a successful footballer, you have fast cars’. But at the end of the day his wife was snatched from him at an early stage of his life with her. So, of course he is going to suffer, it doesn’t matter if he has an amazing job.” The prince said the event was an opportunity to show that even “unflappable” sporting personalities could experience mental health problems. He told BBC Breakfast: “It is OK to suffer, but as long as you talk about it. It is not a weakness. Weakness is having a problem and not recognising it and not solving it.”He also spoke to Holmes, who won a gold medal at the 2004 Olympics in the 800 metres and 1,500 metres, and who revealed her experience of depression in her autobiography. She said: “I had depression going through my athletics career, no one knew at all what I was going through.” She said it had only been in the last few years that she had been more open. Thomas advised anyone experiencing mental health issues: “Don’t feel embarrassed, don’t feel shameful about it if you deem it as a weakness, as I did. “I felt mentally I was weak, because I had gone from someone who was mentally tough, mentally very strong, someone physically strong, to someone who felt vulnerable and weak. And you are not weak. You are just going through a tough time in your life, where, if you can talk to someone, hopefully, they will help you through the other side.” The prince has been a visible champion of taboo subjects. Earlier this month he won praise from the Terrence Higgins Trust for taking an HIV test live on Facebook, with the charity describing it as a “groundbreaking moment in the fight against HIV”. His role in attempting to destigmatise HIV/Aids has been compared to that of his late mother, who was photographed meeting Aids patients in the 1980s in an effort to change public opinion over how the virus was transmitted.
Since leaving the army, Harry has also campaigned to break the stigma of mental health issues that often plague war veterans as they make the transition back into civilian life. He founded the Invictus Games for wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women. Describing what inspired the games, he told Good Morning America host Robin Roberts in March it was after he was withdrawn from the frontline in Afghanistan when news of his secret first deployment leaked. Again, drawing on his personal experience, he said he felt “broken” at having to leave his men behind. “And then I find myself on a plane and while I am sitting there I look through the curtain to the front and there are three of our lads wrapped up in plastic, missing limbs,” he said. “One of the guys [is] clutching a little test tube of shrapnel that had been removed from his head, and he was in a coma clutching this. “And I suddenly thought to myself, people don’t get to see this. In the whole of those 10 weeks, I never saw the injury part, I only heard about it. That’s how it all started for me. It’s like these people are role models and they need to be celebrated more among society,” he said."
2016-07-25T10:10:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Manchester warns funding for 'wonder material' graphene at risk after Brexit,"Treasury ministers have been urged to back Britain’s world-leading research on graphene, the “wonder material” first discovered in Manchester, amid concerns the city’s university is set to lose £1m a year in EU funding after the UK’s vote for Brexit. Leading scientists warned that Britain is likely to lose its place in the EU’s groundbreaking Graphene Flagship project, the biggest research scheme of its kind, following the result of the EU referendum last month. Leaving the Europe-wide project would also mean losing £1m a year in funding for the University of Manchester, where the material was first isolated by two Nobel prize-winning scientists in 2004.
Andy Burnham MP, Labour candidate to be mayor of Greater Manchester, said: “EU membership was vital to the north-west and Manchester economy and that is why I have already asked Theresa May to plug any potential gaps. “Europe helped to keep Manchester and our universities at the cutting edge of research and development, including funds to boost the National Graphene Institute [at the University of Manchester]. The new PM and chancellor must ensure that the UK government, not only the Chinese one, steps in and supports Manchester’s economy.” The one atom-thick material is 200 times stronger than steel and conducts electricity better than any material known to man. It was first isolated by Konstantin Novoselov and Andre Geim, who won the Nobel prize in physics for their work in 2010. Scientists believe graphene has thousands of potential commercial applications, including being used in the next generation of aeroplanes and high-speed trains.
Prof Robert Young, who leads the research project at the University of Manchester, raised concerns about the future of the EU funding as he announced new Chinese investment in the National Graphene Institute. The deal, thought to be worth between £2m and £3m, is a five-year research partnership between China’s Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials and researchers in Manchester. Young said there could be graphene-modified composites in aircraft within 10 years, including in the wings of Airbus planes made in Broughton, Chester. With a budget of €1bn (£830m), the EU Graphene Flagship launched in 2013 and is Europe’s biggest ever joint research project with 150 groups across 23 countries.
Young said: “We have three researchers from the Graphene Flagship, which is a European Union project, and we’ve got two years’ funding on that that may not be renewed … We don’t know what’s going to happen. “I guess the government might come up with some system where EU projects are funded by the UK government rather than money from the EU. I would urge them to continue that. UK universities do quite well out of European research funding – we get €1.60 for every €1 we put in. That’s a possible threat but we don’t know how that will pan out.” Prof Richard Jones, a leading physicist and pro-vice-chancellor of research and innovation at the University of Sheffield, said: “The EU Graphene Flagship is a very big project and it’s not just Manchester, there are a number of other universities that benefit from it. It matters for money, but it also matters for those connections across Europe. I would be very worried indeed if I was in Manchester’s place about that.” The Chinese investment comes as a delegation of Manchester’s business and civic leaders, including the council chief executive, Sir Howard Bernstein, and the council leader, Sir Richard Leese, fly to Beijing this week in an attempt to secure further Chinese investment in the city. Manchester airport last year launched the first ever direct flight from the north of England to Beijing, which was unveiled by David Cameron and Xi Jinping during the Chinese president’s state visit to the UK in October."

2016-07-25T11:43:29Z,uk-news,UK news,IPCC investigates 11 for mishandling Greville Janner child sex abuse claims,"The police watchdog is investigating 11 people over the alleged mishandling by Leicestershire police of child sexual abuse allegations against the late Labour peer Greville Janner. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it had served criminal and gross misconduct notices on 11 individuals. It did not name those involved. Lord Janner, who had dementia, died last year aged 87, while awaiting a trial of the facts for 22 alleged sexual offences against nine men and boys. The IPCC launched an independent investigation into the handling of allegations by Leicestershire police in April last year. Janner was subject to three police investigations between 1991 and 2007. In a statement released on Monday, the IPCC said: “The Independent Police Complaints Commission has served criminal and gross misconduct notices on 11 individuals as it continues to investigate Leicestershire police’s handling of child sexual abuse allegations made against the late Greville Janner. “The IPCC has decided not to name any subjects to ensure that the ongoing criminal investigation is not compromised.” Criminal and misconduct notices are formal warnings notifying the recipients that they are under investigation for either criminal or gross misconduct offences. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Leicestershire police were severely criticised in an independent report by Richard Henriques, a retired judge, for mishandling investigations into the peer. The report showed in sometimes harrowing detail how former residents of children’s homes repeatedly made claims of abuse to officials in authority but their claims were not acted upon. Janner was the MP for Leicester West for 27 years and stood down at the 1997 election. He was eventually charged with 22 offences relating to nine men and boys following another inquiry in 2013. His family insist he is innocent of any wrongdoing.
Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, decided in April last year that his ill health meant he should not be charged. But a month later that decision was overturned by an independent review and Saunders reversed her decision, bringing charges against Janner to bring about a trial of the facts. Janner appeared at Westminster magistrates’ court in August and appeared to be confused when asked to confirm his identity, saying “Ooh, it’s wonderful.” After a number of court hearings, Mr Justice Openshaw ultimately determined Janner was unfit to plead and a trial of the facts was ordered. In a “trial of facts”, the jury is asked to decide – on the basis of evidence adduced by prosecution lawyers and by lawyers who put the case for the defence – whether or not the accused did the acts he or she was charged with."

The Man Engine, billed as the largest mechanical puppet to have been built in the UK, will travel 130 miles across Devon and Cornwall during the next fortnight. It has been constructed to mark the 10th anniversary of the west Devon and Cornwall mining landscape being added to the list of Unesco world heritage sites. As it moves from place to place in crawling mode, the Man Engine is the size of a double decker bus, but it becomes nearly three times as tall when it extends to its full height of about 12 metres (39ft) with the help of puppeteers and mechanised parts. The Man Engine, which was commissioned by the Cornish mining world heritage partnership, was shown to the public in Tavistock on Monday and greeted by choirs, visitors and local people performing the Cornish mining chant Haka Balweyth. It will trundle through 10 mining areas and form the centrepiece of theatrical shows and cultural events.
Engineered in Cornwall, the puppet’s rocking neck is a reminder of a giant beam engine, while the shoulders look like sheave wheels on mining headgear and the hands resemble 20th-century excavators. Will Coleman, the artistic director of Golden Tree Productions, which created the engine, said the figure was designed to be a reminder of thousands of years of mining history in Cornwall and the region’s geology. “Our horn-shaped granite kingdom of Cornwall is a tiny 0.002% of the planet’s surface, yet beneath our rocky shores can be found samples of more than 90% of all mineral species ever identified. Millions of years in the making, the geology of Cornwall is unique,” he said. “This unbelievable geological treasure has powered the Cornish people’s endeavour through 4,000 years of mining history: innovation, triumph and heartbreak. I was brought up on the banks of the river Tamar with the stories and the legacy of Cornish mining all around me. The landscape is deeply rooted in the impacts of that industry, and in the successes and the struggles of the real people whose lives shaped our Cornish mining story.” A series of events will coincide with the procession of the Man Engine. In Liskeard, the first Cornish town to receive the puppet, a street mural is being painted to mark the event, while the Man Engine will be greeted by brass bands on Bodmin Moor. On the penultimate evening of its journey, in Penzance, a 7.5-metre (25ft) tall Humphry Davy puppet will appear and parade through the chemist’s hometown to meet the Man Engine, offering it the gift of a huge Davy safety lamp, which safeguarded the lives of millions of miners. Cllr Julian German, the chairman of the Cornish mining world heritage partnership, said: “Our Cornish mining ancestors were international entrepreneurs, who propelled mining into a new industrial era on a worldwide scale. It wasn’t an easy journey for anyone then, and in many ways, it is a difficult history. “Special projects like the towering Man Engine show we still share this same gritty ambition and ingenuity with our ancestors.”"
2016-07-25T13:40:24Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May tries to ease 'hard border' fears on Northern Ireland visit,"Theresa May has vowed to maintain peace and stability in Northern Ireland despite fears that Britain’s vote to leave the EU will lead to the creation of a “hard border” with the Irish Republic. On her first visit to the province as prime minister, May tried to assuage concerns about a fortified frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. May, while campaigning for a remain vote as home secretary during the referendum campaign, had said it was inconceivable that border arrangements between the two could remain unchanged in the event of a Brexit vote.
Speaking in Belfast on Monday, the prime minister said: “No one wants a return to the border of the past.” May was referring to the state of the border during the Troubles, when hundreds of rural roads were blocked by security barriers and there were armed vehicle checkpoints, and permanent border posts manned by police and British troops. May described her talks with the deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin, and Arlene Foster, the first minister and Democratic Unionist party leader, as “very constructive, positive”. “What we do want to do is to find a way through this that is going to work and deliver a practical solution for everybody – as part of the work that we are doing to ensure that we make a success of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union – and that we come out of this with a deal which is in the best interests of the whole of the United Kingdom,” she said. May will hold further talks on the implications of the Brexit vote for the island of Ireland when she meets the taoiseach, Enda Kenny, in London on Tuesday. The Irish government is increasingly hopeful that it will be able to retain both free movement and a customs union across the border with Northern Ireland, but the shape of any deal will depend on the kind of wider Brexit sought by May and the willingness of the rest of the EU to be flexible. Kenny is expected to say he is not pushing May to trigger article 50 immediately, so giving the UK government time to think through the implications. May’s 90-minute meeting in Belfast with the leaders of the Northern Ireland executive coincided with a legal challenge being mounted by a coalition of pro-EU human rights and community groups in the province. They are attempting to overturn the Brexit vote so the region can remain in the EU. However, May repeated her assertion on entering Downing Street that her government will begin the process of leaving the EU.
“Brexit means Brexit, but we will be making a success of it and I am clear that the Northern Ireland executive and the other devolved governments will be involved in our discussions as we set forward the UK position,” she said. McGuinness said he told the prime minister that in terms of Brexit, there was “no good news for the people of the north of Ireland”. On Europe, McGuinness said he, rather than the pro-Brexit Foster, spoke for the majority of people – “unionists, nationalists and republicans” – who voted to remain in the EU. In the referendum on 23 June, 56% of those who voted in Northern Ireland wanted to stay in the EU. Foster said she was delighted that May regarded Northern Ireland as a strategic part of the United Kingdom. “No one wants to see the borders of the 70s, 80s, 90s [again],” she said.The first minister went on to say she would object to any special restrictions being imposed on Northern Irish citizens travelling to other parts of the UK. “There must be no internal borders within the United Kingdom. She [May] responded positively to that. There will be no internal borders in the United Kingdom,” Foster said. Foster rejected McGuinness’s claim to speak for the majority of people when it came to the EU. She said the UK as a whole had voted to leave the EU and that this would have to be respected."
2016-07-25T14:32:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Suspect in RAF kidnap attempt may have facial injury after headbutt,"Detectives investigating an alleged attempt to kidnap an RAF serviceman believe one of the suspects may have a visible facial injury after revealing the victim headbutted and punched him to the ground. The serviceman, in his late 20s, was jogging near RAF Marham in Norfolk on Wednesday when two men described as “Middle Eastern” in appearance sprang from a dark-coloured Ford Galaxy and tried to drag him into the vehicle at knifepoint. The victim managed to fight off one attacker but did not cause him to bleed, contrary to some reports, Norfolk police have said. However, the main suspect may have swelling and bruising around his eye socket after he was headbutted and punched by the serviceman. Det Supt Paul Durham, from the Norfolk and Suffolk major investigation team, who is leading the inquiry, said: “The victim managed to fight off his attacker and headbutted him, we believe around the eye socket, so it is possible he suffered swelling and bruising in this area. “He was then punched, which caused him to fall to the ground. Clearly the extent of his injuries is unknown, however, we do not believe either attack caused the suspect to bleed, contrary to reports circulating in the media. “If you know someone who matches the description of our suspect, who has a similar injury, then I would urge you to contact my officers.” On Saturday, Norfolk police said it is increasingly likely the two men involved in the alleged kidnap attempt were part of a larger team and there could have been more than two men in the car. Police have appealed for dashboard camera footage recorded by drivers in the Marham or King’s Lynn areas and also asked shoppers at a nearby Costcutter store to come forward after CCTV revealed a number of people used the store at the time of the botched kidnapping. Detectives previously said they could not rule out terrorism as a motive and launched dedicated hotlines for anyone with information. As the serviceman knocked one of the alleged assailants to the ground, the second man reportedly climbed out of the car wielding a 3in blade. As he went to help his companion, the victim ran away. Police released descriptions of the suspects. The first man was between 20 and 30, approximately 6ft tall, of athletic but stocky build, with dark hair, which was long on top, and had a well-groomed beard. He was of Middle Eastern origin in appearance with a dark skin tone and wore dark casual clothing. The second was between 20 and 30 years old but younger than the first suspect and of slimmer build. He was approximately 5ft 10in, clean shaven with short dark hair. He was also of Middle Eastern origin in appearance and wore a white T-shirt and dark shorts. RAF Marham is home to four Tornado squadrons that have played a key role in the bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria. From 2018, the base will also house the F-35 Lightning II jet."
2016-07-25T16:37:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Alleged serial killer charged over attacks on eight other men,"An alleged serial killer accused of drugging and murdering four men he met on gay dating websites faces 17 further charges related to attacks on eight other men, it can now be reported. Stephen Port, 41, who is accused of luring men to his flat in east London before killing them, was originally charged with four counts of murder and four counts of administering a poison. He is also accused of six further counts of administering a poison, seven of rape and four sexual assaults against another eight men, the details of which were until Monday covered by reporting restrictions. Port, of Barking, east London, pleaded not guilty to all the charges, which allegedly took place between 2011 and 2015, at the Old Bailey on Monday. Appearing in court via videolink from Belmarsh prison, wearing smart black trousers and a light shirt, he spoke only to confirm his name and enter pleas during the brief hearing. He sat with his hands clasped in front of him as each of the charges was read out in court. Court hearings were delayed for six months because of the scale of the police investigation into his alleged crimes. Mr Justice Openshaw joined the two indictments and said Port faces a 10-week trial commencing on 4 October. The former bus garage chef allegedly met the men on gay websites and invited them to his house, where he is said to have poisoned them with the party drug GHB. Four of his alleged victims, all in their 20s, suffered overdoses and were dumped in or near a churchyard in east London. Port is alleged to have met at least some of the men on the dating app Grindr. The first alleged victim, Anthony Walgate, 23, was found dead on Cooke Street on 19 June 2014. He was a fashion and design student at Middlesex University who was originally from Hull but living in Barnet. Gabriel Kovari, 22, was found by a dog walker near St Margaret’s churchyard on 28 August 2014. Originally from Slovakia, he lived in Lewisham, south London. Just under a month later, on 20 September, the same dog walker discovered the body of Daniel Whitworth, 21, from Gravesend, Kent, near the churchyard. On 14 September last year, Jack Taylor, 25, a forklift truck driver from Dagenham, was found dead near the abbey ruins close to North Street. The deaths were not initially linked but after further investigation they were referred to the Metropolitan police homicide and major crime command on 14 October last year. The force has referred its handling of the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. This article was amended on Tuesday 26 July to correct the name of the high court judge, now properly referred to as Mr Justice Openshaw."
2016-07-25T17:17:57Z,uk-news,UK news,Bradford woman's death in Pakistan investigated after 'honour' killing claims,"Police are investigating the death of a British woman in Pakistan after her husband claimed she was the victim of an “honour” killing for marrying a man from outside the family allegedly against her parents’ wishes. Samia Shahid, a beauty therapist from Bradford, died on Wednesday while visiting relatives in Pandori village near Mangla Dam in northern Punjab, the Foreign Office confirmed. Shahid’s local MP, Naz Shah, has demanded that authorities in Pakistan exhume her body and commission an independent autopsy. The police officer leading the investigation in Pakistan told the Guardian he had sent samples from the body to the country’s top forensics lab in Lahore on Tuesday. Mohammad Aqeel Abbas, the station house officer for Jhelum district who is investigating the case, said a postmortem was carried out immediately after Shahid died and she was then buried in her village graveyard. There were no visible injuries or signs of violence on her body, he said.
Shahid’s husband, Syed Mukhtar Kazam, claimed he was told the “happy and bubbly” 28-year-old had suffered a fatal heart attack. He received the news last week while in Dubai, where the couple lived together. A source close to the family told the Guardian they believed she died after an asthma attack. Her husband said he feared she had been killed by her family, who he says refused to accept their relationship, partly as he was an “outsider”. Shortly before Shahid and Kazam married at Leeds town hall in September 2014, she had left her first husband, a first cousin from their village in Pakistan. The family strongly deny Kazam’s claims. Her father, who is in Pakistan, said the allegations made by Kazam were “lies and allegations” against him. “An investigation is under way and if I am found guilty I am ready for every kind of punishment,” he said. “My daughter was living a very peaceful and happy life. She had come to Pakistan on her own and was not under any pressure from her family.” “This is a terrible tragedy but she died of natural causes,” said Mohammed Ali, a cousin in Bradford. “The family did a postmortem. There’s no evidence whatsoever of murder.” He disputed Kazam’s claim of marriage, referring to him as “that boy, Samia’s so-called husband”.
A family friend in Bradford said on Sunday the family were not happy when Shahid married Kazam but had learned to accept their relationship because they loved her. The Guardian has seen a witness statement submitted to Pakistani police by Shahid’s father, Mohammed Shahid, in which he refers to his daughter’s husband as her cousin Mohammed Shakeel, not Kazam. The Guardian has also seen a copy of Shahid and Kazam’s British marriage certificate, signed on 24 September 2014. Shah has asked the prime minister of Pakistan to intervene. In a letter written on Sunday to Nawaz Sharif, seen by the Guardian, Shah wrote: “Should this be [an honour killing] case then we must ensure justice is done for Samia and we must ensure this never happens again.” A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed Shahid’s death, saying: “We are providing support to the family of a British national who has died in Pakistan, and are in contact with the local authorities to seek further information.” A West Yorkshire police spokesman confirmed the force was aware of the death and would liaise with the Foreign Office and Pakistani authorities. Kazam, a Pakistani national, claims Shahid’s family did not approve of their “love marriage”. He says she moved to live with him in Dubai in May 2015, but had been back to Bradford twice in the past year to persuade her parents to accept the relationship. Kazam claimed that at the start of July, Shahid was encouraged to travel to Pakistan because one of her aunts had died, but she chose not to travel to the country. Kazam claimed Shahid was told that a relative was gravely ill in Pakistan and she flew to Islamabad on 14 July. Shahid was due to return last Thursday but Kazam said he received a call on Wednesday from one of Shahid’s cousins saying she had had a heart attack and died. He told the Guardian he did not believe his otherwise healthy wife would have died suddenly, and he flew to Pakistan to force the police to investigate.
“I am sure my wife is killed by the family,” Kazam said. “She was healthy. And she had no disease,” he said. “I believe she was killed because her parents were not happy with our marriage.” In Bradford, where the family live in a large end-terrace house in the Manningham area, family friends said they were shocked by Kazam’s allegations. One woman, who did not want her name to be published, said she had known Shahid all her life. “She was happy and bubbly, loud and very much loved by her family.” Shahid had worked as a mobile beauty therapist but in Dubai had been working in an office for a property company, she said. She was a “daddy’s girl”, the woman added. “You know how in our culture people often favour sons over daughters? It was the other way around with Samia. Her dad loved her so much. If she shed a tear then he would be crying his eyes out. She was her daddy’s princess.” The woman said Shahid’s family had been unhappy when she announced her intention to marry Kazam but grew to accept it. “If they didn’t accept her, why would they have her back in their lives?” she said. “We’re not living back in the old days.” Ali, who said he was Shahid’s first cousin, said she had fallen out with Kazam because he did not want her to have contact with her family. “She kept in touch with her family on the sly,” he said. “She had fallen out with him when she left Dubai. She was all stressed out.”"
2016-07-25T17:18:57Z,uk-news,UK news,Tests to be carried out on body of soldier who died after Brecon march,"Further tests are to be carried out on the body of a soldier who collapsed and died during a training exercise on the hottest day of the year, close to the spot where three SAS candidates died from heat illness during an SAS selection exercise three years ago. Dyfed-Powys police said they were treating the death of Cpl Joshua Hoole, 26, who was described as “superfit” by his family, as unexplained. A postmortem has been carried out, but police said more tests were needed and that the results would not be available until late September. This could delay Hoole’s funeral. A spokeswoman for the force said: “Further results … are expected in late September. Police will evaluate the results, along with all other information available through the investigation. An inquest will not be opened at this time.” The case has raised concerns about the military’s measures to keep personnel safe in extreme heat. Relatives of Hoole, from Ecclefechan, Scotland, have said they are concerned that he was training in full combat gear on a very hot day. Hoole, a member of the Rifles regiment, was one of about 20 soldiers who took part in an eight-mile march on lanes around the school of infantry in Brecon, Mid Wales, last Tuesday. They left at 7am, by which time the temperature in the area was 17.6C (64F). It had risen to 22.3C when they returned at 9am. Each soldier was dressed in full combat clothing and boots and carrying a 25kg rucksack, but the march was not seen as difficult one and did not involve severe climbs. The soldiers carried water and there were water stations along the route. The exercise was organised by Hoole’s regiment to make sure that he and other candidates were fit enough to take part in a demanding platoon sergeants’ battle course that is run by the school of infantry. An army source compared the march to an MOT: an annual test to ensure that soldiers had a basic level of fitness, much less gruelling than the SAS test. Hoole and his colleagues completed the march as a squad within the stipulated two hours. On their return to the school of infantry, Hoole collapsed. Civilian paramedics were called shortly before 9am, but could not save him. The Ministry of Defence has refused to speculate about the cause of death, and inquiries have been launched by the military, the civilian police, and health and safety officials. Defence chiefs were strongly criticised by a coroner over the SAS deaths in July 2013 and the MoD was subject to a “crown censure”, the stiffest penalty it can be given."
2016-07-25T18:19:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Muslim convert Jack Letts denies he is fighting for Isis,"A British man who converted to Islam, travelled to Syria and was accused of joining Islamic State has said he is not “currently” a militant and does not support the terrorist group. But Jack Letts added that neither was he on the side of “dirty non-Muslims”. Speaking from Syria, Letts admitted to missing home comforts, such as “kebabs and Krispy Kreme doughnuts”, but said he knows he would not be welcome back in the UK and is considered to be a terrorist.
“I oppose so-called Islamic State, but that doesn’t mean I am with you, the dirty non-Muslims,” Letts wrote in an online post he said he wanted to be remembered as his final words, should he be killed. Letts, from Oxford, revealed that he narrowly avoided being killed in an airstrike, escaping with a “scratch”, and insisted he was not afraid of dying. “I’m not worried. Everyone is going to die on their day. Whether it’s by a drone strike … A Muslim understands that his life is between the hands of Allah. So, if they want to bomb me, they’ll bomb me,” he told Channel 4 News. Asked if he was a terrorist, he said: “Do you mean by the English government’s definition, that anyone that opposes a non-Islamic system and man-made laws? Then, of course, by that definition, I suppose they’d say I’m a terrorist, khalas (and that’s that).” Asked if he was a militant, the 20-year-old, who left the UK for Syria about two years ago, said: “They’ll say what they want. Currently I’m not. But, khalas, they’ll say what they want.” He said he went to Syria “searching for the truth, and people of the truth, and I don’t regret that I came”. In a Facebook post from earlier this month, Letts also denied claims from his parents that he has severe obsessive compulsive disorder and said he hated them because they “reject the religion of truth”. John Letts and Sally Lane are awaiting trial after being charged with terrorism offences relating to allegedly sending their son money. They have denied the charges of funding terrorism. They are due to stand trial in January. Speaking to Channel 4 News, Letts said he harboured no plans to return to the UK. “[If] I came back to England, I don’t think I’d be very welcome. But I don’t plan on coming back anyway, Alhamdulillah (praise be to God). I don’t want to come back.”"

Images were posted online appearing to show a man wrenching a boy’s arm behind his back on a train. Witnesses reportedly said the incident followed a confrontation in which the man threatened to give three children a “clip round the ear”. Witnesses told the Manchester Evening News that the three children, aged between about eight and 11, got on the train running from Clitheroe, in Lancashire, to Manchester at Blackburn and put their feet up on the seats.
The man, who was believed to be in his 70s, told them off and they were “being quite cocky”, according to a witness who spoke to the paper, who did not want to be named. The 17-year-old student said: “[The man] threatened them with a ‘clip around the ear’ and then went and sat back down. The children then put their feet back up and wouldn’t take them down. The guy then went over again and tried to take their feet down.” The man, who has not been identified, is accused of assaulting one of the children at that point. A picture taken of the incident by another of the children has been circulating online. Another witness told the paper the children had been “badly behaved” and were unaccompanied but said the man “acted like [a] US cop” and left the child in tears. British Transport police tweeted that it was looking into the reports."

Police Scotland said on Tuesday they had detained a 43-year-old man after Michael O’Hanlon was fatally injured beside a car repair workshop at an industrial estate in Stevenston, near Irvine, at about midday on Monday. Attempts by paramedics to resuscitate him failed and he was declared dead at the scene. The arrested man is expected in court in Kilmarnock later on Tuesday. O’Hanlon, 45, ran the Musclebox bodybuilders and supplements shop in the east end of Glasgow with his partner Eileen Kirkwood, and had won the National Amateur Body-Builders’ Association Mr Scotland title. The NABBA website said he had won the class two contest and the overall competition in 2016, having first won the title 23 years ago. Soon after his body was found, a Police Scotland spokeswoman said: “Police and emergency services responded to a report of a 45-year-old man having being injured in the Moorpark industrial estate in Stevenston. “The man was pronounced dead at the scene by ambulance staff. A postmortem examination will take place to establish the cause of death, which is being treated as suspicious. “Inquiries are at an early stage, however detectives are following a positive line of enquiry.”"

A 34-year-old man was found dead by police at a bungalow in Headley at about 2.30am on Monday. A woman was also shot in the leg, but her injuries are not thought to be life-threatening. Summerlyn Farquharson, who goes by the name The Female Boss Krissy, was listed as one of the organisers along with reggae dance hall artist Braintear Spookie. “Before the shooting, everything was nice and then it was chaos,” she told the Press Association. “We have never had problems before and we have done the party on a yearly basis. “At about two o’clock the crowd was getting unruly, I am not sure if it was the alcohol, but by the time I got to the security I heard a gunshot, I saw people running, people were trying to get into the house. “People weren’t allowed in the house as it was a pool party but they were banging on the door. I opened the door to let Spookie in, people were shouting to call the police, saying someone was shot, so I called the police and locked us in. “We don’t know who was shot, we don’t know why it happened, we have no clue, we don’t know who it is.” She said that she had rented the property on a country lane next to the church for the past four years and had held similar parties twice before without any trouble. The event was licensed by Mole Valley district council from 2pm on Sunday until 4am on Monday, allowing the sale of alcohol and “regulated entertainment”. Residents complained of being kept awake by the party and said the usually quiet lane was overrun by traffic. They said that broken glass and rubbish was strewn on the lane on Monday morning. Farquharson said the organisers had received abusive messages following the media coverage. “It was frightening and damaging to Spookie’s career, getting all this bad publicity,” she said. “It was an innocent party, it was not a sex party, Spookie was going to showcase some of his material but because of the chaos that didn’t happen, we never planned for this to happen. “We are also getting lots of hurtful messages, for him to be sent back to Africa, we aren’t from Africa, we are British like anyone else, we have the right to be here.” On Monday afternoon, police arrested one person on suspicion of murder and a second on suspicion of assisting an offender. The gun used in the shooting, believed to be a handgun, has not been recovered. Police want to hear from anyone who attended the event and/or saw a white and black Mini leaving the scene."
2016-07-26T09:52:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Australian family facing deportation 'looking for miracle' after job falls through,"The Australian family facing deportation from the UK say they are “looking for a miracle” after the job offer in the Scottish Highlands they were basing their last-ditch visa application on was unexpectedly withdrawn. Gregg and Kathryn Brain – who have lived in Dingwall, in the Highlands, with their son Lachlan, seven, since 2011 – were granted leave to remain in the UK until 1 August following a series of appeals at Holyrood and Westminster in May. A local distillery owner offered Kathryn Brain employment and agreed to take on the sponsorship role required by the Home Office, but the family learned last week that the offer had fallen through. Their case gained national attention after the post-study work visa scheme that initially attracted them to Scotland was retrospectively cancelled by the UK government. Gregg Brain told the Guardian: “Essentially, now we have one week to find another job, put that in place and get the paperwork together. We are looking for a miracle at this point.” The family’s MP, Ian Blackford, confirmed that he had made contact with the new immigration minister Robert Goodwill, who had been “helpful and understanding up to a point” regarding the family’s predicament. Blackford said that he was now spending his time trying to find another opportunity for the couple that will fit the necessary visa requirements, and is confident that if one is found then the Home Office will look favourably on the application timescale. “The only thing that matters is getting a job for them,” Blackford told the Guardian. “In fairness, I don’t think that the UK government wants to see them deported, but the reality is that this is what will happen if a job opportunity isn’t found in time.” Eariler this month, the Brains gave evidence to the home affairs select committee, during which Gregg described how the family initially came to Scotland in 2011 on Kathryn’s student visa while she took a course in Scottish history at the University of the Highlands and Islands. They intended to move on to a two-year, post-study work visa after she completed her course. But the Home Office cancelled the scheme, citing widespread abuse, forcing them to apply for the far more stringent tier 2 visa. Gregg Brain said it was only in 2012 that the couple became aware of the cancellation of the scheme, which was first announced in March the previous year, and he reassured his wife that such a move could not be retrospective. He told the committee: “It would seem to me a natural justice issue when people have made the decision [to move countries] and the significant life changes based on what was offered. In a country that prides itself on being the birthplace of the rule of law, to assume you will be dealt with ethically and honestly by the UK government should simply be beyond question.”"

Charlie Girling, who was with the 1st Aylesford Scout group, died on Sunday evening while attending the Finnish jamboree, Roihu 2016, near the town of Hämeenlinna in southern Finland. An onsite medical team and paramedics from the local hospital offered immediate support but were unable to save him. Wayne Bulpitt, the UK chief commissioner for the Scout Association, said: “Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Charlie during this difficult and challenging time. The Scout Association is in touch with all the families of the young people attending the Finnish national jamboree from Kent, ensuring they are fully briefed and supported. “We will be working with the Finnish Scout movement and the relevant local authorities to establish the full details of this tragic incident.” Three memorial services for Charlie were held at the camp on Monday and professional crisis counsellors were on hand to offer their support. Scouts from Charlie’s group flew back to the UK on Tuesday morning, earlier than planned, in light of his death. Anna Munsterhjelm, Finland’s chief Scout, said: “The Guides and Scouts of Finland and Finnjamboree Roihu express their deepest condolences to the friends and family of the tragic medical situation that resulted in the death of a scout. We feel deeply sorry for their loss. “We wish that every scout in and outside the camp will help to bear the grief of the family and friends. To aid us in processing this difficult situation, one can join hands, respect the mourning and show compassion to those most in need.” Hundreds of British Scouts from 19 different groups were at the nine-day camp, which draws together over 16,000 participants in total and is said to be Finland’s biggest youth festival.

2016-07-26T17:26:54Z,uk-news,UK news,Alleged 'honour killing' victim was harassed by relative in Bradford,"A British woman who died in Pakistan in a possible “honour” killing had been harassed by a family member in Bradford, West Yorkshire police have confirmed. Samia Shahid, 28, who died in uncertain circumstances in Pakistan last Wednesday, had returned to Bradford in September to try to patch things up with members of her family who were unhappy she had married an “outsider” from a different Islamic sect, friends said. Shahid had been living in Dubai with her second husband, Syed Mukhtar Kazam, having divorced her first, a cousin from the family village in Pakistani Punjab. A friend, who asked not to be named, told the Guardian that Shahid returned from Dubai in September to try to build bridges with her family. She was optimistic about the visit, posting on Facebook that she was excited about returning to her “motherland”. She asked a female police officer to chaperone her to the family home in Manningham, Bradford, after being harassed by one of her relatives, who wanted her to return to her first marriage. A spokesman for West Yorkshire police said on Tuesday: “Police can confirm that they attended an address in Bradford last September, where the victim was subjected to harassment. The offender received a warning and the victim was informed of the action taken. “West Yorkshire police is continuing to liaise with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in relation to the death in Pakistan.” Police would not confirm which family member received the harassment warning. The MP for Bradford West, Naz Shah, has demanded Shahid’s body be exhumed and an independent postmortem carried out. Shahid’s family have told the Guardian she died from either an asthma attack or a heart attack, but her second husband alleges foul play, believing she was the victim of an “honour” killing. An initial postmortem was inconclusive, Pakistani police told the Guardian. Her internal organs have been sent to Lahore for forensic analysis, Mohammad Aqeel said. There were no visible injuries or signs of violence on her body, the officer added. The Guardian has seen a witness statement submitted to Pakistani police by Shahid’s father, Mohammed Shahid, in which he refers to his daughter’s husband as her cousin Mohammed Shakeel, not Kazam. Shahid’s father maintains his innocence. Reached by phone in Pakistan on Tuesday, he said: “I loved my daughter. She was my everything. I’m still in grief. I’ve no idea; maybe police have issued warning to my family members but this hasn’t come in my notice. My family members as well as she didn’t inform me. My daughter never complained to me if she had any problems within the family.” Three of Shahid’s friends in Britain spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity about her relationship with her family in Bradford. One had already given a witness statement to West Yorkshire police and the others said they would do so imminently. One woman, who asked to be named as Annie Shah, said she became close friends with Shahid in the run-up to her second wedding, when she was converting from being a Sunni to a Shia, a different denomination of Islam followed by Kazam. Some of Shahid’s family were very unhappy about the conversion, which meant she attended a different mosque. Annie Shah said: “They didn’t like that he was not only not part of the family but also wasn’t a Sunni.” Annie Shah said she had first known Shahid when she was still unhappily married to her cousin, Mohammed Shakeel, and living in Pakistan. “She asked my sister-in-law to help her get contraceptive pills because she didn’t want to get pregnant,” she said. She said Shahid was very happy with Kazam, whom she called Ali, and was trying to get pregnant when she died. “She loved her husband so much. She was madly in love with him.” Another friend, who said she had known Shahid for six years in Bradford, remembered the incident last September when Shahid returned home chaperoned by a police officer. “They had kicked her out of the house so she came back with a woman police officer.” The family strongly deny Kazam’s claims that he feared she had been killed by her family. Her father said the allegations made by Kazam were “lies and allegations” against him. “An investigation is under way and if I am found guilty I am ready for every kind of punishment,” he said. “My daughter was living a very peaceful and happy life. She had come to Pakistan on her own and was not under any pressure from her family.” “This is a terrible tragedy but she died of natural causes,” said Mohammed Ali, a cousin in Bradford. “The family did a postmortem. There’s no evidence whatsoever of murder.” He disputed Kazam’s claim of marriage, referring to him as “that boy, Samia’s so-called husband”."
2016-07-26T18:26:16Z,uk-news,UK news,MI5 resisting independent oversight of bulk data collection,"The security service MI5 has been repeatedly resisting independent oversight of its decision to collect communications data from tens of thousands of individuals, previously secret documents have shown. Four letters over the course of 2015 from the head of MI5, Andrew Parker, to the then home secretary, Theresa May, complain that the non-statutory requirement recommended by both the intelligence and security committee and the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson, is bureaucratic and risks hampering the agency’s response to security threats. The letters were released as part of a four-day hearing of the investigatory powers tribunal brought by Privacy International against the bulk data collection by the intelligence agencies. Privacy International said that Parker’s letters to May suggest repeated foot-dragging from MI5 and a reluctance to comply with the requirement. Other previously secret documents released to the tribunal on Tuesday show that MI5 was repeatedly warned by the Interception of Communications Commissioner’s Office [IOCCO] that it was breaching a code of practice on data collection that requires the agency to appoint a designated person independent of an investigation to authorise data collection. The IOCCO found that MI5 had implemented independent oversight of data collection from people such as doctors and lawyers in professions with access to privileged or confidential information. But in the majority of cases it found that “line managers are not independent from the operations for which they are granting authorisation or giving notices”. In December 2014, it urged MI5 to review its oversight measures. A year later it found that no progress had been made and reminded MI5 that the home secretary had said it was “imperative” that such independent oversight was achieved. In Parker’s first letter to May, dated 19 March 2015, he said independent oversight of data collection would “cause significant disruption” and “reduce our effectiveness … It would increase the processing time for [data] requests because those taking the decisions would not be familiar with the relevant investigative context”. He went on to suggest there was no public clamour for the change. “There does not appear to be a pressing litigation or reputational requirement to commit to make these changes now and we can therefore see no obvious gain in doing so,” Parker wrote. A month later Parker warned May that MI5 “will not hit your deadline” after she asked it to “strengthen the independence of authorisation for communications data”. In the next letter, sent on 30 June, Parker reported progress in the oversight of communications data checks on persons in sensitive professions. But warned that making the change for all data requests would require more staff – the exact number is redacted. “We think there are significant risks from implementing independence for all CD [communications data] authorisations at this point,” he said. In the last letter, dated 18 December 2015, Parker says he still has “strong reservations about agreeing now to more widespread changes for targeted CD requests”. “We submitted a total of more than 100,000 individual requests for communications data in 2014 through 40,000 applications,” Parker wrote. “If we were to switch to an arrangement where each of these has to be authorised by someone within MI5 who is unfamiliar with the case and who has to be sufficiently briefed to be able to make a considered decision, we would be adding a non-trivial amount of administrative burden into our system, at the same time as we work to increase assurance levels against a very high tempo of threat.” In another set of letters released to the tribunal, MI5 said the IOCCO had agreed that it did not need to have independent approval for data requests in ongoing operations. The IOCCO wrote back pointing out that the code of practice on communications intercepts required it to be informed by MI5 if it could not appoint an independent person, and that it had not done so. Millie Graham Wood, a legal officer for Privacy International, said the documents showed “there has been a lack of oversight, which is still not on a statutory basis, and a wilful avoidance of internal safeguards”. She said they pointed to a “worrying practice” as they showed “the lack of a clear line of separation with the security service between investigative teams who request approval for a particular activity and those in the service who authorise”. In a skeleton argument to the hearing, lawyers for the intelligence services defended the use of bulk communications data [BCD]. It quoted a security service witness saying: “The use of BCD has stopped terrorist attacks and has saved lives many times.” A witness for GCHQ is quoted, saying: “Exploitation of BCD is an essential tool that is used on a daily basis ... without it, the intelligence services would be significantly less effective in protecting the UK against threats such as terrorism, cyber threats, or espionage.” The hearing continues."
2016-07-26T18:53:56Z,uk-news,UK news,Childhood home of Bobby Moore receives English Heritage plaque,"The semi-detached house where England’s World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore lived when he was growing up has been commemorated with an English Heritage plaque. Moore became the first footballer to receive a blue sign outside his childhood home days before the 50th anniversary of the 1966 World Cup final. The plaque was unveiled at 43 Waverley Gardens in Barking, east London, where Moore lived from birth until after he made his England debut in 1962, in front of his family and prominent figures in the footballing world, who paid tribute to “a legend and a true English hero”.
His daughter, Roberta Moore, spoke of the “wonderful honour” of seeing her father’s career commemorated by the sign fixed to the front of the small, semi-detached property. She said: “This is where it all began – kicking a ball out here in the street with his friends before embarking on an incredible journey which as we all know led him up the steps to collect the World Cup from the Queen at Wembley 50 years ago this week. My sincere gratitude and thanks to English Heritage for bestowing this honour upon my father, I couldn’t be more proud.”
Moore was signed by nearby West Ham United aged 16, where he forged a successful career making more than 600 appearances. At 22, he became the youngest person to wear the captain’s armband for England, and remains the only England captain to have lifted the World Cup. England’s 4-2 victory over West Germany in the final of the tournament at Wembley in 1966 is unquestionably English football’s finest hour. The triumph propelled him to instant and lasting fame and he went on to win the BBC sports personality of the year award that year, followed by an OBE in 1967. He died of cancer in 1993, aged just 51. The Waverley Gardens house was listed on both Moore’s birth certificate and his marriage certificate 21 years later. After unveiling the plaque, his daughter added: “It’s really nice to be able to show my children, who sadly did not get to meet my father, so it’s really nice they are able to have a connection with Dad through films and photographs and this kind of lovely occasion.” Greg Dyke, the outgoing chairman of the FA, who is also a English Heritage blue plaque panel member, described the footballing great as “one of the greatest players this country has ever produced”.
He added: “Today we are commemorating a man who achieved glory in the world of football and who instilled immense pride and loyalty in the hearts of supporters of the game. Even those who do not follow the game of football know the name Bobby Moore – a legend and a true English hero.” The former West Ham captain was described as the “ultimate local boy done good” by the east London club’s vice-chairwoman, Karren Brady. It was in Waverley Gardens where Moore developed into a footballer of ability, with kickarounds with his father and uncle on nearby Greatfields Park, and then playing schools and Saturday morning football. It was also while living there that he lifted his first silverware, the London-wide Crisp Shield in the 1950-51 season, playing with the Barking schools team. Brady said: “It’s so poignant that we should gather here where it all began for a young Bobby, the place where he first harboured hopes for playing for West Ham, the place where he dreamed of wearing the Three Lions on his chest, the place where the most remarkable sporting story started life.”"
2016-07-26T23:01:26Z,uk-news,UK news,MPs predict surge in immigration amid Brexit uncertainty,"Britain is likely to experience a surge in immigration amid the uncertainty of the negotiations to leave the EU, according to a committee of MPs, who say it is imperative for the government to offer EU citizens living in the country confirmation of their status. The home affairs select committee called on ministers to prepare and fully resource the country’s immigration agencies to make sure they can handle the “heavy extra demands that will be placed on them by the fallout from Brexit”. It also claimed it would become more difficult to remove offenders who are EU nationals from the UK “on paper” and in practice after Britain leaves the EU. The committee chair, Labour MP Keith Vaz, said: “The biggest issue relating to Brexit is migration. There is a clear lack of certainty in the government’s approach to the position of EU migrants resident in the UK and British citizens living in the EU. Neither should be used as pawns in a complicated chess game which has not even begun.”
His report sets out three potential cut-off dates that the government could impose for new immigration rules to come into play: 23 June when the referendum was held, the date that article 50 is triggered, or when the UK actually leaves the EU. “Unless the government makes a decision, the prospect of a ‘surge’ in immigration will increase. Multiple voices and opinions from government ministers causes uncertainty, and must stop,” added Vaz. The report suggested there could be a sudden increase in migration from outside the EU due to anticipation of stricter rules being enacted to respond to national concerns about the numbers of people coming into Britain. It also identified myriad other problems around people smuggling, failure to deport foreign offenders, and serious inefficiencies in the handling of migration data. The report found that: One third of lorries – amounting to 750,000 vehicles a year – were arriving at the UK border without the recommended levels of security. Truck drivers and companies were served 3,300 civil penalties for people smuggling, whether intentional or not, but £2.5m out of the £6.5m owed was never paid. The number of foreign national offenders in the community “remains unacceptably high”, with the government falling short of a commitment to remove Polish offenders in British jails. The Home Office has failed to put visa information on to computers and “lacks an effective and efficient system for managing its immigration casework”. An “unacceptably high number of asylum applications are being dealt with inappropriately”, with the government returning people to unsafe countries such as Eritrea. But MPs said Brexit was the top issue. The cross-party group concluded that the decision to leave the EU had left European citizens in Britain and UK nationals abroad in a “potentially very difficult and uncertain position”, which was why they wanted a cut-off date. “EU citizens settled in the UK before the chosen date should be afforded the right to permanent residence. The challenge of successfully resolving the practicalities of the UK exit in relation to EU citizens must not be underestimated. A unit should be established in the Home Office to deal with this issue, in addition to the newly established department for exiting the European Union headed by the newly appointed secretary of state, Rt Hon David Davis,” the report said. It suggested that the priority should be establishing where EU citizens live and work, with one option being to set up a system of registration. A government spokeswoman said: “We have been clear that we want to protect the status of EU nationals already living here, and the only circumstances in which that wouldn’t be possible is if British citizens’ rights in European member states were not protected in return,” she said. “We are about to begin these negotiations and it would be wrong to set out further unilateral positions in advance. But there is clearly no mandate for accepting the free movement of people as it has existed up until now.” Responding to other parts of the report, a spokeswoman for the Home Office said it was in their interest to combat any attempts to enter the UK illegally, not least because it hit the haulage industry and put drivers’ safety at risk. They said they had worked closely with companies to set standards. On money owed to the government she added: “Any outstanding fines will be aggressively pursued and we will detain the vehicles of those concerned if necessary.” The department suggested that it was misleading to give a figure of unpaid fines as money was collected in the following financial year. The spokeswoman said the government was determined to act against employers who use illegal workers, would consider the findings on processing data, and added: “Foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crimes in the UK should be in no doubt of our determination to deport them.”"
2016-07-26T23:54:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Hundreds evacuated in City of London after gas leak,"Hundreds of people in the City of London were evacuated due to a gas leak on Tuesday. Emergency services were called to London Wall in the City at about 4pm. The 25-metre cordon remained in place until after 9pm, when the area was reopened to the public. London fire brigade said they were called to reports of a gas leak from the cellar of a coffee shop and had been standing by in case they were needed while engineers rectified the problem. Approximately 500 people had been evacuated, a City of London police spokesperson told the Guardian. No fatalities or injuries were reported. Eyewitness Matt Harris, who owns Fox Fine Wines on London Wall, told the London Evening Standard: “[The emergency services] are telling us it’s an absolutely massive gas leak in the sub-basement. They said they’re going to have to dig the street up to get the gas out.” He said there was little panic as City of London police told customers they had to leave the building.
A spokesperson for the London fire brigade said: “The gas engineers are currently working on it and we have a fire engine on standby just in case we are needed. The surrounding buildings, which were mainly offices, were all evacuated and fortunately we haven’t yet been needed. We’re just there as a precaution.”
People were advised to avoid the area with delays to be expected. TFL Traffic News tweeted that London Wall was shut eastbound at Wood Street and westbound at Blomfield Street, adding that the closures were expected to be lifted within a couple of hours. The City of London police announced the road reopening on their Twitter account."
2016-07-27T08:46:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Four-year-old boy dies in fire at house in south Wales,"A four-year-old boy has died in a house blaze in south Wales despite attempts by firefighters and neighbours to save him. The boy, named locally as Jac Davies, was in an upstairs bedroom of the house with his three-year-old brother when the fire broke out early on Wednesday. Jac’s mother, Jennifer Davies, 28, raised the alarm at 1.40am and managed to escape with her six-year-old daughter and 11-month-old son. Neighbours attempted to reach the boys, but were beaten back by smoke and flames. Four firefighters went into the house in Alltwen, near Pontardawe in the Swansea valley, and reached the boys, but Jac was pronounced dead at the scene. Jamie Mills, a neighbour, said: “I heard shouting in the street, and when I heard someone was getting a ladder I knew it was serious. I ran straight out there, and you could see a bit of smoke upstairs. Some boys tried to get through the back door and a brick was thrown through the window. I tried to get in the front door.” Another neighbour said: “I woke up and heard screaming. It was terrible. One of the neighbours tried to get upstairs to rescue them, but couldn’t. There was too much smoke. He was a lovely boy.” Chris Margetts, senior operations manager for the fire service, said: “When we got there ... two young children were still inside. Crews went in with breathing apparatus and rescued the children – a three-year-old boy and [a] four-year-old boy. Unfortunately, the four-year-old did not make it. “It was a fully developed fire and it was quite hot and challenging. It was a very confusing scene – when the crews got there, there were other guys, neighbours, trying to get into the property to effect a rescue. “The thoughts and sympathies of the fire service are with the family and the community of Alltwen at this tragic time. It’s a very close-knit community, and we will have specialist teams working to support them.” DCI Esyr Jones, of Swansea and Neath Port Talbot CID, said: “We are continuing to jointly investigate the fire. A scene examination is taking place by police and fire investigators to establish the cause, which at this stage is not known. “A number of local people were involved in the rescue of the family, but tragically a four-year-old boy died at the scene. I would like any witnesses or anyone involved at the scene who have not yet spoken to police to come forward with any information they may have.” A tribute left at the scene signed from “mammy” said: “My handsome big blue eyed boy, your my life, my world, my everything and will never ever forget your beautiful blonde curls. Go ride your train up to heaven and wait for me. Save a bit of that light for me, and we will see each other again one day I promise.” Another card left with some flowers said: “So sad to hear you are sadly gone. Harry will miss you, seeing you smile and playing with you at school. Gone too young.”"
2016-07-27T12:30:03Z,uk-news,UK news,RAF Marham abduction attempt: police release efit of suspects,"Detectives investigating an attempted abduction of an RAF serviceman have released efit images of the two suspects. The serviceman, in his late 20s, was jogging near RAF Marham in Norfolk on Wednesday when two men described as “Middle Eastern” in appearance jumped out of a dark-coloured car and tried to drag him into the vehicle at knifepoint. The first suspect, who was fought off by the serviceman, is aged between 20 and 30 and about 6ft tall. He is described as of athletic but stocky build, with dark hair which was long on top and a well-groomed beard. He had a dark skin tone and wore casual clothing. Police believe he may have a facial injury as the serviceman headbutted him to fend him off. The second suspect, who reportedly climbed out of the car wielding a 3in blade, is aged between 20 and 30 but younger than the first suspect and of a slimmer build. He was about 5ft 10in, clean shaven with short dark hair and wore a white T-shirt and dark shorts. He went to help his companion, allowing the serviceman to get away. Det Supt Paul Durham, from the Norfolk and Suffolk major investigation team, who is leading the inquiry with support from officers at the Metropolitan police counter-terrorism command, said: “Today we have released efit images of the two suspects seen by the victim during the incident and I would urge anyone who recognises either man to come forward and call police immediately.” He said it was possible that at least one other person was involved, possibly in the vehicle. Durham said police continued to pursue several lines of inquiry as well as the incident being a potential terror attack. “We’re looking at the possibility of mistaken identity, a drugs debt or a domestic type thing,” he added. There was no firm evidence to establish the motive for the incident, he added. He said the efits were based on information provided by the victim, and CCTV footage was still being reviewed. “It’s very challenging,” he said. “It’s patchy at best.” He said a large geographical area was involved, with multiple possible entrance and escape routes. “We’ve not had that breakthrough that we need, hence the reason this appeal is so important,” he said. Officers will be carrying out witness appeals in Marham on Wednesday, seeking information from people who were in the area a week ago."
2016-07-27T14:08:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Man loses libel action against father of woman who accused him of rape,"A shipping magnate’s son has lost his libel action against the father of a woman who accused him of rape after a judge said the comments were made in the public interest. Alexander Economou said he had pursued his action against David de Freitas, 60, after enduring weeks of “public rubbishing” following articles in the Guardian, on BBC Radio 4 and in the Daily Telegraph, in which De Freitas questioned the actions of the Crown Prosecution Service. De Freitas’s daughter Eleanor had accused Economou of rape, but when the investigation concluded with no charge, he pursued a private prosecution against her for perverting the course of justice by making up the rape claim. The CPS took up the case and Eleanor de Freitas, 23, was charged but four days before her trial in April 2014 she took her own life. In a series of articles in the Guardian, the Telegraph in November and December 2014 and broadcasts on the Radio 4 Today programme, De Freitas raised concerns about the role of prosecutors in the case. Economou sued, saying his reputation had been damaged by the articles. Economou told the libel court he believed De Freitas’s purpose was to lash out against him in public because he blamed him for his daughter’s death and wanted to take revenge. He said he was left close to a nervous breakdown and was shunned by a number of people. Mr Justice Warby dismissed the libel claim on Wednesday in the high court. He said two of the articles – in the Daily Telegraph and an article written by De Freitas in the Guardian – did cause “serious harm to his reputation” but the judge upheld the public interest defence raised by De Freitas. Mr Justice Warby said: “Mr De Freitas could and did properly consider the publication to be in the public interest and ... a judgment in favour of Mr Economou would represent an interference with Mr de Freitas’ free speech rights out of any reasonable proportion to the need to protect and vindicate Mr Economou’s reputation.” He found that Economou, 37, who had been in a relationship with Elizabeth de Freitas, had pursued the libel action against her father “with sincerity but ... in anger and with elements of vengefulness”. The fallout from her death has led to both menappearing opposite each other in civil and criminal courtrooms. In June, Economou was cleared at Westminster magistrates court of harassing De Freitas following publicity about the case. Eleanor de Freitas, a trainee accountant who suffered from bipolar disorder, accused Economou of rape in 2013 but no case was brought against him. Instead, Economou spent £200,000 on a private prosecution of the 23-year-old for perverting the course of justice by making up the rape claim – a case that the CPS eventually took on. De Freitas was charged and four days before her trial in April 2013 she took her own life. In a series of articles, her father raised concerns about her treatment by the CPS but he never identified Economou nor was his name published. De Freitas said in his defence he never named Economou and his focus in the comments was on the role and conduct of the CPS and its decision to continue the prosecution of his daughter. “I believed this was not only about my family, but also about other families who would face similar issues,” he told the court. “We wanted to bring some good out of this tragedy and enable lessons to be learned.” Lawyers for Economou said they intended to appeal. In a statement released after the hearing, De Freitas said: “The day I received the call from my wife to tell me Eleanor was dead was the worst day of my life. “The death of our only daughter has had a devastating effect on our family. These libel proceedings commenced just before Christmas 2014, our first Christmas without Eleanor. “At that time, we were grieving the loss of our only child (as we still are) and trying to deal with her Inquest. These libel proceedings have prolonged our grieving process. My focus has been, and continues to be, the conduct and decision-making of the CPS. I am relieved that the court has accepted my public interest defence in this libel action.” ends"
2016-07-27T14:27:01Z,uk-news,UK news,"Leytonstone tube attacker 'psychotic' at time of assault, court told","A taxi driver who cut the throat of a commuter at a London tube station was sectioned nine years before the attack and experienced a significant deterioration in his mental health after he was released from hospital, a court has heard. Muhiddin Mire, 30, had downloaded Islamic State propaganda before the attack in December 2015, in what he told police was an act of revenge for coalition airstrikes in Syria, which the UK government had three days previously voted to support. Mire was convicted of attempted murder for attacking 56-year-old Lyle Zimmerman and threatening four other travellers at Leytonstone station, east London. At a sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey, Dr Shaun Bhattacharjee, a Broadmoor forensic psychiatrist, revealed Mire was sectioned in 2006 and released with a prescription for anti-psychotic medication after two weeks in hospital. Mire was put in touch with a community mental health team upon his release, but soon lost contact with them and stopped taking the medication. In the years before the attack, Mire became increasingly unwell and was likely exhibiting symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia, a serious mental illness for which he is now receiving treatment. Among “strange” ideas Mire had was a belief that former prime minister Tony Blair was his guardian angel and that he had been possessed by evil spirits, the court heard. His paranoid delusions later manifested themselves in a belief that he was under surveillance by the security services and was being followed. Bhattacharjee told the court that the prevailing culture – in this case a heightened state of tension over Islamic terrorism – can often inform schizophrenics’ delusions. As an example, Bhattacharjee said in the 1970s some paranoid schizophrenics experienced delusions related to the IRA and Irish terrorism. “It is clear at the time of the offence he was very psychotic and manifested a significant number of psychotic symptoms,” he said. The doctor said it was possible Mire “never fully recovered from his first psychosis in 2006” and that he was a risk to others and needs ongoing inpatient psychiatric treatment. “Because of the significant risk to the safety of others,” he said, “it’s necessary that that treatment is continued in conditions of high security.” During the attack, Mire shouted, “This is for my Syrian brothers. I’m going to spill your blood”. He told police in the early hours after his arrest that the attack was an act of vengeance for coalition airstrikes in Syria. On 2 December, the government voted in favour of extending bombings against Islamic State targets in the Middle East to include Syria. One person was overheard on mobile phone footage of the incident shouting at Mire: “You ain’t no Muslim, bruv,” a rebuke that garnered much public attention. He had images of the soldier Lee Rigby and a British Islamic State executioner on his Samsung phone, along with material linked to the terror group. The court heard he first started viewing Islamic State videos online three years before the attack. Sentencing has been adjourned to Friday at 2pm. Judge Nicolas Hilliard told the court Mire faces a sentence ranging from an indeterminate jail term to an indefinite hospital detention order. In a statement read during the hearing, Zimmerman, a musician, said he was “quite lucky” to have survived. “I have been left with a scar on my neck which I am aware of only because it pulls when I use my voice but is otherwise superficial and healing well,” he said. Zimmerman suffered from “flashing lights” in his vision for months after the attack. “I am somewhat more cautious about interacting with strangers since the attack. Overall, I have not been significantly traumatised by the attack psychologically,” he added. Prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC praised Zimmerman for his “philosophical view” of his injuries. The judge’s sentencing remarks are to be recorded on camera for the first time during the hearing as part of a pilot exploring the possibility of broadcasting future crown court cases. The footage will not be broadcast but sent to the Ministry of Justice for assessment."
2016-07-27T15:06:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Man jailed for hiding neighbour's body and using flat as cannabis factory,"A man has been jailed for hiding his neighbour’s body “like a piece of rubbish” under a tarpaulin in a yard so he could use his flat as a cannabis factory. Paul Jackson befriended lonely former navy helicopter engineer Nicholas Clark, 63, but when his neighbour died of natural causes he saw the chance to use his home to produce drugs. Instead of reporting the death, Jackson, 40, removed Clark’s body from the flat in Bristol and hid it under debris in a yard near his friend Anthony Whillier’s home. The body was found months later when Whillier was evicted and his landlord went to clear the flat and yard. A murder investigation was launched, Clark was identified and the cannabis factory found at his old home. Police also discovered Jackson had taken money from the dead man’s bank account. Jackson was jailed for three-and-half years at Bristol crown court for preventing a lawful burial, theft and allowing the production of cannabis. Whillier received a two-year suspended jail term and 240 hours of unpaid work for cannabis production. Clark’s family, from whom he was estranged, released a statement expressing anger at the lack of respect Jackson had shown. They said: “It’s devastating to know that Nick’s body was treated with such crudeness. The lack of respect shown by the perpetrators is beyond comprehension. “While Nick may have died in natural circumstances, the actions to move his body from the home he loved … showed a complete lack of respect for any human being, let alone someone classed as a friend. “Nick deserved to have his human rights respected, and not be treated as something which could be discarded without a moment’s thought. Nick was a lonely man who relied on the support of his neighbours and friends” Detectives do not know exactly when he died, but Clark had not been seen since undergoing an operation in February 2015. His remains were found in April 2015. Senior investigating officer Det Ch Insp Mike Williams said Jackson took money from Clark’s account after his death. He said: “Nick’s family have been devastated by the way his body was treated after he died and it’s hard to comprehend how anybody could treat a human being in this callous way. Because he wasn’t reported as missing, it’s very likely his remains would have remained undetected if the yard hadn’t been cleared. “Nick deserved respect for loyally serving his country but after he died from natural causes, his so-called friend and neighbour Paul Jackson treated his body like a piece of rubbish.”"

Rosanna Lawes, the executive director of development at the LLDC, said Stratford and east London were changing fast and the new images demonstrated that London was open for business after the EU referendum. “In a few short years, we will see not only a new cultural and education district in east London, with some of the world’s leading institutions sitting in the heart of the park, but new neighbourhoods and business districts and hugely successful sporting venues delivering on the legacy promises made for the 2012 Games,” said Lawes. “This is the perfect illustration of how London is open and will remain so.” The V&A is proposing an outpost called V&A East in a red-brick building of 18,000 sq metres. Described as a museum for the digital age, the building would display items from the V&A’s vast collections and also stage exhibitions responding to contemporary events.
The Smithsonian, the world’s biggest museum and research complex, will collaborate with the V&A after abandoning plans to have its own bespoke outpost on the site. Sadler’s Wells is planning a 550-seat auditorium staging contemporary dance performances, which require a smaller venue than its 1,500-seat base in Clerkenwell.
In 2014, the government pledged £141m to the project – called Olympicopolis by former London mayor Boris Johnson – and £180m is being raised from private sources. The total cost has been estimated at £850m, with further money coming from the Greater London Authority and residential land sales. The designs were produced by architecture and design firm Allies and Morrison, with O’Donnell + Tuomey and Arquitecturia. They will be developed over the coming months before a detailed planning application is submitted at the end of 2016. The scheme is expected to create 3,000 jobs, attract 1.5 million visitors a year and deliver a £2.8bn boost to the economy of Stratford and the surrounding areas."
2016-07-27T17:35:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Immigration raid on Byron Hamburgers rounds up 35 workers,"Dozens of staff at the Byron Hamburgers chain of restaurants have been arrested in an immigration swoop, it has emerged. The Home Office has confirmed 35 nationals from Brazil, Nepal, Egypt and Albania were among those rounded up in the raid, which took place across London on the morning of 4 July. A senior worker in one of the branches alleged that staff had been told to attend a health and safety meeting at 9.30am that day but immigration officials quickly arrived and started to interview people. “It is fucking disgusting. Some of these people worked here for four or five years and they weren’t even given a chance to say goodbye,” said the worker who spoke on condition of anonymity. A source at the Home Office said that reports that up to 80 staff had been deported were wide of the mark, confirming that 35 people were arrested on suspicion of breaches of immigration laws. “They were arrested in order to progress potential immigration offences,” the source said.
Byron confirmed it facilitated the raid at the Home Office’s request but refused to respond to claims that it set up staff meetings on the false pretence they were for health and safety training. It said: “We can confirm that several of Byron’s London restaurants were visited by representatives of the Home Office. These visits resulted in the removal of members of staff who are suspected by the Home Office of not having the right to work in the UK, and of possessing fraudulent personal and right to work documentation that is in breach of immigration and employment regulation.” It said that the Home Office acknowledged that it had complied with its legal responsibilities as an employer but it had been shown “false/counterfeit documentation” by those at the centre of the alleged immigration breaches. “We have cooperated fully and acted upon the Home Office’s requests throughout the course of the investigations leading to this action, and will continue to do so.” Byron, which has 56 restaurants across the country, is owned by investment firm Hutton Collins which bought the chain in a £100m deal in 2013. Reports of the raid first appeared in a Spanish language online newspaper, El Iberico, in London and quickly spread across social media, prompting plans of protests and boycotts of the restaurant. Amelia Womack, the deputy leader of the Green party, said: “These reports are deeply shocking. If these accusations are true than the bosses at Byron should be utterly ashamed of themselves for turning people’s lives upside down.” She said: “People who are settled and working in the UK should be able to apply for residency so as to continue contributing to our society and our economy.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Immigration enforcement officers carried out intelligence-led visits to a number of Byron restaurants across London on 4 July, arresting 35 people for immigration offences. The operation was carried out with the full co-operation of the business.”"
2016-07-27T18:02:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Police search for ex-husband of woman who died in 'honour killing' in Pakistan,"A special team has been set up to hunt for the former husband of a British woman whose death in Pakistan last week is being treated as a potential “honour” killing, police said on Wednesday. Mohammad Shakeel fled the village of Pandori, 80km south of Islamabad, soon after a complaint was lodged with police on Saturday accusing him and other family members of murdering his former wife Samia Shahid. It is alleged that Shahid, 28, had been tricked into travelling to Pakistan and killed for marrying against the wishes of her family. On Wednesday, some of the most senior policemen in the Punjab province, as well as agents from Pakistan’s military intelligence agency the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, descended on Pandori and searched two of the cluster of houses where the extended family live. The case, which has been highlighted by the Bradford West MP Naz Shah, has become a priority after Pakistan’s interior minister, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, announced that he had ordered a rapid investigation. Also under suspicion is Shahid’s father, Mohammad, who told police he discovered his daughter’s body, with vomit around her mouth, in Shakeel’s house on Wednesday 20 July. Wisal Fakhar Sultan, the regional police officer for Rawalpindi, said police were investigating whether Shahid had killed herself, accidentally taken an overdose or been deliberately poisoned. Tablets and mobile phones were taken from Shakeel’s house and a forensics laboratory in Lahore has been ordered to speed up analysis of samples taken from Shahid’s body. One officer told the Guardian it was likely she had been deliberately poisoned. He said bruising had been found on her neck and shoulders, contradicting earlier statements by the police. Officials said Shahid’s cousin Mobeen, her sister Madiha and her mother Imtiaz Bibi were all also under investigation. Shahid’s father was briefly arrested on Monday night but later released following the intervention of a local politician. Mujahid Khan, a senior officer from the local district of Jhelum, said her father was “under strict surveillance” and that his passport had been confiscated to stop him from leaving the country. Mohammad Shahid told the Guardian he had attempted to call Shakeel to ask him to give himself up to the police but had not been able to get through. “My daughter was living with her husband Shakeel and I used to visit her every day,” he said. “I went as usual on Wednesday and I found her lying on the stairs. Shakeel and all of the rest of the family were in my home next door.” The imposing compounds searched by police on Tuesday are some the largest houses in Pandori, where Mohammad Shahid enjoys prestige as the wealthy owner of a Bradford curry house. Police have struggled to find any neighbours to help them with their inquiries who are not family members. The family insist Shahid was married to Shakeel, a first cousin, and police in Pakistan say they have not received any documents proving otherwise. In fact, she divorced him in a UK sharia court in 2014 and then remarried a man called Syed Mukhtar Kazam after taking the incendiary step of converting to Shi’ism, a different sect to the Sunni faith of her family. Friends of Shahid in the UK said the family felt so dishonoured by her behaviour that they did not acknowledge she had remarried. West Yorkshire police last year warned a member of Shahid’s family in Bradford for harassing her. She had returned home from Dubai, where she had been living with her new husband, and hoped to reconcile with her relatives, but was so afraid of them that she asked a female police officer to accompany her to the family home in Manningham. Even in the presence of the police officer, one relative abused her and was given an official harassment warning, police said. Kazam was so concerned about her safety that he tried to prevent her visiting Pakistan to see her family last week after she received messages saying her father was extremely unwell. He flew to Pakistan after learning of her death to lodge a complaint with police. On Wednesday, a 37-year-old man and 32-year-old woman were in custody in Bradford in connection to alleged threats made against Shah, the MP who raised the alarm about the case, West Yorkshire police said. Shah said she could not comment on the nature of threats allegedly made to her, but said she had been called by police to discuss her security arrangements. She said she had received a briefing from the Pakistani authorities on Wednesday to say that the interior minister was overseeing the case personally. “I was told that the case is now under his watch and he has assigned two of his most senior and capable officers to the investigation,” she said “I feel reassured by this development because the investigation has gone from them basically doing nothing and saying they were just waiting for the forensic tests to come back to them treating it as a potential murder investigation. I am determined to see justice done.”"
2016-07-27T18:37:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Parents launch fundraising campaign after vandals target school,"Parents have begun an online fundraising drive after a Glasgow primary school was badly damaged by teenage vandals who destroyed every piece of computer equipment, smashed sinks and made popcorn in two microwave ovens before wrecking them. The cost of the damage at Gowanbank primary is thought to run to more than £10,000. It is the fifth primary school in Glasgow to be targeted by vandals this summer. Headteacher John Daly said it looked like a bomb had been detonated in the school in the Nitshill area of south Glasgow. “Nothing was stolen, everything was just trashed. It was nothing but wanton vandalism and it is very deflating,” he told the Evening Times. “It may only be a building but this completely takes away from providing our children with a safe and protective learning environment.” The intruders appeared to take their time, smashing or scratching every computer monitor, pulling whiteboards off the walls, setting off fire extinguishers and breaking crockery. Evening Times reporter Catriona Stewart tweeted:
Irene Wilson, the school’s janitor who was passing by the school, raised the alarm after hearing noise from inside. It has been hit by vandals as recently as last week. Gowanbank’s parent council has launched an online fundraising appeal in a bid to return the school to as close as possible to normal before classes resume in three weeks.
Daly said he was trying to replace Gowanbank’s IT equipment. “We can’t function without it and I plan to get new crayons and drawing equipment for the children. One silver lining is that there are still a couple of weeks before school goes back so we will be able to get the place back up and running.” Liz Cameron, Glasgow city council’s executive member for children, young people and lifelong learning, said the incidents of school vandalism were soul destroying. “The respect for education shown by these – let’s be blunt – thugs is nil ... Our schools are the most treasured thing in our city and we all must protect them,” she said. “I’m saying to everybody in the community – our schools are there for your children and your grandchildren and it is the responsibility of everyone in the community to look after them.” Another Glasgow primary scool, St Catherine’s, has also been the target of multiple break-ins, with the vandals smashing windows, starting fires and causing other damage that has cost an estimated £100,000. The Scotsman reported that a group of former pupils is thought to be responsible for much of the damage. Although some have been identified by parents and pupils, no one has been willing to give a statement to police."
2016-07-27T18:59:23Z,uk-news,UK news,IPCC bungled case against officers accused of abusing firefighter,"The police watchdog bungled a case against three officers accused of abusing and Tasering a black firefighter because of his race, it has emerged. The Independent Police Complaints Commission apologised after disciplinary charges against the Metropolitan police officers were dropped and admitted making key errors. The case, revealed by the Guardian, was prompted by an incident in 2011 when firefighter Edric Kennedy-Macfoy said police had behaved like “wild animals”, dragging him from his car and subjecting him to a violent attack that culminated in him being shot with a Taser. The three officers faced the sack if found guilty of gross misconduct charges but the case against them collapsed at a disciplinary hearing held in private. Evidence potentially in their favour had been missed by the IPCC inquiry and the watchdog said it may take a year for them to gather it. This would mean the case against the officers could not be brought until next year, which was an excessive delay. The IPCC apologised to Kennedy-Macfoy and to the three officers on Wednesday. Kennedy-Macfoy, 32, said: “I feel that the last five years of my life have been stolen from me. These proceedings have been withdrawn before I was given the chance to give evidence before the tribunal and I will forever feel that I have been denied justice. “The IPCC investigation should never have taken so long and I expect a full apology from them and an assurance they will now take immediate steps to ensure this never happens again.” The firefighter was off-duty when in September 2011 he approached the officers in Harrow, north London, to help identify a young man who had thrown a rock at a police van after a late-night melee. He says officers suddenly turned on him and he believes he was targeted because of his skin colour. Describing the incident, Kennedy-Macfoy said he was dragged from his white Audibefore the officers surrounded him and shouted abuse. He said he replied calmly and showed his palms to the officers, telling them: “Listen guys, I haven’t done anything wrong. I’m a firefighter – I work with you lot and I just want to explain something. I’ve showed no aggression towards any of you.” Police evidence led to the firefighter being charged but he was cleared of obstructing police after a two-day trial at Brent magistrates court. The Met has apologised and paid “substantial damages” to Kennedy-Macfoy and he in turn has offered to help share his experience to train police officers. In a letter, deputy assistant commissioner Fiona Taylor said: “It is plain that what happened to you on this night should not have happened, and for that, on behalf of the MPS, I apologise.” The IPCC has previously been criticised by alleged victims of police excesses, and officers themselves, for being incompetent and too slow. It has been given extra powers and money by the government, which is keen to see if it will play the part it is supposed to in boosting public confidence in the police. In a statement the IPCC vowed to review the case to ensure it did not repeat the blunders. It said: “The withdrawal follows procedural shortfalls identified by the IPCC. They related to disclosure of relevant material and the need for further investigative work, including witness interviews, which it became clear were not conducted during the investigation. “If the IPCC were to remedy those shortfalls, we were informed that a further hearing could not take place for at least twelve months. It is the IPCC’s view that further delays are not acceptable, given the time since the original incident.” The three officers facing disciplinary charges were: PC Mark Gatland, who fired the Taser, PC Daniel Roberts and Insp Sutinderjit Mahil, who was a sergeant at the time. The Met said it was alleged that Gatland “used unreasonable force and discharged a Taser without warning and that on both occasions his actions were motivated by racial discrimination and/or racial stereotyping and so treated the victim less favourably”. The force said it was also alleged that Roberts and Mahil each used “abusive and offensive language and that racial discrimination and/or racial stereotyping motivated this”. The Met said: “After careful consideration of all the evidence available it is clear that there are conflicting accounts, and as such the case that was due to go before the misconduct panel was not as strong as previously thought.” The force, which is facing criticism over its race record, said: “We fully recognise that the misconduct hearing not going ahead is damaging for the complainant and for the public who need to have confidence in the way officers are held to account for their actions.”"
2016-07-27T22:25:25Z,uk-news,UK news,"London Olympics legacy: jobs, jobs and jobs","There are prosperous views looking west from the roof of what was once the London 2012 Olympics press centre and is now part of a commercial complex called Here East, whose best known tenant is BT Sport: straight ahead for the City and the Shard; look left for more big money towers in Canary Wharf; further left and much nearer, the Olympic stadium is a short walk away. On the other side of Here East, across the Olympic Park, lies Stratford town centre with its luxurious Westfield mall. But beyond that stretches the rest of the London borough of Newham, one of the poorest places in the UK. Inside the Here East building, Newham’s Labour executive mayor Sir Robin Wales talked about jobs. He told a conference called Rising in the East that in the past six years the council’s job brokerage, Workplace, which began in 2007, had got well over 30,000 local people into jobs - people who had never worked or who had been unemployed for a long time. The secret, he said, has been to partner with local employers to help Newham residents to seize the opportunities the rapid development of this part of east London has brought - not just since the Olympics, but from the early years of this century with Westfield’s investment in Stratford City and the steady, long-term eastward shift of the capital’s economic centre of gravity. Earlier that morning (Wednesday), plans for the expansion of City Airport had been approved by the government, following London mayor Sadiq Khan’s dropping of objections to it that had been made by his predecessor, Boris Johnson. Green AM Caroline Russell, whose party would like the airport closed, is dismayed, calling the decision “reckless” and “terrible news”. Clyde Loakes, deputy leader and cabinet member for the environment of Labour-run Waltham Forest, one of Newham’s fellow post-Olympic “growth boroughs”, deemed it “incredibly disappointing” and a “kick in the teeth” for residents of what he says is the third most overflown of the city’s 32 boroughs. Sir Robin, though, made it clear he was delighted: more flights means more business, means more growth, means still more jobs. Another participant in the Rising in the East event, organised by thinktank Centre for London, was John Burton, Westfield’s head of development. He said the company had not moved in expecting the Olympic bid to be successful. When it was, the Newham mayor got on their case: “Robin’s message to us was ‘sort yourselves out’. He saw the opportunity for us as investors. Every time we had a negotiation with us, he left us with a very simple message: ‘I want jobs, I want jobs and I want more jobs’.” But, of course, there are jobs and there are jobs and there are jobs. London’s Poverty Profile for 2015 showed that Newham’s unemployment rate, as a proportion of the economically active, fell by 1% to 8.6% between 2011 and 2014 and that during the same period the rate of workless benefit claimants dropped from 13.8% among working age people to 10.2%. However, between 2010 and 2014, the proportion of employees in Newham categorised as low paid rose from 25% to 35% and the proportion of low paid jobs done by Newham employees went up from 17% to 29%. Between 2010 and 2015, Newham’s position in the league table of most deprived local authority districts according to the government’s index of multiple deprivation dropped from second to 25th place, only one notch above Islington (see page 15). The borough has produced a graphic mapping out the detail of this change. But some of it may be due to demographic shifts, as young, middle income households looking for relatively cheap places to buy move into terraced houses in Plaistow or shared ownership flats around the Royal Docks - they are “swarming in”, Sir Robin remarked. “The growth in zero hours contracts, insecure and part-time jobs limits progress,” wrote the LSE’s otherwise upbeat Anne Power in an early legacy assessment three years ago. Newham is conscious that many of the jobs of longer established residents don’t pay very well. It says it is striving to raise skills levels among locals through tie-ins with employers and points to a recent initiative with Lloyds and property developer Lendlease to boost construction industry careers. Newham adds that it is pressing the government, as yet without success, to allow it to enforce payment of the national minimum wage. The council says it knows from its housing panel survey that nearly one in five of the borough’s residents in work does not receive it, let alone the higher, voluntary London Living wage. Sir Robin expressed disappointment that Newham and other growth boroughs such as Hackney - whose City Hall-bound mayor Jules Pipe he credited with getting Hear East converted and occupied - and Tower Hamlets have not received the Games legacy support needed from post-Labour national governments. He did, though, say he was proud of what Newham has fought for and achieved. “No Olympic Games in previous history has made a difference to a poor community sitting right next to it,” he said, and concluded that London is the only Olympic city so far to have secured “anything like” a local legacy of that kind. “We can keep building on that,” he said."
2016-07-28T06:00:27Z,uk-news,UK news,HMRC cleaners striking over pay: 'They've treated us appallingly',"When George Osborne announced a new “national living wage” (NLW) to boost low-paid workers’ income and help people off welfare, cleaner Maria Hill looked forward to the modest rise the extra 50p per hour would bring her. Hill, 54, has cleaned the Liverpool offices of HM Revenue and Customs for more than 15 years. “Things are tight, really tight to be honest,” she says. When you are earning £201.60 a week “every bit helps”. It never occurred to her that she would be left much worse off and would end up on strike. As the April deadline for bringing in the NLW approached, ISS, the company that employs the HMRC cleaners in a complex subcontracting chain, told staff that it could not afford the mandatory rise. It informed them that it intended to claw back any increase in hourly pay by cutting each worker’s number of hours so that their overall wages stayed the same. Hill, on 30 hours a week, was due a £15 rise when the new rate of £7.20 per hour came in, but ISS cut her hours to 28 a week, clawing back £14.40. Other workers had their hours adjusted similarly. In some cases where cleaners were only doing a few hours a week, they say, the company docked 15 minutes a week from their rotas to avoid having to pay more. For Hill and several other cleaners – nearly all women in their 50s born and bred in Liverpool – there was an additional sting in the tail. Single people on low pay who work at least 30 hours a week qualify for the government’s working tax credits to supplement their wages. Ironically, these credits are paid out by HMRC, which is also the government department responsible for enforcing the NLW. When ISS lopped two hours from their working week, the cleaners fell below the threshold and have, as a result, lost between £40 and £50 a week in tax credit payments each. Several of the women have visited Citizens Advice bureaux (CAB) or the council’s One Stop Shop for advice in recent weeks and have been told they would be better off not working and receiving full benefits. Hill says that by the time she has paid for her bus pass to work, her gas, electricity, water and rent, “there’s nothing spare”. She has fallen behind with her council tax since the changes. “It’s really upsetting, You work all week and what’s the point of it, it’s just hand-to-mouth, beans on toast, nothing left to go anywhere or take the grandchildren out.”
Patricia Walls, 53, is in the same position as Hill. Her 30-hour week has been cut to 28 hours and she has lost her in-work tax credits. She worked throughout the years when her four children were growing up, enjoying the friendship and dignity a job gave her. She, too, now fears she may be better off not working, although she says she would hate to be unemployed. “I’ve worked all my life, I don’t want to give up,” she told the Guardian outside the HMRC offices in James Street. Those of the cleaners who are members of the Public and Commercial Services union voted to strike for two days this week against the changes and gathered around a bench outside the building to form a picket line. Beneath the steady flow of cheerful Liverpool banter and raucous clapping of ISS managers crossing the picket line, there was a sense of bewilderment and fear for the future. Walls was referred to CAB by her GP because the stress was already taking its toll – she ended up in hospital with high blood pressure and an infection. Having lost her tax credits, she would probably receive more money getting welfare and housing support, but since she still lives in the housing association three-bedroomed house her children grew up in, leaving the job she has done for 27 years would also mean leaving the family home, thanks to government’s so-called “bedroom tax” for under-occupancy. “It’s really stressing me out,” she says. Hill says. “They’ve treated us appallingly, we’re just a number, they don’t care about us,” she says. “The managers are not local.” ISS is, in fact, a transnational corporation, one of the largest employers in the world, with its headquarters in Denmark. It specialises in facilities management and doubled its profits last year to £250m, although none of the female cleaners we spoke to at the HMRC offices knew they were working for a foreign company. The origins of the arrangement for HMRC buildings date back to 2001, when the department sold off its estate of more than 600 buildings to Mapeley, a Bermuda-based offshore company, as part of a private finance initiative. The deal was later condemned by MPs as bad value and as undermining HMRC’s position as a tax collector. HMRC leases back buildings from a subsidiary of Mapele; a further subsidiary, Salisbury FM, is contracted by Mapeley to manage the day-to-day running of the offices. Salisbury, in turn, subcontracts the cleaning to ISS. HMRC said that while it “greatly appreciated the work cleaning staff do”, their terms and conditions were determined by the external contractor and that it had no involvement in their pay. “HMRC is absolutely committed to every worker receiving at least the national living wage and we come down hard on suppliers, including our own, who don’t share that commitment. All those who work for our third party suppliers can be assured of our determination to secure for all workers their legal entitlement to a living wage.”
ISS declined to discuss whether its contract to clean HMRC offices allowed for increases in pay mandated by government. “Our contract with Salisbury is commercially sensitive and details are not made public. We do, however, have the necessary checks in place with our client to ensure the cleaning provision targets are maintained,” it said in a statement. After the two-day strike, it said: “ISS has a duty of care towards our staff, as well as a contractual responsibility to the client. As such, we look forward to resuming discussions with our people, and to do so with their PCS trade union representatives and the other key parties involved.” A spokesperson for Salisbury FM declined to comment on questions about provisions in its contract with ISS for an increase in costs as a result of the NLW, saying that workers’ terms were a private matter between them and ISS, and that Salisbury’s contract with ISS was also private and confidential. Mapeley did not respond to requests for comment. Hills’s MP, Maria Eagle, said it was “beyond parody” that the government could not make sure people who cleaned its own offices benefited from the NLW, “a policy supposed to tackle low pay. It makes their policy look more like a propaganda tool than wanting to do something. These convoluted arrangements to distance employees from their employer are one of the ways working people have had money drained away from them in the last 20 years. This sleight of hand is the kind of things that makes people disillusioned with politics.”"
2016-07-28T08:31:47Z,uk-news,UK news,EDF set to give green light to Hinkley Point nuclear project,"The French energy company EDF is expected to give the go-ahead for an £18bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. EDF’s board will meet in Paris on Thursday and is almost certain to approve the project – the UK’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. The decision to proceed will be criticised by environmental groups such as Greenpeace, which have called for more investment in renewable energy sources. But unions will welcome the much-delayed project because it will create 25,000 construction jobs. Hinkley Point C will provide 7% of the UK’s electricity over its estimated 60-year lifespan and is scheduled to go online in 2025 – several years later than planned. That timetable could be highly optimistic given it will use the same reactor design as a plant being built in Flamanville, France, which is years behind schedule and more than three times over budget. Also France’s nuclear safety authority has found weaknesses in the reactor’s steel.
The delay in approving Hinkley Point has been largely due to concerns about EDF’s financial health, which has been compounded by the burden of the Flamanville project. French unions have warned that the company – 85% owned by the French government – could be ruined by the cost of the UK project. EDF has sought a partner to spread the burden and China General Nuclear Power Corporation is expected to take a 33% stake in the project. EDF said recently that Hinkley Point was a “unique asset for French industry as it would benefit the whole of the nuclear industry and support employment in major companies and smaller enterprises in the sector”. Speaking on Thursday on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the former Lib Dem energy secretary Chris Huhne said the project was worthwhile, not least as the main risks were being carried by EDF. He said: “It’s certainly a risk for EDF, because the nuclear industry has not delivered a power plant on time or on budget anywhere in the world for years and years.” But Huhne said EDF and the French government had a strong interest in delivering the plant. “The reality is, if they can make Hinkley Point work, and they can finally crack producing these things on time and on budget, there’s a potential market there in a low-carbon world which could be very valuable to French industry,” he said. Tom Burke, from the environmental group E3G, told the programme that Hinkley Point was a huge waste of money. “There is no doubt we need the electricity,” he said. “We just don’t need electricity from Hinkley, at enormous cost, very unreliably. We’ve much better ways in which we could achieve the security of supply that we need at affordable cost and in a low-carbon way, without going to this sort of trouble.” But Huhne argued that, at least in the short term, the UK needed nuclear energy to augment any move to renewable sources. “The reality is that in the northern hemisphere, when it comes to January and February we have amazingly high demand for energy and our ability to produce it from intermittent renewables is, at the very best, variable.” The business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, said last week: “New nuclear is an essential part of our plan for a secure, clean and affordable energy system that will power the economy throughout this century.” Unite urged the EDF board to approve the project, which the union said will generate thousands of skilled jobs and help meet the UK’s energy needs for decades to come. Kevin Coyne, Unite’s national officer for energy, said: “The cost of not doing so could result in the lights going out in Britain and the West Country missing out on the much-needed economic boost that this major infrastructure project would bring. Workers are shovel ready and raring to go – all they need is the green light from the EDF board.” Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, said: “Energy margins for the UK continue to decline and we need to take the practical steps which ensure that we keep the lights on and transition to low-carbon generation. A final investment decision will be good for jobs, good for consumers, good for the environment and good for the economy.” John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, said: “Every time EDF has tried to build a reactor like Hinkley, it has failed. There isn’t a shred of evidence that Hinkley can be built on time or on budget, and if it hits the same problems as its predecessors, it can’t be relied on to keep the lights on in the UK. “The UK government doesn’t have to sign the contract with the French and Chinese state-owned nuclear companies. We need to invest in reliable home-grown renewable energy like offshore wind which is powering other northern European countries more cheaply than Hinkley, even taking into account the backup cost when the wind doesn’t blow.”"
2016-07-28T13:31:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Southern rail guards to stage five-day strike,"Guards working for Southern rail are to stage a five-day strike from 8 August as part of a long-running dispute over the future of their roles, the RMT union has said. It comes as Southern’s services were hit by a string of delays and cancellations over the course of several weeks due to a combination of industrial disputes, staff shortages, and major engineering works. Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which owns Southern, has even faced calls to be stripped of the franchise, and Claire Perry stepped down as rail minister and was replaced by Paul Maynard. The dispute centres on Southern’s plan to implement changes to the role of conductors on 21 August. A spokesman for the RMT said it had offered a three-month pause to action if the company agreed to suspend its proposals for driver-operated doors and allow talks to take place, but that the request “has been kicked back in our faces”. He added: “The union wrote to the new transport secretary, Chris Grayling, asking for direct talks after he said it was a priority to sort out the chaos on Southern. That letter has been ignored.” The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “This action has been forced on us by the arrogance and inaction of Govia Thameslink and the government, who have made it clear that they have no interest in resolving this dispute or in tackling the daily chaos on Southern. “Our fight is with the company and the government, who have dragged this franchise into total meltdown. We share the anger and frustration of passengers and we cannot sit back while jobs and safety are compromised on these dangerously overcrowded trains. “It is disgraceful that neither the company nor the government are prepared to engage and are looking to bully through the extension of driver-only operation and the attack on the guards set for 21 August. “They should wake up and get round the table now as an urgent priority.” Govia Thameslink Railway’s chief operating officer, Dyan Crowther, said it was unacceptable that passengers were being made to suffer five days of disruption because the RMT was refusing to accept necessary change. “We are offering all our onboard staff a job, as valued members of our future operation, with no reduction in salary,” he said. “We value the work of our staff, who are trying their best to deliver service levels that passengers expect. “The sooner we can introduce the essential modernisation that our railways desperately need, the sooner we can stop the RMT from holding passengers to ransom. Contrary to the RMT’s accusation, we have always been open to talks and remain so. Only this week we spoke with the general secretary, Mick Cash, about further talks and he has been unwilling to enter into discussion.” Earlier this month, Southern cancelled 341 trains a day when it introduced an emergency timetable aimed at providing a more reliable service. Commuters met Charles Horton, the chief executive of Southern, at a “meet the managers” event at London Victoria station, where they expressed their frustration with services."
2016-07-28T13:41:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Resignation of EDF director paves way for Hinkley Point go-ahead,"An EDF director opposed to the construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant has resigned before a crucial board vote on the project, paving the way for the French company to approve it. Gérard Magnin said Hinkley Point was “very risky” in his resignation letter to EDF’s chief executive. Magnin did not attend the board meeting in Paris on Thursday where EDF’s remaining 17 directors will vote on the project. His resignation follows that of EDF’s chief financial official, Thomas Piquemal, earlier this year, which was linked to concerns about the cost of Hinkley Point. Magnin has a background in alternative energies and is the founder of Energy Cities, an association designed to help local authorities move to newer forms of energy. The French government, which owns 85% of EDF, proposed him as a board member in 2014. His appointment was seen as an attempt to encourage the company to invest more in renewable energy.
Magnin, however, said Hinkley Point and a proposal to buy Areva’s reactor building unit showed EDF was actually moving further towards nuclear power. “As a board member proposed by the government shareholder, I no longer want to support a strategy that I do not agree with,” Magnin wrote in his letter to Jean-Bernard Lévy, which has been seen by Reuters. “Let’s hope that Hinkley Point will not drag EDF into the same abyss as Areva.” The French government had to rescue the nuclear group from bankruptcy earlier this year. The £18bn project is controversial in the UK and France. EDF has net debt of more than €37bn (£31bn) and unions representing the company’s workers in France are concerned that Hinkley Point could jeopardise its survival. Critics in the UK are concerned that consumers will ultimately have to pick up the bill for the project. The National Audit Office (NAO) has said taxpayers could end up paying more than £30bn through a range of subsidies designed to support the project. The government has agreed a strike price, a guaranteed price for the electricity generated by Hinkley Point, of £92.50 per megawatt hour. This is more than twice the cost of existing wholesale electricity prices."
2016-07-28T13:45:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Hinkley Point C: should the Â£18bn nuclear power station be built?,"If EDF decides to go ahead with the construction of an £18bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset it would be controversial. A debate has raged about the merits of the project for a decade, with the following some of the key arguments for and against. For Britain needs to keep the lights on Hinkley Point C will be the first nuclear power station to be built in Britain for a generation. It will provide 7% of the country’s electricity for almost 60 years, helping to ensure that the UK produces enough energy to meet its needs. A better option than fossil fuels The government wants to phase out polluting coal by 2025, with nuclear offering a lower-carbon option that produces enough electricity to fill the gap created by closing existing plants. Construction is privately funded The £18bn cost of Hinkley Point C is being borne by EDF, which is 85% owned by the French government, and China General Nuclear Power Corporation, which has agreed to take a 33% stake in the project. Furthermore, the project is expected to create 25,000 jobs in the UK. Against Cost to consumers Although EDF and China are funding construction, UK households will subsidise their work through the price they pay for electricity. The government has agreed a strike price - a guaranteed price for the electricity generated by Hinkley Point - of £92.50 per megawatt hour. This is significantly above wholesale electricity prices and most renewable energy sources, where costs are falling thanks to new technology. Safety and environmental impact The 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster led to Japan and Germany announcing that they would shut down all of their nuclear reactors. Japan has subsequently restarted some, but Germany still plans to close all its plants permanently by 2022. Concerns remain about how to deal with nuclear waste, and France’s nuclear safety authority has found weaknesses in a reactor EDF is building in Flamanville, which is the same design as Hinkley Point C. Delays and cost overruns In 2007, EDF’s chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, said Britons would be cooking its Christmas turkeys on new nuclear power by 2017. Hinkley Point C, however, is now not expected to be completed before 2025. Even that deadline and the £18bn budget could be optimistic. EDF’s project in Flamanville is more than three times over budget and years behind schedule. EDF’s workers in France have campaigned for Hinkley Point C to be delayed or scrapped amid fears it could ruin the company’s finances."
2016-07-28T14:23:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Hundreds line streets for funeral of soldier who died on Brecon march,"Hundreds of mourners have lined the streets of a Scottish village to pay their last respects to a soldier who died on a training exercise on the hottest day of the year. More than 200 people, including soldiers in uniform, stood in silence as Cpl Joshua Hoole’s funeral cortege passed through his home village of Ecclefechan, near Lockerbie, in Dumfries and Galloway. In driving rain, the hearse was led by a lone piper and carried floral tributes. Hoole, of the Rifles infantry regiment, died last week in Brecon, Wales, after collapsing on the hottest day of the year, close to where three recruits suffered fatal heat illness in 2013 on an SAS test march. The coincidence led to fears that the Ministry of Defence may not have learned lessons about how to keep service personnel safe in very hot weather. Tests are ongoing to find out what caused Hoole’s death. Before the funeral, Hoole’s father said it was possible that an underlying heart problem could have been to blame. A former sergeant major and an Iraq veteran, Phillip Hoole, 54, told the North West Evening Mail: “Josh wouldn’t have wanted the soldiers that were with him, or the medics, to feel any personal blame. He was doing his job and he knew the risks. “Josh wouldn’t have been happy with the way that people have had a knee-jerk reaction straight away simply because it was the hottest day of the year. People have started to point the finger at the army.” Hoole, 26, had been due to marry his fiancee, Rachael McKie, next year and was to be best man at his brother Tyrone’s wedding in Edinburgh on Saturday.
Phillip Hoole said his son had been about 200 metres from the course finish line when he collapsed. He said it had been a normal run “with no extra beastings” and had been done within the confines laid down by the army. Hoole was one of about 20 soldiers who took part in a 13km march on lanes around the school of infantry in Brecon on 19 July. They left at 7am, by which time the temperature in the area was already 17.6C. It had risen to 22.3C when they returned at 9am. Each soldier was dressed in full combat clothing and boots and they were carrying 25kg rucksacks, but the march was not seen as a difficult one and did not involve severe climbs. The soldiers carried water and there were water stations along the route. The exercise was organised by Hoole’s own regiment to make sure he and other candidates were fit enough to take part in a demanding platoon sergeants’ battle course, which is run by the school of infantry. An army source compared the march to an MOT – an annual test to make sure soldiers had a basic level of fitness, but one that was much less gruelling than the SAS test. The funeral cortege made its way to the Crichton memorial church in Dumfries, where the coffin was carried by a military party."
2016-07-28T16:06:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Bradford MP accuses Pakistani officials of potential cover-up in 'honour killing',"A Bradford MP has accused Pakistani officials of colluding in “a potential cover-up” of what she believes was the “honour” killing of one of her constituents, who married against her parents’ wishes. Samia Shahid, 28, died last week after allegedly being tricked into travelling to Pakistan by her family, who allegedly disapproved of her love marriage to a man from a different Islamic sect. Pakistani police investigating the death told the Guardian on Sunday that there were “no visible injuries or signs of violence” on Shahid’s body when it was found last Wednesday in the family home in Pandori, Jhelum, 50 miles (80km) south of Islamabad. A postmortem report released on Thursday shows that her body did in fact have a “reddish brown linear horizontal bruise measuring about 19cm extending from just below [the] right ear and around the neck”. The Guardian has seen photographs of Shahid’s body, which appear to confirm the finding. There also appear to be two purple welts around her neck. Naz Shah, Shahid’s MP in Bradford West, has accused Pakistani authorities of a potential cover-up in light of the findings. She said on Thursday: “I originally intervened in this case to demand that there was a proper investigation into my constituent’s death, saying it had all the hallmarks of a so-called ‘honour’ killing. Having seen the autopsy report, I think we are now also looking at a case involving a potential cover-up.” Shah said she had spoken to the Pakistani high commissioner to the UK, Syed Ibne Abbas, who told her the Pakistani ombudsman was investigating. “I have asked for the police officer and the physician who did the first postmortem to be investigated,” the MP said. “Just a few days ago they were telling us the autopsy was inconclusive and that there were no visible signs on her body and now the autopsy report shows that there were marks on her neck.” Shahid’s family have said variously that she died of a heart attack or an asthma attack and insist they did not kill her. On Thursday, Shahid’s second husband, Syed Mukhtar Kazam, said he was not satisfied with the police and demanded a fresh postmortem. “They are trying to cover up this murder,” he said. “My life has been threatened, but there is no question of being quiet. It is a question of justice and my agenda is she was killed and I need justice for her.” He alleges that his wife was tricked into travelling to Pakistan by relatives who falsely claimed a relative had fallen ill there. On Wednesday, a special team was set up to hunt for Shahid’s first husband, Mohammed Shakeel, who fled Pandori soon after a complaint was lodged with police on Saturday accusing him and other family members of murdering his former wife. On Thursday, the district police officer for Jhelum, Mujahid Akbar, told the Guardian that Shakeel has been granted pre-arrest bail by the Rawalpindi high court. This procedure affords legal relief to a defendant in anticipation of a possible arrest, effectively meaning they cannot be arrested. Police said Shakeel presented himself to the authorities for questioning on Thursday. The family insist Shahid was married to Shakeel, a first cousin, and police in Pakistan say they have not received any documents proving otherwise. In fact, she divorced him in a UK sharia court in 2014 and then married Kazam at Leeds town hall in September 2014, after converting to Shia Islam, while her family is Sunni. Friends of Shahid in the UK said the family felt so dishonoured by her behaviour that they did not acknowledge she had remarried. A family member in Bradford was given a harassment warning by police in September 2015 when Shahid, who was living in Dubai, returned to the UK to try to patch things up with her family, West Yorkshire police said. Two people, believed to be cousins of Shahid, were arrested in Bradford this week on suspicion of threatening Shah. Both were bailed on Wednesday night pending further investigations."
2016-07-28T16:47:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Police end standoff after Surrey house found to be empty,"A standoff involving armed police at a house in a Surrey village that lasted for several hours has ended after a search of the property revealed it to be empty. Police raided the semi-detached house on Careys Wood, Smallfield, at 6am on Thursday in a planned drugs operation, arresting three people. Officers believed a fourth person was inside with a gun, leading to a lengthy standoff, involving a number of armed officers, an armoured Land Rover, and a helicopter from the national police air service (NPAS). A cordon was set up on local roads and residents were prevented from returning to their homes. But just before 4pm, Surrey police tweeted that it had “stepped down its response”. DI Paul Burrill, the senior investigation officer, said: “Officers responded to information that a further man was inside the property on Careys Wood and was believed to be in possession of a suspected firearm. Following a thorough search of the property with assistance from NPAS and the Surrey police dog unit no one was located inside the address.” He said police were now urgently trying to trace Paul Hodge, 57, who is wanted on suspicion of drugs and firearms offences. Burrill urged anyone who sees Hodge not to approach him but to call 999 immediately. The three people arrested at the property were a woman in her 40s, held on suspicion of drugs-related offences, and two men – one in his 20s and another in his late teens – held on suspicion of obstructing police. A number of guns were recovered from the house. Warrants were carried out at 15 other addresses across Surrey as part of Operation Aragon and 10 people were arrested in total. They all remained in custody on Thursday afternoon. Surrey police said the warrants were obtained as part of a large-scale investigation into the supply of class A controlled drugs."
2016-07-28T17:39:17Z,uk-news,UK news,"Newport woman died from 'side effects' of contraceptive pill, rules coroner","A sales executive died from the side effects of a pill prescribed for acne and as a contraceptive three weeks after her GP advised her to go for a spa day when she complained of pain and shortness of breath, a coroner has ruled. Business studies graduate Charlotte Foster, 23, was showing symptoms of a pulmonary embolism but was told by the GP that she simply had back pain, the Shropshire coroner, John Ellery, concluded. Foster, the daughter of a retired hospital consultant, suffered a cardiac arrest at work and brain damage five months after starting to take the drug Dianette. Ellery said “areas of concern” had been highlighted during the inquest and he was considering whether to refer the case to the General Medical Council, which investigates complaints about medics. Giving an narrative conclusion, Ellery said: “She [Foster] presented with symptoms of pulmonary embolism, but was diagnosed with back pain and was not treated for pulmonary embolism. The deceased died from the untreated side effects of the combined oral contraceptive pill Dianette.” Following his findings, Foster’s family said: “We hope that more people and medical professionals become aware of the potential risks, however rare, of taking this medication so that no other family have to live through this nightmare. “Charlotte was much loved by all who knew her, she had her whole life ahead of her and we are devastated by her death. We remain a close and loving family who will always remember the happiness she gave to us during her lifetime.” Foster, from Newport in Shropshire, was prescribed Dianette by GP Sarah Cumberlidge in August 2015 to combat acne and as a contraceptive. Cumberlidge told the inquest she had advised Foster if she suffered problems such as shortness of breath or chest pains she should contact the surgery. Over Christmas and the new year Foster complained of chest and back pain, shortness of breath and heart palpitations. On New Year’s Eve, her ribs hurt and she couldn’t lie down or breathe properly. She and her mother went to see her new GP, Sunil Simon, at a practice in Newport on 4 January. Her mother told the inquest in Shrewsbury that Foster complained to Dr Simon of pain in her back, right leg, of tightness of her chest and of being unable to take a deep breath. “He did not seem to listen to her,” Foster’s mother said. “He told her her problem was mechanical and that she should go for a massage or a spa day. I feel he should have immediately stopped her from taking the pill and investigated her for a pulmonary embolism.” On 22 January Foster suffered a cardiac arrest at work and was taken to the Princess Royal hospital in Telford. She was pronounced dead on 25 January. Dr Simon told the inquest he had had “no concerns” that Foster had been suffering from a pulmonary embolism when he saw her. He told the coroner: “I did not note any signs of respiratory distress or shortness of breath. The cause of her back pain was mechanical. When I observed Charlotte I did not observe that she had shortness of breath.”"
2016-07-28T17:42:54Z,uk-news,UK news,'It was a fake meeting': Byron Hamburgers staff on immigration raid,"Staff at Byron Hamburgers restaurants have told how the company trapped kitchen staff in an immigration sting by calling for a meeting about cooking burgers. In the first insider accounts of the swoop on foreign workers in one of Britain’s most popular burger chains, one worker said they were summoned to a meeting about the dangers of medium and medium-rare cooking of burgers.
“This was strange, because we already had this training,” said the worker, who has already been deported. A chef at a different branch in central London said they were told the meeting was about a new burger recipe. The targeting of staff at a dozen Byron restaurants in London was part of a carefully planned “intelligence-led” raid by the Home Office, which according to insiders involved between four and a dozen officers at each branch. One of the kitchen staff said she arrived for the meeting at 9.30am, but within minutes four immigration officers burst into the building. “They said, ‘nobody move, we’re immigration, stay where you are’, and then they started calling out names and took the people they were looking for aside,” the worker said. The officers then questioned the people over several hours, witnesses said. “I feel really sad about this. Everyone is hysterical about immigration. It feels like it must have been in the 1930s or something,” said a worker, who, like all the staff the Guardian has spoken to, requested anonymity. Another witness said front-of-house staff were not told what was going on. “I arrived at work for 10.30am to open the restaurant as a waiter. I was welcomed by about 15 immigration officers talking to my colleagues,” they said. “They actually were treated well by the officers, although I did hear one [officer] say, ‘I can’t wait for the waiters to come in (my best friend was one of the ones he was referring to) so I can pounce on them’. This absolutely disgusted me, as it was as if he wasn’t a person,” said a waiter. Another staff member told how one worker was taken away in handcuffs after objecting to his arrest. The Home Office has confirmed that 35 nationals from Brazil, Nepal, Egypt and Albania were among those arrested following the raid, which took place across London on the morning of 4 July. The government has not confirmed how many were deported, but one chef interviewed by the Guardian said “around 20” were taken to the first holding point after the raid.
“They had a list of names and some photos, which presumably they got from human resources in head office,” said one worker. Another worker, who has already been deported, told how he was bundled into a van marked “police immigration” and taken to a Home Office immigration centre near London Bridge. “There were 20 of us there, all from Byron. At the beginning, I couldn’t believe what was happening. But then, when I realised they were going to deport us, I felt so bad,” the chef said. “They were destroying everything I have done. I worked hard, I paid taxes and Byron did this to us. It is immoral. They were happy to employ me for years doing really hard work that no British person would do.” After a few hours at London Bridge, he was sent to a series of detention centres before being deported. First, he was taken to Tinsley House near Gatwick airport, then to Verne immigration removal centre, a former prison in Dorset. He spent a week there, then was sent to Harmondsworth near Heathrow. “I have had a hard life, so I wasn’t scared, I was very upset. They were not prisons but they feel like prisons,” said the chef. “We had no chance to call friends, to collect our belongings. I had things like a laptop, my clothes, all the things you need for life in London.” He was paid £10 an hour at Byron, where he worked for two years doing 50- to 70-hour weeks, he said. “The foreign people work very hard in this country. They work harder than British people because they have come from a hard life and we need to find work. I was a good representative of my country,” he added. Another kitchen worker said staff at his branch were told the meeting was about “a new hamburger that they were going to start selling”. “It seemed a bit weird,” they said. “Waiters and others have meetings but not kitchen staff. We went to the meeting at about nine. But then we were waiting for about half an hour. Then, about 20 minutes later, four or five immigration officers appeared and said we had to stay where we were while they asked about our nationality and who we were.” Staff said managers felt “betrayed” by the company as they had been told to organise the meetings. “It feels like they used us to shop staff, people who have become our friends over the last few years. I understand that they were trying to avoid a fine, but they shouldn’t be using their staff to do the Home Office’s dirty work,” said one. “Everything had been arranged for that day. It feels like a total breach of confidence by the bosses,” said another kitchen staff member. The waiter who witnessed the interviews at her branch said: “It was a fake meeting to entrap these guys who work 50+ hours a week without complaint. Two of the guys who were arrested were paid minimum wage. “I was so appalled that the area manager, directors and all those at head office would do this to these guys all to avoid a fine. They were fed to the lions.” The company confirmed it facilitated the raid at the Home Office’s request, but refused to respond to claims that it set up staff meetings on the pretext of being for health and safety training. The company has been attacked for its allegedly duplicitous role in the incident, with calls for boycotts and protests circulating on social media. On Facebook, a group has been established to coordinate a campaign. Amelia Womack, the Green party’s deputy leader, said the “alleged act of underhand trickery from Byron is unforgivable”. But others have argued the company had no choice in the face of heavy fines or even temporary closure, and say it should be supported.
Others fully support Byron, saying they were not only upholding the law, but were obliged to do so under the Immigration Act 2016.
Tougher sanctions on employers hiring illegal non-EU staff were introduced in the Immigration Act 2016, increasing the maximum custodial sentence on indictment from two to five years. It also introduced powers to close premises for up to 48 hours, in addition to heavy fines. In a statement on Wednesday, Byron said the Home Office acknowledged that it had complied with its legal responsibilities as an employer, but the company had been shown “false/counterfeit documentation” by those at the centre of the alleged immigration breaches."
2016-07-28T17:45:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Unions demand change after report into London's 'cattle-truck' trains,"More than a third of rail passengers are forced to stand on trains arriving in parts of London in the morning rush hour, according to official figures that show rail capacity in the capital has failed to keep pace with demand. Almost 35% of passengers arriving at Blackfriars on weekday mornings stand, making it the country’s most overcrowded station, as do nearly a third of those arriving at other stations including Waterloo, Fenchurch Street and Moorgate. The figures have led to criticism of “cattle truck-style conditions” from union leaders and passenger groups, including calls for rail franchises to be renationalised. According to the Department for Transport (DfT), 581,400 rail passengers arrived at London terminals during the morning peak of a typical autumn weekday in 2015, an increase of 3.2% over the year before.
Every single major London station operated in excess of its capacity, with the worst being Blackfriars where nearly 15% more passengers arrived than services were designed to handle. Across the UK, major stations operated on average 5% over capacity. The report said: “The worsening crowding levels show that capacity provision is not coping with rising levels of passenger demand, which has been the case in London and a number of other cities.” According to the data released by DfT, 30% of rail passengers travelling into central London on the 397 services that arrive between 8am and 9am – nearly 100,000 people – have to stand up. The return journey is little better, with 17% of passengers - almost 37,000 people – standing up on outward-bound services between 5pm and 6pm.
All major cities in England and Wales apart from Newcastle experienced growth in the number of rail passengers over the past year. In London, more than 160,000 additional passengers travelled by train compared with autumn 2011, the figures showed. Paul Maynard, the new rail minister, said: “These statistics reveal the unprecedented scale of passenger demand, with journeys doubling in the past 20 years. We are investing a record £40bn into the network to address this, delivering 3,700 extra carriages by 2019 and providing a huge boost to capacity through programmes like HS2, Crossrail and the £6.5bn Thameslink programme.” But union leaders slammed the latest figures, saying they were evidence that two decades of rail privatisation had failed passengers. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: “These figures mean that thousands of commuters into London have to travel in cattle truck-style conditions while also paying the highest fares in Europe just to do so. It is a scandal that this is still happening 20 years after the failure of rail privatisation. We need a publicly run railway with real focus on improving capacity and cutting fares.” Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, said: “It has long been our contention that privatisation has failed to deliver for rail passengers in Britain. We’re disappointed – but not surprised – by these figures. “Disappointed for those passengers – especially those who are pregnant or disabled – who have to suffer like this, and for those tourists who come to this country expecting a first-class public transport system in a first-world economy.
“Sadly, the privatised train companies are failing to deliver and this government is letting them get away with it. If you’re standing on your train today, then you’ll be standing on your train in 10 years’ time because the government doesn’t care enough to do anything about it and the companies only care about making money, not delivering a service.” A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, representing train operators and Network Rail, insisted that the companies would improve services. He said: “We understand passengers’ frustration when they can’t get a seat and we as an industry are working hard together to tackle overcrowding. “Over the past 20 years, record numbers of passengers have been attracted to the railway, which is why we are introducing thousands of new and modern carriages.”"
2016-07-28T18:04:35Z,uk-news,UK news,What do we know about Hinkley Point C's technology?,"Britain’s first new nuclear power station in more than 20 years will contain the industry’s most cutting-edge technology. Hinkley Point C on the Somerset coast will feature two European pressurised reactors (EPRs) designed to be safer, more reliable and more fuel efficient than anything that has gone before.
The EPR has been developed by the French companies EDF and Areva. A variant of the pressurised water reactor, it will work in the same fundamental way as previous generations of the device: nuclear fission triggers a chain reaction, producing energy. Water is then heated, producing steam that turns turbines and generates electricity. The technology behind the reactors is meant to be safer than any previous design. Taking lessons from the past – such as 9/11 or the nuclear disaster at Fukushima – EDF claims the EPR is highly resistant to external hazards, with a reinforced core designed to withstand plane crashes, earthquakes and extreme flooding.
They will be the most powerful reactors in the world but use less fuel – and produce about a third less waste – than older reactors. They can operate for longer, with less downtime for maintenance. The reactors will be available for more than 90% of their 60-year life, according to EDF. In December 2012, after an extensive review, EPRs were approved for use in the UK by the Office for Nuclear Regulation and the Environment Agency, which confirmed that the reactor met strict safety requirements.
But the scale of the reactors and their additional safety features make EPRs highly complex. Today, not a single EPR reactor operates anywhere in the world. Costs have overrun at the Flamanville nuclear plant in France, which is six years behind schedule. In Finland, where another EPR is planned, the picture is even worse: the Olkiluoto reactor is nearly a decade behind and three times over budget."
2016-07-28T18:58:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Nuclear critics condemn decision to give Hinkley Point C project go-ahead,"Nuclear critics are rounding on proponents of the giant Hinkley project – arguing that it has been negotiated in secret, is technically flawed and possibly unbuildable, and will condemn Britain to centuries of massive, unnecessary costs. “It beggars belief that this government, which prides itself on pinching the pennies, plans to spend tens of billions on Hinkley Point – the most expensive white elephant in British history,” said the Green MP Caroline Lucas on Thursday after the EDF board gave it the go-ahead. “It seems its commitment to inflexible, outdated, unaffordable power production knows no bounds.” Paul Ekins, professor of resources at the UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources, said: “At a total cost to consumers of nearly £30bn, Hinkley now represents appalling value for money. If built, it will force cheaper renewables off the system for much of its subsidised life.” Meanwhile, Greenpeace chief scientist Doug Parr questioned the competence of French energy firms EDF and Areva to build and implement the project. “This is a one-off project which can barely be afforded and which will lead nowhere,” he said. “There are serious questions over the competence and capacity of a company to build a project which will have safety liabilities that stretch centuries into the future.”
Parr said that Hinkley would increase the chances of nuclear proliferation and greatly increase Britain’s high-level nuclear waste. “Over its lifetime Hinkley will produce waste equivalent to 80% of all the waste so far produced in the UK in terms of radioactivity,” he added. “Protecting, guarding and maintaining this highly dangerous spent fuel on site for up to 200 years will be a massive challenge. The government has no plans for what it will do with it.”
Jonathon Porritt, the former head of the government’s sustainable development commission, said there were serious flaws in a similar reactor being built at Flamanville in France. “There is the increasingly likely possibility that the steel reactor vessel EDF has constructed for the EPR at Flamanville may be so seriously flawed as to require it to be broken out of the reactor building for repairs,” he said. “This would be an unbelievably expensive and time-consuming process.” Legal experts warned that the project would still have to overcome court challenges. Karla Hill, Client Earth’s director of programmes, said the proposed deal with EDF was “less than visionary and centralises the UK’s power production even more when the government should be creating a decentralised energy system for the future. What is more, state support for this project is the subject of two ongoing legal cases.” Paul Dorfman, a senior researcher at UCL’s Energy Institute, said: “UK taxpayers and electricity consumers will be locked into paying for the coming Hinkley debacle long after the current EDF board and UK government decision-makers are dead and buried.
“There is no way that Hinkley can deliver power by 2025, which is already eight years later than originally promised. And it is costing many more billions in subsidies than initially thought.”
Mike Childs,head of research and science at Friends of the Earth, said the negotiations had “been done in secret, with no transparency”. He said any deal to go ahead with Hinkley would be “a barking mad decision. At a time when renewable costs are tumbling and the costs of EDF’s other projects are soaring, we are tying our hands to a contract that runs far into the future at well over the odds.” But many nuclear experts welcomed the EDF board’s decision. “This is excellent news for Britain – and in particular for the UK nuclear industry,” said Paul Howarth, chief executive of the National Nuclear Laboratory. “Hinkley Point C will be an important element in the UK’s drive to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity to homes and businesses for generations to come.” Mark Wenman, a lecturer in nuclear engineering materials at Imperial College London, said: “The UK needs to remain committed to reducing CO2 emissions and Hinkley C, if built on time, would provide secure low-carbon energy just when we need it. “Although other nuclear projects have been delayed in Europe, this provides the opportunity to show that big infrastructure projects can be delivered in the UK.”
Other nuclear experts were more cautious and warned of escalating costs. “The amount of subsidy consumers will pay for the project could be many times higher than originally envisaged if low electricity prices continue,” said Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre. “Hinkley’s 10-year lead time means that it cannot address some of the more immediate challenges faced by the UK electricity industry.” John Radcliffe, an energy researcher at the University of Birmingham, said EDF’s decision came as no surprise. “There was simply too much at stake for British and French governments to let this deal unravel.”"
2016-07-28T18:59:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Hundreds of Eritreans' asylum applications still 'incorrectly refused',"Hundreds of asylum applications from Eritreans are being incorrectly refused by the government owing to its “unacceptable” policy on accepting refugees from the country, MPs have said. The home affairs select committee has called on the Home Office to explain why it still has not updated its guidance on asylum seekers from Eritrea, even though it has acknowledged the guidance to be wrong. The cross-party committee of MPs noted in a report published on Wednesday that 86% of appeals from Eritrean asylum seekers were decided in their favour in the first quarter of 2016. “This suggests to us that the Home Office country guidance for Eritrea was wrong and applications for asylum from Eritrean nationals have been incorrectly refused,” said the report. “This is the third consecutive report in which we have commented on the approach of the Home Office to asylum-seeking Eritreans. It is unacceptable that the Home Office is still getting so many of its decisions regarding nationals of this country wrong.” Until it controversially updated its country advice in March 2015, while Theresa May was home secretary, the Home Office advised that it was not safe to return most asylum seekers to Eritrea, which has been described as “the North Korea of Africa”. But the updated Home Office guidance claimed that citizens who left Eritrea without permission – many of them to escape its indefinite military service – would not face persecution if they returned. The change of advice was based on a report, produced for the Danish government, that has since been discredited and from which the Danish government has distanced itself. One expert, who led an independent inquiry into the Home Office guidance, said in January that “an undergraduate would be failed” for producing such a document.
The home affairs committee said that where there were concerns over the accuracy of country guidance, as there were with Eritrea, the Home Office should “suspend decisions until such a time that those concerns have been investigated and, where necessary, revised guidance put in place”, or risk repatriating people to countries that were known to be unsafe or clogging up appeals courts unnecessarily. In 2015, Eritreans accounted for the largest group of people applying for asylum in the UK, with 3,726 applications. The changed Home Office advice resulted in the number of Eritreans granted protection in the UK plummeting, from a 73% approval rate in the first quarter of 2015 to 34% in the second quarter. However, the majority of these rejections are being overturned on appeal. In the first quarter of 2016, 86% of all appeals of Eritrean nationals were granted. This number is far higher than the appeal grant rate for other nationalities – the next highest successful appeal rate is for Iranians at 52%. The home affairs committee also suggested that the Home Office review its country advice on Iran, given that such a large number of decisions were being overturned on appeal. The cost to the government of asylum appeals from Eritreans has risen by more than £5m since the change of country advice came into effect. An asylum claim costs an average of £1,300 to the government; this increases to £3,300 if the claim goes to appeal, according to the Ministry of Justice. According to freedom of information data obtained by the Guardian, in the year before the country advice was changed (April 2014 to March 2015) there were 308 appeals of asylum decisions from Eritrean nationals, at a cost to the government of roughly £1m. In the year after the change of country advice (April 2015 to March 2016) there were 1,894 appeals by Eritreans, costing taxpayers £6.25m.
Zecahrias*, a 35-year-old Eritrean who came to the UK just after the Home Office guidance changed and had his initial asylum claim rejected, said he believed the Home Office was deliberately rejecting Eritreans to try to deter others from seeking asylum in Britain. “They know what’s going on, they know the truth and we know what they are doing. Maybe the Home Office are saying, because we give them [asylum] easily, people are flowing to us, so if we reject them then people will not come,” he said. Zecahrias was serving in the Eritrean military – as part of an indefinite mandatory military service scheme – when he left the country after learning that he was in danger of being arrested and possibly killed by the government. Zecahrias’s father was “disappeared” by the government in 2000 and the family have had no news of him in 15 years. “I decided it’s better to do something and die than wait for them [to] kill me,” he said. Zecahrias underwent a harrowing journey from Eritrea: he crossed the Sahara, was twice arrested in Libya and travelled in a boat for 15 hours on the Mediterranean. While he was in Libya he met his girlfriend, who is also a refugee. On arrival in the UK he thought he was safe.
“We believed the UK government is the best-organised, the one who was looking after human rights, who have the power to change everything and make it right,” he said. When his asylum claim was rejected, Zecahrias’s girlfriend was pregnant and the news devastated him. He struggled to leave the house and lived in fear that the government would send him back to Eritrea, where he thought he would be arrested, if not killed. “If the government of [the] UK was planning to take me back home on the plane, I was planning suicide,” he said. “It’s not what I was expecting when coming to England.” He had his asylum claim granted on appeal, something he says is now expected by Eritrean asylum seekers. “I want to thank [the British government] for what they do,” said Zecahrias, who is now working in Leeds and supporting his girlfriend and son. “But they know the truth, they can solve this.” “All country information and guidance is based on a careful and objective assessment of available evidence from a range of sources including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, local, national and international organisations, and media outlets,” said a Home Office spokesperson. “We continually review our country information and guidance to ensure it is up-to-date, accurate and relevant, so that staff can make fair and considered decisions.” *Name has been changed"
2016-07-28T19:58:10Z,uk-news,UK news,How bold will Sadiq Khan's air quality improvement programme be?,"The final day to “have your say” on Sadiq Khan’s plans for improving London’s air quality is Friday, 29 July. Submissions can be accepted until one minute to midnight, so there’s no time lose. Khan’s main proposals, first set out back in May, are as follows: To bring forward the introduction of an ultra low emission zone (ULEZ) in central London to some time in 2019 from September 2020, which is when Boris Johnson had scheduled it for. Johnson’s ULEZ was set to charge owners of cars, vans and motorcycles that didn’t comply with its emission standards £12.50 a day to drive in the ULEZ, which exactly corresponds to the congestion charge zone. It would differ from it, though, in operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The ULEZ charge was to be on top of the daily congestion charge of £11.50 (or £10.50 for those who pay through the CC Autopay system) and any separate charge raised for breaching standards in the plain old non-ultra Low Emission Zone (LEZ), which has covered practically the whole of Greater London since 2008 and hits non-compliant vehicles with daily charges of between £100 and £200. Khan has confirmed that his ULEZ charge too would be on top of the congestion charge, and said that it will be set at “up to £12.50”, meaning it could be lower. To expand the ULEZ beyond central London from 2020 and possibly sooner - to the North Circular and South Circular roads for cars, vans and motorcycles and London-wide for lorries, buses and coaches. To bring in an interim £10 per day emissions surcharge - sometimes called a toxicity charge or “T-charge” for short - from 2017 for all vehicles with pre-Euro 4 emission standards entering central London (primarily those registered before 2006) before the ULEZ comes into effect. This would be levied on top of the congestion charge, exactly like the ULEZ charge. Khan has told Green Party AM Caroline Russell that he anticipates this encouraging “the early adoption of cleaner vehicles ahead of the ULEZ”. It is expected to affect about 9,000 vehicles out of around 150,000 that pass through the congestion charge zone each day. Khan also wants Transport for London (TfL) to require all new buses operating in London from 2018 to be hybrid or zero emission vehicles and produce plans for a diesel vehicle scrappage scheme in the hope that national government will take them up. He also favours supplying better information for Londoners about pollution levels in the city. These ideas have received a pretty warm welcome from environmentalists, including the Clean Air in London (CAL) campaign and Russell. They are recognised as representing a big advance on the more cautious and, some say, dubious measures Johnson took under the threat of European Union fines. But how far will Khan go? How far could and should he? CAL has given Khan a “generous 6 out of 10” for his initiative, but still says “it’s not good enough”. Rather than fining vehicles for emission standard infractions, CAL wants a straight ban on all diesel motors in high pollution areas. “The so-called ULEZ is nothing of the sort,” they say and argue that it is “mathematically impossible” for London to comply with World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels until at least 2025 unless diesel is outlawed. This view is shared in a new report for the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), which says “it is likely that diesel cars will have to be completely phased out on London’s road over the next decade” in order to comply with legal and WHO NO2 limits and WHO limits for “particulate matter” - microscopic bits of soot and dirt generated by motor vehicles. CAL also calls for a simplification of what could end up as an array of overlapping emission charging schemes into a single, London-wide one. When Khan launched his consultation at Great Ormond Street Hospital earlier this month, I asked him about a diesel ban. Why not just do it and make a really dramatic difference to air quality right away? Or was part of the thinking on the ULEZ scheme that it would bring in some handy cash for TfL? He replied that his plans were “cost-neutral” and encouraged me to submit ideas to the consultation. This was touching, though I imagine others will have covered that ground better than I could. As for a fully unified, pan-London emissions charging regime, it’s understood that Khan’s officers regard it as a very interesting idea and have been looking at something similar in California. It would be a long-term goal, but still worthy of examination in the mayor’s consultation. As I write, you have just over 24 hours to help make that happen. Start from here."
2016-07-28T20:06:24Z,uk-news,UK news,Complaint to police after officers put spit hood over man's head during arrest,"A young black man says he was left “bruised and shaken” after four police officers pinned him to the ground and placed a hood over his head during an arrest that was caught on camera by witnesses who said he was treated “like a dog”. IK Aihie, 20, was detained by British Transport police at London Bridge station on 21 July at 11.30pm. Footage filmed by a commuter, shows Aihie screaming as police officers hold him on the ground and later place a spit hood over his head. The hood is a full face covering used by police to prevent a suspect from spitting at arresting officers. His girlfriend, Jessica McConkey, can be seen in distress in the clip, claiming the couple were having an argument and the police arrested him. McConkey’s mother, Denise, said both her daughter and Aihie were left distressed by the incident. Aihie was held in a cell overnight in Islington and released the next day without charge, she said. McConkey has since complained to the force claiming it used excessive force. Aihie also intends to lodge a complaint himself, the Guardian understands. British Transport police have claimed Aihie became “aggressive” after police intervened in the argument, and threatened to spit at the officers. McConkey said: “Both IK and I are law abiding citizens and have the utmost respect for the police force and the work they do. However, in this instance we were treated unfairly and the use of force during IK’s arrest was excessive and unwarranted and I have made a complaint to the British Transport police.” Aihie told the Guardian: “It was a completely terrifying experience for both of us and I’ve been left bruised and shaken. I’ve never been arrested before and certainly don’t intend to ever again.” A commuter told the Guardian that she had “never witnessed anything like that before”. “I was going to take my train to Orpington and on my way to the platform I saw the guy getting arrested,” she said. “They were getting pinned to the wall and he was asking why he was being arrested. He was saying, ‘what are you arresting me for? I want to know’ and they weren’t answering. “He was clearly upset about being arrested, he was like: ‘Why are you arresting me?’ I want to know.’ He was kind of refusing it. There were a couple of policeman there holding him down and at the same time the girl was beside them and she was telling him to calm down. She was asking everyone to film. “[Aihie] wanted to know why he was being arrested. None of them were explaining why. That was making him frustrated. He said ‘I haven’t done anything wrong.’ “I think they could have explained to him why he was being arrested. The girl was shouting all the time saying: ‘He’s my boyfriend, we were having an argument, he’s being arrested for having an argument with me.’ “I’ve never witnessed anything like that before. I’ve never seen an arrest like that. I didn’t know – is that the usual way you arrest somebody? Putting on the spit hood – what was the reason for that? I didn’t see him spit and I was so close. I can understand it makes a person feel like a dog.” A British Transport police spokesman said: “We are aware of a video on Facebook of British Transport police (BTP) officers detaining a man at London Bridge station. “The incident occurred shortly after 11.30pm when officers intervened in an argument between a man and a woman. The man then became aggressive towards the officers, at which point he was arrested. “Whilst being held, he made a threat that he would spit at officers who then placed a spit guard on him. The man has since accepted a caution for an offence under Section 5 of the Public Order Act. “BTP has since received a complaint from a member of the public in relation to the use of force. This complaint is being investigated by our professional standards department to determine whether the use of force was proportionate and in line with BTP training guidelines.”"
2016-07-29T10:57:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Should we crack down on alcohol sale and consumption at UK airports?,"A crackdown on the sale of alcohol at British airports is being considered by Tariq Ahmed, the UK’s new aviation minister, in a bid to tackle disruptive behaviour at airports and on flights. Ahmed has called for the way bars, restaurants and duty free shops sell alcohol to be reviewed. Normal licensing restrictions do not apply to bars and shops in airports; they are allowed to sell alcohol at any time of the day or night. Ahmed also hopes to reexamine the measures that prevent drunk passengers from boarding flights. “I think that it’s important for the safety and security of all passengers that we ensure that regime is actually fit for purpose,” he said. At least 442 people were arrested in the two years prior to March 2016 on suspicion of being intoxicated on a plane or at an airport, according to figures obtained under freedom of information requests. Six men on a stag party were involved in a mid-air brawl and arrested by German police earlier in this year. And an easyJet flight from Manchester to Paphos was delayed after a 25-year-old woman allegedly assaulted the captain after being asked to leave the plane. Do you agree with reviewing the rules on alcohol sales and consumption at UK airports, or should people be free to make their own decisions? Share your thoughts and experiences in the form below."
2016-07-29T11:31:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Police find no evidence of reported gunman at Sheffield brewery,"Police have found no evidence of a suspected gunman who was reported to have entered a disused brewery in Sheffield early on Friday morning. South Yorkshire police had sealed off the former Stones brewery on Neepsend Lane, north of the city centre, after reports that a man carrying what was believed to be a gun had entered the site. There was rush-hour disruption as roads were closed and the public were warned to steer clear of the area for almost seven hours while officers conducted a comprehensive search. At about midday the force issued a statement saying it was confident there was no substance to the report, and that it wanted to reassure the public there was no ongoing danger.
Supt Scott Green said: “In the current climate, we will always take any report of this nature seriously and put measures in place to ensure the safety of the public as this is and will always be paramount. “I want to thank the public for their patience and understanding with this incident, as there has been major disruption in Sheffield this morning and we appreciate this has caused significant traffic delays and people being unable to attend their place of work and go about their daily business. “I would always encourage anyone to report incidents of this nature to the police, as we will always take action to ensure the city is kept safe and free from harm.”"
2016-07-29T12:05:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Why have ministers delayed final approval for Hinkley Point C?,"The government’s decision to delay final approval of the controversial Hinkley Point C nuclear power station has cast fresh doubt on the project. Theresa May’s government plans to review the proposed £18bn plant before making an announcement in early autumn.
The move has shocked EDF, which was expecting to sign contracts for the plant on Friday after the board of the largely French state-owned company signed off the project. This is what could have caused the government to launch a review: Theresa May simply wants time to study the project This would be understandable, given that May’s government is barely a month old. David Cameron and George Osborne backed the project heavily, and it is unlikely that a review would have taken place if they were still prime minister and chancellor, but they are now consigned to the backbenches. Downing Street sources insist that May agreed the review and a new timetable with François Hollande, the French president. However, if this explanation is correct, why was EDF surprised? The company had planned a VIP party and an interview with its UK chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, to celebrate Hinkley Point C being approved. China The Hinkley Point C project is being led by EDF, but China is providing major financial support. The state-backed China General Nuclear Power Corporation has agreed to take a 33% stake in the project. But May could be having doubts about Chinese involvement in such an important domestic project. Last year, Nick Timothy, her joint chief of staff and then aide, accused Osborne of “selling our national security to China”. In a piece for Conservative Home, he claimed that China was effectively buying Britain’s silence on allegations of Chinese human rights abuse. On Hinkley Point, Timothy said: “Security experts, reportedly inside as well as outside government, are worried that the Chinese could use their role to build weaknesses into computer systems, which will allow them to shut down Britain’s energy production at will.” Renegotiation of costs Although EDF and China will initially pay for the construction of Hinkley Point C, which will create 25,000 jobs, the cost will eventually be picked up by British taxpayers. The National Audit Office has warned that taxpayers could end up paying more than £30bn through a range of subsidies designed to support the project. The government has agreed a “strike price”, a guaranteed price for the electricity generated by Hinkley Point C, of £92.50 a megawatt hour for 35 years. This is more than twice the cost of existing wholesale electricity prices. The government could now look to renegotiate these terms, although EDF, whose finances are in a perilous state, is unlikely to be accommodating. Negotiating tactic for Brexit The construction of Hinkley Point C would represent a remarkable collaboration between the British and French governments. The UK is a vital growth market for EDF, with other major industrialised countries such as Germany and Japan closing down their nuclear reactors. By delaying approval of the project, the prime minister may be looking for some leverage with France as Britain begins talks about leaving the EU. The project is going to be scrapped To its critics in the UK and France, Hinkley Point C is an expensive, unsafe and outdated white elephant. Greenpeace claims that the government would be better off developing cheaper renewable energy sources, while trade unions in France believe that EDF simply cannot afford the project. The British government’s decision to delay approval could be a means of shelving the project without anyone losing face."
2016-07-29T12:46:57Z,uk-news,UK news,More than 520 children 'targets of online sexual abuse' in Scotland,"More than 520 children have been identified as likely or potential victims of sexual abuse online and 77 people arrested in a major anti-paedophile operation by police in Scotland. Detectives said they had uncovered more than 30m indecent images on mobile telephones and computers seized during Operation Lattise, a six-week inquiry launched by Police Scotland in June. The force has referred 122 children to child protection services and charged the 77 alleged perpetrators with 390 offences ranging from rape to sexual extortion, sharing indecent images, online grooming, indecent communications and bestiality. After seizing 547 electronic devices, detectives say they found 10m images of child sexual abuse or indecency on one electronic device alone, while a second suspect is believed to have communicated with more than 110 children and teenagers. The investigation is expected to uncover further offences and victims: the haul of images and leads was so large that investigations were still continuing, with further forensic examination of many seized devices ongoing. With detectives searching 83 homes so far and using covert technology to support the investigation, the force said it would need four officers working full-time for six months to assess all the images seized. Assistant Chief Constable Malcolm Graham said: “This is not sexting in terms of people sending abusive messages to each other. This is children being sexually abused and these images being shared. “It is about real victims in Scotland and elsewhere. It’s about these horrific acts which ruin people’s lives and we need to make sure that stops.” He added: “Let me make it clear. Child sexual abuse and exploitation, which can range from sharing images depicting the rape, sexual torture or assault of a child to grooming or sexually extorting a child takes place solely because of decisions made on the part of the abuser. “Online child sexual abuse is not a victimless crime: children, from toddlers to teenagers, are being sexually abused and exploited now in Scotland and when an image or video clip is shared or viewed, they are being re-victimised.” The initiative has been supported by the NSPCC Scotland. Its policy manager, Joanna Barrett, said the charity was increasingly concerned about the dangers facing children online. “Too many children are exposed to dangerous and harmful content through the internet or are subjected to online harassment, grooming and sexual exploitation,” she said. “We recently highlighted how the internet is playing an increasing role in the sexual abuse of younger children in Scotland, with a 60% rise recorded over a year in the number of indecent communications offences carried out by adults against children aged under 13. “It is vital we learn more about the nature and scale of this offending in Scotland, and its impact on children and young people.”"
2016-07-29T12:54:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Pigeon fancier faces ban over scam that won him top prize,"A leading pigeon fancier is facing expulsion from the sport after admitting cheating in one of its most prestigious races to win prizes worth £11,500. Eamonn Kelly, from Didcot in Oxfordshire, successfully defended his title in the Tarbes National last weekend, after one of 14 birds he registered for the race was recorded as having flown home from Tarbes in southern France with the fastest average time. In fact, it later emerged, Kelly had sent one set of birds to the south of France to be released but calculated a fake winning time based on the microchip of another pigeon that never left his loft in Oxfordshire. Kelly, who due to his long experience in the sport had been trusted as a race controller, now faces a possible life ban from the National Flying Club, which will convene a disciplinary meeting next week to decide his fate. More than 42,000 people keep pigeons in the UK, and its benign reputation can belie a fiercely competitive pastime in which races are hotly contested and often lucrative, and individual winning birds can change hands for thousands. Victory in the Tarbes race, one of racing’s blue riband events in the UK, won Kelly £1,500 in cash and a new Ford Fiesta worth £10,000. In a statement released to the Sun, Kelly said: “I was tempted and fell, a decision I will regret for the rest of my life. A sport that I love so much, that has given me untold pleasure and above all friendship, I have thrown all away.” The newspaper said Kelly, who owns 350 birds, had generated a winning time that suggested one of his birds had made the 580-mile journey at an average speed of 40mph. But suspicions were raised when other birds in the field, averaging 39mph, were still miles from home. In a statement Phil Curtis, the NFC’s chairman, described the incident as “unfortunate for the sport of pigeon racing”. A club spokesman said its management committee would meet to consider Kelly’s punishment. Under the rules of the Royal Pigeon Racing Association, the sport’s governing body, sanctions can range from suspension to a limitless expulsion from the sport."
2016-07-29T13:50:52Z,uk-news,UK news,EDF boss confident Hinkley Point C nuclear plant will be built,"The boss of EDF says he is still confident about Hinkley Point C being built despite the UK government throwing the nuclear power plant into doubt by launching a fresh review. Jean-Bernard Levy, the chief executive of EDF, said on Friday he had no doubt about the government’s support for the £18bn project. The board of EDF approved Hinkley Point C by 10 votes to seven at a meeting on Thursday, but the UK government then announced it would conduct another review of the controversial project and announce its decision in the early autumn.
Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, said the government would “now consider carefully all the component parts of this project”. However, Levy played down the delay. “There is no comment to make. The statement made by Mr Clark is perfectly clear,” he said. “I have no doubt about the support of the British government led by Mrs May.” Nonetheless, Levy confirmed he had not been warned about the government’s review and only found out when he saw the announcement on the internet. EDF’s UK chief executive, Vincent De Rivaz, was expected in Somerset on Friday morning alongside senior company officials to give interviews about the project. The event was cancelled after the government’s unexpected intervention. The Guardian understands that there would have been no review under the former government, led by David Cameron and with Amber Rudd as energy secretary, as a decision had already been made to sign off the project. Sources stressed that this response had come from the new prime minister, Theresa May, and her new ministerial team. May’s joint chief of staff, Nick Timothy, criticised the project last year because of the funding it was receiving from China. China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) has taken a 33% stake in the project alongside EDF. Timothy wrote on the ConservativeHome website in October 2015, that it was “baffling” that the government was allowing Chinese state firms to invest in sensitive infrastructure and that “rational concerns about national security are being swept to one side because of the desperate desire for Chinese trade and investment”. He claimed security experts were worried the Chinese could build weaknesses into computer systems that would allow them to “shut down Britain’s energy production at will” and argued against giving a “hostile state” access to the UK’s critical infrastructure. China has reiterated its commitment to Hinkley Point C despite the review and the fact a delegation had flown to the UK this week to sign contracts. A CGN spokesman said: “We respect the new government’s need to familiarise itself with a project as important to the UK’s future energy security as Hinkley Point C and we stand ready to help the government in this respect. CGN remains committed to delivering this much-needed nuclear capacity with our strategic partners, EDF, and providing the UK with safe, reliable and sustainable energy.” Ian Liddell-Grainger, the local Conservative MP for whose constituency includes the Hinkley Point nuclear power stations, added: “I am 100% sure this is going to happen, I am 100% sure it is going to be signed, and 100% sure that we will build it on time on budget.” He argued that Rudd as energy secretary, as well as Andrea Leadsom, who was a minister of state in the department, had time to understand the project and be positive about it. Clark, he added, was only two weeks into his job, and the prime minister was considered in her manner. “Knowing Theresa May, she is a formidably lady who makes up her own mind,” he added. “When you send her things she questions it, and it is always her who responds. That is how she ticks.” But a Conservative pressure group on the left of the party said ministers should use this opportunity to back out. Ben Caldecott, associate fellow at Bright Blue, said: “The government should abandon Hinkley C – pursuing it in light of all the evidence of cost reductions in other technologies would be deeply irresponsible. We need a new Plan A. “This must be focused on bringing forward sufficient renewables, electricity storage, and energy efficiency to more than close any gap left in the late 2020s by Hinkley not proceeding. This would be sensible, achievable and cheap.”
Shares in EDF rose more than 10% in France on Friday on the back of the delay and better-than-expected financial results. Trade union leaders in France have said Hinkley Point could financially ruin the company, which has net debts of more than €37bn (£31bn). The government’s new review was met with fierce criticism from trade unions in the UK. The construction of Hinkley Point C is expected to create 25,000 jobs. The GMB called the decision “bewildering and bonkers”. Justin Bowden, GMB national secretary for energy, said: “After years of procrastination, what is required is decisive action not dithering and more delay. This unnecessary hesitation is putting finance for the project in doubt and 25,000 new jobs at risk immediately after Brexit. It is a gross error of judgment and must be reversed.” Barry Gardiner, the shadow energy secretary, said the decision for a review at the 11th hour “sends the most appalling message out to investors”. He told the Guardian: “The government says we are open for business but it says to investors we will dally with you for 10 years, we will give an indicative contract and then after a final decision, when the chairman has been authorised to come and sign, you pull the plug and say we will take another three months.” Gardiner pointed out that both May and Clarke had been in the cabinet that agreed to push ahead with the plans. He said that Labour had warned about the contract for years, but argued that the way it had been handled showed either that ministers had been incompetent or that it was a deliberate decision. And if it was deliberate, then that is staggering, an incredibly aggressive act,” he added. He said Britain needed to retain relationships with European partners in a bid to retain single market access. “This is not a time to be making enemies, and particularly not of the French.” The CBI said the government needed to show that Britain was open for business. Josh Hardie, the CBI deputy director-general, said: “While it is understandable the government wants to get to grips with the details of the Hinkley contract, it must press ahead to finalise the deal as soon as possible. “The UK is facing a major investment challenge to ensure a secure, low-carbon and affordable energy supply. It’s crucial that we see clear and timely decisions, and send a definite message that the UK is well and truly open for business.”
However, Simon Walker, the director-general of the Institute of Directors, said the delay by the new government was sensible. “Considering the vast scale of this project, and the high price asked for the power generated, it is only sensible for Greg Clark to pause before making his decision,” he said. “The IoD is a firm supporter of building new nuclear plants to generate reliable, low-carbon energy, but the government is right to scrutinise the value of such long-term investments carefully.” French energy unions reacted angrily to EDF giving the go-ahead for Hickley Point C, saying it was a political decision. A joint union statement said the decision had been made “against the unanimous opinion of the staff representative and passed using force, an unusual step in the history of the company”. EDF’s central committee is taking legal action in an attempt to suspend the company’s decision. A hearing is expected on 2 August. A second legal attempt will be considered by judges on 22 September. “Such a project cannot be carried out or succeed against the will of the unions and staff,” said the union statement."
2016-07-29T15:13:18Z,uk-news,UK news,'You can't just walk away on a plane': passengers on drinking at airports,"Jack Rice, 19, is at Manchester airport with a group of friends waiting to go on his first “lads’ holiday” to the Spanish party resort of Magaluf, on Mallorca. The group have arrived four hours early for their flight and after they go through security, they plan to sit down and have a few beers before getting on the plane. “I’m not going to drink loads, just have a few,” he says. “We want to have a drink before we get over because it’s the start of our holiday. I’m not a big drinker, but I’m going to have a drink, because we don’t get there until later and I don’t want to be stone cold sober.”
On Friday, the aviation minister, Tariq Ahmad, who was appointed by Theresa May this month, announced a review of the sale of alcohol at airports after a series of incidents involving drunk passengers. Bars and restaurants in airports are not subject to normal licensing restrictions and can sell alcohol 24 hours a day. Although Lord Ahmad said he did not want to “kill merriment altogether”, the review will look at the times alcohol is on sale and the possibility of screening passengers before they get on their flights. Like many other British tourists waiting to board flights to sunnier climes from Manchester, Rice does not object to the idea that there should be a limit to the amount you can drink at an airport. “If you’re too drunk, you obviously shouldn’t be allowed on a plane,” he says. Mike Berridge, 39, is waiting with his wife, Karen, and their daughter to fly to İçmeler, Turkey. “Last year we sat just in front of an idiot who was far too drunk [and using bad language], and I don’t think it’s acceptable, especially when you’re travelling with children,” he says. “It really spoiled the journey.” A freedom of information request by the Press Association revealed that at least 442 people were arrested in the two years to March 2016 on suspicion of being intoxicated on a plane or at an airport. Several airlines have raised concerns with the government about the number of alcohol-related incidents on flights. In May, police were called to Manchester airport when a female passenger allegedly punched an easyJet pilot in the face after being ordered to leave a plane bound for Cyprus. In February, six British men on a stag party were arrested by German police following a mid-air brawl that caused a Ryanair flight from Luton to Bratislava to be diverted to Berlin. Louise Mowthorpe, 46, is on her way to San Javier, Spain, with her partner, Chris Knaggs, and 10-year-old daughter. She is in favour of trying to limit people’s drinking at airports, but thinks it will be difficult to police. “Some people use drink for medicinal purposes, or when they’re stressed, they have a drink. And some people can manage alcohol better than other people,” Mowthorpe says.
Knaggs says drinking in an airport is very different to drinking in a bar. “You’ve got a responsibility to other people’s safety on a plane. In a bar, you can just walk away from people, but [a plane is] a confined space and people are supposed to be able to operate doors ... You don’t want to be sitting next to someone who’s been drinking and can’t function properly if they evacuate the plane,” he says. A code of practice on disruptive passengers was published this week after talks between airlines, the police and bodies including the British Air Transport Association and the Airport Operators Association. The code instructs airport shops to advise passengers not to drink alcohol they have purchased before or during their flight, and calls for the training of restaurant and bar staff to limit or stop serving alcohol in order to prevent or manage disruptive behaviour."
2016-07-29T15:35:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Home Office has no immediate plans to change EU passports,"It was one of the more persistent if minor refrains from the pro-leave camp in the run-up to the EU referendum: an end to the burgundy hegemony of the standard EU passport. But it seems traditionalists are not – at least for now – going to get their old-style British passports back. The news – which will come as a particular disappointment to Nigel Farage, who disapprovingly brandished his EU passport on a more or less hourly basis during the referendum campaign – has come in a written answer from the Home Office. Michael Fabricant, the pro-Brexit Conservative MP for Lichfield, asked Amber Rudd, the new home secretary, in a written parliamentary question, whether she would “take steps to introduce a new passport with a navy blue cover for the UK following the exit of the UK from the EU”. Rudd replied: “There are no immediate plans for changes to the format or colour of the UK passport. Parliament will be informed of any changes to the passport following UK withdrawal from the European Union.” A Home Office spokeswoman said she was not able to expand on the answer or say whether the situation might change when withdrawal from the EU was finalised. The larger, old-style passports, commonly referred to as blue even though the cover was black, were replaced from 1988 by the smaller, machine-readable type, of a standard colour among EU nations, but for British nationals with the royal coat of arms and UK name on the front."
2016-07-29T15:59:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Questions of leadership and naked ambition,"Monday The sight of Mo Farah sprinting away from the field in the 5,000 metres at the London Anniversary Games was a welcome reminder that the Rio Olympics are nearly on us and that for a couple of weeks we can all get excited about sports, such as rowing and hockey, that almost no one watches in the intervening four years. Less welcome was the reminder that none of the British track and field commentators seem willing to utter one word against Sebastian Coe, the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations. As far as the Brit commentators are concerned, the fact that their old mate Seb was vice-president of the IAAF during the period when its president, Lamine Diack, was implicated in one of the worst doping cover-ups in the sport’s history is not really worth mentioning. Although Coe has said little on the matter, either he knew about the scandal and chose to do nothing or he was so hopeless as vice-pres that he was out of the loop. Either way, his appointment doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the sport’s future. Tuesday Labour isn’t the only political party searching for a kinder, gentler way of doing politics. After Nigel Farage resigned after failing to get elected as an MP for the seventh time at the last general election, Suzanne Evans was appointed leader – for three days. Then Nige unresigned himself and was reinstated as leader. Evans’s crime had been to be the sort of candidate that normal people might want to vote for as long as they didn’t have to think too hard about what she was saying. Since then, Evans has been suspended by Ukip’s national executive committee, which has put paid to her chances of becoming leader again. Today she formally announced she had given up trying to overturn her suspension and was going to support Lisa Duffy, a candidate no one had ever heard of instead. The favourite to take over from Nige is Ukip MEP Steven Woolfe, who is best known for reciting a poem he had written during the referendum campaign: ”As the sun fell on scapa fell / I heard the news and final death knell / Of England’s beaten heart / Destroyed from within / By its own kith and kin / Who sort to break it apart.” How come Kipling never had the linguistic audacity to internally rhyme “fell” with “fell”, to insert a homophone for sought that suggests the power to exclude and to use the absence of punctuation as a metaphor for having no control over our borders. Wednesday Meanwhile Labour lurches from one self-inflicted injury to another. On his first day out and about in his leadership campaign, Owen Smith managed to alienate most female voters by saying he was going to “smash” Theresa May “back on her heels”. Jeremy Corbyn remains the odds-on favourite, which will please most of the Labour party membership and the Conservatives. Opinion polls published today give the Tories a 12-point lead over Labour; more worryingly, almost one-third of those who voted Labour at the last election now think Theresa May will make a better prime minister than Corbyn. What this means is that if Corbyn does retain the leadership, then May could well call an early general election, at which Labour would lose at least 44 seats. After which disaster, no doubt, Labour would be forced to have yet another leadership contest at which Corbyn could well be re-elected yet again. No wonder one of his supporters, Jon Lansman, recently tweeted: “Democracy gives power to people. ‘Winning’ is the small bit that matters to political elites who want to keep power themselves.” A cynic might call it turkeys voting for Christmas. Thursday There’s an old gag that ends with the punchline: “I didn’t recognise you with your clothes on.” Channel 4 has decided to take this as the starting point for its new dating show, Naked Attraction, which cuts to the chase by treating its contestants as personality-free slabs of meat who choose one another on the basis of whether they like each other’s bits. “It’s very presentable when you go down there,” says one bloke graciously about a woman called Aina. Aina very wisely decides not to let him go down there. That was the show’s moral high point. You could say that Channel 4 is taking its race to the bottom rather too literally. Friday It’s often claimed that Boris Johnson speaks fluent Latin, French and Italian and passable German and Spanish. Yesterday he got the chance to construire some ponts with les Français after his speech at the French embassy, shortly after he was appointed foreign secretary, during which he was booed by some members of staff. In Paris for talks with his French counterpart, Jean-Marc Ayrault, who only recently accused him of telling loads of lies during the referendum campaign, Boris chose to address the French media in their own tongue. While there was something heroic about a British foreign secretary for once not shouting slowly in Anglais to make himself understood, Boris’s speech did suggest he had once again been economical with the actualité. Fluency in Boris-world is bumbling along in a public school British accent. “Bonjour Johnny Français homme. Je wanter to reassure vous que Grande-Bretagne ne quitte pas Europe although si vos border guards cause quarante mile traffic jams on the A Vingt encore then we may do. Tout ce que happen avec Brexit est that France will now have to combattre Les Allemands toute seule parce que Britain will not venir a votre rescue comme nous did dans les deux dernières guerres de monde. Merci amis.” Boris didn’t take any questions. No point in pushing your luck. Digested week, digested: The IOC came, they saw, they did as little as possible."
2016-07-29T16:33:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Most of those arrested at Byron burger chain have been removed from UK,"Most of the 35 workers arrested in a controversial immigration sting at the Byron hamburger chain have been removed from the UK. The Home Office confirmed that 25 of those arrested in the operation on 4 July on suspicion of immigration offences “have now left the UK, either voluntarily departed or been removed”. It said the rest were “having their cases progressed by Immigration Enforcement”. Earlier this week the Home Office revealed that people from Brazil, Nepal, Egypt and Albania were among the 35 rounded up in the raid. The removals come as more evidence emerges that Byron duped workers in 12 branches into attending meetings on 4 July on the pretext that they were training sessions on the dangers of cooking meat. An email from head office seen by the Guardian was sent to managers telling them meetings were to be held following visits from environmental health officers (EHO). Referring to “back of house” (BOH) staff and kitchen porters (KP) it read: “Morning, “Due to recent EHO contact and receiving two 1 star ratings along with an increase in food safety audit fails. “I feel immediate action needs to be taken in this area. In order to remain compliant and show that we are going above and beyond the expectations it is imperative that all our restaurants complete refresher Think Pink and updated food safety training. This will start from next week with a phased rollout across restaurants. The expectation is that all management team and BOH must attend including KPs.” The email listed 12 branches of the popular upmarket burger chain scheduled for the first training sessions, including Canary Wharf, Spitalfields, Finchley, Fulham Broadway and Camden. “Your ops manager will be in touch by the end of today to confirm the schedule for your area. As you know, food safety should always be top of our agenda and with the increased focus on our company from EHO, your support is much appreciated in this matter. Should you have any questions do not hesitate to speak to your manager,” said the email. Managers’ decision to dupe workers has angered some staff, with one calling it “disgusting” and another saying staff were “thrown to the lions”. Another said it was unfair that managers had been used to “shop” colleagues. It has also prompted calls on social media to boycott the chain, with one campaigner organising a protest at Holborn tube station in London at 7pm on Friday. However, many on social media say Byron was acting correctly to comply with the law enforcement agencies. One chef interviewed by the Guardian who was removed from the country, said he had been taken to three different detention centres before been put on a plane to his native country. He had been in the UK for two years and said he was not given any time to collect his belongings, including clothes and a laptop. Sources at the Home Office said reports on social media that Byron knew it was employing workers in breach of immigration laws were incorrect. “There has been no suggestion whatsoever that this is the case, if it was they would have faced prosecution,” said a source. A Byron spokeswoman said: “We have cooperated fully and acted upon the Home Office’s requests and processes throughout the course of the investigations leading to this action, and will continue to do so. We have also worked hard to ensure minimal impact on our customers while this operation was underway.”"
2016-07-29T16:46:56Z,uk-news,UK news,Hinkley Point C delay points to renegotiation rather than rethink,"Theresa May’s government has read the small print of the Hinkley deal and maybe it’s become spooked. But whether ministers are specifically anxious by the phenomenal long-term cost of the project, the Chinese state’s involvement, or the design and near-impossible construction of what would be the most ambitious and expensive power station in the world is not yet clear. Possibly, the new prime minister has been led to understand that the whole darn thing must be rethought. Or it could just be a momentary delay. What is not in doubt is that government is still firmly committed to nuclear power as part of the UK energy mix. So it seems unlikely that No 10 is planning a radical rethink of energy policy and a return to the pre-Blair, renewable-only days. Far more likely, the plan being hurriedly hatched is to renegotiate the deal with EDF and the Chinese, in the expectation that the French company’s tricky finances will force it to abandon the Hinkley ship. Then if the EDF deal unravels it will clear the way for government to swiftly adopt Plan B. This could involve the business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, inviting the Japanese giant Hitachi to expand its existing programme of two new reactors in Britain. The company, which owns the Horizon nuclear consortium, is well down the road of planning and building a new 2,700MW power station at Wylfa on Anglesey, and is already negotiating price guarantees with government.
The energy secretary Greg Clark has just returned from Tokyo after talks with the company that also builds small modular reactors, which are touted by many as simple to build, safe, secure and cheap. It is possible Clark has been speaking to Hitachi to step this up. But a Hinkley exit, if it happened, would give the energy secretary several new nuclear options. If the government is fixated on big, centralised power stations, Clark could also take a trip to Seoul, South Korea, where the national nuclear company, Kepco, has an envious record of building a range of large nuclear reactors more or less on time and on budget. If China is still considered acceptable, he could ask Beijing to step in. Either way, if EDF did step out of the way, he would be free to strike a better, cheaper, quicker nuclear deal as well as offering loans and sweeteners. But the business and energy department also knows it is a fact of modern energy life that nuclear costs are inexorably rising at the same time that renewable energy is becoming cheaper and more reliable. Not only is is becoming feasible to store the intermittent electricity generated by wind and sun, it is possible to tap into many other sources and distribute power very differently. The beauty of this week’s unexpected pause on the EDF deal is that it allows May to make a clean break with the Cameron government’s apparent ideological opposition to renewables and decentralised power. In the eight years since Hinkley negotiations started, renewables have been transformed. Offshore wind, once ruinously expensive, is now around 20% cheaper than nuclear power in Denmark; solar is so cheap it can be sold in supermarkets; tidal power is limitless and emerging; and energy saving, the Cinderella of the energy world, has proved itself the cheapest way to cut energy costs. All could flourish once the yoke of the giant Hinkley project is lifted. Because Hinkley stands to cost the taxpayer more than the Channel Tunnel, the Olympic games, Heathrow expansion and Crossrail combined, it would inevitably stifle all these emerging technologies for the whole of its heavily subsidised 60-year life. Maybe, the government has unexpectedly stepped back and opened the way for exciting options that it can now grasp."
2016-07-29T17:27:38Z,uk-news,UK news,Garden bridge charity delays publishing annual accounts for five months,"The charity behind London’s proposed garden bridge has delayed publishing its full accounts for five months, adding to concerns that the financing of the project could be in trouble. The Garden Bridge Trust, which aims to begin work later this year on the 367-metre tree and plant-filled structure across the Thames, said the delay in filing accounts to Companies House and the Charities Commission was simply an administrative matter.
As reports circulate that support for the £175m scheme is fading in government, and with the trust still waiting to hear if they will receive a funding guarantee from ministers, critics said they feared there was more to it. The accounts had been expected by the end of this month and were likely to shed some light on the project’s spending activities. In May the newly elected mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said the trust had already spent £37.7m of the £60m in public funding given to the project before any construction had even begun. There have also been questions about the extent of private donations to the trust, which says it still has to raise £30m of the £115m in private money needed, with some sizeable contributions remaining anonymous. “I suspect that the Garden Bridge Trust is using administrative tidiness as a desperate excuse to postpone publishing their accounts,” said Caroline Pidgeon, who leads the Liberal Democrats in the Greater London assembly. “It reeks of convenience to delay publishing their accounts just when there are so many questions they need to answer about how much they have really raised from private donors, and also how they have already managed to spend so much of taxpayers’ money.” The trust said it originally ended its trading year in October, the anniversary of its formation, with accounts filed in July. It was now moving to a more standard year-end of 31 March, to match the financial year, and would thus prepare 17 months of accounts rather than 12. These would be filed to Companies House by 31 December and the Charities Commission a month later.
A spokeswoman for the trust said: “We don’t have anything to hide – this is a decision taken for administrative reasons.” It was, she added, “sensible” to align its dates with the financial calendar. Earlier this week BBC’s Newsnight reported that the Thomas Heatherwick-designed project could be in jeopardy under the new government of Theresa May, which no longer featured George Osborne, a key supporter of the bridge. Khan is notably more sceptical about the bridge, which is to run from South Bank to Temple and feature 270 trees and thousands of plants, than Boris Johnson, his predecessor. Earlier this month Khan blocked some funding for part of the work pending a review. While proponents say the structure will be a tourist draw and economic boon that will provide a much-needed pedestrian link, critics say it is a vastly expensive vanity project on a stretch of the Thames already well served by bridges, and is likely to need ongoing public subsidies. The trust is waiting to hear whether the Department for Transport (DfT), which provided £30m of the £60m in public money, will extend an additional £15m in underwriting against the project failing, into 2017. This is seen as crucial for its viability. News on this had been expected this week, but has not materialised. The start of construction work has been put back from this summer until the autumn. A DfT spokeswoman would not give any details for when the decision might come. She said: “The trustees of the garden bridge have asked for an extension to the financial support the government is providing to the project. Ministers are considering the request.”"
2016-07-29T17:40:58Z,uk-news,UK news,'I have to get justice for her': was this British woman a victim of 'honour' killing?,"When Samia Shahid got a call earlier this month saying her father was dying in hospital and she had only days to reach his bedside in Pakistan before it was too late, her husband begged her not to go. “Obviously I could see it was a lie,” said Mukhtar Syed Kazam, who feared his British wife would not be safe with a family who felt a furious sense of shame towards their daughter. She went anyway and, six days after landing at Islamabad airport, was found dead on the marble-tiled staircase of her cousin’s house in Pandori, a tiny Punjab village filled with families that have one foot in Pakistan and another in Bradford. Kazam is convinced his wife is the latest victim of the epidemic of “honour” killings that has been sweeping Pakistan for years. More than 1,096 cases were reported last year, though the actual number of victims is likely to be far higher. Such crimes are often triggered by women defying centuries-old patriarchal codes and daring to make their own choice about who they marry, or how they live their lives. Shahid not only married a man of her choice, she also divorced her first husband, her cousin Shakeel, a man Kazam says she was pressured to marry in a lavish wedding in Pakistan in 2012. The marriage had been arranged when she was young and it is believed Shahid was expected to apply for a visa for Shakeel so he could join her in the UK. “The nearer [the wedding] day came, the more she didn’t want to do it,” said a friend in Bradford. She went through with the marriage but was so determined not to become pregnant that she asked a British friend in Pakistan to help her get the contraceptive pill – hard to come by in rural Pakistan. Shahid eventually returned to the UK, where she sought a divorce via the Sharia courts and couriered the legal papers to Shakeel at his Pandori home. Her rejection of the marriage is said to have gravely insulted her family, who refused to recognise the divorce. They reported her missing to the police in November 2014 when she left the UK to live with her new partner, Kazam, in Dubai.
Shahid met Kazam, a Pakistani living in Dubai, through mutual friends when he was visiting the UK. They fell in love and got married in September 2014. The family was never likely to approve. Kazam was an outsider; a member of the Syed clan rather than their own Choudhry clan and with no links to their ancestral village near the Mangla dam in Punjab. One of Shahid’s friends, who did her hair and makeup for her wedding, said the bride-to-be was determined to get not just a nikkah (an Islamic marriage certificate), but also a legally binding UK one. “That’s why they got married at Leeds town hall. She said to me: ‘You never know when I might need this [marriage certificate]’.I think that’s probably one of the best decisions she ever made.” Raising the potential for yet more disapproval from her family, Shahid converted to Kazam’s Shia school of Islam – an act tantamount to renouncing faith for hardline Sunnis. According to several friends in Bradford, she was frightened about her trip to Pakistan. “She was scared that she wouldn’t make it back,” said one. Other Bradford friends said they were not surprised she took the risk of going to Pakistan if she thought her father was seriously ill. He had always doted on Shahid, the eldest of his three daughters. “She was her daddy’s princess,” said a friend outside the family home. Shahid had attempted to restore her relationship with the family on a return visit to Bradford in September 2015, the Guardian has learned. She was sufficiently worried that she asked a police chaperone to accompany her to a meeting with her own family. It didn’t go well. Even with the officer present, the meeting became heated and one of her relatives received an official police harassment warning, West Yorkshire police said. “She was very smart, was Samia,” said a friend in Bradford. “That’s why she took the police officer with her. She thought they’d hurt her or take her passport off her or both.” Kazam said his wife’s visit to Pakistan this month was “the longest week of my life”. It became apparent that Shahid’s father, 50-year-old Muhammad Shahid, was not at death’s door, he said. But it was not until the day before she was due to fly home that Kazam said he began to seriously worry about his wife’s safety. The constant stream of instant messages she had been sending suddenly dried up, he said.
When he phoned her cousin, a man called Mobeen, Kazam said he was told Shahid – who he says was a healthy 28-year-old woman – had died of a heart attack. It was the first in a number of conflicting explanations of her death, including that she had fallen after an asthma attack. The local press carried a story claiming she had killed herself because she was depressed about not having had children, but the family have rejected this. Aqeel Abbas, the investigating officer on the case, played down the likelihood of foul play, telling the Guardian on Sunday that there had been no signs of external physical injury on Shahid’s body. However, it emerged days later through an autopsy – and pictures of her body seen by this newspaper – that Shahid has visible bruising around her neck. A source involved in the investigation said they suspected Shahid was poisoned. Naz Shah, the local MP in Bradford who has written to the Pakistani authorities to demand an investigation into her constituent’s death, said the development raised fears of a potential cover up. Kazam said he feared Shahid’s family would use their local power to hush up the investigation. The family prospered enough in the decades since they first moved to the UK in 1955 to build large houses back in Pandori. Among the family businesses in Bradford is Oasis Limousines, a luxury car hire company where Shahid’s younger brother Itezaz, known as Itty, rents out Lamborghinis, Bentleys and Ferraris. The Shahids had lived for years in a big, end-of-terrace house by Lister Park in the predominantly Pakistani Manningham area of Bradford, with a heavy metal gate and high hedge shielding the house from the busy road outside. Opposite is a parade of commercial properties, many of which are connected to Shahid’s large extended family. One is Cartwrights solicitors where a cousin, 37-year-old lawyer Naheem Akhtar, is a partner. He was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of making threats to Shah. Akhtar did not respond to requests for comment, but was bailed along with a 32-year-old woman on Wednesday night pending further police inquiries. Shah’s complaints dramatically raised the profile of a case that might otherwise have never gone further than the local Urdu language press in Jhelum district. The interior minister has demanded an in-depth investigation while the chief minister of Punjab has ordered a special committee of top provincial policemen to prepare a report into the affair within three days. The police have been keeping close tabs on her father, who was briefly arrested on Monday night and who has had his passport confiscated. Shakeel has also raised suspicions by fleeing the village and turning off his phone, prompting police to mount a search team. He reappeared on Thursday after being granted pre-arrest bail by the Rawalpindi high court but has not given a statement to police, who are anxiously awaiting the results of forensic tests. Shahid’s friends in Bradford have already made up their minds. One, a friend from the gym which Shahid frequently visited, marched immediately around to Trafalgar House police station to give a statement. “I told them: ‘My friend has been murdered,’” they said. “I have to get justice for her.”"
2016-07-29T17:59:11Z,uk-news,UK news,From feast to farce: how the big Hinkley Point C party was put on ice,"It was the lunch that never was. Cantonese-style pork crackling, Somerset brie and mackerel ceviche with creme fraiche were all on the menu for the 150 VIPs invited to Hinkley Point on Friday. The guests were due to celebrate a third nuclear power station at the site finally being approved. In keeping with the rest of the decade-long battle to build Hinkley Point C, however, the celebrations did not go as scheduled. By Friday morning the marquee was being packed away and the guests were nowhere to be seen. The menu had the distinctive flavours of the West Country, France and China to it to reflect the interests coming together to deliver the power plant. EDF, the French energy company, is building the new nuclear plant in Somerset with financial support from China General Nuclear Power Corporation. Planning for the party began a week ago, when EDF announced that it would make a final decision on whether to go ahead with the controversial £18bn project at a board meeting on 28 July. The French company had not been expected to make a decision until later in the year, so the announcement was a surprise. After 10 years of debate about the cost, safety and quality of the Hinkley Point C project, the final stretch looked to be in sight. EDF received another boost on Wednesday when shareholders agreed to buy €4bn (£3.4bn) of new shares in the company, providing another tranche of funding for Hinkley Point C. The agreement involved the French government, which owns 85% of EDF, buying €3bn of shares. By then, however, the Hinkley Point party was already in trouble. When Theresa May met François Hollande last week Britain’s prime minister told the French president that she would like to review the project herself. David Cameron and George Osborne had been enthusiastic cheerleaders. On Wednesday night May called Hollande again to confirm the government’s new timetable. Despite the French government being the biggest shareholder in EDF, it appears the 18 members of the company’s board headed for the crucial vote on Thursday afternoon with no knowledge of May’s rethink. Before the board meeting, the saga took another twist. An EDF director opposed to the new nuclear plant resigned and said he would not attend the meeting.
Gérard Magnin said the project was “very risky” in his resignation letter. His departure followed that of EDF’s chief financial official, Thomas Piquemal, earlier this year, which was also linked to concerns about the cost of Hinkley Point C Magnin has a background in alternative energies and is the founder of Energy Cities, an association designed to help local authorities move towards newer forms of energy. He said in his letter that he was concerned about EDF’s strategic direction and its growing reliance on nuclear. Magnin’s resignation suggested that EDF was about to approve Hinkley Point C, and so it turned out. At around 6.30pm UK time on Thursday, news emerged that the remaining EDF directors had approved the project by just 10 votes to seven. EDF hailed the news in a statement, calling Hinkley Point C a “unique asset for French and British industries”. Two hours later, however, the UK government made a more sombre announcement. Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial secretary, said: “The government will now consider carefully all the component parts of this project and make its decision in the early autumn.” This was not what EDF was expecting. It had been preparing to sign the contracts to start Hinkley Point C with the government and its Chinese partners on Friday. It swiftly cancelled plans to hold media interviews with Vincent de Rivaz, the boss of its UK arm, and for the celebratory lunch with VIP guests. A delegation from China that had flown over for the signing of the documents realised the trip had been in vain. Jean-Bernard Lévy, EDF’s chief executive, did not know about the delay until he left an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro, which was meant to celebrate the company’s decision to build Hinkley Point C. Lévy is understood to have read the UK government statement on the internet. There could still be a celebratory lunch in the autumn if May’s government approves the project, but the hangover from the lunch-that-never-was could be painful."

The child, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, told carers of disturbing levels of abuse when briefly in the care of Butler and his partner, Jennie Gray. Carers reported to a high court judge in a private hearing that the child told them they had been punished when they wet themselves. Their “head was put down the toilet and the toilet was flushed”. The child said that they “got smacks” at “mummy and daddy’s house” and described “my house” as a “bad” house. The alarming details of the abuse meted out to Ellie and the younger sibling emerged for the first time after the court of appeal ruled on Friday that the Guardian and six other media organisations could have access to this historic judgment on the case. In the 36-page judgment, Mrs Justice King, said she was also satisfied that marks on the younger sibling’s back and bottom on the day the sibling was admitted to care, which was just after Ellie’s death, was “probably with a belt”. Butler, who was jailed for life last month, and Gray, who was sentenced to 42 months for covering up Ellie’s death and for child cruelty, portrayed themselves as doting parents who would never have harmed their children. However, King’s judgment handed down after a private high court hearing relating to Ellie’s death describes “a highly dysfunctional and abusive relationship” in which the mother was subjected to “chronic domestic violence”. Ellie and the younger sibling were reunited with Butler and Gray in November 2012 after years in the care of others. A different high court judge, the now-retired Mrs Justice Hogg, had found the two children should be returned to their parents after an earlier conviction for assaulting Ellie was overturned by the court of appeal. Ellie had been living with her maternal grandmother and grandfather, who after Butler’s conviction revealed that he had warned Hogg that she and court staff would have “blood on their hands”. In October 2013, some 11 months later, Ellie was dead after suffering horrific head injuries. King, who was asked to look at the facts surrounding the case in June 2014, found that it must have been “deeply disturbing” for Ellie to have been moved “from the tranquility and calm of her grandparents to the toxic and abusive atmosphere” of her parents’ home. In a damning finding, she said that that one of the “most disturbing things” revealed in the abusive text message exchanges between them “was that the mother repeatedly sought to ingratiate herself with the father in a pitiable and wretched way at the expense of her children”. She said Butler’s description of the younger sibling as “an abs[olute] cunt” was shocking, language Butler tried to dismiss as normal during his trial. The judge found Butler and Gray to have been “untruthful” to Hogg and said that even with the assistance of an independent social worker it would be a “challenging rehabilitation” for all concerned. Ellie had not lived with her parents since she was a baby and her younger sibling had very little contact with Butler during their life in care. King found that Gray had been admitted to hospital less than two months after being reunited with Butler after becoming pregnant. Doctors were concerned that she had been subjected to violence as the consultant noted bruising on her thighs, but she lied about her status, telling staff that she was a single mother whose husband worked in the north. The judge also noted records that Butler had been judged “to pose a medium risk of serious harm to members of the public and staff” seven months after he had got custody of Ellie, during a court case over benefit fraud."
2016-07-30T11:55:38Z,uk-news,UK news,Seriously ill detainee was shackled hours before he died,"The Home Office has been forced to disclose the results of a damning internal inquiry into the treatment of a seriously ill immigration detainee who was handcuffed and chained in hospital until shortly before he died. The report, which has been passed to the Guardian, raises fundamental questions about the treatment of ill and vulnerable detainees. It identifies a failure in the Home Office’s duty of care towards a 43-year-old man with a heart condition who was handcuffed while he was sedated, criticises a “serious breakdown in communication” and calls for significant changes in the use of restraints on detainees in hospital. A Home Office spokesman welcomed the report and said that following the death new guidance had been issued relating to the restraint of detainees while under escort and for medical visits, along with new guidance about the reporting of serious incidents and deaths in detention. The report, written by the Home Office’s professional standards unit, examines the treatment of a foreign national who was married with three children and was detained at Harmondsworth immigration removal centre near Heathrow on 10 August 2012. The man’s name is known to the Guardian, but his family requested that it not be used. He was not deemed to be a risk to the public. He was detained because he had failed to report according to the conditions of his bail.
He became seriously unwell while in detention and was admitted to Harefield hospital in Middlesex suffering from heart problems on 9 November 2012. He died at the hospital on 17 November 2012, before he could have the aortic valve replacement surgery he needed. He was attached by his wrists to a two-metre closet chain for almost his entire stay in hospital. Handcuffs were used for some of the time. He was only released from restraints once and was not unchained until seven hours before he died. According to the report, the man asked to be released from detention and from hospital so that he could go home to die surrounded by his family. The Home Office declined his request, and two approaches from his solicitors. The man said he wanted to highlight the fact that he was dying while chained in the media, but this did not happen before he died. The report paints a picture of serious confusion and poor communication between the various Home Office departments overseeing the case and GEO, the private contractors at Harmondsworth, especially in the hours before the man’s death. “There would appear to be a serious breakdown in communication under the current detention reporting process,” the report states. The man died at 1.25am on 17 November, but as late as 15.45pm on 16 November, when officials knew he was dying, GEO refused to remove the restraints despite the Home Office asking it to do so. A GEO manager said the use of handcuffs had been appropriate. One Home Office official was not made aware of the fact that the man was being restrained until two days before his death. According to the report, the official said the information had horrified her. Among the reasons for GEO’s reluctance to remove the restraints from the dying man, the report identified the potential for a £10,000 fine if anyone absconded. One GEO officer interviewed in the report said he feared losing his job if that happened. The report states: “It is likely that GEO have a cautious approach to assessing the risk of a detainee absconding as this would result in a £10,000 fine.” The report calls for improved guidance on the restraint of detainees who need hospital treatment and better oversight of such cases by senior Home Office managers. It also suggests that new national guidance about handcuffing immigration detainees in hospital may be required. The case echoes that of Alois Dvorzac, a Canadian man with dementia who died in shackles after being detained at Heathrow airport while on his way to being reunited with his daughter in Slovenia. The prisons and probation ombudsman described his death as shameful and wholly unacceptable. The charity Medical Justice, which works to improve the health of immigration detainees, saw a brief reference to the man’s death in a 2012 report by the prison inspectorate into Harmondsworth and made a freedom of information request to obtain it. When the Home Office rejected the request on the grounds that the report would be too distressing for the man’s family, the charity appealed to the first tier tribunal. The appeal was successful and the tribunal deemed in the public interest for the Home Office to release the report to the charity. It was disclosed to Medical Justice on 7 July 2016. The report states that being restrained did not affect the outcome for the man but adds: “However, the fact that [the man] remained in a closet chain during his angioplasty when he would have been sedated and having a medical operation may be considered as a failing of our duty of care towards [the man] and therefore improved oversight is recommended.” Theresa Schleicher, the acting director of Medical Justice, said: “It is shocking that a dying man was chained to officers while having heart surgery. It is even more shocking that those responsible for reviewing and authorising his detention did not know that he was chained and that the Home Office contract appears to encourage this practice.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “New guidance on the use of restraints on detainees under escort was issued in 2014, with a presumption against their use for medical visits. Contractors must now complete a full risk assessment before their use and they must only be used as a last resort. “The use of restraints is closely monitored by the Home Office to ensure that it is reasonable, necessary and proportionate and in accordance with approved techniques. On top of this, we have revised our guidance to make improvements to the reporting of serious incidents and the handling of deaths in detention.” GEO did not respond to a request for comment."
2016-07-30T12:28:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Anti-Internment League march banned from Belfast city centre,"An Irish republican march is to be banned from Belfast city centre next weekend. The parades commission, which adjudicates on marches across Northern Ireland, has ruled that the Anti-Internment League parade should be barred from entering central Belfast. The commission said its decision was in part influenced by violence that erupted last year at the start of the march in north Belfast, and the refusal of the parade’s organisers to engage with it. It also said there was “extremely high risks of public disorder” if the march was allowed to converge on Belfast city hall. The commission said the organisers had breached times imposed upon them for the last march. The Police Service of Northern Ireland had to use water cannon to quell trouble in the north of the city last year, as officers prevented the march from leaving the republican Ardoyne district. Three men and a woman were arrested after petrol bombs, stones and bottles were thrown at police lines. In a statement the parades commission said: “The deliberate breach of the timing condition, result in public disorder by the parade participants and/or supporters last year, has increased significantly the risks of the proposed parade this year as has the organisers’ refusal to engage with the commission.” The Anti-Internment League has said it will mount a legal challenge over the parade commission’s ruling. The group includes a number of dissident republican organisations some of whom – though not all – support the “armed struggle” of the New IRA and other paramilitary organisations."
2016-07-30T13:44:15Z,uk-news,UK news,Government seeks to reassure investors as Hinkley Point C delayed,"The British government has tried to reassure France and China that plans for a controversial new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point C are still on the table, despite ordering an unexpected review into the £18bn project. The companies behind the initiative, EDF and China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN), were shocked when the UK refused to give immediate approval for the nuclear plant, which has been dogged by concerns about its cost and safety. The government intervened just two hours after French energy company EDF announced its board had approved construction of Hinkley Point C. However, the UK prime minister, Theresa May, is understood to have discussed her plans to reassess the £18bn project with François Hollande, the French president, during a phone call on Wednesday. Sources said French officials were satisfied with the UK taking a final decision in the autumn. However, officials close to the Chinese consortium said they were “bemused at the turn of the events”. Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, also met with the chief executives of both companies on Friday to try to reassure them that the government’s energy policy had not changed. A senior Whitehall source said: “There is a new prime minister and a new government with a major decision in the in-tray.” The source said it was not unreasonable for them to want time to assess a complicated deal that has taken years to develop.
However, there are understood to be new concerns within the government about the involvement of the Chinese state-backed CGN in the project. May’s joint chief of staff, Nick Timothy, criticised the project last year and warned the government was “selling our national security to China”. Timothy wrote on the ConservativeHome website in October 2015 that it was “baffling” that the government was allowing Chinese state firms to invest in sensitive infrastructure and that “rational concerns about national security are being swept to one side because of the desperate desire for Chinese trade and investment”. He claimed security experts were worried the Chinese could build weaknesses into computer systems that would allow them to “shut down Britain’s energy production at will”. Timothy’s views are in stark contrast to the approach adopted by the former chancellor, George Osborne, who courted investment from China in what was dubbed his “silk road” policy. Government sources played down the importance of Timothy’s comments on Friday. Ian Liddell-Grainger, the Conservative MP whose constituency includes Hinkley Point, added: “I am 100% sure this is going to happen, I am 100% sure it is going to be signed, and 100% sure that we will build it on time on budget. “Knowing Theresa May, she is a formidable lady who makes up her own mind. When you send her things she questions it, and it is always her who responds. That is how she ticks.” EDF and CGN, which holds a 33% stake in the power plant, were preparing to sign the contracts to start the project on Friday and had to cancel a celebratory lunch for 150 VIPs.
However, Jean-Bernard Lévy, the chief executive of EDF, said on Friday he had no doubt about the British government’s support for the £18bn project. “There is no comment to make. The statement made by Mr Clark is perfectly clear,” he said. “I have no doubt about the support of the British government led by Mrs May.” Nonetheless, Levy confirmed he had not been warned about the government’s review and only found out when he saw the announcement on the internet. EDF’s chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, said in a open letter to staff the company was “ready” to start building as soon as the government gave the go-ahead, the BBC reported. De Rivaz said: “The new prime minister has been in post for just 16 days. Her full cabinet has been in post even fewer. “We can understand their need to take a little time. We fully respect the prime minister’s method.” He added: “The very good news is that we are ready. The board’s decision means that when the government is ready to go ahead, we are ready, too.” The Guardian understands that May discussed the Hinkley Point deal at dinner with Hollande last week, in one of her first overseas visits as prime minister. While Cameron and Osborne had been waiting for EDF to give the green light to the project, May indicated that the final decision would be for the UK government, with one insider suggesting that September was talked about as a date for that decision. Given that EDF failed to finalise the Hinkley Point deal under the leadership of David Cameron despite being urged to do so, officials believe it should not be surprised that a new government wants to proceed with caution. They claim final approval was always expected to be in the autumn until EDF announced last week it would hold a board meeting on Thursday. One energy expert with knowledge of the deal, who previously worked in Whitehall when May was home secretary, agreed that she was not the sort of politician who would sign something off without understanding the detail. “She’s not a knee-jerk politician. She takes her time. She likes evidence based policy.” He said that contrasted with Osborne, who was willing to agree to Hinkley at an even higher price.
Barry Gardiner, the shadow energy secretary, said the government was in chaos and the new review “sends the most appalling message out to investors”. He told the Guardian: “The government says we are open for business but it says to investors ‘we will dally with you for 10 years, we will give an indicative contract, and then after a final decision, we will pull the plug and say we will take another three months’.” Gardiner said Labour had warned about the project – which could eventually cost taxpayers £30bn – for years. However, he claimed that announcing the review so late risked damaging Britain’s relationship with France just as negotiations about Brexit begin. “This is not a time to be making enemies, and particularly not of the French,” he added. Trade union leaders called the decision “bewildering and bonkers”. Justin Bowden, GMB national secretary for energy, said: “After years of procrastination, what is required is decisive action not dithering and more delay. This unnecessary hesitation is putting finance for the project in doubt and 25,000 new jobs at risk immediately after Brexit. It is a gross error of judgment and must be reversed.”"
2016-07-30T15:00:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Football scores a golden goal to keep Chinaâ€™s UK investors onside,"Once we had ping-pong diplomacy, now it is football-fuelled dealmaking. When Yaya Touré ambled into a small bar near Beijing’s Workers’ Stadium last week, little did he know he was the latest big name ambassador for the “northern powerhouse”. The Manchester City star offered a bemused smile as more than 50 Chinese fans rushed forward screaming his name, one holding aloft a scarf that declared: “I am a Cityzen.”
Touré’s guest appearance – 24 hours before City’s abandoned showcase derby match against Manchester United in the Chinese capital – was Manchester’s latest attempt to cash in on China’s record-breaking spending spree by appealing to its football-mad investors. The prize? A share of the $100bn-plus in overseas deals done by Chinese firms in the first quarter of this year – more than they spent in all of 2015, itself a record. These follow President Xi Jinping’s “one belt, one road” policy, aiming to address a slowing economy, falling currency and saturated domestic market. China’s cash-rich companies are looking increasingly outside London, with recent eye-catching deals ranging from a 60-year, billion-pound construction deal in Sheffield to the £45m takeover of Wolverhampton Wanderers by China’s answer to Warren Buffett, and a spate of Manchester property investments. At an investment summit hosted by Manchester’s business leaders last Monday, ex-players Dwight Yorke, Sun Jihai and Mike Summerbee entertained a coterie of Chinese executives before the dealmaking got under way at a plush hotel near Beijing’s Bird’s Nest stadium. Barbara Woodward, Britain’s ambassador to China, who was at the event, said: “Chinese investors are looking for very big projects. That billion into Sheffield is a very big project that can transform the city centre. There are lots of investors with a few million to spend, but in China there is a large-scale approach which is very suited to helping us regenerate, particularly the north of England.” In her first interview since Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, Woodward insisted the outcome had not shaken investor confidence in the UK. “This is a month on now and we’ve been very clear with the Chinese that the core investing fundamentals – skilled workforce, low tax, rule of law – all apply still. The Chinese are all signalling to us that frankly, with the pound lower than it was, then we’re a pretty attractive investment destination.” The ambassador also insists that the so-called golden era of British-Chinese relations – led by former chancellor George Osborne – was “not in trouble” despite the economic uncertainty, and experts predicting a cooling of the relationship under Theresa May. “I don’t think you should abandon the golden era at all – and the Chinese side too were very keen on that. No one is walking away from that,” she said. It may be months before the deals negotiated last week in Beijing become public, but executives present insisted that Brexit had not put the brakes on inward investment. “I’ve been very reassured,” said Sir Howard Bernstein, Manchester city council’s chief executive, who led the delegation in Beijing and said there were three or four big investments under way.
A Manchester-based executive at property broker James Lang LaSalle, which advises clients on flagship London properties including the Grosvenor House hotel, said he was “very hopeful” that new Chinese-funded deals would be announced within the next three months. Gary Neville, the ex-England footballer turned property magnate, last week became the latest to unveil plans part-funded by China that will transform Manchester city centre. His £200m project – which includes £15m from Chinese investors – will see the construction of two new skyscrapers, a five-star hotel and a split-level public plaza in place of an “underused and unwelcoming” block that will be torn down. Britain’s decision to leave the EU, said Neville, had prompted him to fly out to Singapore to offer soothing words to his business partners. “There is a level of uncertainty – there’s even more uncertainty overseas … I suppose in some ways we had a decision to make: do we go or do we stop? Our duty as Mancunians is to go.” Neville’s is just one Manchester project to benefit from Chinese funding following the state visit by Xi to London and Manchester last October. Flanked by David Cameron and Osborne, the Chinese president bestowed his blessing on the then-chancellor’s “northern powerhouse”, visited Manchester City’s football academy – taking a famous selfie with striker Sergio Agüero and Cameron – and announced the first direct flight from Manchester to mainland China. Ken O’Toole, chief executive of Manchester airport, said the new Hainan Airlines service had so far filled more than 90% of seats and could smooth the way for further big-money investment deals in the north. The airport is understood to be edging closer to another new direct flight to China, this time to Shanghai. “Prior to the existence of a direct flight, this money would have gone to London and the south-east but there is now clear recognition of the strength of Manchester and the north as an investment proposition, particularly in China,” he said. Manchester’s estate agents have for some time been reporting heavy interest for the smartest residential projects from Chinese buyers. In some developments, they are reported to account for up to 25% of buyers, as they seek better value than they can get in London. But where President Xi goes, money follows. Less than two months after his visit, media tycoon Li Ruigang paid £265m to acquire a 13% stake in Manchester City’s parent company. The Beijing Construction and Engineering Group (BCEG), which is backing the Gary Neville-fronted project and whose chairman was at the event hosted by Manchester’s business leaders last week, has also agreed to provide funding to kickstart a £650m development of apartments, office space and gardens at Middlewood Locks in Salford. The Locks was one of 20 northern projects that together formed a “pitchbook” of investment opportunities, which Osborne took to Chengdu last year as part of a bid to raise up to £24bn to fund development in the northern powerhouse. A Treasury spokeswoman said discussions were ongoing with more than 15 different Chinese investors over projects highlighted in the pitchbook. BCEG is also an investor in Airport City, an £800m commercial district close to Manchester airport that includes a £130m “China cluster” – called Wuhan Square and Shenzhen Gardens – designed to attract Chinese firms setting up in the UK. Last September, a group based in Xinjiang, Hualing Group, also agreed to invest £60m in Middlewood Locks, the Thorpe Park business zone in Leeds and a digital campus in Sheffield in a deal with the developer Scarborough Group.
But it is the 60-year, £1bn Sheffield deal with Sichuan Guodong Construction Group, announced earlier this month after 18 months of negotiations, that marks China’s biggest investment outside London to date. The first tranche of the funding will see £220m spent on a handful of projects in Sheffield’s city centre, including the city’s first five-star hotel, together with residential blocks and student accommodation that according to the city council should create “hundreds if not thousands” of jobs in South Yorkshire. A board made up of council leaders and Sichuan Guodong executives will meet twice a year, to jointly decide which projects to approve. Leigh Bramall, Sheffield city council’s deputy leader, said the prospect of connecting Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield and Liverpool within 30 minutes of each other – by much-needed upgrades to rail and road infrastructure – effectively made much of the north “one city, on a Chinese scale”. While 30 minutes to connect the four cities may appear a distant dream, the Labour peer Lord Adonis said journey times between Manchester and Leeds should be reduced to 40 minutes – from between one and two hours currently – by 2022. In the March budget, Osborne unveiled plans for a high-speed line from Manchester to Leeds – HS3 – and an 18-mile underground road tunnel beneath the Peak District, with initial funding amounting to £300m. While the announcements were broadly welcomed, there has been criticism that HS3 ignores major cities like Liverpool and Sheffield. Bramall said there remains an outdated view of the north among Britain’s London-centric investment community: “Some British investors have got a somewhat bucolic view of the north, or certainly have had historically,” he said. “The Chinese look at us with a fresh pair of eyes. They see the potential for big cities that have got great universities, with a fantastic quality of life, and they want to be part of the growth of those cities and make returns that way.” There is, however, uncertainty about Britain’s relationship with China post-Brexit and post-Osborne – especially since the government’s decision not to simply rubber-stamp the Hinkley Point nuclear power project, which has substantial Chinese backing. Steve Tsang, a professor of contemporary Chinese studies at Nottingham University, said May’s government would probably seek to cool Osborne’s “at any price” approach, which led to him being praised by Chinese state media for not emphasising human rights. “I think Hammond and May will want to have the relationship on a more normal basis,” Tsang said. And that could be bad news for the northern powerhouse plans: “If they do I would expect the Chinese government to be less helpful on the economic side. “It is the beginning of the end of the so-called golden relationship but I’m not saying it’s over – yet.”"
2016-07-30T17:03:14Z,uk-news,UK news,"Man, 31, stabbed to death outside tube station in east London","Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was stabbed to death outside a tube station in east London. Officers were called at 10.35pm on Friday night following reports of a knifing outside Bethnal Green underground station. They found a 31-year-old man who had collapsed on the forecourt of a petrol station on the junction between Old Ford Road and Cambridge Heath Road. The man, named locally as Luther ‘Beanz’ Edwards, was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead an hour later. His next of kin have been informed. Police believe he attended a boxing event at York Hall on Old Ford Road before an altercation with a number of people took place. No arrests have been made. The homicide and major crime command are investigating. Detectives are said to be keeping an open mind regarding any motive, but have issued an appeal for witnesses. Anyone with information should ring the incident room on 020 8345 3715, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or at Crimestoppers-uk.org. Murders remain a relatively rare crime in Britain, although the number of homicides in England and Wales rose by 71 to 574 in the 12 months to September 2015. The 14% increase was fuelled by rises in knife and gun crime, according to the Office for National Statistics figures. The rise in the number of homicides brings to an end a decade in which the murder rate in England and Wales has been falling despite the continued growth in the population."
2016-07-30T18:47:40Z,uk-news,UK news,"Britain’s energy dilemma: if not nuclear power, then what?","Britain faces a problem in coping with its complex energy demands. It needs to provide extra energy to meet rising demands for power in coming decades but at a reasonable cost – while also reducing carbon emissions by considerable levels in order to meet its climate change commitments. This is not an easy combination to achieve. However, Hinkley Point was considered by many experts to be a crucial aid in reaching these goals. With its massive 3.2bn watt capacity, Hinkley Point C would provide 7% of the nation’s electricity when completed. Night and day, it would help to generate the power that would keep the nation working while renewable energy sources, mainly wind plants, would provide the rest of the electricity needed by homes and offices. “You have to have some baseload source to provide power when it is utterly calm and renewables are not providing energy,” explains Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute. “Gas and coal plants – which can also supply that baseload – will no longer be viable in future because of their carbon emissions, which cause global warming. You are then left with nuclear.” This dilemma reveals a major drawback that affects renewable energy. Wind and solar plants are intermittent power suppliers. They often provide power when it is not needed but fail to supply it when it is required. And until a method of storing energy on an industrial scale is developed, this drawback will continue to bedevil its deployment across the country. Research into ways to store energy on a large scale is now being pursued across the globe but may take decades. Similarly, other game-changing energy projects are being worked on. One of the most important of these is fusion power. This aims to recreate the process that provides the Sun with its energy. Nuclei of hydrogen atoms are fused together at colossal temperatures inside huge reactors to create helium nuclei – and a great deal of excess energy, but little pollution or radioactive contamination. However, current devices – in particular the international Iter fusion reactor being built in France with British involvement – are currently years behind schedule and vastly over budget. Few experts believe fusion will get us out of our current energy problem. Alternatively, we could continue to use fossil fuel plants but take their carbon dioxide emissions, liquefy them and then pump into the ground, a procedure known as carbon capture and storage. Britain has huge, empty North Sea oil fields which many geologists and energy experts believe would be ideal for storing liquefied carbon dioxide. Several test projects were set up in recent years, with the government pledging to provide funding of up to £1bn until, in November last year, it abruptly cancelled the programme, halting work on all major British CCS projects. As Luke Warren, chief executive of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, said at the time: “This is devastating. This technology is critical for the UK’s economic, industrial and climate policies.” These may prove to be prophetic words."
2016-07-30T23:05:19Z,uk-news,UK news,"Five years after the riots, tension in Tottenham has not gone away","A police car sped past, prompting Tash to frown. “We are being punished because we dared riot. Tottenham used to be a nice place, but they took away our carnival and now the police target us,” said the 23-year-old, who works at the Coin-Op Launderette on Tottenham High Road, close to the junction of Forster Road.
It was from this north London corner that, shortly after 6pm on 6 August 2011, the first accounts of a riot were reported. The disorder spread with astonishing speed. More than 15,000 people are estimated to have become involved. About 4,000 of them were arrested, 5,112 crimes were committed and 3,800 shops damaged in London. Five people died as mayhem took hold in other towns and cities across England. Tottenham is where it began and Tottenham’s battle-scarred streets remain most closely associated with the summer riots of five years ago. The catalyst was the police killing of a local man, Mark Duggan, 29, when he was shot during an attempt to arrest him. Antipathy towards the police remains easy to find in Tottenham. So too the repeated allegation that the Metropolitan police force is racist. “It’s a colour war, but a diluted colour war because they’re careful in how they oppress people,” added Tash. Another disquieting theme repeated across the borough and neighbouring Hackney, both home to sizeable African-Caribbean populations, is the theory that an official policy is in place to systematically remove the area’s black communities. “It’s blatantly clear they want to ethnically cleanse us,” said courier Jason Hardie, 28, from Haringey. Police have attempted to ease tensions by reducing the volume of stop-and-searches in areas like Tottenham (although during June there were 495 stop-and-searches in Haringey, the fifth highest among the 32 London boroughs). But the issue remains one of ethnicity. During the last year police in Tottenham recorded 55 searches per 1,000 of its black community – more than twice the rate among the white population.
Many believe the police are more distant and aloof than they were before the 2011 riots. “You never see police on foot any more. They don’t talk to us, but they’re happy to speed up and down the High Road with their sirens blaring,” said electrical engineer Tony Davies, 49, speaking outside the Aldi supermarket that was attacked by rioters four hours after the first reports of disorder in August 2011. It is an observation that strikes a chord with Tottenham’s MP, David Lammy, who believes the draconian cuts to the Met’s budget led to the collapse of neighbourhood policing, loosening the bonds between officers and the community at the very time they most needed strengthening. “The neighbourhood policing levels have been decimated, the safer neighbourhood teams that existed at ward level, identifiable officers that people could call and who they knew,” said Lammy. “When people say they feel a different kind of policing, basically what they are saying is that they only see the police with blue lights.” There are also recurring claims from residents that the Met has opted for a more aggressive policing style. “They intimidate us. They keep control of the streets by looking tough, picking up people for minor offences,” said hairdresser Samantha Palmer, 24. Another resident, Darren, 22, who claims he was present during the Tottenham riots but was not arrested, said: “The police have calmed down, but they had to.” His friend interrupts: “But they’re still racist.” Darren nods: “Yeah, they’re obviously still racist.” As proof of discrimination, critics point to Scotland Yard’s “gangs matrix” database. Nearly 80% of its 3,422 individuals were recently classified as black. By comparison, only 439 white people – London has 3.66 million people classified as white British – were categorised as members of an organised criminal gang. Stafford Scott, coordinator of the Tottenham Rights group, which has campaigned against policing oppression in the area since the Broadwater Farm riot of 1985, said it was beyond dispute that the Met criminalises young black men ahead of any other demographic. He recounted an anecdote involving a conversation with an unnamed police officer who told him that “coppers in Tottenham have a bad attitude” and explained that they were “cocky and arrogant” because they had to endure two riots. Deborah Coles of Inquest supported Duggan’s family during the coroner’s hearing, which found that he was “lawfully killed” by officers. She says police discrimination remains a source of simmering resentment. “Young black men are disproportionately represented through stop-and-search, arrests, charging, higher sentencing – discriminatory treatment throughout the whole system,” says Cole. The Met did not respond to requests for an interview. Tottenham has attempted to rebuild itself since the 2011 riots, particularly through large-scale development projects which will see £1bn of investment deliver up to 10,000 new homes and 5,000 new jobs over the next nine years. But the re-generation projects have sparked new divisions.
On the Broadwater Farm estate, there is precious little enthusiasm for the ambitious reimagining of the area. Residents complain that they are excluded from the wealth of new opportunities being created. Broadwater resident Roy, 57, said: “The riot in 1985 was about food, water, basic needs. Now it’s about having a stake in society, the chance to be someone. You have all these developments springing up, incomers with money and we’re left looking on, wondering if we feature in the future blueprint.” Scott is among those who believe that Tottenham’s black community is being deliberately frozen out. “The local authorities and the police are working together to deliver collective punishment for those who had the temerity to riot a second time.” Indices supplied by Haringey council, however, suggest the regeneration is working, at least for some. Between March 2011 and 2016, employment rates rose from 56.7% to 68.7%. Similarly, numbers claiming jobseeker’s allowance fell from 6,550 in June 2011 to 2,862 five years later, with the drop mirrored among young people. Median weekly earnings for full-time workers rose by around £30, while the number of children receiving free school meals – a key poverty indicator – has fallen from 42.2% five years ago to 33.6%. Even so, a recent report by the Runnymede Trust documented profound ethnic inequalities within the area, particularly in employment and housing. When assessing ethnic inequality, it ranked Haringey as the second worst out of London’s 32 boroughs.
Undaunted, the leader of Haringey council, Claire Kober, believes Tottenham’s trajectory is such that the future is undeniably bright. Lammy suggests Tottenham had no choice but to regenerate, describing his constituency as struggling before the riots. “Tottenham needs regeneration. Tottenham cannot be the only area of London where everything passes us by. You then get into a discussion about the nature of that investment. The real issue, like the rest of London, is house prices, but that’s a macro-economic issue that’s unfair to land at the door of the local authority and even the mayor’s office,” said Lammy. The central concern is, the MP believes, the selling off of social housing stock and the failure to provide alternatives. “The collapse of subsidised social housing is a scandal – that issue for a community like Tottenham is profound.” As a result, too many locals, said Lammy, were living in overcrowded and inadequate houses at the mercy of landlords and without the hope of ever affording a home – the average price for a three-bedroom house in Tottenham is £550,000. “Even if they can afford to buy, there is very little prospect of their children becoming owner-occupiers. That reality is also fracturing communities,” said Lammy. The disintegration of neighbourhoods is similarly evident in rapidly gentrifying Hackney. One of the most recognisable faces from the 2011 riots was Pauline Pearce, nicknamed the “Hackney heroine” after standing up to troublemakers.She said: ”The authorities want to ethnically cleanse Hackney, get rid of its grassroots. By doing so they are getting rid of its culture, the diversity we celebrate here.” Pearce, 50, described adverts in Hackney promoting new housing developments that feature no ethnic minorities. “On one billboard were pictures of very trendy middle-class white folks and it said: ‘Turn your back on the norm.’ That’s sad.” Along Hackney’s Clarence Road, which runs parallel to the Pembury Estate – scene of some of the worst rioting – the mood was the same. Inside the Finger Licking Caribbean Takeaway, whose patrons sit beside a smoking oil drum barbecuing chicken as they listen to reggae, the chef said: “They are trying to drive us out, they are killing us, putting business rates higher all the time.” Pearce, a Lib Dem prospective parliamentary candidate, added: “People are struggling because of the rates. It’s hurting one-man businesses, pushing them out.” Further along Clarence Road, inside the R&B cafe, the refrain was similar. “Property prices are crushing us. My daughters cannot afford to live here, but instead they allow the yuppies to come in and push us out,” said one customer.
But others insist that Hackney’s transforming demographic, coupled with a range of social initiatives, has improved the borough. A poll released on Thursday revealed that 74.5% of the Pembury estate’s 3,500 tenants believe life has “got better” over the last five years. In Tottenham too there are those who believe gentrification is unambiguously positive. Zeshan, who owns the Pound Plus store opposite the High Road’s police station, said: “The area feels calmer. I see a lot of new faces, a lot of newcomers, and it creates a better mix.” Some are even more enthusiastic. Ali Mohammed, 45, who fled Somalia 10 years ago, described Haringey as the “best place on Earth”. Beaming, he added: “People have a good society here, it’s perfect.” Could the riots happen again? Lammy is adamant that his constituency will not countenance another repeat, but concedes that the social peace is fragile. “The people of Tottenham recognise that sort of destruction a third time would be a huge act of self harm. Having said that, austerity is real, unemployment is real, [there are] the strapped services – the local authority has lost £225m in five years – and the consequences of youth centres closing, day centres closing.” Others say fresh disorder is inevitable, a matter of when, not if. According to Pearce: “This country could turn into a riot at any time. Look at the curent levels of racism, at America where the police think it’s OK to kill. This is where I start to get scared.” Davies, speaking outside Tottenham’s Aldi supermarket, said: “There will be another riot. The police are not communicating, there’s tension.” Cole adds that mistrust towards the police remains undiminished since Duggan’s death, citing a lack of accountability as key. “A lot of those concerns are still very much alive today,” she said. Lammy points to research showing that three-quarters of 63 proposals made by an official panel into the riots have yet to be implemented, including mentoring for convicted youth offenders, along with fresh measures to prevent young people going without education, employment or training. “The lessons of the riots were swept under a giant carpet,” says Lammy. “We needed to ensure that people have a stake in society. Have we got there? No we haven’t.” CLAIRE KOBER
Leader of Haringey council “Tottenham is the future of London, with cutting-edge arts and culture, world-class sports, a strong community and a proud history. Rising employment and school standards and the number of businesses relocating from other parts of London over the last five years show Tottenham is heading in the right direction. We’re working around the clock to ensure a child born in Tottenham today will have a quality of life and access to the same level of opportunity, at least equal, to the best in London by age 20.” STAFFORD SCOTT
Activist and coordinator of the pressure group Tottenham Rights “The conditions for another riot are still there, absolutely. If you go to Broadwater Farm estate they’ll tell you things have got worse because unemployment is even higher. Now the authorities are trying to kick them out without any understanding or appreciation that they are the ones responsible for these young kids being born into environments that will encourage the behaviour they are now being punished for. There is inequality in health, education and unemployment, along with the policy of getting into bed with big developers where they put in tiny amounts of affordable housing.” DAVID LAMMY
Labour MP for Tottenham “The riots were the the lowest moment of my political life, comforting men, women and children standing just in their pyjamas with their homes and shops burnt to the ground. Frankly it took years off my life. When neighbours do that to one another, it is a horrendous thing. There are still victims recovering, children who have nightmares, people who have had heart attacks as a consequence. The legacy it leaves to an area is not to be underestimated and part of what you have got to overcome is stigma and the perception that remains, long after the cameras and journalists, the external actors, have left.” PAULINE PEARCE
Hackney resident and Lib Dem prospective parliamentary candidate “There’s been an improvement regarding outreach work and it went crazy with schemes to help young people, but as far as gentifrication and the housing and the benefits situation goes, it’s been negative. Apparently they’re still arresting people from the riots. Five years later! Oh come on! These are people who got carried away in the moment. You’ve got 100 people and 98 are smashing the shit out of everything. Are you going to be the only two to stand there? In a place like Pembury [estate] you’d be accused of being an informer. ”"
2016-07-30T23:30:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May 'raised objections to project as home secretary',"Theresa May raised objections to the Hinkley Point C nuclear power deal during the coalition government, the former business secretary Sir Vince Cable has claimed, in remarks that will throw fresh doubt over the project’s future. Cable said that as home secretary, May had been unhappy about the former chancellor George Osborne’s “gung-ho” attitude to Chinese investment. Speaking after May unexpectedly delayed signing-off on government support for the new power station, Cable described the late decision as clumsy but understandable. “Certainly, when we were in government, Theresa May was, I think, quite clear that she was unhappy about the rather gung-ho approach to Chinese investment that we had, and that George Osborne in particular was promoting and, as I recall, raised objections to Hinkley at that time,” he said.
EDF’s board had voted narrowly to give its final go-ahead for the long-delayed joint project on Thursday, only for Downing Street to pull back from signing the contract and say it would make a decision in the early autumn. The move surprised EDF executives, who were preparing to sign contracts with the government the next day. The company’s UK chief executive, Vincent De Rivaz, was forced to cancel a round of media interviews. Officials from China General Nuclear, which has a one-third stake in the Hinkley project, were also expected to attend a media event in Somerset. De Rivaz has since written to workers in a bid to reassure them the £18bn project is still strong despite the unexpected delay. He said he had met the business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, after the announcement that the government would “consider carefully” all parts of the project before making a decision. He wrote to employees: “My message today is one of continuity and confidence. The EDF board’s decision is a huge achievement and one we should be proud of. Our journey is a long one and there is a further stage. Our job now is to maintain the courage, patience and dedication that have served us so well.” Comments by May’s chief of staff, Nick Timothy, last year have led to claims that the delay has been prompted by concerns that Chinese state-owned companies were being allowed to invest in sensitive infrastructure.
Timothy wrote on the ConservativeHome website: “Rational concerns about national security are being swept to one side because of the desperate desire for Chinese trade and investment.” One former cabinet minister said he believed it was “100%” down to Timothy’s intervention that the project had been stalled. “Nick is in an incredibly powerful position,” the source said. “Theresa listens to his every utterance, reads out his speeches and the reshuffle, I’m pretty sure, leads back to him. This is nothing to do with ministers. It will put [the chancellor] Philip Hammond’s nose out of joint and we shall have to see how that plays out.” The Tory MP in whose constituency the plant will be built, Ian Liddell-Grainger, said he did not believe Timothy could have been serious in his comments. He said: “All he was saying is that his concern is the amount of infrastructure that is going to the Chinese. But if that was the case, are we happy that Huawei are running Whitehall communications, as it is their hardware. “You know the Chinese are doing HS2? Are we saying we don’t want the Chinese to do anything and we don’t want their companies to be involved locally anywhere in the UK? The answer is no, that is not what he is saying. I don’t think there is any doubt that he has put forward an idea, but I don’t think he is serious about it.” The former Tory co-chairman Grant Shapps, who leads the all-party British Infrastructure Group, said MPs would be concerned if the pause continued beyond the autumn. He said: “If this is ‘stop, take a breathe, check the numbers and press ahead’, then fine, no one is going to begrudge. But if this is truly just another piece of big infrastructure where we bottle it and don’t do it, like airports, then that is bad news for Britain PLC. “Particularly that is the case post-Brexit when the world needs to see we are out there and prepared to engage internationally and frankly take international investment. Companies have to take pretty serious decisions about these kinds of investment. It makes deals more expensive in the future if we chop and change. So, benefit of doubt, but not for very long is my view.” Jason Millett, the chief operating officer for major programmes and infrastructure at Mace, a major contractor at Hinkley Point, added that the decision to delay had left people bewildered. “We are a little nervous. In the business we do, projects do have ups and downs and there are hurdles. We thought the EDF board decision would be the last hurdle. This is a new hurdle that’s been introduced,” he said."
2016-07-31T09:54:56Z,uk-news,UK news,"UK risk of terror attack remains a case of 'when, not if', says Met chief","Britain is well equipped to prevent terrorist atrocities similar to those seen on the continent in recent weeks, but it remains a question of “when, not if” there is an attack, the Metropolitan police commissioner has said. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he was hoping to offer reassurance following a number of attacks in France and Germany, but admitted that he was ultimately limited in doing so by the reality of the situation. “I know that with each new outrage and especially those on our doorstep in Europe, there is a greater sense of fear that Britain will be the next victim in this wave of cruel and mindless mass murder,” he said. “I feel and understand that fear and as the police officer in charge of preventing such an attack, [I] know that you want me to reassure you. I am afraid I cannot do that entirely. “Our threat level has been at severe for two years – it remains there. It means an attack is highly likely. You could say it is a case of when, not if.” Hogan-Howe was speaking in the aftermath of a series of attacks, including four claimed by Islamic State, which have raised public fears about the ability of authorities to protect them. They include the Nice attack on 14 July, when Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel drove a truck into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day, the murder of Father Jacques Hamel, 85, as he celebrated mass in a Normandy church last Tuesday, and attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach in Germany. The Met commissioner said everyone had watched such incidents with “a terrifying and depressing sense of horror and dread”. However, despite people’s growing concerns, he said there were “lots of things working in our [the UK’s] favour”. The relationship between MI5, MI6 and police was a “world beater”, Hogan-Howe said, which had helped prevent terror incidents since the murder of Lee Rigby in 2013. He also pointed to the fact that the UK is an island and has strict gun controls as contributing factors, and referenced “the British way of life and culture”.He said this encompassed the way the majority of officers are unarmed, which he said created a closer relationship with the communities they serve, and “tolerance and acceptance. Our approach to Muslims is no different because these attacks purport to be committed in the name of Islam. We don’t stigmatise the millions of British Muslims whose values and faith completely reject the terrorists’ litany of hate.” Hogan-Howe outlined specific steps implemented after rampaging gunmen killed 130 people in Paris last November. The number of firearms officers has been increased by 600 to 2,800 and the number of specialists available immediately, 24/7, to tackle any terrorist threat, had risen three-fold, he said. Hogan Howe acknowledged that what he was saying would not be reassuring to some but ended on a defiant note, urging people to unite to reject the ideology espoused by terrorists. “We will not become like them, we will not hate, we will not be cowed and because of this, they will never win,” he said."
2016-07-31T12:34:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Bugging Byron: activists release cockroaches and locusts at burger chain,"Two London branches of Byron have been forced to close after protesters released hundreds of live insects into the restaurants, part of a growing backlash following the burger chain’s involvement in an immigration sting against its own staff.
Activists from two organisations, London Black Revs and Malcolm X Movement, let out a “swarm of insects” in Byron’s Shaftesbury Avenue and Holborn restaurants on Friday evening. Other protesters picketed restaurants over the weekend and #boycottbyron has been circulating on Twitter.
Immigration officers rounded up 35 people from Albania, Brazil, Egypt and Nepal in the raid, which took place across London on the morning of 4 July, the Home Office has confirmed. Staff were allegedly told to attend a health and safety meeting at 9.30am, but immigration officials quickly arrived instead.
In a joint statement published on Facebook, London Black Revs and Malcolm X Movement said the direct action was in response to the chain’s “despicable actions in the past weeks having entrapped waiters, back of house staff and chefs in collaboration with UK Border Agency [see footnote]”. “Many thousands of live cockroaches, locusts and crickets [have been released] into these restaurants. We apologise to customers and staff for any irritation, however, we had to act as forced deportations such as this and others are unacceptable, we must defend these people and their families from such dehumanised treatment,” the statement said.
Michael Segalov, a journalist from Huck magazine, went to one of the restaurants where the activists released the insects.
Protesters were outside urging people to boycott the chain and the restaurant was quieter than might be expected on a Friday night. It quickly descended into chaos when the insects were spotted, he said. One young protester told him prior to the action: “Katie Hopkins called them cockroaches in an article just a few months ago. We want to show these people what cockroaches really look like, and we’ll unleash them on places like this if they don’t change their ways.” In response to the continued protests, a spokeswoman for Byron said: “The safety of our customers and restaurant teams is paramount, and our priority is now to work with local police to minimise the risk of further incident.” • This footnote was appended on 5 August 2016: the UK Border Agency was dissolved in 2013."

Greater Manchester police said the 12-year-old and a 17-year-old were detained on Sunday morning and two 16-year-olds were arrested on suspicion of the same offence on Saturday. All four remain in custody. Police were called to Warrington Street in Ashton town centre at 10.50pm on Wednesday following a report of an assault. Upon arrival at the scene, officers discovered a man in his 40s who had suffered a number of injuries to his head and abdomen. The attack is thought to have taken place outside a branch of McDonald’s. The injured man was taken to hospital, where he died in the early hours of Thursday morning. Formal identification is yet to take place and police are calling for witnesses to come forward. DI Kevin O’Regan of Greater Manchester police said: “This has been quite a fast-moving investigation and we have now made three further arrests, bringing the total number of people we have in custody to four. “Our investigation continues and I would urge anybody with information to please contact police, no matter how insignificant you think it may be.”"

But the promotional film above, held in the City of London’s London Metropolitan Archives, shows that London-wide government was pursuing the same goal more than 30 years ago. The 24-minute film, which, judging by the statistics shown, must have been made after 1982 but before the abolition of the Greater London Council (GLC) in 1986, is striking for the familiarity of cyclists’ concerns, the reasons for people turning to cycling and the sorts of solutions produced by the road engineers of the time.

2016-08-01T06:00:25Z,uk-news,UK news,"Rise in child sexual abuse cases threatens other policing, warns chair of commissioners","Police struggling to cope with a huge escalation in the number of child sexual exploitation cases fear it “may grow to threaten other aspects of effective policing”, the new chair of police commissioners has warned. Vera Baird QC, in her first public statement since being elected chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) last month, said the cost of police efforts to tackle the “growing and tragic menace” of child sexual exploitation could treble to £3bn a year by 2020. Baird, who is also the police and crime commissioner (PCC) for Northumbria, is calling on the Home Office to urgently consider how the financial pressure of investigating more child sexual exploitation cases could affect other branches of policing. “Such totals place significant strain on police resources – especially as PCCs are also responsible for commissioning services for victims – and may grow to threaten other aspects of effective policing,” she writes in a piece for the Guardian. “The home secretary may wish to consider this as a matter of urgency, to ensure forces are adequately resourced to deal with these investigations and provide care for victims. PCCs do have concern over the impact this may place on overall force budgets, and are keen to safeguard our ability to continue to provide the most effective overall service to the public.” David Lloyd, PCC for Hertfordshire and leader of the Conservative group of the APCC, agreed with Baird. He said that his total policing budget was £200m a year. “If investigations into child sexual exploitation continue to rise at the rate they are predicted to do, they will swallow up … 15 police forces the size of Hertfordshire-worth of cost,” he said. “Police budgets are unlikely to rise, so these costs will have to come from other policing areas.” That financial pressure is why, Baird writes, she is on Monday launching a campaign to pressure the government to make sex education compulsory in all schools, at both primary and secondary levels. “It is imperative that there should be more action through health and education to prevent these crimes taking place in the first place and to arm potential victims to resist them,” writes Baird.
Sex education is currently only compulsory in maintained schools from the age of 11. Academies, which make up the majority of secondary schools, and free schools are not required to give students any personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education. Earlier this year, England’s then-education secretary rejected MPs’ calls to make sex and relationship education compulsory in all schools. Nicky Morgan infuriated campaigners by making her decision despite four key House of Commons committees, which pressed for sex education to be made statutory in primaries and secondaries. Baird’s call comes just days after more than 500 children were identified as “victims or potential victims” of online sexual abuse, and 77 people arrested and charged as part of an important investigation in Scotland after 30m indecent images were recovered. “Online child sexual abuse is a national threat,” said Malcolm Graham, the assistant chief constable who led Operation Lattise. “The reality is it is happening now, not only in Scotland but across the world, to children of all ages, from infants to teenagers.” Also last week, 28-year-old Daniel Rodriguez was sentenced to 16 years in jail for grooming five teenage girls using social media. Det Supt John Macdonald, of the Metropolitan police, said: “Unfortunately this is a pattern of abuse we are increasingly seeing. Social media enables people who want to have sex with children to approach scores if not hundreds or thousands of them online in an attempt to meet up,” he said. “[These crimes] are greatly underreported to the police.” On Monday, supported by PCCs across the political divide, Baird is calling on anyone “who cares about protecting our young people” to email her personally to discuss how to persuade the government to make PSHE a compulsory part of the national curriculum. “If you are a teacher, parent, classroom assistant or just someone who cares about protecting our young people, get in touch,” she writes. “It may be that we can tip the desirable into the attainable if we all act together now. My email address is enquiries@apccs.police.uk.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “High-quality sex and relationship education (SRE) is a vital part of preparing young people for life in modern Britain – helping them make informed choices, stay safe and learn to respect themselves and others.”"

The boy and a 17-year-old were detained on Sunday morning and two 16-year-olds were arrested on suspicion of the same offence on Saturday. The four suspects, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are due to appear at Oldham magistrates court later on Monday.

2016-08-01T09:18:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan bangs the London drum next to ministers' listening ears,"Where is the mayor? He’s everywhere. He’s at the gala opening of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, thanking JK Rowling that it’s taking place in London’s Theatreland. He’s on the London Underground with artist David Shrigley, underlining that “London is Open” as an inclusive arts and culture crucible, as well as in every other way. The previous day, Sadiq Khan had visited the Francis Crick Institute near St Pancras to declare that London is and must remain a global magnet for life science innovation, despite the UK’s voting to leave the EU. He’s been in the Telegraph, describing himself as “an advocate for wealth creators in London”. He’s run the annual JP Morgan charity race round Battersea Park, thanking his fellow participants for “the contribution they make to our capital”. You don’t get anywhere as London Mayor by leading a protest movement against business and bankers, especially when, as a Labour politician with influence and power, you know that your prospects for getting things done at City Hall depend heavily on your relationship with national government - and that Conservatives look set to be in charge of that for years to come. Those Tories, like it or not, hold a big key to your success. But what Khan knows is that London is also a big key to the Theresa May government’s success. The new mayor and the newer prime minister have a common interest in ensuring that the capital’s economy survives Brexit. That is why Khan is banging the drum for giving London greater power, and why May cannot afford to block her ears. To point out that London produces nearly a quarter of UK economic output is not to indulge in the sort of metropolitan swagger that might have induced Leave voters elsewhere to want to cut the Gherkin down to size. It’s just an economic fact. Here’s another: London’s economy now generates 30% of the UK’s taxes, according to the Centre for Cities. That may be unhealthy, unbalanced and unfair, but when Khan says that a thriving London means a thriving UK, as things stand he’s not far wrong. Ministers will be wary of saying so, but they know it too. Khan has had what he called a “positive chat’ with David Davis about Brexit negotiations and says that chancellor Philip Hammond has “indicated that he is open to further devolution for London”. Against this backdrop, Khan has asked LSE professor Tony Travers to reactivate the London Finance Commission, a Boris Johnson project that, in 2013, produced proposals for allowing London government - both the mayor and the boroughs - to retain and make direct use of more of the property taxes raised in the capital. This isn’t about London pocketing more of the nation’s cash, but giving it more control over how the portion it already receives is spent. “The mayor and the boroughs know better than Whitehall how to run responsive and effective public services,” Travers says. “Devolution would be good for London and would take pressure off the UK government at a time when it needs all its capacity to make Brexit work as well as possible.” Khan is thinking bigger than Johnson did. He wants Travers and his colleagues to explore London having greater autonomy over skills training, housing, business rates, policing, health, and air quality control as well. Meanwhile, in the background, arguments for enabling the Square Mile to keep trading with EU nations as before and for finding a way for London, the heartland of Remain sentiment, to secure its own, special arrangements to allow EU workers to continue to freely come and go are being aired. Rightly or wrongly, this is not just about London. It’s about the UK as a whole. Alexander Jan, director of city economics at engineering giant Arup, has summed it up like this: Ever since the war, attempts have been made to rebalance growth in the UK. Many have failed. Measures to restrain London have typically done little for the rest of the country but have harmed the economy of our city. Ensuring London has the economic and labour mobility freedoms that will allow it to thrive is the best way to secure a prosperous long-term future for the UK as a whole. And for all the city’s citizens wherever they may come from. That is the case Mayor Khan is loudly making. In time we shall learn how closely prime minister May has been listening."
2016-08-01T11:47:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Fundraising page of cyclist who died in RideLondon flooded with donations,"A charity fundraising page set up by a cyclist who died from heart failure while taking part in Sunday’s RideLondon-Surrey 100 has had a flood of donations following his death. Robin Chard, 48, from Bicester in Oxfordshire, suffered a cardiac arrest about 25 miles into the 100-mile course, at Kingston upon Thames in south-west London, RideLondon said. He had been raising money for Cancer Research UK in honour of his father, stepfather and mother-in-law, all of whom died from the disease. Chard, who died at Kingston hospital despite receiving immediate treatment from fellow riders and medical teams, had set a target of £400 in donations. By the early hours of Tuesday morning, the sum had reached nearly £45,000. A number of those who left messages on the JustGiving page said they had also taken part in the event and wanted to pay their respects. Chard is the third participant in three years to die following a heart attack during the event. Chard’s father, Edwin, and stepfather, Bert, both died from lung cancer. His mother-in-law, Sheila, died from non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Chard himself was treated for Hodgkin lymphoma in childhood. In a statement released by the organisers, his wife, Vickie, said he had died doing something he loved to raise money for “a cause that was very important to him”. She added: “I’d like to thank everyone who has helped and supported Robin and me, especially the event stewards, the event team and the amazing staff at Kingston hospital.” His sister, Andrea Day, 43, said: “We are very touched by the kind messages and donations from everyone on Robin’s JustGiving page. As you can imagine, we are all very shocked and saddened by the news of his passing. He was a beloved son, husband, father, brother and friend to so many and will be sorely missed.“We kindly ask that you respect our privacy at this difficult time and keep donating.” The organisers of RideLondon and Cancer Research UK released statements expressing their condolences. Chard wrote on his JustGiving page about his personal connection with cancer: “So you can see it’s a bit of a personal crusade, but I’m not riding a white charger, just a bike 100 miles in and around London.” One online tribute, reported by the Evening Standard, read: “Uncle Robin, so incredibly proud of your efforts in the Prudential 100 bike ride today in London. Sadly, he didn’t make it to the end but he passed away raising money for a charity close to his heart. If anyone can still donate in his memory I know how much he would appreciate it.” Separately, two cyclists were seriously hurt in crashes during the event, in which nearly 27,000 people cycled a closed-roads loop out of London, into the Surrey countryside and back. The crashes, which required air ambulances to take cyclists to hospital, caused long delays on the course. One of those hurt was seriously injured after hitting a tree. Organisers put in place two detours to try to clear the crowds, including a major reroute to miss out the Box Hill climb in Surrey. Organisers said 33 riders were taken to hospital, with seven still there, of whom three were seriously injured. They added: “The Prudential RideLondon medical team is liaising closely with the hospitals and the welfare team is supporting the families of the injured riders.” The event was part of a weekend of cycling activities in and around the capital. As part of the 100-mile ride cyclists left the Olympic park in Stratford, east London, and headed to Surrey before returning for a finish on the Mall. Despite the diversions, there were still delayed riders on the course when the men’s professional race, which closed the weekend, took to the same roads on Sunday afternoon. At one point the elite riders, including Tour de France winner Chris Froome, had to be halted for about 20 minutes as the roads were cleared."
2016-08-01T12:13:09Z,uk-news,UK news,MP urges Home Office to allow Australian family to stay in Scotland,"The Home Office has been urged to allow an Australian family facing deportation far more time to find the job they need to secure a permanent visa. Ian Blackford, the couple’s MP in the Scottish Highlands, wrote to the Home Office on Monday asking ministers to give Kathryn and Gregg Brain, and their seven-year old-son, Lachlan, indefinite leave to remain. The final deadline for Mrs Brain, an academic, to find a job which satisfies the strict criteria for a tier-two visa expires at midnight on 1 August, putting them at immediate risk of deportation back to Australia. A job offer with a distillery near their home in Dingwall, near Inverness, was withdrawn unexpectedly last month, leaving the Brains, originally from Brisbane, struggling to find another suitable offer. Another employer in the Highlands has suggested he could have a post available but has been unable to give confirmation before the Brains’ current grace period expires at midnight. Blackford has asked Robert Goodwill, the recently appointed immigration minister, to give the family indefinite leave to remain rather than simply extend the grace period which the Home Office granted in May, after a furore about the Brains’ deportation erupted.
A grace period just adds to the pressure, said Blackford, the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber. “Giving them the right to stay to find work will remove the pressure and give them the time they need to satisfy the two-tier requirements. These two-tier jobs in the Highlands aren’t ten a penny.” Blackford said the Home Office’s position on the Brains’ case was perverse since the department had introduced a pilot scheme last week that gave students at six universities extra time to apply for a tier-two visa, after their degrees had finished: a scheme very similar to the previous post-study work visa system. That was rejected by the Home Office: the pilot scheme only offers a six-month extension, a period far shorter than the several years extra which the Brains had now had. The family has been under threat of deportation after the UK government withdrew the visa scheme intended for students and academics months after the family emigrated from Australia. They travelled to Scotland in June 2011 under the post-study work visa scheme, hoping that Mrs Brain would find a job after getting a degree at the University of the Highlands and Islands. The Home Office insists it announced in March 2011, three months before the Brains moved to the UK, that the scheme was being withdrawn. The Brains argue they were only told it was being cancelled in 2012, two years after they had been accepted for it. The family has since had a series of extensions to their temporary visas; Lachlan has become fluent in Gaelic and the Brains say they would be homeless, penniless and without work if they were deported back to Australia. The couple have been banned from working in the UK until they can get a permanent visa. Mr Brain said: “At this stage we are still very much hoping that an employer will come forward and we’ll be able to continue moving towards a tier-two visa application. “Of course, what I’d really like is for the Home Office to give us what they promised when we moved here in the first place – a two-year visa with the right to work. We have fulfilled our end of the bargain and we still very much want the Home Office to fulfil theirs.” The Home Office said it was unable to make any determination about the Brains’ status until after the midnight deadline expires, since technically the family still had the rest of the day to apply for a tier-two visa."
2016-08-01T13:22:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Leytonstone knife attacker sentenced to life,"A mentally ill taxi driver who cut the throat of a stranger at a London tube station has been given a life sentence with a minimum term of eight and a half years after a judge concluded the attacker was motivated by Islamic extremism. Muhiddin Mire, 30, who has paranoid schizophrenia, told police the rampage in December 2015 was an act of revenge for coalition airstrikes in Syria, which the UK government had voted to support three days previously. Judge Nicholas Hilliard, the recorder of London, told Mire he would be immediately transferred to Broadmoor, the high-security psychiatric hospital in Berkshire. The type of sentence handed down to Mire means that if he is found to be free of symptoms and subject to review he could be transferred to prison to serve the remainder of the term. Hilliard said: “This was an attempt to kill an innocent member of the public for ideological reasons by cutting his throat in plain sight for maximum impact.” Mire, who had downloaded Islamic State propaganda before the attack, was convicted in June of attempted murder for stabbing 56-year-old Lyle Zimmerman and threatening four other travellers at Leytonstone station, east London. But doctors giving evidence to the hearing conflicted over whether Mire’s mental illness was the sole reason for the attack. Dr Shaun Bhattacharjee, a Broadmoor forensic psychiatrist, told the court Mire’s interest in extremism was a symptom of his mental disorder. But Dr Philip Joseph told the judge it was possible for Mire’s obsession with Islamic terrorism to be separate from the illness. Ultimately, Hilliard sided with Joseph’s argument. “What the defendant was intent upon was designed to intimidate a section of the public that were there to witness what he was doing. This was not carried out in secret but very brazenly indeed. It was carried out to advance a religious or ideological cause, namely Islamic extremism.” Hilliard said Mire’s interaction with commuters in the tube station during the attack was evidence of his awareness of what was going on around him. It was revealed during an earlier hearing that Mire was sectioned in 2006 and released with a prescription for antipsychotic medication after two weeks in hospital. He was put in touch with a community mental health team upon his release but soon lost contact with them and stopped taking the medication. In the years before the attack, Mire became increasingly unwell and was probably already exhibiting symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia. Among “strange” ideas Mire had was a belief that the former prime minister Tony Blair was his guardian angel and that he had been possessed by evil spirits, the court heard. His paranoid delusions later manifested in a belief that he was under surveillance by the security services and was being followed. Bhattacharjee told the court the prevailing culture – in this case a heightened state of tension over Islamic terrorism – could often inform schizophrenics’ delusions. As an example, Bhattacharjee said in the 1970s some paranoid schizophrenics experienced delusions related to the IRA and Irish terrorism. During the attack, Mire shouted, “This is for my Syrian brothers. I’m going to spill your blood.” But Joseph told the same hearing that this interest in extremism was separate from his mental illness, not fuelled by it. Mire told police in the hours after his arrest that the attack was an act of vengeance for coalition airstrikes in Syria. On 2 December, the government voted in favour of extending bombings against Isis targets in the Middle East to include Syria. He had images of the soldier Lee Rigby and a British Isis killer on his phone, along with material linked to the terror group. The court heard Mire started viewing Isis videos online three years before the attack. One person was overheard on mobile phone footage of the incident shouting at Mire: “You ain’t no Muslim, bruv,” a rebuke that garnered much public attention. After sentencing, Met police commander Dean Haydon, of the counter-terrorism command, said: “London is a safer place with Mire behind bars. While Mire was not accused of terrorist offences, it would appear from comments he made at the time of the attack and the content he had downloaded on his phone that he may have been inspired by terrorist propaganda. “My officers continue to work tirelessly in stopping people getting drawn into terrorism and violent extremism in all forms as well as prosecuting, disrupting and deterring extremists, reaching out to communities and safeguarding the vulnerable. “We depend on information from the public, who can be our eyes and ears in our efforts to keep us all safe.”"
2016-08-01T16:26:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Mother of student killed in transphobic murder blames mental health services,"The mother of a student who was murdered in a transphobic and homophobic attack has blamed “totally inadequate” mental health services for the death of her son. Lee Arnold, 37, was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 23 years and four months for stabbing 30-year-old William Lound 12 times in his room at his halls of residence in February this year. Arnold, who has paranoid schizophrenia and anti-social personality disorder, has 19 previous criminal convictions, including threatening a 64-year-old with a knife and racially motivated street robbery. He spent seven years in psychiatric care before being released into the community in April 2014. Speaking after the sentencing at Manchester Minshull Street crown court on Monday, Mo Lound, whose daughter took her own life after her son’s murder, said: “I do not blame Lee Arnold for what he did, I blame the system which allowed it to happen. Arnold is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic with a history of violence and has spent much of his adult life in secure institutions. He should not have been roaming the streets of Greater Manchester without supervision.” Judge John Potter told the court the victim was a bright, kind and intelligent man whose first reaction when he met people in need was to offer help. Lound had taught himself to speak three languages and had travelled the world in the merchant navy before working for two years to get the qualifications he needed to go to university to study computer science. Lound, who was gay and would occasionally wear women’s clothing and makeup, won a scholarship to study at Salford University, enrolling last September. The judge paid tribute to his mother and urged the appropriate authorities to consider carefully, and if necessary act upon, criticism made of the mental health care Arnold had received. Arnold presented himself to the accident and emergency department of Manchester Royal Infirmary 10 months before the murder, saying he was hearing a voice telling him to kill people. He was admitted to hospital for assessment before being discharged to a supported hostel, which he never attended. The following month he was found by police at Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester with a razor blade in his hand saying he was “going out of his head with voices” and wanted to kill himself to prevent him from harming others. The prosecution barrister, Robert Hall, said that over the weeks and months that followed, Arnold continued a cycle of prescription drug overdoses followed by treatment for his mental health problems only to be released back into the community again. Lound met Arnold at the “tented village”, a community of homeless people in Manchester, where he had taken to spending time. Hall said the student felt that the people living there were “less judgmental of his lifestyle, habits and attitudes”. On 7 February this year, Arnold went to Lound’s room in a shared student flat in Bramall Court, Salford, where the pair had sex, the court heard. Arnold took a knife from the kitchen and stabbed the victim six times in the upper back and six times in the head and neck. In Arnold’s account of the murder, he said Lound asked repeatedly: “Why are you doing this to me?” and he responded: “Shut up you little freak.” After Lound died, Arnold drew an arrow on the wall above the bed pointing to the victim’s body, next to the words: “Number 1. Your not reddy [sic] for me. I always win. Tick tock.” The following day Arnold arrived at a drop-in centre for homeless people where he approached a member of staff and told them he had committed a murder. Police were called and Arnold directed them to Lound’s flat. Upon hearing his victim’s body had been found, Arnold said: “I told you I was telling the truth. That’s why I handed myself in because I knew I would do it again. I feel bad for his family. I told you I was telling the truth.” In June Lound’s sister Virginia, 28, known as Gini, was found dead in the convenience store she owned in Southport, Merseyside. Mo Lound said she had taken her own life because she was heartbroken by what had happened to her brother. “Last Christmas I had two wonderful children who I loved very dearly and was very proud of,” Mo Lound told the court. “This Christmas I will be alone.” Speaking to the press outside court in Manchester, she said: “How many other Lee Arnolds are loose on the streets of our towns and cities, with the potential to kill or injure innocent people? Perhaps it is time our government woke up to the fact that investment in mental health services is totally inadequate.” She said her children’s young lives had been cut short by the actions of a man “who should have received the help he so desperately needed before he went on to wreak such devastation”. After pleading guilty to Lound’s murder, Arnold asked the court that he be sentenced quickly so as not to “extend the pain” that the victim’s family had suffered. His barrister told the court that the defendant wished to be punished for his crime, so had entered a guilty plea and not a plea of diminished responsibility."
2016-08-02T09:19:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Housing crisis in England: do you ever hope to own your own home?,"The gap between earnings and property prices has seen home ownership fall to its lowest levels since 2000, and is a problem that is no longer confined to London according to a new report by the Resolution Foundation thinktank. The report, based on analysis of the latest Labour Force Survey, showed that in early 2016 only 58% of households in Greater Manchester were homeowners, compared with a peak of 72% in 2003. In outer London, the peak in ownership came earlier, in 2000, but the fall was also from 72% then to 58% in February. The West Midlands and Yorkshire have also seen double-digit drops, driven by declines in Sheffield and Leeds. The return of mortgages for borrowers with small deposits has brought first-time buyers back to the market, but the analysis underlines how great the struggle is to meet today’s new high house prices. According to Nationwide, the UK average had risen to £196,930 in February – a 60% increase in 13 years.

Four boys – a 12-year-old and three teenagers – appeared at Oldham magistrates court charged with the murder of Bradley Moore, 43, on Monday. Police were called to Ashton-under-Lyne town centre at 10.50pm last Wednesday after a report of an assault. When they arrived at the scene, outside a McDonald’s restaurant, officers discovered Moore with a number of injuries to his head and abdomen. He was taken to hospital where he died in the early hours of Thursday morning. Two 16-year-olds were arrested on suspicion of his murder on Saturday and a 12-year-old and 17-year-old were detained on Sunday for the same offence. The four suspects cannot be named for legal reasons. Moore’s family said they had struggled to find the words to describe their loss, but that life would not be the same without him and that they would always love him. His daughter Alex said: “My dad was a harmless man and was loved by all those who knew him. I will make him proud and I know he will be watching over me, my brothers, Reece and Jack, and my little sister Emma.” Moore’s youngest sister, Melanie, said: “Bradley was a tough character who led a difficult life at times. For it to be cut short so tragically is truly heartbreaking. At least he can now rest at ease with our mother. May he rest in peace.” DI John Mulvihill, of Greater Manchester police’s major incident team, said: “This is a tragic case and four young people have been charged in connection with Bradley’s murder. Our investigation remains ongoing and I am continuing to appeal for witnesses that were in or around the McDonald’s on Warrington Street at around 10.30pm on Wednesday 27 July to come forward. “I would also like to appeal to the driver of a Vauxhall Corsa to come forward, who visited McDonald’s at this time and parked his vehicle on Warrington Street, near to the restaurant. I believe he may have information that will assist this investigation.” A provisional trial date has been set for January and a plea hearing is scheduled to take place this month."

2016-08-02T12:48:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Masked men fire shots near Irish border,"Shots have been fired by masked men into a van outside a hotel close to the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. The armed trio turned up outside the Carlton hotel, in Belleek, shortly before 9.30am on Tuesday and fired at least one shot into the vehicle. It is believed to be owned by a local contractor. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said no one was injured in the shooting although a number of people were badly shaken by the attack. A PSNI officer said teams were working closely with the Garda Síochána after reports that three men drove off into the Irish Republic following the incident. PSNI Ch Insp Graham Dodds said: “I would appeal to anyone who may have noticed any suspicious activity in the area or anyone who has any information about this incident to contact police at Enniskillen on the non-emergency 101 number, quoting reference number 272 02/07/16. Alternatively, if you prefer to provide information without giving details, please contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800555111.” The PSNI will be exploring whether there is any dissident republican link to the shooting. Tom Elliott, the Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh/South Tyrone condemned those responsible for the shooting. He said: “Belleek is a quiet Fermanagh border village and this incident will have come as a complete shock to the local community. “It is a reminder that we are still plagued by those who are intent on murder, attempted murder and disruption, and of dark days which we all want to put behind us.”"
2016-08-02T13:11:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Teenager's drowning death 'accidental' says coroner,"The parents of a drowned teenage boy outraged by the “poor” police efforts to search for him did not attend an inquest into his death. An Oxfordshire coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death after hearing how 16-year-old Ellis Downes drowned in the Thames last May. But an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into the response of Thames Valley police is ongoing, following complaints by his parents. Delivering his conclusion of accidental death by drowning, assistant coroner Jeremy Chipperfield said: “Ellis reached the other side of the river and he seemed to be cold. It was on that return that he ran into difficulties in the river. “Two of his friends bravely dived in to save Ellis and one said the water was so cold that he could not breathe. Ellis continued to struggle while they swam towards him. When they were a few feet away he went under the water and it was impossible to retrieve him.” The boy’s parents, Darren and Emma Downes, were unhappy that the police did not find their son but relied on volunteers who found his body on the river bed on 9 May after a two-day search. His family subsequently criticised the police force and a senior officer later apologised to the family over the police response and follow-up. IPCC associate commissioner Guido Liguori, who is overseeing the investigation, said on Tuesday: “Our thoughts remain with Ellis’s family and friends. Our investigation is making good progress and we hope it will help answer the many questions asked about the police response, as well as identifying any lessons which can be learned.” The teenager, from Harwell, near Didcot, Oxfordshire, disappeared at about 9pm on 7 May 2015 after going for a cooling dip on a warm spring day with his friends. A friend, Aaron Lewis, offered to drive him back to his friends on the other bank, as he appeared tired. The teenager said he wanted to swim back but began to struggle in the cold river on the return journey and was swept under the water, where he drowned. The coroner heard that Ellis was seen rolling on to his back as he appeared to be tiring before continuing to swim to the opposite riverbank. Lewis said in a statement: “When he was over halfway back he looked as if he was struggling, I shouted to him ‘are you okay?’ and there was no reply.” Brothers Dean and Jack Gunning dived into the river in an attempt to save their friend, but the coroner heard they were not able to reach him in time. Dean said in a statement that was read by the coroner: “As soon as I went into the water I went numb all over. I could not breathe. Jack was about six to eight feet away from Ellis. He dived under to try to get him and he came up after two seconds and said he could not see him.”"
2016-08-02T14:25:09Z,uk-news,UK news,News of the World legal chief 'ordered  surveillance on rival lawyers',"A News of the World lawyer ordered surveillance of two solicitors engaged in litigation against the paper for phone hacking in order to gain an improper advantage, a disciplinary tribunal has heard. Tom Crone, legal affairs manager with the now defunct newspaper’s publisher, News International (now News UK), is accused of attempting to uncover an alleged affair between the two colleagues to provide the NoW with “good leverage” in legal proceedings. The Bar Standards Board has brought six charges of professional misconduct against him, which, if proved, could lead to him being disbarred. He denies the charges. At Tuesday’s hearing of the tribunal in central London, prosecuting counsel Christopher Aylwin, told the five-person panel that Crone asked the paper’s newsdesk to put solicitors Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris under surveillance in order to find out information that could embarrass the pair. “It was your intention to use evidence of the affair, if you’d got it, to persuade – and I use the word neutrally – to pressure Miss Harris and Mr Lewis,” said Aylwin, cross-examining Crone. “You were looking for an excuse to embarrass them in their private lives. You would not have used a bare-faced threat – you’re far too aware of the consequences to have done that – but there are ways of getting your point across, are there not?” Crone admits requesting that the solicitors, then both at Manchester firm George Davies (now part of Mills and Reeve), be placed under surveillance but denies the charge that it was aimed at getting advantage by improper means. The surveillance found no evidence of an affair. Crone claims that he acted because of concerns that the pair were leaking confidential legal information to the Guardian and exchanging confidential information relating to different phone-hacking claims they were working on when they should not have been. Among the cases Lewis worked on was the claim by then Professional Football Association boss Gordon Taylor, which was cited in the initial Guardian revelations about the phone-hacking scandal. Crone told the panel that if Lewis and Harris were having an affair it would have provided circumstantial evidence that they were passing confidential information between each other. The intention would then be to report them to the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA), alleging that they had breached professional standards, he said. But Aylwin said Crone’s intention was “to obtain good leverage. It wasn’t anything to do with recusal or claims to the SRA, it was to have your way as far as the litigation was concerned.” Crone, who often expressed irritation at the questioning, replied: “No, that was absolutely not the case.” He added: “I would regard that as a clear blackmail threat which I wouldn’t make. I wouldn’t dream of doing that.” He said that any such threat would have been futile against experienced solicitors such as Lewis and Harris, who would have simply rung the police. Crone joined Rupert Murdoch’s UK newspaper division in 1985, acting for both the NoW and the Sun. He resigned in July 2011, the month in which the NoW was closed. In 2007, after the jailing of the NoW’s royal editor, Clive Goodman, he supervised an internal investigation into hacking at the paper but could find no evidence to suggest anyone else was involved. Crone gave evidence to the Commons culture, media and sport select committee about hacking allegations and also to the Leveson inquiry. He was arrested in August 2012 in connection with the Metropolitan police’s investigation into hacking but in October 2014, the Crown Prosecution Service announced he would not face charges because there was “insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction”. Among those watching proceedings was Formula one boss Max Mosley who, in 2008, when Crone was still at News International, won £60,000 in a privacy action against NoW after the Sunday tabloid falsely accused him of taking part in a “sick Nazi orgy”. The hearing was adjourned until later this month."
2016-08-02T14:31:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Man who left UK after arrest over child murder is detained in Portugal,"A man who left Britain after being arrested on suspicion of murdering a six-year-old boy and then posted pictures of himself sunbathing online has been detained in Portugal. The suspect, 35, breached conditions of his bail by leaving the country and appeared to taunt police as he published pictures and comments on Facebook. The man, from Peterborough, who has not been identified by police, was arrested in April on suspicion of murdering Rikki Neave, strangled to death more than two decades ago. He was released on bail to return to a Cambridgeshire police station on 20 September. Rikki was last seen leaving his home on the Welland estate in Peterborough to go to school on 28 November 1994. The following day his naked body was found in nearby woodland and his clothing – grey trousers, a white shirt, black shoes and a blue coat – were found in a wheelie bin. Cambridgeshire police said the suspect was arrested in Lisbon by Portuguese police and will remain in custody while extradition proceedings begin. “He has been arrested under a European arrest warrant on suspicion of breaching his licence,” the force said. Officers from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit are expected to travel out to Portugal in the coming days. Rikki’s mother, Ruth Neave, 46, was charged with murder at the time but cleared by a jury. She admitted charges of causing child cruelty to Rikki and his two sisters, Rebecca, then eight, and Rochelle, then three. In recent years she has campaigned for Cambridgeshire police to reinvestigate the killing, claiming his killer remained at large.
In June last year, the major crime unit relaunched the inquiry. In November, detectives and Ruth Neave made an appeal on BBC1’s Crimewatch, which included artist’s impressions of two men officers wanted to identify. The original case caused a national outcry after details of horrific abuse were presented in court. Ruth Neave had called police when her son failed to come home from Welland primary school, Northampton crown court heard. Prosecutors alleged the boy was killed in a sacrifice by his mother, who had an interest in the occult and black magic and told neighbours she was a high priestess. Jurors were told she had asked social workers to take her son into care because he was in danger if he stayed at home. But lawyers for the defence said a sex attacker who had not been found could have been responsible for Rikki’s death. Ruth Neave was cleared of murder but jailed for seven years for the child cruelty charges. Neave, labelled Britain’s most evil mother by some newspapers at the time of her trial, held a press conference last year at which she said she had been pressured into admitting the cruelty charges. When the inquiry was relaunched, Det Supt Paul Fullwood, head of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit, revealed there had been other similar incidents around the time of the boy’s death, including children being left tied up in woods."
2016-08-02T14:39:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Dozens of asylum seekers crammed into single Home Office property,"Dozens of vulnerable women and children seeking asylum in the UK are living in filthy, overcrowded and potentially dangerous conditions in Home Office accommodation, a Guardian investigation has revealed. There are currently 18 women and 15 children living in the property in Hounslow, which is two terrace houses knocked together. They have fled conflict zones in Africa and the Middle East. Some are survivors of rape and torture. Two private contractors, Clearsprings Ready Homes, one of the largest providers of Home Office accommodation, and Cromwood Housing have contracts to manage the accommodation. The owner of the property, Imtiaz Aziz, lives next door in a vastly different house to the one provided for the asylum seekers. Clearsprings hit the headlines after the Guardian revealed that it compelled asylum seekers to wear coloured wristbands in exchange for food. Following concerns raised by the Guardian about the property to Hounslow council, inspectors arrived the following day. A more detailed council inspection will take place on Wednesday.
The women have complained about an infestation of rats in the kitchen, filthy conditions, leaks, naked wires left exposed and infestations of bedbugs. They say there are periodic infestations of cockroaches. They have also expressed concerns about the overcrowding and the fact that the 33 people in the property have to share one kitchen. Some of the larger rooms have a cooking hob and sink in them but many do not. The women say that the toilets sometimes do not flush and they are forced to use buckets. “I was cooking an egg and opened a kitchen cupboard. Two rats ran out and crossed the kitchen. I was scared and couldn’t eat my egg after that,” said one woman. The women have also complained about the lack of a garden for the children to play in. The Aziz family have taken the back garden that belongs to the accommodation as part of their garden and, following a request from Cromwood, have provided a small, overgrown patch of ground to the asylum seekers, which they say is too dangerous for children to play in. The women say that what makes things worse is the fact that their children look out of the windows and see the Aziz family’s beautifully manicured garden that they cannot enter. “In this house the children do not like the school holidays because they have nowhere to play; for a child to hate the school holidays you know something bad is happening,” said one woman. All are fearful of being identified individually in case raising complaints causes negative repercussions from the Home Office or the contractors.
“Everything is overcrowded here,” said one woman. “I am sharing a small room with another woman and it is a real squeeze, the kitchen is so, so bad. There is no space for everyone to put their pots and pans and so some women have brought their clothes cupboards into the kitchen to use to put their cooking things in. I’m worried that this is a fire hazard. We have had leaks in the kitchen and one woman complained about water pouring through her light fitting.” Mothers have also complained that sometimes they cannot get their children and buggies in and out of the front door because cars are parked too close to it. When the Guardian put questions about the bad conditions to the Aziz family they invited us into their home to respond. The house is spacious, immaculately clean and the decor is both tasteful and luxurious. It is hard to reconcile the two worlds living next door to each other. Aziz said that when he had made a decision to convert the property into a house of multiple occupation (HMO) he stipulated that he and his family would retain use of the forecourt and back garden of the property next door. When asked about the women’s claims about the conditions of the housing, Aziz said: “Our contractors haven’t always been reliable. We have been through several different contractors.”
He confirmed that there had been problems with damp, leaks, overcrowding and infestation of insects. He said he was not aware of an infestation of rats although there had previously been an infestation of rats in the property next door to the asylum seekers’ accommodation, which he also owns. He added: “There are legal requirements that we have to meet as landlords of an HMO. We meet all the legal requirements. It’s for Cromwood to maintain the garden, if it’s unsafe Cromwood would need to deal with that particular issue. When I visited the kitchen I wasn’t happy with the state of it, it clearly needs a refresh. We were planning to redo the kitchen but it just hasn’t transpired. The house generally feels a bit dark. “Probably in the last four years there hasn’t been the attention to detail that we would have wanted but we are busy people and we have to rely on the information that’s given to us. If they have concerns we are here to help, let’s see if we can deal with it. We have tried to behave as responsibly as we can within the constraints of not being experts.” One woman said: “If you see the way we live here you would think we are animals, not humans. Look at the way the landlord next door is living compared with our conditions. This is the kind of place to put goats or chickens, not humans. “I blame the Home Office. The landlords and contractors know they can get away with this because the Home Office really doesn’t care. At the end of the day the landlord gets paid and he and his family don’t have to live in these conditions. “My health has suffered so much here, my whole body is itchy from bedbug bites and my breathing has got worse because of all the dust. This place is like a cage. We are degraded to almost nothing but we have got no choice. We want the outside world to know what’s really happening behind closed doors.”
Both Clearsprings and Cromwood said the Home Office would respond on their behalf. A Home Office spokesman said: “Providers are monitored extremely closely to ensure they meet required standards and the contracts include measures to ensure any issues are quickly addressed.” “Where a contractor is found to be falling short of these standards, we work with them to ensure issues are quickly addressed and when they are not we can and do impose sanctions.” A Hounslow council spokesperson said: “Council officers made an unannounced visit to the licensed HMO (house of multiple occupancy) ... on 28 July. “All communal parts of the building were inspected and some issues were noted that we will be taking up with the management as a matter of urgency. “Officers were only able to get access to some of the rooms and will return to do a full inspection. “If further issues are found we will, of course, take all appropriate action to ensure safe conditions for residents.”"
2016-08-02T15:45:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Sussex bar blocks mobile signals to encourage sociability,"A bar in Hove, Sussex, is encouraging customers to be more sociable by deliberately blocking mobile phone signals. Steve Tyler and Scot Callister have built a device known as a Faraday cage into the walls and ceiling of their bar, The Gin Tub, to halt incoming signals. Named after 19th-century British scientist Michael Faraday, the cage is made of conductive metal that traps electromagnetic waves. Tyler told Sky News: “I just wanted people to enjoy a night out in my bar, without being interrupted by their phones. So rather than asking them not to use their phones, I stopped the phones working.” He said the Faraday cage wasn’t difficult to install. “It’s silver foil in the walls and copper mesh. And it’s not the perfect system, it’s not military grade,” he said. “The Americans are still listening. But the general public get poor signal or no signal, so they have to go outside to use their phones. That’s what I want them to do. I want them to talk to the people they’re with, not the people they’re not with.” The bar is not entirely phone-free, however. Retro telephones are available on each table so that customers can contact other tables or order more drinks. The law on blocking phones is unclear. While the 2006 Wireless Telegraphy Act states that “the use of any apparatus, whether or not wireless telegraphy apparatus, for the purpose of interfering with any wireless telegraphy, is an offence”, a Faraday cage, unlike electronic jamming devices, does not transmit its own signal to interfere with communications. An Ofcom spokesman said: “Unlike jammers, Faraday cages don’t proactively cause interference, although they do interfere with mobile reception. We would always recommend people seek legal advice if they are unsure whether an installation breaches wireless telegraphy laws.” In 2014, a cafe in Vancouver also used the technique to repel wireless signals."
2016-08-02T16:49:34Z,uk-news,UK news,'Home ownership is unrealistic': five readers on England's housing crisis,"Home ownership in England has fallen to the lowest levels in 30 years, highlighting the vast gap between earnings and property prices. Once most acutely felt in the capital, the problem has now spread across the country, according to a new report by the Resolution Foundation thinktank. The report, based on analysis of the latest Labour Force Survey, showed that in early 2016 only 58% of households in Greater Manchester were homeowners, compared with a peak of 72% in 2003. In outer London, the peak in ownership came earlier, in 2000, but the fall was also from 72% then to 58% in February. The West Midlands and Yorkshire have also seen double-digit drops, driven by declines in Sheffield and Leeds. We asked people across the country whether they still aspire to own a home, or if they’ve resigned themselves to renting. ‘It’s impossible to get a mortgage on a single income as a small time self-employed person’ Andy, 44, Devon. Very unlikely I’ll be able to buy. It’s impossible to get a mortgage on a single income as a small time self-employed person. Even if I could raise some funds, I could not afford what I need, a garden or outdoor space, garage or workshop. I have always rented, never been in position to buy or expected too. My current situation is okay, but rent plus bills and council tax usually just over half monthly income. Although this is manageable, it is tenuous when self employed and leaves nothing for saving, or holidays. If I had to move I would expect my rent to go up at least £100 a month. But there is nothing to rent anymore. The housing crisis deepening here in Devon, as it is across the south west. There are villages full of holiday cottages, but nowhere for residents especially young people. Offhand I can think of eleven people aged 18 to 55, including 2 couples, who need somewhere to live immediately. Houseshare is the best option but it’s complicated when kids and couples are involved, and estate agents are suspicious. Besides, all the larger houses have been done up to sell, so are stupidly well appointed, too expensive, and only ever available on short contracts or with the threat of sale. Proper revision of housing and planning is needed, with a view to helping people rather than making money. A rewrite of tenancy law, to give some protection to the tenant. A return to council and government funded social housing, both urban and rural, is equally vital. Relaxation of restrictions on, and renewed provision for, alternative homes such as buses, caravans and trucks. Let people help themselves and have pride in doing so. ‘I feel a bit trapped really because the career I want means I need to be here in London’ Rachael, 28, London. Salary: £33,000 a year It’s funny but my hopes for the future are that one day I don’t have to live in a shared house and can rent a flat of my own. I once dreamed that I’d own a home but living in London and paying back my student loan and masters it’s just completely unrealistic I’ll ever buy here. I feel a bit trapped really because the career I want means I need to be here in London, but buying here is so unachievable. All of my friends who have bought firstly don’t live in London, not that Surrey is cheap, and are all in relationships; most too had parents help them out either financially or by providing a rent-free home whilst they save. I’m single, and don’t have parents who can help me out, so even renting alone would feel like an achievement. It’s a bit depressing really. I did once hope to own my property but now I don’t care, I’ve stopped caring because it’s just completely unrealistic. ‘We just don’t have the means to raise a deposit alongside paying the rent’ Sam, 28, Nottingham. Salary: £23,000 a year The current situation is madness, especially given that my partner and I spend more on rent than we would on a mortgage to buy the same property. Unfortunately we just don’t have the means to raise a deposit alongside paying the rent. Neither of us have wealthy families to ask for a gift or loan, and whilst we try to save as much as we can we realise it will take a long time to save the amount needed. Frankly, if renters rights were ever to be bolstered, with long-term tenancies, protections against eviction and rights to decorate, keep pets, treat the place you’re renting as a home not a hotel room, then I’d probably be content to rent longer-term. But the reality is that lack of security means owning your own home is the only way to be sure of a roof over your head.
For the future, I do hope that we can eventually save the necessary deposit to be able to buy a home. We’ve looked at shared ownership schemes, but these are just as expensive and have a lot of drawbacks. I think we’ll get there, but it’s a long hard road. Alternatively, and rather bleakly, our only other option is falling back on inheritance - but this is extremely unpalatable and not in any way guaranteed. ‘I squat, it’s not secure, but neither was renting’ Ru, 26, Sipson, Middlesex. Salary: £300 a month At the moment I live in an eco-squat, protest site and I love it, but it’s open and precarious nature isn’t sustainable for me long term. I love the autonomy. When I lived in rented accommodation I couldn’t paint a wall, fix a leak, afford to turn up the heat, but here I can renovate my space and chop more logs for the wood burner. I’d love to transform a derelict property into a sustainable beautiful home. It pisses me off that people can get mortgages to buy second homes, especially buy to let- when the interest rates go up, the renters suffer. I care about stability- it’s anxiety inducing not knowing where you’re going to live, or relying on parents. My hope for the future is to get into some kind of eco-cooperative. I enjoy communal living and think it’s better for the planet. I wouldn’t mind being a nomad for a bit, grabbing a van and moving round the country full time, but I don’t like being reliant on petrol, and I want space to grow my own food! I’m not part of the rental system at the moment. I was, in London, when I left university. I got a job as a zone one receptionist straight away, and a room in a shared house, but so much of my money went on rent that I ended up living this miserable life where I didn’t enjoy the city at all, even the free bits. So now I squat, it’s not secure, but neither was renting. Squatting has been cut off from lots of properties by the introduction of SS144, which banned residential squatting, which is ridiculous given the number of homes that are empty. ‘I have no savings and my wages are too low to get a mortgage’ Marta, 33, Lincolnshire. Salary: £575 a month I do not see how I will ever be able to own my own home. I have no savings and my wages are too low to get a mortgage. Also I do not really see owning my own home as the ultimate goal. If there was an option of affordable, long-term and fair renting I would be quite happy to rent for the rest of my life. Having a mortgage is risky because things can go wrong if for example you get ill or your relationship breaks down. The fees attached to getting a mortgage are ridiculous as well. I feel angry and depressed. I am renting privately but was a local authority tenant in South East England before. I actually decided to give up my social housing because it was a new housing estate build in a middle of nowhere with no facilities for my children to play, really bad public transport, no shops or even free cash point. My privately rented accommodation is owned by a landlord who lives in a different county. He owns a lot of houses in the area but never ventures out to look at them. I tried to get him to change a 14-year-old boiler in the property via one of the government schemes that he could qualify because we are on certain benefits but he just was not interested. This is the same with any repairs you always get ready for an uphill struggle to get anything done."
2016-08-02T17:05:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Number of striking workers now lower than ever,"The number of workers that went on strike in Britain last year was the lowest recorded in more than 120 years. Official figures show that just 81,000 workers were involved in strike action in 2015, down from 733,300 in 2014 and the smallest number since records began in 1893. The previous low was 93,000 in 1998 and 2005. The TUC warned that companies now need to increase how much they pay workers in order to avoid a rise in the number of strikes. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “These figures show that going on strike is always a last resort when your employer won’t negotiate and won’t compromise. Strikes are far less common these days and tend to be short. “Most strikes are about people demanding fair pay, which is unsurprising given that real wages have fallen off a cliff in the past decade. “Good industrial relations depend on fair wages and decent rights at work. The new prime minister has spoken about raising wages – now it’s time to live up to that promise.” Industrial action in 2015 included strikes by London Underground staff. Northern Ireland, which lost the most days to strikes for each employee, saw a mass walkout of public sector staff in protest against cutbacks and Stormont’s budget. Across the UK, 170,000 days were lost to strikes, according to the Office of National Statistics. This was sharply down from 788,000 in 2014 and is the second lowest on record. The lowest on record was in 2005, when just 157,000 days were lost. In contrast, 29.5m days were lost in 1979 after the “winter of discontent” while 162.2m were lost in 1926 after the general strike.
The number of days lost to strikes has declined despite public sector cuts, a decline in real wages over the last decade, and criticism of the working practices at some of Britain’s largest companies, such as Sports Direct. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, last week called for a clampdown on zero-hours contracts and said that businesses with more than 250 employees should be made to bargain collectively with recognised trade unions. Corbyn said the British economy “isn’t working for millions of our people”. There were 106 strikes in 2015, less than half the number that took place in 1995 and a twentieth of the strikes in 1975, according to the TUC. More than two-thirds of the days lost were linked to disputes over pay, with 71% or 121,000 days lost connected to these disputes. Another 20% of the days lost were blamed on disputes about redundancies. Although the number of strikes fell, there was an increase in the percentage of disputes lasting for more than one day. Around 70% of the strikes lasted more than one day, compared to 54% in 2014 and 37% in 2013, highlighting that there was some long-running battles between employees and their employer. In Northern Ireland, 21 days were lost per 1,000 employees, compared to 15 per 1,000 in London and just one per 1,000 in the north east, Yorkshire, the Midlands, and the east. The transport and storage sector suffered the most labour disputes, accounting for 60,200 of the days lost. In contrast, public administration and defence lost the most days in 2014."
2016-08-02T19:28:25Z,uk-news,UK news,London's Fenchurch Street evacuated after reports of man with knife,"Hundreds of commuters were evacuated from Fenchurch Street station in central London as armed police cleared the area following a sighting of a man with a knife. Officers were called to the station following reports of a robbery on board a train. A British Transport police spokesperson said: â€œOfficers attended the scene and carried a full search of the train, which had been traveling from Southend Central station. Fenchurch Street station was evacuated while the search was carried out. No one matching the report was found. â€œThe investigation into the incident continues.â€� Their Essex office earlier tweeted: â€œUnconfirmed reports of a man on @c2c_Rail train with a knife. Officers attended & have confirmed itâ€™s all is safe. Trains are running now.â€� The station, in the south-east area of the City of London, is a key transport hub and serves east London and south Essex. Ioanna Pierrie, a personal assistant, was on her way home from work and waiting on the platform when the station was evacuated. She said: â€œIt was quite busy and then a really loud alarm went off and a couple of members of staff were running down the platform shouting: â€˜This is not a routine check please evacuate the station now.â€™â€�
Pierrie said she panicked because she heard station staff talking about an armed man. â€œI heard on the walkie-talkie of c2c staff that they were searching the platforms and there was talk of an armed man but Iâ€™m not too sure how true that is. â€œI waited a bit outside the station and some more police arrived with guns and went inside. We were all told to stand well back from the actual station doors and all the staff were also outside. Pierrie and the others who were evacuated were then told they should continue their journey from a different station.
The station was reopened following the search, however the incident disrupted the journeys of thousands of commuters who were making their way home towards the end of rush hour, with the service to Essex severely delayed. The company c2c Rail, who manage the station, tweeted to say: â€œWe apologise for currently delays, this was due to police dealing with an incident earlier @ Fenchurch St.â€�"
2016-08-02T23:46:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Registering EU nationals in UK could take 140 years at current rates,"Registering more than 3 million EU migrants already living in Britain would present the government with a huge administrative task, according to a new report. Experts looked at the existing regime for applying for permanent residence to examine possible issues that could arise if any new system was introduced following the Brexit vote. Their analysis suggests that if all the European Economic Area (EEA) citizens living in the UK at the beginning of 2016 applied for permanent residence in the same year, this would amount to the equivalent of around 140 years of work at recent rates of processing. Britain is expected to seek to changes to free movement rules following the outcome of the referendum in June, but details of the system have yet to be outlined. Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: “Depending on how long Brexit negotiations take, the government may need to register EU citizens already living here quite quickly. “Given the sheer number of EU citizens who would need to register and the potential complexity of the process, this will be a formidable task.” The observatory looked at the existing regime through which EU nationals apply for permanent residence. Under the rules, those who have lived continuously in the UK for at least five years automatically have a permanent right to reside. The paper said that while the actual process in coming years may be “quite different”, examining the current process “gives an insight into the kind of issues that could arise as any future registration mechanism is implemented”. Assuming free movement comes to an end after the exit process is formalised, EU citizens may need to obtain documents demonstrating their residence rights within a relatively short period of time in order to distinguish themselves from newly arriving EU citizens who do not continue to enjoy free movement rights, according to the study.
Meanwhile, Britain’s new EU commissioner, Sir Julian King, has been asked to help develop European security and counter-terrorism plans. The diplomat will become commissioner for the security union, tasked with beefing up the EU’s counter-terrorism role and taking action to prevent radicalisation. King, currently UK ambassador to France, was appointed by David Cameron in one of his final acts as prime minister, to ensure that the UK had a place around the table at the EU executive in Brussels. The vacancy arose after Jonathan Hill stood down as financial regulation commissioner following Britain’s vote to leave the EU. The portfolio offered by the European commission is not the derisory job in charge of paperclips or EU language policy that some Brussels insiders had joked about, but King will be a junior member of the commission, outranked by existing politicians. He will report to the commission first vice-president, Frans Timmermans, who will have the final say over any legislative initiatives. King will not attend ministerial meetings, usually a key part of a commissioner’s job. Dimitris Avramopoulos, the commissioner in charge of home affairs and migration, will represent the commission on security policy at meetings with EU ministers and in the European parliament, a decision already being seen as a snub to the UK. The job underlines the EU’s hopes of maintaining strong ties with a post-Brexit UK in the fight against terrorism. The EU executive has been pushing for a more joined-up response to terrorism, even before the recent attacks in Paris, Brussels, Normandy and Nice. Following the Brussels attacks in March, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the commission, said: “We need capital markets union, energy union, economic and monetary union, but we also think that we need a security union.” Juncker interviewed King in July and then spent some time “meditating” on the decision, according to a spokeswoman. If confirmed in post, King will get his feet under the table almost 18 months after the launch of the EU’s security strategy. The spokeswoman said he would have to deliver “very concrete anti-terrorism measures”, adding that “obviously fighting terrorism is primarily a member state’s responsibility”. Timothy Kirkhope, a Conservative MEP, said the portfolio choice sent “a strong signal that the security relationship between Britain and the EU will remain of key importance post Brexit”. In a letter to King, Juncker said the EU was going through one of the most testing periods in its history. He highlighted the problem of unemployment and the lingering effects of the financial crisis. “We have to cope with the refugee crisis, with the aftermath of the UK referendum and with the increased threat of terrorism,” he said. No 10 welcomed the decision. “The UK will continue to fulfil our rights and obligations as a member state until we leave the EU, and the prime minister has been clear that we will be an active player, so it is right that we should continue to have a commissioner role,” a spokesperson said. “Security is a vital issue for all member states and cooperation across the EU can help to better protect us all from the range of threats we face. “The president called the prime minister [on Monday] evening to inform her of his decision. We now look forward to Sir Julian being confirmed in the role.” King still has to be formally approved by all 28 EU member states. He will be questioned by MEPs at a hearing likely to take place in September. While the European parliament does not have a binding vote, Juncker has to “seriously consider” its views. King can expect to be questioned about data protection, a topic that arouses strong passions in the parliament, which has a track record of voting down data collection schemes. Rebecca Harms, a German MEP who co-chairs the Green group, said some British politicians “tended to be associated with mass data collection and closing borders”. “We need to agree our security strategy, but we have to do it with deeper cooperation and we have to be very specific about data collection,” she said. She also voiced surprise that King was being offered “a key portfolio” rather than the “relatively unimportant job” expected. “This is not a portfolio that you give to someone who fills a gap between 2016 and 2018.”"
2016-08-03T05:46:14Z,uk-news,UK news,British jets bomb Saddam palace used by Isis in Iraq,"British fighter jets have bombed a former palace of Saddam Hussein being used as a training centre for Isis recruits in Iraq, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. A pair of RAF Tornados took part as a multinational squadron attacked the headquarters and training centre for foreign terrorist recruits, located close to the Tigris in Mosul. The strike was part of a co-ordinated coalition attack on the compound, which housed and trained recruits and contained outbuildings for internal security and repression, the MoD said. Extensive surveillance had shown Islamic State was using the palace, built by Iraq’s former dictator as a major headquarters and training centre. The multinational squadron including the British Tornados armed with the RAF’s largest 2000lb Paveway bombs attacked the complex on the afternoon of Monday, the MoD said – hitting the headquarters building first, then a security centre, in what was rated as a successful attack in initial assessments.
The secure compound next to the Tigris river included the main palace used for accommodation and meetings, and outbuildings used for command and control, training, internal security and repression, the MoD said. The UK defence secretary, Michael Fallon, said: “Daesh [Isis] has been losing followers and territory for months, and emphatic strikes like this show that we and the coalition will not waver.” During his visit to RAF Akrotiri, from where Tornado and Typhoon aircraft have been flying daily missions against Isis, Fallon announced that additional UK troops would deploy to Iraq to support the mutinational military effort against Islamic State later this month."
2016-08-03T08:00:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Brighton photo biennial: seventh edition aims to cut through stereotypes,"This year’s Brighton Photo Biennial is to take on the stereotypes around gender, sexuality and the ideal body form that dominate our lives from advertising to the filtered images posted across social media. The seventh edition of the biennial, titled Beyond The Bias- Reshaping Image, will include exhibitions documenting the youth subcultures around Notting Hill Carnival, representations of the LGBT community in both Brighton and Mumbai, and an exploration of the black dandy phenomenon across the world. Celia Davies, director of Photoworks who devised the biennial programme, said she wanted to bring together photographers who offered a new perspective on identity and representation, “cutting through, dissecting and hopefully in some way reshaping” our visual culture, which tends to conform to a single idea of beauty, fashion and gender. Ewen Spencer, who had spent the past two decades documenting youth culture and was at the forefront of documenting the emergence of garage and grime music, will produce a new series of work for the biennial exploring subcultures of young Londoners, particularly that have emerged around Notting Hill carnival.
Rather than being displayed in the traditional format, Spencer’s images will be blown up and displayed on custom-built billboards in Brighton’s Fabrica gallery. Davies said the project, titled Kick over the statues, would emphasise how, even though the advent of the internet is often seen to have killed off youth subcultures and tribes as they once existed, they are still present on the streets of places such as London and Liverpool. “The project will use the Notting Hill carnival as a locator for these ideas around history of youth culture, the diaspora that is involved in youth culture today, the tribe mentality that is involved and how people are expressing it,” said Davies. She added: “Ewen would always say that style informs fashion and I think that is a really interesting point, because young people are particularly good at individualising trends for themselves. It is what makes this such an interesting project.”
The biennial has also brought together a British and an Indian photographer for a new continent-crossing project documenting members of the LGBT+ community in Brighton and Mumbai. Olivia Arthur and Bharat Sikka decided to examine self-image and sexuality through a series of intimate portraits where each subjects was asked to explore their own fantasies – either in the privacy of their own homes or in public open spaces. The images will also address issues around assumptions and the portrayal of gender, with photos of figures from the trans community and some in the midst of transitioning. “In Mumbai there is a complexity in terms of how people express their sexuality because homosexuality is banned and carries with it an enormous amounts of shame, whereas Brighton is one of the gay capitals of the UK and sexuality is often on public display,” said Davies.
“But sometimes you wonder how authentic that is, in terms of what people are really feeling about their sexuality. So these images will explore shame and fantasy and how those feelings are connected to sexuality and self-image.” The Brighton Photo Biennial will also bring one of the largest documentations of black dandy culture from around the world to the UK. The Dandy Lion project, begun by American curator Shantrelle Lewis, has collated contemporary images of black dandies from Europe, the US and Africa since 2010. The exhibition in Brighton will showcase 150 of these images taken by more than 30 photographers and filmmakers over the past decade, the largest show of its kind ever displayed in the UK, and will also include some photos collected from an open call by the biennial specifically for the show. The photos will illustrate how different communities of the diaspora have interpreted the black dandy styles, which has troubled roots from the time of slavery but has since been adopted and owned by many from the black community. While the black dandy style is often seen as a projection of manhood and masculinity, Davies said the show would explore, across the diaspora, the nuances of the phenomenon. “Being a dandy is about looking good but it runs deeper than that,” she said. “That visibility and that need to be taken seriously – it’s a statement as much about political and social attitudes as it is about fashion.” Brighton Photo Biennial 2016 runs from 1 to 30 October"
2016-08-03T08:56:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Australian family fighting deportation ordered to leave UK,"The Home Office has ordered the Australian family fighting to remain in Scotland to leave the UK, after they failed to find a job that meets the government’s strict immigration criteria.
Gregg and Kathryn Brain, who emigrated from Australia in 2011 in the belief they could build a life in Scotland on a post-study work visa, were given the news by their MP, Ian Blackford, on Tuesday night. Blackford said Robert Goodwill, the Home Office immigration minister, had written to him saying the Brains would not get indefinite leave to remain or a further extension to the grace period, after the last extension lapsed on 1 August. The Brains, who have a seven-year-old son, Lachlan, and are originally from Brisbane, now face imminent deportation. Goodwill has told the family that officers with the family returns unit of the Home Office’s immigration enforcement department will contact the Brains later this week to organise “a voluntary departure to Australia”. They will discuss how much time and what help and assistance the family need to make this a reality. Goodwill told Blackford: “I very much hope you will encourage the family to cooperate with this process and to leave the UK voluntarily. Failure to do so would lead to an adverse immigration history, which could preclude the family making a future tier-two job application or even returning to the UK as visitors.” Gregg Brain said the family had not lost hope of securing a last-minute job offer and winning the right to stay. “We’re talking to our lawyer about our options going forward. We consider this not to be lost and certainly a hell of a long way from being over,” Brain told the Guardian. “We’re bitterly disappointed that [the Home Office] haven’t chosen the honourable route and we still hope that they will discover their sense of honour.” Blackford said he was now racing to see if he could find a job for Kathryn Brain that would satisfy the tier-two criteria she needs to meet, and apply before the deportation process is complete. He is pursuing one potential job offer. “I will see if I can I identify an opportunity for them. I’m working on something which may result in an offer for her but until that’s in the bag, I don’t want to say too much about that,” he said. “I’m amazed at the way they have conducted themselves over the last while: they have been remarkably dignified in their response to the whole thing. It must just be awful for them.” The Brains are now hoping the Home Office will confirm that the deportation threat would be lifted if his wife could find the right job, to give potential employers the confidence that a job offer for Kathryn Brain would not be wasted. Gregg Brain said Goodwill was guilty of “extraordinary spin” by implying there was a level playing field for all non-EU migrants like them trying to secure work visas in the UK, since the rules affecting the Brains had been changed after their work study visa was granted. A new pilot scheme for overseas students at four English universities seeking work visas, launched last week, had none of the financial costs facing the Brains, he added. Any employer who wanted to offer Kathryn Brain a job would need to pay up to £3,000 in Home Office and legal fees – costs which would not apply to a UK or EU citizen.
The Brains have been living in Dingwall near Inverness since 2011 after they moved so Kathryn Brain could study at the University of the Highlands and Islands, and under the then post-study work visa system find a job which would allow the family to remain in the UK. The Brains said they were unaware that the Home Office had announced in March 2011, three months before they arrived in the UK, that the post-study work visa system was being scrapped. Ministers had indicated it would be scrapped in December 2010, the Home Office said. The Brains say they only discovered it had been withdrawn in 2012, after they had settled in Dingwall. After Kathryn Brain’s degree course ended last year, they tried but failed to find a job for her which met the correct criteria. They are furious that they are now being forced to leave, arguing that it is a breach of faith by the UK government to cancel that visa system retrospectively. One potential job offer at a local distillery was withdrawn late last month, after the distillery owner feared he was breaking the law by not opening the job up to all applicants. In his letter to Blackford, Goodwill said: “My officials and I have looked carefully at the family’s case to see whether there are any exceptional considerations which would justify granting them leave outside the immigration rules, as you suggest. “There is no fundamental difference between their circumstances and that of any other individuals who came to the UK on a temporary study visa. If they wish to remain to work, then they must make a tier-two application to do so.” Goodwill added: “There was no breach of faith in relation to the closure of the tier-one (post-study work) route. It was not an entitlement of the student visa Kathryn Brain originally applied for, which was for a time-limited period of study only. “The tier-one (post-study work) category was closed because too many applicants were not using the student route primarily to gain a world-class education at our universities, but merely as a means to the end of living and working in the UK.” He added: “Although the family have said they were unaware of the announcement until 2012, they have still had a number of years in which to search and apply for jobs which would qualify under tier two. “I would also observe that tier one (post-study work) never conferred a long-term right to stay in the UK. Even when the route was open, applicants needed to find a job that would qualify under tier two before the end of the two years in the route.”"
2016-08-03T11:00:39Z,uk-news,UK news,Police arrest man over alleged sexual abuse at Ampleforth College,"Police have arrested a man as part of their investigations into historical sexual abuse allegations at Ampleforth College, a prestigious Catholic boarding school in North Yorkshire. The school is being investigated by the independent Goddard inquiry into child sexual abuse in England and Wales. The inquiry was announced in July 2014 following the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal. North Yorkshire police confirmed two investigations into alleged sexual abuse at the school were being carried out by the force and that one man had been arrested. A police spokesman said the force was fully cooperating with the Goddard inquiry and was keen to work closely with all those involved. “We have already provided a considerable amount of information, and we may be in a position to provide more as the inquiry progresses,” he said. Ampleforth College was founded in 1802 and is run by the Benedictine monks and lay staff of Ampleforth Abbey. Allegations of sexual abuse at the school date back decades but police first started investigating in 2003 when a psychologist employed by Ampleforth to carry out risk assessments on pupils turned whistleblower. Since 1996, a number of staff and former staff have been convicted of offences including indecent assault and downloading indecent images of children. Judge Lowell Goddard confirmed in November last year that, among other things, her inquiry would examine reports of abuse in the Roman Catholic church. The £17.9m investigation – the biggest public inquiry into institutional child abuse and accusations of establishment cover-ups held in England and Wales – does not have the power to convict or punish people. However, Goddard has said she would not shrink from naming individuals who have abused children and the institutions that allowed it to happen. Former pupils at Ampleforth – known as Old Amplefordians – include Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, sculptor Anthony Gormley and actor Rupert Everett. It was a boys’ school until 2002, when girls where first admitted to the sixth form. The school became fully co-ed in 2010."
2016-08-03T11:32:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Is Britain doing enough to help child refugees?,"This week marks three months since the UK government passed a landmark ruling to provide sanctuary to unaccompanied, vulnerable child refugees. Guardian journalist Amelia Gentleman interviewed children in the Calais refugee camp, and highlighted the UK government’s failure to act on its word. Gentleman spoke to several children, aged nine to 12, all of whom arrived in Europe before 20 March (a criterion set out in the legislation to prevent more children from being sent away by their parents alone), all potentially eligible to be helped to safety in the UK under the Dubs amendment – a commitment to relocate a number of lone child migrants to the UK “as soon as possible”. Although no figure was specified, charities hoped that the UK would begin to accommodate large numbers of the estimated 88,000 unaccompanied child refugees in Europe. However, by the start of this week fewer than 20 had arrived under the scheme. Lord Dubs has condemned the “shocking” lack of urgency in the government’s response that was forcing very young children to continue living in “intolerable conditions”. Did you read the Guardian’s report? We want to know what you think about it. If you have experience working with child refugees, we’d also like to hear from you.

2016-08-03T13:18:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Police Federation sceptical after London increases armed police,"The unveiling of additional armed police in London has been met with scepticism by the body representing rank-and-file officers as it said it would take two years for the targeted increase in marksmen to be met nationally. The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said an undisclosed number of the force’s planned additional 600 marksmen were now fully trained. But the Police Federation said it would take at least 24 months to recruit the 1,500 extra armed police officers planned nationwide, leaving areas of the country vulnerable to attack in the meantime. The Police Federation chair, Steve White, said: “Some forces are getting volunteers coming forward, but they are not always being selected because they don’t meet the criteria. It is vitally important that standards are maintained. The best-case scenario is two years in terms of recruiting an extra 1,500 officers. “If there is an attack it is unlikely to be an isolated incident. We’ve got to have the resources around the country because it might happen in multiple places at the same time.”
The former prime minister David Cameron announced in April that police in England and Wales would train extra firearms officers following a review of armed policing, which was commissioned after the terrorist attacks in Paris in November, when 130 people were killed. Speaking in Hyde Park, Hogan-Howe said: “I think people understand that where you are going to have people as enemies who’ve got guns, we’ve got to have guns. “It’s unusual, but it’s an entirely rational and reasonable response to make sure that people are aware that we’ve got the guns, and if we have to use them we’ve got people well equipped to do that.” As well as the armed response teams on public patrol, Scotland Yard has specialist counter-terrorism firearms squads who are on call 24 hours a day and trained to confront and stop attackers as a priority over dealing with casualties. The masked marksmen are trained to operate on water, to abseil, operate on motorbikes and will be armed with handguns and semi-automatic weapons, as well as Tasers. There were 5,639 authorised firearms officers in forces across England and Wales as of 31 March, according to the latest Home Office figures, which is down by eight compared with the previous year, when there were 5,647. The total number has fallen by more than 1,000 in the past five years. Deputy chief constable Simon Chesterman, national lead for firearms, said in July that the majority of new marksmen would be in place by April 2017. In London, Scotland Yard’s existing 2,200 marksmen are being boosted by 600, and the force intends to have significantly more in place by the end of the year. White, who was elected as Police Federation chair in 2014, said the new armed officers were not external recruits but were being drafted in from other areas, including neighbourhood policing.
“Chief constables are having to make very difficult decisions in terms of managing their budgets and managing the competing priorities that they have,” he said. “With counter-terrorism there is the top-sliced money and the extra money for firearms officers, but that is once we’re having an attack. “Of course we need them, but we must make sure that we have the relationships built up between local communities and the police service, so that people can ring the police or speak to their bobby on the street and have the confidence to raise things with them. “If you don’t have police officers having that daily contact in these communities you’re never going to build these relationships.” However, neighbourhood coverage has been increased in London. The capital’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said on Wednesday that each ward will get an additional dedicated constable. Khan said: “The safety and security of all Londoners is my first priority, and our police and security services is working incredibly hard every day on our behalf. “‎The threat level here in London has not changed, but it does remain at severe and especially in light of recent deadly attacks in Europe it is important we are prepared should the unthinkable happen. “We will see more armed officers on our streets, but there is no reason to be alarmed. All of our police officers are playing their part and working closely with all of our communities to prevent the possibility of an attack.”"
2016-08-03T13:33:16Z,uk-news,UK news,Have tuition fees stopped you from attending university?,"On average, English undergraduates paid just under £6,000 in annual tuition fees in the 2013-14 year, after the government’s decision to triple maximum fees, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD). This is the highest average undergraduate fee in the industrialised world. Some universities in England, including Durham and Manchester, have started telling potential students that their tuition fees will go up across the board from next year, the first rise since fees were nearly trebled to £9,000 in 2012. Eight OECD countries have no tuition fees for full-time undergraduate students at public universities, in more than half of the other countries with relevant data, annual fees are £1,300 or more. This, however, is for people from the same country, with international students generally charged more. Have you been put off from attending university due to high tuition fees?

2016-08-03T13:33:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Police investigate report of suspicious activity near Aldershot garrison,"Police are investigating reports of two men acting suspiciously near the British army garrison in Aldershot, Hampshire. Officers received a report from a civilian member of staff who works in the military complex that two men were behaving suspiciously in a blue Renault Clio parked nearby. There was no contact made between the two men and the person reporting the incident and there is nothing to suggest a crime was committed, the police added. Tensions have been high around military bases since two men described as “Middle Eastern” in appearance allegedly tried to abduct an RAF serviceman at knifepoint outside RAF Marham, Norfolk, in July. A statement from Hampshire police said: “We were called to a suspicious incident at 8.42am today at the junction between Queens Avenue and Hospital Hill, Aldershot. Two men were seen acting suspiciously in a blue Renault Clio. At this stage there is nothing to suggest that a crime has been committed but we are looking into why the two men had stopped the car on this stretch of road.” Bulford military camp on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, was placed on lockdown on Thursday after reports that three people had been seen on a nearby ridge with a “long-barrelled weapon”. But police said the incident was a false alarm and that tensions were high following the Marham incident and the Bastille Day attack in Nice. Detectives investigating the attempted abduction at Marhamhave released efit images of the suspects. The first suspect, who was fought off by the serviceman, is aged between 20 and 30 and about 6ft tall. He is described as of athletic but stocky build, with dark hair which was long on top and a well-groomed beard. He had a dark skin tone and wore casual clothing. Police believe he may have a visible facial injury as the serviceman headbutted him to fend him off."
2016-08-03T14:58:55Z,uk-news,UK news,British woman dies after cycling into ravine on Pyrénées holiday,"Tributes have been paid to a Welsh woman who died after cycling into a ravine in fog, while on holidays in the Pyrénées. There was speculation that Jennifer Hill, who was on a cycling holiday with her husband, may have missed a sharp turn while descending a steep road above the resort of Gavarnie. Visibility was described as poor by local firefighters at the time of the accident on Sunday evening. Hill was the director of learning and skills at Vale of Glamorgan council in South Wales, and tributes came from council officials and from her family, who described her as “a devoted mother and treasured wife”. In a statement issued through the council, the family said: “We are so proud of her dedication to her work and many achievements both in the Vale and earlier in her career. She strove for nothing less than the best, whether it was cycling, running, or tending our beautiful garden. Nothing can replace her.” The council’s managing director, Rob Thomas, said he was shocked to hear of her death. “Jennifer’s work was admired far beyond the Vale of Glamorgan and her tragic death is a great loss to her profession. The greater loss is of course to Jennifer’s family, friends and colleagues. Having worked closely with her for several years I feel very fortunate to have been able to call Jennifer both a friend and colleague. Her compassion was unbreakable, in even the most testing of circumstances, and she will be deeply missed.” The council leader, Neil Moore, called her death “an absolute tragedy”, describing her as a public servant of great distinction. “Jennifer’s work has had a very real impact on the prospects of learners of all ages in the Vale of Glamorgan. Her dedication to improving education was hugely respected both throughout the Vale and beyond.” Hill joined the council in 2012 when she moved to live in Monmouth with her family, having previously worked as assistant director of schools and children’s services at Enfield in London. In Glamorgan she oversaw the council’s best ever exam results, and improvements in the education service praised by inspectors."
2016-08-03T15:51:17Z,uk-news,UK news,EuroMillions winners bought £61m ticket after lifesaving cancer surgery,"A family syndicate from Wales has won a £61m lottery jackpot after buying a ticket because they felt like “the luckiest people on the planet” after one of them had lifesaving cancer surgery. Sonia Davies, 53, called her daughter Stephanie, 23, to urge her to buy the ticket last Friday, two days after undergoing surgery in Florida to remove a tumour on her parathyroid gland. Having been told by doctors that the surgery had saved her life, she felt she was “on a winning streak”, she told a press conference in Newport on Wednesday. “I felt like I had cheated death. You just think, OK, we’ll buy a lottery ticket, because I feel so lucky. She “didn’t for a minute” think she would win, she said, but nonetheless had the sense of “someone shining down on you”. The two women will share the rollover jackpot of £61,102,442.90 with Sonia’s other daughter, Courtney, 19, Sonia’s partner, Keith Reynolds, 55, and Stephanie’s partner, Steve Powell, 30. Sonia Davies said it had been a “rollercoaster of a week”. “I had my operation on Wednesday and until then we didn’t know how serious it was. They told me that if it hadn’t been removed it would have been fatal – and at the very least I would have lost my voice within a year. “They managed to give me the all-clear straight after the operation, so as you can imagine we were on cloud nine.” She said her partner had been scanning his emails and learned about the EuroMillions rollover. “He was convinced that we were the luckiest people on the planet and definitely on a winning streak after the success of my op … something told us we needed to get a ticket – and the rest is history.” Stephanie Davies, a sales executive, said she had thought her mother was “mad” to call from Florida, where the couple were also having a holiday. “But they were so insistent I knew we had to do it.” She bought six Lucky Dip tickets at a garage near the family home in Monmouth, close to the Welsh-English border, but forgot to check the numbers until early on Sunday morning, when she retired to bed telling her boyfriend: “If I shout down, it means we’ve won the lottery, and if not I’ve gone to bed.” She then looked on her iPad and realised one of their tickets had all the numbers. “I came back downstairs to find Steve and couldn’t take my hand away from my mouth in shock. I kept saying, ‘We’ve won, and I’m not joking.’ I could see Steve was trying to read me to see whether I was telling the truth, but I was so emotional, he decided to check. And he checked again. We giggled. We memorised the numbers and checked again. We checked the draw date again.” Seized “in a crazy moment” with an irrational panic that the ticket might disappear, they took selfies with the winning ticket, before locking all the doors and windows in case someone could hear they had won, she said. “Suddenly you realise that you have this piece of paper in your hand and it’s worth £61m.” The first phone call was to her mother and Reynolds, who were about to board their plane home. “I thought she’d told me she’d lost her dog,” said Sonia. “Then I heard Steve shouting, ‘We’ve won £61m!’” They called her sister Courtney and, at 5.20am and unable to sleep, rang lottery organisers Camelot to claim their prize. The winning numbers were 1, 21, 26, 40, 50 and Lucky Stars 2 and 4. Sonia Davies and Reynolds, who described their trip home from Florida as “the longest flight of our life”, said they were hoping to share their winnings of £12,200,488.58 each with family and friends, but would also like a new oak-framed carport for their home near Ross-on-Wye. Younger daughter Courtney, a student at the University of Southampton, plans to finish her degree in psychology before deciding what to do next, but said she wanted to replace her VW Fox and to buy an electric toothbrush – a £50 luxury she had always coveted but felt unable to justify. Her boyfriend Kieran, also a student, has “high expectations” about his upcoming 21st-birthday gift. For Stephanie and her partner, the priorities were decorating the home they bought together at Christmas, and a trip to the Caribbean. Fighting back tears while talking to reporters, Stephanie said: “It’s just so much to take in. It doesn’t seem real. There are so many emotions coming through.” • If you have followed a link to this article from an email, please be aware that it may be a scam email.

2016-08-03T16:12:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Southern rail staff make further strike threats over new disputes,"The crisis at Southern Railway is set to intensify with further strike threats by workers involving two new disputes. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) said it planned to ballot more than 250 station staff in protest at ticket office closures and members of the drivers’ union Aslef will also vote for industrial action. Aslef said there had been a breakdown in relations with management at Southern and Gatwick Express. The TSSA said 47 jobs would be lost if the plans to close 34 offices and reduce hours at 49 others go ahead. The ballot was announced before talks between Southern and the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union in a separate dispute over the role of conductors.
The RMT is planning five days of strikes from Monday if the deadlocked row is not resolved with Southern, which operates services from London to southern counties. Southern, which is a brand name used by the Go-Ahead group and Keolis of France, said a strike timetable would be put in place if the action was not called off by Thursday afternoon. Angie Doll, the passenger service director at the railway company, cricitised TSSA and said Aslef had twice tried to block plans to improve the railway and the courts had twice ruled this unlawful. “To call a strike ballot now is a cynical and desperate attempt to heap even more misery on passengers, especially as we have met with Aslef on two occasions and have a further meeting with them next week on this specific issue,” said Doll. RMT wrote to the new transport secretary, Chris Grayling, asking for direct talks after he said tackling Southern’s issues would be a priority in his new role, but the union said the request had been ignored. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said the “arrogance and inaction” of Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), Southern’s train operating company, and the government demonstrated that they had no interest in resolving the dispute. But the rail minister, Paul Maynard, said the move showed the union “had decided that it is not on the side of the passenger”. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, told a rally on Tuesday evening in Brighton – one of the cities most affected by the Southern crisis – that renationalisation was the answer. “If there’s one thing that can unite this party, and indeed this city, it’s campaigning to get rid of the Southern franchise and bring the railways into public ownership.”"
2016-08-03T17:45:59Z,uk-news,UK news,"Alleged 'honour' killing victim was murdered, Pakistani police confirm","Police in Pakistan have confirmed that a woman from Bradford, whose husband believes was the victim of a so-called “honour” killing, was murdered. Samia Shahid, 28, died last month in northern Punjab. Her husband, Syed Mukhtar Kazam, said he believed his wife, who was in Pakistan to visit relatives, was killed because her family disapproved of their marriage. Shahid’s family – who deny Kazam’s claims – initially said she had died of a heart attack, but police said that forensic reports showed she had been strangled. “The report says that she neither committed suicide nor did she die a natural death,” police spokeswoman Nabeela Ghazanfar told Reuters. “She died of asphyxia after her breathing was choked, which leads to the possibility she was murdered. Now the team will carry out investigations along the lines that this is a murder.” Ghazanfar said a forensic report on Shahid’s death had been released to a three-member investigative committee set up by the chief minister of Punjab and led by deputy inspector general of police Abubakar Khuda Bakhsh. No arrests have been made in the case, though Shahid’s father, Mohammad, and a cousin, Mobeen, have been interviewed by police. Shahid’s husband claimed she was killed because she divorced her first husband – a cousin she had married in an arranged service – and married Kazam, moving to Dubai with him in 2014. Shahid converted from the Sunni to the Shia school of Islam when the pair married. Police did not treat Shahid’s death as suspicious and a first postmortem reported there were no marks on her body, but a murder inquiry was launched last week and a new team of investigators put in charge of the case. Photographs of the body, seen by the media, appear to show a 19cm-long bruise on her neck. Kazam has travelled to Pakistan to put pressure on the authorities to investigate Shahid’s death. Naz Shah, the local MP in Bradford, said he was under 24-hour police protection after receiving death threats. Shah has written to the Pakistani authorities to demand a proper investigation into her constituent’s death, raising fears that there could be a cover-up. Kazam has said he fears Shahid’s family will use their local power to hush up the investigation. More than 1,096 “honour” killings were reported in Pakistan last year, though the actual number of victims is likely to be far higher."
2016-08-03T17:59:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Man dies after attack in County Durham village,"A man has died after he was attacked in a village in County Durham, police have confirmed. Kelloe, a former pit village, is said to be on lockdown and a police manhunt under way for the attacker. The victim was taken to the James Cook University hospital in Middlesbrough, where he died a short time later. Officers were called to reports of an attack in Kelloe on Wednesday afternoon. A North East Ambulance Service spokesman said: “We were called at 2pm to a serious incident in Front Street in Kelloe. A man in his 20s appeared to have significant stab wounds to his chest and stomach.”
Paramedics arrived within five minutes and were joined by the air ambulance, who had a doctor on board. “Their doctor decided he should stay in the ambulance and he was driven to hospital,” the ambulance service spokesman said. “The doctor also went in the ambulance so he could work on him on the way. The man was in a serious condition.” The incident is thought to have happened close to a hairdresser’s and the Kelloe Working Men’s Club. Witnesses told the Northern Echo that armed officers, backed by a helicopter, had carried out a search of the village looking for the assailant. At least one property was said to have been raided by officers during the search. One witness, who did not want to be named, told the Press Association: “About 1.45pm I saw lots of police cars and an ambulance heading to the village. “I saw lots of police officers getting changed into their armed response gear. Apparently there was a young man in his 30s stabbed. They had the police helicopter up and they’re still looking for the guy who did it.”"
2016-08-03T18:21:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Police officer seriously hurt in attempted robbery in London,"A police officer is in hospital in a serious condition after being hit by a moped while helping to foil an attempted robbery at a luxury store in London’s West End. Four men armed with a machete and an axe and riding two mopeds targeted the Chronext shop in Piccadilly on Wednesday morning. The gang smashed the windows of the store and tried to steal valuables, but were stopped when Scotland Yard’s anti-robbery team, known as the Flying Squad, moved in after receiving a tip-off. Tasers were fired at the men as they tried to flee. One officer was left in a serious condition after he was hit by a robber fleeing on a moped; three others suffered minor injuries. All four members of the gang were arrested.
Jacob Marrache, retail manager of the store, told the Guardian that the attack had caused close to £500,000 of damage to both the property and to their stock. The police had come into the store earlier in the day to warn them that a robbery might take place. Just before the incident, they were contacted once again by the police who told them it was definitely happening and they should ask their customers to leave the shop. The attack began soon after. Marrache said: “Two mopeds showed up right in front of the store. There were four guys. They had a hammer and got the door open. They shouted ‘don’t fucking move’ and made a lot of noise and started smashing up the first cabinet. At that moment, the police just stormed in at them and chased them out.” Outside the shop all of the men were apprehended, however there was a struggle with all four spitting and shouting. “The officer who got hurt was struggling with one of the guys who was trying to get on the moped,” Marrache said. “It’s not really clear what happened but he got hurt.” He praised the actions of the officers. “They were all very brave. Our biggest concern is the injured officer’s wellbeing. We’ve got expensive stock here but everything is insured and none of that really matters when it comes to someone’s life. We’re all praying for him and hoping he’s alright. They all put their lives on the line. They were all amazing.” Avi Reed, the UK director of Chronext, told BBC News that the company were delighted by the police warning. “Thank god our employees were at the back of the store and nobody was injured,” he said. “The police acted with amazing speed. Unfortunately I believe one officer was injured. “We are delighted there was a police warning and it’s terrifying to think what would have happened without it.” One witness was Nasir Miah, an Uber driver who saw the attempted robbery unfold from his car. He told the Daily Mail: “I couldn’t believe what I was watching, it was like a scene out of a movie. Even in London you don’t see anything like that very often. “I was coming up to a junction when I saw something that looked really weird. I thought it must be a robbery because these two mopeds mounted the pavement. “The people riding them then got off and were acting quite aggressively, people were getting out of their way. The next thing there was a lot of shouting and undercover police officers jumped out from nowhere and lunged at the bikers before they could even get in the store. “The bikers had nowhere to go as they were facing oncoming traffic, then some of the public started helping the officers when they realised what was going on.” All four men were arrested on suspicion of robbery and have been taken to central London police stations. One of those arrested reported being unwell and has been transferred to hospital. An axe, knives and the stolen jewellery were all recovered at the scene. Det Supt Craig Turner said: “Our officers are absolutely committed to keeping London safe and target the criminals who pose a danger to Londoners and our city businesses day in, day out. “They know that this work carries with it very real risks and dangers but take this in their stride as part of serving the public. However, today’s events highlight how the reckless behaviour of those determined to evade justice, heedless of the consequences, can have a real impact on all those involved.” The store will reopen tomorrow after a new door was fitted on Wednesday evening, Marrache confirmed. The company also plan to increase security measures including stronger reinforced glass and extra CCTV cameras, as well as further staff training."

Officers in Wandsworth were called by the London ambulance service to Winstanley Estate just after 6pm on Wednesday, following reports of a stabbing. A spokesperson said: “Officers attended and found a man in his 30s suffering from multiple stab injuries at a residential address. He died at the scene a short while later. “Police are in the process of informing next of kin. Formal identification awaits. A postmortem examination will be held in due course.” Two other men were found in the area suffering from stab injuries. They were taken to a south London hospital, where they remain in a serious but stable condition. Detectives from the homicide and major crime command are investigating, but no arrests have been made and inquiries are ongoing."
2016-08-04T05:00:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Squalid property used to house asylum seekers receives second inspection,"A London council has carried out its second inspection in the space of a week into Home Office accommodation for asylum seekers after the Guardian exposed the appalling conditions there. Inspectors from Hounslow council went into the property in the east of the borough on Wednesday, which is used to house dozens of vulnerable asylum seeker women and children. Some of them are survivors of rape and torture. The council said it had identified improvement works required at the property on earlier visits and that now the Home Office contractors have begun to do the repairs. A council spokeswoman said that a decision would be made about whether to review the property’s current licence and whether to change its conditions. A pest company has been called in and has set baits, which it will return to inspect. The council said it will be returning to monitor the work being carried out on the property. When council inspectors visited the property on Thursday last week, they said: “All communal parts of the building were inspected and some issues were noted that we will be taking up with the management as a matter of urgency.” The women said that since the Guardian exposed the conditions in the property there had been a steady stream of people coming into the property to inspect, clean and repair it. “[On Tuesday] we had someone here from the Home Office all day looking at all the rooms. Cleaners have been in and have used a lot of bleach in the kitchen. When we kept complaining about the bad conditions here to the landlord nothing was done but now the case is in the media they are listening to us.” One woman said that water was pouring through her light fitting. “I was very scared and felt very stressed,” she said. “The manager of the property was here and he also seemed very stressed about the whole thing. They are not happy that we have spoken to the media about this place.” Another woman said that she was overjoyed that at last things were changing at the accommodation. “I have twice tried to commit suicide here,” she said. “It is a very bad place. I have a lot of medical records which link my illnesses with the bad conditions here. I’m happy that things are changing now.” Two private contractors, Clearsprings Ready Homes, one of the largest providers of Home Office accommodation, and Cromwood Housing have contracts to manage the accommodation. The owner of the property, Imtiaz Aziz, lives next door. His home is very luxurious. Clearsprings hit the headlines after the Guardian revealed that it compelled asylum seekers to wear coloured wristbands in exchange for food. The women have complained about an infestation of rats in the kitchen, filthy conditions, leaks, naked wires left exposed and infestations of bedbugs. The women have also complained about the lack of a garden for the children to play in. The Aziz family have taken the back garden that belongs to the accommodation as part of their garden and, following a request from Cromwood, have provided a small, overgrown patch of ground to the asylum seekers, which they say is too dangerous for children to play in. The women said that today the weeds in the patch of garden allocated to the asylum seekers have been cut down. When asked about the women’s claims about the conditions of the housing, Aziz said: “Our contractors haven’t always been reliable. We have been through several different contractors.” Both Clearsprings and Cromwood said the Home Office would respond on their behalf. A Home Office spokesman said: “Providers are monitored extremely closely to ensure they meet required standards and the contracts include measures to ensure any issues are quickly addressed. “Where a contractor is found to be falling short of these standards, we work with them to ensure issues are quickly addressed and when they are not we can and do impose sanctions.” A Hounslow council spokeswoman said: “A further visit to the licensed HMO [house of multiple occupancy] was made today, on Wednesday by council officers. “They met with the owner and contractors who were on site and who were cooperative and had begun work on issues identified by the council officers on earlier visits. A pest company had also visited the property and found no evidence of cockroaches but did set baits which they will return to inspect. “The property is licensed to house 31 people and the number of people living there was not found to be over that. A decision will be made on whether the licence should be reviewed with conditions. There will be further visits by the council to monitor the works being carried out by the owner.”"
2016-08-04T06:08:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Antisemitic incidents in UK rise 11% in first six months of 2016,"Incidents of antisemitism rose by 11% in the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 2015, according to the Community Security Trust. The overall figure of 557 cases of malicious acts was the second highest ever recorded during a January-June period, the CST said. There was no obvious trigger for the increase, said the organisation, which provides security to the UK Jewish community. Two years ago, the war in Gaza led to a big rise in antisemitic incidents in the UK. But the biggest increases this year were recorded in April, May and June, months when antisemitism in the Labour party was the subject of widespread media coverage. Racism and xenophobia were part of the campaign discourse in run-up to the EU referendum on 23 June.
The most common type of incident recorded involved verbal abuse of Jews in public. Other types of antisemitism included graffiti, abuse via social media, threats, damage and desecration of Jewish property and leaflets. There were 41 violent antisemitic assaults among the 557 incidents, a 13% drop on the comparative 2015 period. More than three-quarters of the incidents were recorded in London and Manchester, the two largest Jewish communities in the UK. In London there was a 62% increase in incidents, whereas Manchester there was a 54% fall. Commenting on the figures, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, said: “I condemn the deplorable rise in antisemitic hate incidents in the first half of this year and will continue to work with law enforcement partners and with the Jewish community to ensure their safety and security.” The government provided £13.4m for security measures at Jewish sites, she added.
Andy Burnham, shadow home secretary and campaigning to be Labour’s candidate in the Manchester mayoral election, said the overall increases were worrying but he welcomed the fall in reports of incidents in Manchester. “Labour will always lead the way in tackling any form of hatred or prejudice but we are being hampered in that fight by a small number who are not welcome in our party,” he said. John Mann, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on antisemitism, said all political parties should adopt the recommendations made by Shami Chakrabarti in her report into antisemitism in the Labour party, published in June. “This is a worrying rise in incidents set against a backdrop of increasing hate crime across the country,” he said. “The message should go out to everyone that we will not stand for antisemitism, perpetrators of hate crimes against Jews will be caught and prosecuted and the bystanders must be educated. Britain should expect better than this.” Moshe Kantor, president of the European Jewish Congress, said: “The worrying increase of anitsemitic hate incidents in the UK once again highlights our need to unite throughout Europe to stamp out intolerance. “We have seen time and time again that the UK is not immune from the Europe-wide trend of increased hate and violence against minorities. More must be done by the British leaders to protect their Jewish communities.”"
2016-08-04T07:15:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Key questions to be answered on the London knife attack,"The Scotland Yard investigation into the Russell Square knife attack is expected to look at information held on the suspect by the health service. Based on initial police public statements, it is clear that any mental health records will be of particular and urgent interest. Detectives will also see if the 19-year-old arrested was either known to the domestic security service MI5, or whether his name is associated with any known suspects. His phone and other electronic devices will be a key indicator of interest in extremist material, assuming they can be accessed. This will be crucial in making an early assessment of the suspect’s mindset and the presence or absence of a terrorist motive. Witness testimony The five survivors, when well enough, may have clues as to the reason for the attack. Detectives will want to know what, if anything, their attacker said before striking, as well as the person’s demeanour and whether any of them recognised or knew him.
The Russell Square area is rich with CCTV, and recordings will be seized on, with detectives seeking to piece together the attacker’s arrival in the area, the lead-up to the attack and whether others were involved. Footage that anyone shot on smartphones will also be sought. Police did not appeal for information about anyone else, suggesting they believed there was only one attacker. Terror link Key questions the public and politicians will want answered are what makes the police think terrorism may be a possibility, and whether any extremist connection comes down to mental illness, ideology or a mixture of both. If police, as well as their partners in MI5, decide the attack was driven by extremism, Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command would be expected to lead the investigation. Until then it would remain with the homicide command, supported by counter-terrorism specialists. Mark Rowley – who spoke to the media in the early hours of Thursday after the Russell Square attack – is Britain’s most senior counter-terrorism officer. He serves as an assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan police and leads its specialist operations division, the home of the counter-terrorism command.
One way or another, the attacks in Russell Square represent a gap in Britain’s system of public safety – be it in national security, or in how Britain’s under-resourced and severely strained mental health system looks after those who need it most. Mental health Officials have said there is a crossover between terrorism and mental health problems. On Monday a man was jailed for life for a knife attack at an east London tube station in December 2015. A few hours after the attack police suggested it was probably terrorism. By the time that case came to court they accepted mental illness was more likely to be a significant factor. In the December 2015 attack Muhiddin Mire shouted: “This is for my Syrian brothers. I’m going to spill your blood.” He also attacked or threatened four other travellers. But the victim, the doctor who treated him and a substantial part of Britain’s security establishment said they believed Mire’s violence was a result of his acute mental health problems rather than a political motivation. After further inquiries, Scotland Yard publicly said so – while pointing out that Mire had been inspired by Isis propaganda on his phone, the downloading of which appeared to coincide with his mental health deteriorating. On Monday, despite these assessments, Mire was jailed for life with the judge saying he was motivated by Islamic extremism. About half of all people feared to be at risk of terrorist sympathies may have mental health or psychological problems, a police study has found. The police study of 500 cases dealt with by Channel, an anti-radicalisation scheme, found that 44% of the individuals involved were assessed as being likely to have vulnerabilities related to mental health or psychological difficulties. A further 15% were assessed as possibly having vulnerabilities but more assessment was needed. In May, Ch Const Simon Cole, who is in charge of the Prevent programme, which aims to protect people against radicalisation, told the Guardian: “There would appear to be, from the work we have been doing, a link to people who are vulnerable around mental health.” The knife attack in central London on Wednesday evening came amid heightened fears of a terrorist attack in the UK. Heightened fears On Sunday, Britain’s most senior police officer, the Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said the likelihood of an attack was a matter of when, not if. On Wednesday, he announced that the number of firearms officers in the capital would be increased by 600. UK security officials have watched in alarm as France has suffered repeated attacks and other countries including Germany have been hit. Since August 2014 the UK terrorist threat level has been raised to severe, its second-highest level. The government said the heightened alert was “related to developments in Syria and Iraq, where terrorist groups are planning attacks against the west”. That was a reference to Isis. Terror attacks by Islamic extremists have twice claimed lives on Britain’s streets. The 2005 London attacks by four suicide bombers killed 52 people and left 750 injured, while Lee Rigby was butchered near the Woolwich military barracks in south London in May 2013 by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowlale, who had spent just over £50 buying knives from an Argos store."

2016-08-04T09:26:48Z,uk-news,UK news,'Traumatised' Briton recuperating after fall from Thailand waterfall,"A British backpacker has been left “extremely traumatised” after plunging from a waterfall in Thailand, suffering deep cuts and breaking several major bones before being carried out of the jungle by her fellow tourists. Natalie Cook, 19, was left with a broken pelvis, pubic bone, wrist and foot, and fractured femur after she lost her footing and fell 10 metres on to jagged rocks in the popular Mae Wang national park in May. She also broke several bones in her lower back. The teenager, from Leeds, claims she was given no safety briefing by Gap 360, the travel firm that organised her trip, and says she has issued a claim against it for compensation. Cook was six days into a five-week trip with 24 friends when the accident happened. Her friends had to carry her uphill on a makeshift stretcher, . Some of wthem feared she had died after seeing her fall.
Cook told the Guardian on Wednesday: “If they [the guides on the trip] had said to me: ‘Don’t go in the waterfall, it’s dangerous,’ I wouldn’t have climbed up it but nobody said anything at all. “They need to make sure they’re telling you what’s dangerous because when you’re on holiday you don’t really know, especially when you’re first-time travelling like I was. You don’t expect these things to be dangerous, but they are.” Describing the moments before the accident, Cook said the group found the waterfall and immediately got in to cool off from the searing jungle heat. “As soon as we got there, we threw our backpacks on the floor and climbed in. The water was absolutely freezing,” she said. “I naively didn’t think it would be dangerous, because I’ve never seen one before. “I began following three of the boys on my trip who were beginning to make their way to the right side of the waterfall. Underneath the water were huge, slippery rocks which we painfully managed to get across. We then climbed out and started making our way up the side of the waterfall.” After she reached the summit she started to negotiate the slippery rocks on her way back down. She said: “When I went to climb down my foot just completely slipped and I landed on a big, triangular, pointed rock. We were about five metres away from the edge and I got pushed off by the water.
“It was awful because I didn’t go unconscious at all so I remember everything. It was horrifying. I honestly thought I was going to die. My life flashed before my eyes. It’s true what they say.” Cook said her friends later told her they thought she had died and were scared to rush to help her. “Some of the boys managed to find a piece of wood in the bushes. I managed to get myself on it, with my broken wrist. About 20 of them carried me uphill through the jungle for an hour in the 46-degree heat with no shoes on, to the side of the road where they had a taxi waiting. “They laid me on the wood in the van and drove me to this nearby clinic. It was awful. I was screaming the whole way. With every little rock, everything was crunching and cracking. It was awful.” She said there were three guides accompanying her party of 25, but she does not recall seeing any of them at the waterfall where the accident happened. She said Gap 360, which is based in Kent, had since refunded her the £1,500 cost of the holiday and flights to Thailand, but that she had filed a legal claim for compensation. “They did refund me for the whole holiday and the flights, but I am trying to file a claim against them because there was no safety briefing or anything.” she said. David Stitt, the co-founder and managing director of Gap 360, said a fellow backpacker had asked a local Thai guide about climbing the waterfall moments before the accident and had been told: “You go once, you finish, you die.”Stitt said the guides did not warn the whole group about the waterfall and that they only noticed Cook had climbed up the beauty spot after she had fallen. “Once the UK office heard about the incident it was immediately decided to offer full assistance to Natalie and her family,” he said. “This included arranging and paying for accommodation for the parents and Natalie’s boyfriend, including meals, as well as providing a liaison officer to help them with anything they needed. We did this not because there was any question about whose fault it was, it was simply the right thing to do for Natalie and the family. “Naturally Gap 360 is very sorry that this incident occurred and that Natalie suffered serious injuries. The local guide made it clear when asked that they should not climb the waterfall. It was obvious to anyone there that climbing the waterfall was dangerous and foolhardy.” Cook, who had to give up her job as a waitress because of her injuries, returned home to Garforth just over a month ago after seven weeks in hospitals in Thailand, where she underwent five hours of surgery and a major operation to stop internal bleeding.
Now she says she is “slowly healing, but it’s been a major life change”, leaving her almost housebound and unable to put any weight on her left leg for another four weeks. Three Britons died this year after being swept into a whirlpool in Vietnam. Sisters Beth Anderson, 24, and Isobel Mackensie Squire, 19, died along with their friend Christian Sloan, 25, at the beauty spot in the country’s central highlands in February. They were with a tour guide and had taken part in a common activity of lying in the stream and letting the water move them downwards before reaching an area close to the whirlpool. Moments later, they were swept to their deaths."
2016-08-04T09:56:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Russell Square stabbings: man held on suspicion of murder,"A 19-year-old man is being held on suspicion of murder after a woman was killed and five other people were injured in multiple stabbings in central London. A man was arrested at the scene after police stunned him with a Taser, following the attack, which began at 10.30pm on Wednesday in Russell Square, near the Imperial Hotel and the British Museum.
The suspect is at a south London police station after receiving treatment in hospital. The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said: “Mental health remains a substantial focus for our investigation.” Britain’s most senior counter-terrorism officer, the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, also said early reports suggested that mental health was a factor. Scotland Yard removed references to terrorism in the later updates, saying it was keeping an “open mind” as to the motive. Hotel guests described hearing screaming from the square below, while witnesses to the aftermath saw a body lying on the floor as armed police scrambled to the scene. Other accounts suggested that the attacker had a motorcycle helmet.
Two women and three men suffered “various injuries” in the incident and were receiving treatment in hospital. Three were discharged on Thursday morning. The incident in the popular tourist area came amid warnings about the near-inevitability of a terrorist attack in the UK, following a series of incidents across Europe and the Middle East. One woman described seeing a man near the scene in motorcycle clothing with a helmet on top of his head. Philippa Baglee, who was in London to celebrate her 60th birthday, was walking past Russell Square when she saw a group of people looking down at the ground. “There was someone lying on the ground and lots of people around, and a guy with a black motorcycle helmet balanced on top of his head walking around,” she said.
“He was on the outside of everyone looking on the ground. The moment I saw an ambulance and police car arrive, I thought someone had just been knocked off their bike.” Asked to describe the man, she said he was short and dressed in what she thought was all black leathers. “It was all very calm. No one was panicking,” Baglee said. The investigation into the stabbings, understood to have occurred on the eastern side of the square, was being led by murder detectives on Thursday with the support of counter-terrorism officers.
Hogan-Howe said: “My thoughts are with the family of the woman who was murdered and those who were injured. A normal night out in our busy capital has ended in horrific circumstances. “Our investigation is moving very quickly and our detectives have been working hard throughout the night. As we have already made clear, mental health remains a substantial focus for our investigation.” Hogan-Howe said specialist firearms officers were on the scene in six minutes and detained the subject using only a Taser. “Their swift response undoubtedly helped to prevent more people from getting injured,” he said. “Across our capital today you will see more police officers, armed and unarmed, to reassure the public after recent events overseas. We will protect our capital and those who live, work and visit our city.”
Police received the first call just after 10.30pm and several further calls were made by members of the public between 10.30pm and 11.30pm. Britain’s most senior counter-terrorism officer, the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, said early reports suggested that mental health was a factor. Scotland Yard removed references to terrorism in the most recent updates, saying it was keeping an “open mind” as to the motive. Rowley addressed the media just after 3.30am outside Scotland Yard’s headquarters. “Early indications suggest mental health is a significant factor in this case and that is one major line of inquiry. But of course at this stage we should keep an open mind regarding motive, and consequently terrorism as a motivation remains but one line of inquiry for us to explore,” he said.
Rowley said there would be extra police patrols on London’s streets following the knife attack. These would include armed officers and were intended to reassure the public. The UK’s terrorism threat level remained at severe, meaning an attack was considered to be highly likely. “As a precautionary measure, Londoners will wake up this morning to notice an increased presence on the streets of officers, including armed officers. We would urge the public to remain calm, alert and vigilant,” Rowley said. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, called for the public to remain “calm and vigilant”. The police were doing an incredibly difficult job, the mayor said, adding that the safety of Londoners was his “number one priority”. Khan said his “heart goes out to the victims of the incident in Russell Square and their loved ones” after the death of the woman, who has not been identified but is believed to have been in her 60s.
Officers cordoned off the area overnight and were stopping people entering Bedford Place, just off Russell Square, where the suspect is believed to have been arrested. Forensic officers wearing protective suits examined the scene. Most cordons were lifted on Thursday, with one partial road closure still in place. Witnesses described how armed police flooded the area after the attack and officers established a large cordon to seal off the square, where a forensics tent was later seen. Paul Hutchinson, who witnessed the aftermath, told Sky News: “Russell Square was all taped off by armed police and there was a body on the floor. “There were loads and loads of armed police, lots of police cars with lights on, a couple of ambulances and the body on the floor.”
A caller to BBC Radio London, named Paul, said he had been to the nearby Bloomsbury cinema with his girlfriend when he came across the scene. “We came around the corner and there were armed police everywhere … a massive police presence … and a corpse lying in the street covered in a blanket,” he said. “We went into the bar across the street and the officers came to interview us … We didn’t actually see anything, but some people in the bar saw something.” Additional police were immediately deployed in the area, which is frequented mainly by students and tourists. Along with the British Museum, the University of London and University College London are very close by. There are numerous hotels and restaurants in the area, including Hotel Russell and the Imperial.
Russell Square is a large garden square with a fountain in the middle and a cafe, and is very busy during the day. Russell Square tube station is located just off the square and the area is a main thoroughfare for buses. The garden area is usually locked at night and would have closed at about 8.30pm. It was not clear whether it was still open when the stabbings took place, or whether they took place within the square itself or just outside. A statement from the London ambulance service said: “We sent a number of staff to the scene, including four ambulance crews, a responder in a car, an advanced paramedic and two officers.
“A medical team of a doctor and paramedic from London’s air ambulance also attended by car. Our first staff arrived at the scene within seven minutes. “Sadly, despite extensive treatment, one woman was pronounced dead at the scene. Our staff also treated a further five people who had been injured during the incident, three men and two women, who were all taken to hospital.” Earlier on Wednesday, Scotland Yard had announced the deployment of an extra 600 armed officers in London following the recent terror attacks in France and Germany."
2016-08-04T10:28:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Russell Square attack witness: 'I heard a woman screaming',"Witnesses have described the scenes around the British Museum in London on Wednesday night after one woman was killed and five injured in a mass stabbing. ‘I heard a woman screaming’ The two hotels that overlook the street where the incident occurred, the Imperial and the President, don’t have CCTV cameras that face on to the square, and guests were mostly unaware of the attack until long after it had happened. But Michel Godbout, who was visiting London from Canada and staying at the President, said: “About 10.30pm I was in my room and I heard a woman screaming – a couple of times in one minute, then I didn’t hear anything. I was almost asleep, I heard police after that but didn’t look out the window. My view is blocked by trees. I only found out what happened this morning when I turned on the TV. If I had known I would have gone out to help or something.”
‘I need a hospital. I need a hospital’ Spanish tourists Anna Calderón and Laura Gómez told the Guardian they saw one of the victims, a blonde woman in her 20s or 30s, running northwards up Southampton Row. “We saw a woman with her hand holding her side,” they said. “She was running and shouting: ‘I need a hospital. I need a hospital’. A man who looks like he was in his 60s and a woman stopped a taxi and helped her. “We had just said goodbye to a friend who lives here in London and we saw this. We didn’t understand what was going on because there was no blood. It was about 10.35pm,” said Gómez.
Calderón added: “When we got to the hotel we heard the sound of ambulances. But we didn’t know anything until we saw what had happened this morning on the TV.” The women, from Madrid, said the attack did not deter them from coming to London. “Scared? No, because I think it is an incident that could happen anywhere and we live in Madrid and we had the terrorist attack on the train so we know what the risks are,” said Calderón. ‘He had blood on his hands’ A woman who witnessed the aftermath of the Russell Square stabbings told how she saw a man running away from police, carrying a knife with blood on his hands. Jodie Parry, who was in her hotel room when she heard a “commotion” in the street, told the BBC that the attacker ignored police as they screamed at him to stop running. “He was running down the street he was turning to see if the police were coming close,” Parry said. “I could hear the policeman screaming: ‘Stop, don’t move, don’t go any further, just stay where you are’ and he turned around and continued running. He just wasn’t prepared to stop. He was actually carrying a knife in his hand and he had blood on his hands.” ‘Call someone, call an ambulance’ A cyclist passing the scene moments after the stabbing was stopped by a Spanish family who flagged him down for help. Fernando, 40, said he was riding home through Russell Square when people asked him to stop and call for an ambulance. “Call someone, call an ambulance,” he remembered them shouting. “There were three people stabbed. An older woman was slumping against the gates, and there was another two people. One of the Spanish family was comforting the older woman. I thought they were friends, but then I realised that they were just passing. No one knew each other.” He added that he had not seen the attacker but said the Spanish family told police the man was covering his face as he made sweeping, stabbing motions. “The moment the police arrived, they asked them if the man had been shouting,” Fernando said. “They said that he didn’t say anything. They said that when he stabbed the people he didn’t shout or scream anything.” ‘He was walking up and down the street’ Another guest at the President, Philippa Baglee, who was visiting London for a few days for her 60th birthday, described seeing a man in motorcycle clothing and a helmet near the scene. “The bar of the President comes out on to the square. I just came down for a cigarette and saw there was a man with a motorbike helmet balanced on his head walking up and down, then the police came,” she said. “There was someone lying on the ground and lots of people around and a guy with a black motorcycle helmet balanced on top of his head walking around. He was on the outside of everyone looking on the ground.
“There were about six or seven people standing around. I thought there had been an accident, I had no idea anyone had been stabbed, I found out this morning. I was shocked. We just came to London for a couple of days for my birthday. I didn’t think about anything like this, I’m not a great worrier; on second thoughts, in the future …” ‘There was a body on the ground’ Alex Hall, 18, said he and his friends came out of a restaurant in Russell Square and saw police trying to resuscitate a woman. “We were walking along and we saw three police cars and an ambulance. They were doing CPR on a woman lying on the ground,” he said. “We thought it must have been someone having a heart attack. The police were shouting at people to get back,” said Hall.” Paul Ó Geibheannaigh, 45, a local resident, said he got to Russell Square 45 minutes after the incident. He described the mass police presence that had descended on central London. “The first thing I saw was armed police, I knew there was something wrong,” he said. “I saw a body on the ground, covered, surrounded in dark matter which I presumed was blood. It was really busy and no one knew what was going on, until I went home and checked Twitter. I didn’t know at the time there had been other people injured. “People were standing around talking, no one knew what had happened but there was a body on the street. People were shocked. This is a well-heeled area but there’s nothing you can do about it, if it happens it happens. If someone comes at you in the street with a knife there’s nothing armed police can do about it. You’re in the wrong place at the wrong time.”
Paul Hutchinson, who witnessed the aftermath of the attack, told Sky News: “Russell Square was all taped off by armed police and there was a body on the floor. There were loads and loads of armed police, lots of police cars with lights on, a couple of ambulances and the body on the floor.” Rehana Azam, 42, who was staying in a nearby hotel, told the Telegraph: “I was in my room on the seventh floor when I heard sirens outside. I looked out my window and thought somebody had collapsed and saw a paramedic performing CPR on the person on the ground. “More and more emergency vehicles, including police cars and ambulances, arrived and I saw a number of people being treated. But then it became clear the person being treated for CPR had died as they put a blanket over them. I saw another person, who I think was a male, being taken into an ambulance on a stretcher. It was awful.” ‘There were too many police to count’ Helen Edwards, 33, who lives near Southampton Row, the street where the attack took place, said people in the capital live with the constant threat of terrorism or crime. “I just came out for a walk,” she said. “I arrived maybe an hour afterwards and saw a huge armed police presence, you couldn’t really tell what was going on. I came back later and police weren’t willing to divulge what happened but said we’d hear about it on the news, which is when I realised something big had happened. “There were too many police to count. There was a load of armed police strategically placed guarding the cordon. “I feel mixed, having lived in the local area for a long time I think back to the 7/7 attacks but we don’t really know what this guy’s motives were. By all accounts he sounds very unwell, this may just be a random tragic incident. “It was a long time before I actually knew what had happened, and you can never tell with that kind of police presence if something has happened or there’s been an alert. And living in central London, there’s always something in the back of your mind, you live with the threat of terrorism or crime.”"
2016-08-04T10:30:53Z,uk-news,UK news,What we know so far about the Russell Square stabbings,"An American woman has been killed and five people injured after a man with a knife attacked people in Russell Square, central London. The attack happened at about 10.30pm on Wednesday, near the British Museum. The victims A woman from the US, believed to be in her 60s, died at the scene. She has not been identified. Two other women and three men were being treated for their injuries. They were identified by police as from Britain, Australia, the US and Israel. Two people remain in hospital, while three have been discharged. The suspect A 19-year-old Norwegian-Somali man was arrested at the scene after being Tasered by a police officer. He is in police custody, where investigators have spoken to him. Police confirmed on Thursday morning that he has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Norway’s national criminal investigation service NCIS confirmed on its website that the suspected attacker was a 19-year-old Norwegian citizen registered as having emigrated from Norway in 2002. It added: “NCIS will assist the British police in the normal manner with information and any requests they might have in their investigation. This is a British investigation and it is the British police who decide how they want to proceed with the case and what information they need from the Norwegian police.” The Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, Mark Rowley, said the motive for the attack was not clear. The force initially suggested that terrorism was a possible line of inquiry, but has since dropped specific mention of that as a motivation. On Wednesday evening, Rowley said: Early indications suggest mental health is a significant factor in this case and that is one major line of inquiry. But of course at this stage we should keep an open mind regarding motive, and consequently terrorism as a motivation remains but one line of inquiry for us to explore. In an update on Thursday morning, that was changed to: Early indications suggest that mental health was a factor in this horrific attack. However, we are keeping an open mind regarding the motive. In a further update shortly before midday on Thursday, the police confirmed terrorism was not a motive in the attack, and said the man’s nationality was not a factor. They reiterated that mental health issues remain the primary focus of the investigation. The attack Scotland Yard said police received the first call just after 10.30pm, reporting a man armed with a knife assaulting people at Russell Square. They added that numerous other calls were made by members of the public in the following 30 minutes, all reporting a man attacking people with a knife between Russell Square, Montague Street, Bloomsbury Square and Great Russell Street. Armed officers attended the scene within five minutes of receiving the first call, police said. Homicide officers are leading the investigation, supported by counter-terrorism officers. Witnesses described a man wearing motorbike clothing and a helmet walking up and down the street where the attack took place. Several said they also saw a body on the ground. Police confirmed on Thursday that the attacker launched a “spontaneous” attack that appears ot have targeted random vicitms.
The aftermath There will be an increased police presence, including armed officers, on the streets of London on Thursday, authorities said. The attack came on the day the Met unveiled additional armed officers. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, urged Londoners to “remain calm and vigilant”. In an update on Thursday morning, Rowley said: “As a precautionary measure, Londoners will wake up this morning to notice an increased presence on the streets of officers, including armed officers. We would urge the public to remain calm, alert and vigilant.” The Met commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, vowed to protect the capital: A normal night out in our busy capital has ended in horrific circumstances. My thoughts are with the family of the woman who was murdered and those who were injured. I am proud that our specialist firearms officers were on the scene in six minutes and, using only a Taser, detained the subject. That demonstrates our commitment to use force in a professional and proportionate way. Their swift response undoubtedly helped to prevent more people from getting injured."
2016-08-04T10:54:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May accused of snubbing Scotland over police  spies inquiry,"Theresa May, the prime minister, has come under criticism for excluding the scrutiny of undercover operations in Scotland from a public inquiry. She had set up the public inquiry into the undercover infiltration of hundreds of political groups since 1968, but limited its scope to examining covert operations in England and Wales. In one of her last decisions as home secretary, she resisted calls to extend the public inquiry to look at the conduct of the undercover police in Scotland as well. Her decision has provoked criticism from campaigners and politicians who say that significant abuses by the undercover police will be ignored. Police have said undercover police who monitored political activists in England and Wales collaborated with Scottish police forces. For example, Mark Kennedy, the undercover officer who infiltrated environmental groups for seven years, visited Scotland 14 times during his time as a spy. In December last year, the Scottish government pressed May to extend the inquiry - led by a senior judge, Lord Justice Pitchford - north of the border. The call had been supported by politicians from across the political divide (see here, here and here). Last week Brandon Lewis, the policing minister, had said that “for a number of reasons, it is not possible to expand the geographical scope of the inquiry.”
Explaining May’s decision, he said that amending the inquiry’s remit would “require further consultation and delay the progress of the inquiry”. He added:”In the interests of learning lessons from past failures and improving public confidence, it is important that the inquiry can proceed swiftly and make recommendations as soon as possible.” Lewis set out May’s decision in a letter which can be found here. Individuals who were spied on by the police said the majority of known officers from two undercover units that monitored political groups “were active in Scotland for several decades. To ignore that is to prevent the inquiry from dealing with a significant part of its remit. It sets the inquiry up to fail before it begins.” One of them, Merrick Cork, said:”It’s outrageous that Theresa May thinks victims of police abuse deserve justice in England but not in Scotland. It’s absurd to expect public trust in police when abuses of power are swept under the carpet, and it’s a snub to Scotland to say it doesn’t matter there.” Their statement can be found here, and an analysis of May’s decision by the Campaign Opposing Police Surveillance, the coalition of people who were spied on by the undercover police, here. Neil Findlay, a Labour MSP, told the BBC that ‘the victims of unethical and illegal undercover policing’ in England and Wales would have access to ‘the truth and potentially justice’, while those in Scotland would not. Now the Scottish government is under pressure to set up its own inquiry into the covert operations. For some months, May has been challenged to extend the inquiry to other countries where the British undercover officers are known to have operated. The undercover officers went to at least 16 other countries such as Germany and France during their covert missions, according to this analysis. The analysis, by the Undercover Research Group, a resource on covert infiltration of political groups, lists known overseas operations by a series of undercover officers who have been unmasked. They include the spies who operated under the fake names of Marco Jacobs and Lynn Watson.
In June, following pressure from campaigners such as Left party MP Andrej Hunko, the German government wrote to May calling for Pitchford’s inquiry to be extended to covert operations by British police in Germany. In the past, German police have said Kennedy worked for three German states during at least five visits to the country between 2004 and 2009. According to German police, he committed at least two crimes, but the cases against him were dropped at the behest of German authorities who knew Kennedy’s true identity. Meanwhile police chiefs have said undercover officers from a Metropolitan police undercover unit, the Special Demonstration Squad, operated in Northern Ireland without informing local police. Campaigners - headed by activist Jason Kirkpatrick - have threatened legal action to force the inquiry to be widened to Northern Ireland and Germany. On Wednesday, the BBC reported that the Northern Ireland government has called for the inquiry to be extended. The inquiry is due to start hearing evidence next year, according to an update of its work. In these blogs here and here, the Campaign Opposing Police Surveillance has criticised the “geographic blinkers” imposed on the inquiry."
2016-08-04T12:42:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Woman killed in Russell Square attack was American citizen,"A Norwegian national of Somali origin has been arrested on suspicion of murdering an American woman and injuring five others, including Britons, in what was described by police as a “spontaneous attack”. Speaking outside Scotland Yard headquarters, Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said there was no evidence that the 19-year-old suspect had been radicalised or was motivated by terrorism and reasserted the view that “mental health issues” played a significant role. The suspect emigrated from Norway to the UK in 2002, at the age of five, according to the Norwegian Embassy. “While the investigation is not yet complete, all of the work we have done so far increasingly points to this tragic incident as having been triggered by mental health issues,” Rowley said. “Indeed at this time we believe it was a spontaneous attack and the victims were selected at random.”
Rowley said officers had interviewed the suspect and his family, had searched addresses and had liaised with security services. The murdered woman was an American national, Rowley said. Those injured were Australian, American, Israeli and British. Two remain in hospital but are not in a life-threatening condition. “This morning we’ve searched addresses in north London and we will search another in south London. I emphasise that so far we’ve found no evidence of radicalisation that would suggest the man in our custody is in any way motivated by terrorism.” The man was arrested at the scene after police stunned him with a Taser following the attack, which began at 10.30pm on Wednesday in Russell Square, near the Imperial Hotel and the British Museum. The suspect was taken to a south London police station after receiving treatment in hospital.
Rowley said terrorism was an initial line of inquiry because, in the “current climate of threat” and with recent events across Europe, all possibilities should be considered. Hotel guests described hearing screaming from the square below, while witnesses to the aftermath saw a body lying on the floor as armed police scrambled to the scene. Ellie Cattle, 21, who is staying in a hotel on Bedford Place, off Russell Square, said: “I looked out of my window because I heard sirens. I could see police – three police vans – coming down the road, and all I heard was them shouting, ‘put it down, put it down’.” Spanish tourists Anna Calderón and Laura Gómez said they saw one of the victims, a blonde woman in her 20s or 30s, running northwards up Southampton Row. Gómez said: “We saw a woman with her hand holding her side. She was running and shouting, ‘I need a hospital. I need a hospital.’ A man who looked like he was in his 60s and a woman stopped a taxi and helped her.” The incident in the popular tourist area came amid warnings about the high likelihood of a terrorist attack in the UK, following a series of incidents across Europe and the Middle East. The investigation into the stabbings, understood to have occurred on the eastern side of the square, was being led by murder detectives on Thursday with the support of counter-terrorism officers.
The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said: “My thoughts are with the family of the woman who was murdered and those who were injured. A normal night out in our busy capital has ended in horrific circumstances. Our investigation is moving very quickly and our detectives have been working hard throughout the night. As we have already made clear, mental health remains a substantial focus for our investigation.” Officers cordoned off the area overnight and were stopping people entering Bedford Place, just off Russell Square, where the suspect is believed to have been arrested. Forensic officers wearing protective suits examined the scene. Most cordons were lifted on Thursday, with one partial road closure still in place. Witnesses described how armed police flooded the area after the attack and officers established a large cordon to seal off the square, where a forensics tent was later seen. Additional police were immediately deployed in the area, which is popular with students and tourists. Along with the British Museum, the University of London and University College London are very close by. There are numerous hotels and restaurants in the area, including Hotel Russell and the Imperial. Russell Square is a large garden square with a central fountain and a cafe, and is very busy during the day. Russell Square tube station is located just off the square and the area is a main thoroughfare for buses. The garden area is usually locked at night and would have closed at about 8.30pm. It was not clear whether it was still open when the stabbings took place, or whether they took place within the square itself or just outside. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, called for the public to remain calm and vigilant. The police were doing an incredibly difficult job, the mayor said, adding that the safety of Londoners was his “number one priority”."
2016-08-04T13:29:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Church of England clergyman found guilty of historical sex offences,"A senior Church of England clergyman has been found guilty of sex offences committed against two young men in the 1970s and 80s amid claims of a church cover-up. A jury at Durham crown court found George Granville Gibson, 80, the former archdeacon of Auckland, guilty of two counts of indecent assault against two men, then aged 18 and 26. He was found not guilty of buggery and four other charges of indecent assault. Two charges of indecent assault were dropped. The court was told that the former bishop of Durham, John Habgood, had been told about Gibson’s inappropriate behaviour, which occurred when he was a vicar at St Clare’s Church in Newton Aycliffe. A former clergyman told the court he “got the push” from the church after raising concerns about Gibson. Gibson was found guilty of indecently assaulting that man. One of those giving evidence against Gibson accused the C of E of a “massive cover-up”. He said: “I didn’t make a complaint because no one would believe me, no one would believe that a man of the cloth would do that. I thought and still think no one would believe me. He was a vicar.” The prosecution had set out a case of the senior clergyman’s “systematic, deliberate” abuse of vulnerable men. Gibson admitted in court to having had homosexual urges, but said he had only ever been sexually attracted to men, not young boys. In 1993, Gibson was promoted to archdeacon of Auckland, effectively number two to the bishop of Durham. Responding to the verdict, Paul Butler, the present bishop of Durham and until recently the C of E’s lead bishop on safeguarding, said: “We offer an unreserved apology to all the survivors and those affected by this news. We commend the bravery of those who brought these allegations forward, acknowledging how difficult and distressing this would have been. “ We are profoundly sorry for the abuse perpetrated by Mr Gibson and remain committed to doing everything possible to ensure the wellbeing of children, young people and adults, who look to us for respect and care. Abuse is a terrible crime and a grievous breach of trust, which has lifelong effects.” Butler said he had ordered an independent review of the circumstances surrounding the case. Gibson was released on bail to be sentenced at a later date."
2016-08-04T13:51:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Armed police patrol central London after 'random' knife attack,"Police officers patrolled central London in greater numbers than usual on Thursday, in an effort to reassure tourists and shoppers after the multiple stabbing in Bloomsbury. Patrols included firearms officers, although few walked the streets openly; most visible officers carried batons and CS sprays in their belts. Two armed officers posted outside the National Portrait Gallery on Trafalgar Square during morning rush hour said there would be many armed police around central London throughout the day. Policing would focus on crowded areas where an attacker could do the most damage, one said.
They carried semi-automatic carbines over their chests; in their belts were holstered Glock pistols, Taser stun guns, CS spray and batons. “We deal with everything from having strong words with someone to lethal force,” one said. Around the British Museum in Bloomsbury, near the scene of Wednesday night’s attack, patrols could be seen on almost every street, as well as in the courtyard in front of the museum. Two officers who spoke to the Guardian said it was their usual beat and they were not aware of any armed officers nearby. Police were also stationed near most tube stations and at major rail terminals throughout the city centre, although officers remained discreet on the concourses. Four police vans, each full of officers, were parked outside Marylebone station. One officer said: “It’s because of what happened last night. We’re not expecting anything bad to happen. These are literally just reassurance patrols.” Asked if they were waiting to go out on patrol or whether they were just going to sit in the van, he answered: “Just waiting for now.”
Earlier, the Met assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, the UK’s most senior counter-terrorism officer, urged the public to remain calm, alert and vigilant. He said: “This attack will of course still cause concern and as a precautionary measure we have increased the number of officers out on the streets today and that will continue for as long as necessary.” Although police said later the Russell Square incident did not appear to be linked to terrorism, Rowley paid tribute to the officers who attended at the scene: “Our firearms officers bravely rushed to that scene with very little information. They would not have known if this was an act of terrorism or the random attack we now know it to be. “They detained an armed and dangerous man and resolved it using the minimum necessary force – no shots were fired. We should be proud of them and the British tradition of using the minimum necessary force.” He added: “I want everyone who is out and about in London today – our residents, businesses or visitors – to know that the Met is totally committed to doing everything we can do to protect you.”"
2016-08-04T14:01:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Australian family fighting deportation get flurry of job offers,"The Australian family ordered to leave the UK after failing to find the right job are pursuing at least two potential leads after a flurry of employment offers. Gregg and Kathryn Brain, from Brisbane, say they have had a flood of enquiries and offers after the Home Office told them late on Tuesday it had begun the deportation process because they had failed to meet strict work visa criteria. Gregg Brain said on Thursday that many of the offers, such as bar work in a nearby pub, would never meet the criteria, but two were strong enough to give them hope. He said the firmest lead so far was from a major Scottish company. He said the couple and their seven-year-old son Lachlan were now living on charity and help from friends. They hope the Home Office will suspend the deportation process if a firm offer meets the tier-two visa requirements. The job would need to pay at least £20,400 and involve a graduate level post for Kathryn, who obtained a degree in Scottish history from the University of the Highlands and Islands last year. The Brains are based in Dingwall in the Scottish Highlands, further reducing their options. “As of this morning, there have been about 15 or 20 job offers we’ve received since Monday,” he said. “These are wonderful and we really appreciate that people are willing to throw these at us.” He said, however, that the family were still very anxious to hear from other potential employers. Ian Blackford, their MP, said that UK immigration minister Robert Goodwill had indicated to the Scottish external affairs minister Fiona Hyslop that the Home Office would “stop the clock” if a compliant application was made. Blackford, the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber, said a prospective employer for Kathryn Brain would also need to register with the Home Office as a tier-two sponsor and was likely to need expert legal advice on the process. “We have to wait and see whether they do actually turn into job offers,” Blackford said. “All the media over the last 24 hours has resulted in a number of people coming forward, which is great, but I want to be a wee bit cautious because it’s about satisfying the criteria for a tier two, so there’s a process to go through. “It has to be a graduate level job. In rural parts of the Highlands, these things aren’t massively common.” The Brains arrived in Dingwall in June 2011 on a post-study work visa linked to Kathryn’s degree course, which would have allowed her two years to find a full-time job in the UK after graduating. That visa was granted in 2010. The Brains insist they did not discover until 2012 that the scheme had been scrapped, and accuse ministers of acting unfairly by effectively making it retrospective. The Home Office said it had announced it was to scrap the visa system in question in March 2011, three months before the Brains emigrated, and that ministers had indicated they planned to do so in December 2010 because too many applicants were abusing it. Blackford said he believed the Home Office was keen to see the case, which has attracted widespread support including from Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, resolved without further controversy. “The Home Office would prefer this problem to go away,” he said. Goodwill told the Brains on Tuesday that officials from the family returns unit of the Home Office’s immigration enforcement department would contact them this week to organise a voluntary departure to Australia. The letter did not fix a deadline by which the family had to leave, but Goodwill said the Brains had had significant time to find work since Kathryn degree course ended. They had been given two extensions to the grace period and there were no exceptional reasons which justified a third extension, nor was there any breach of faith by the Home Office. Goodwill added: “Although the family have said they were unaware of the announcement until 2012, they have still had a number of years in which to search and apply for jobs which would qualify under tier two.” The visa given to the Brains “never conferred a longterm right to stay in the UK”, he said."
2016-08-04T14:15:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Son of Scottish aristocrat charged with trafficking 100kg of cocaine in Kenya,"The son of a Scottish aristocrat has been charged in Kenya with trafficking nearly 100kg of cocaine in one of the country’s biggest drugs seizures in recent years. Jack Marrian, 30, who attended a prestigious Kenyan school with the British cyclist Chris Froome and whose mother is Emma Clare Campbell of Cawdor, denied the charge during a court appearance in Nairobi on Thursday. The haul was found by Kenyan police and US Drug Enforcement Agency officials in containers that had arrived from Brazil at the main Kenyan seaport last week. The class A drugs were allegedly shipped around the world in containers labelled as carrying sugar destined for Uganda. Marrian was born into the famous line of Scottish nobility known as the Clan Campbell of Cawdor.
It is understood a Kenyan national, Roy Francis Mwanthi, has also been charged with trafficking cocaine. A third suspect, also Kenyan, had been questioned earlier by police but it was not clear on Thursday evening whether he had been charged with a crime. The prosecution says documents found on the ship that was used to transport the cargo detailed Marrian as a director of Mshale Uganda Limited, the firm which was to receive the containers. Police had released Marrian and his co-accused on Monday due to a requirement in Kenyan law that suspects to be charged within 24 hours of their arrest. The prosecution was initially not ready to press charges but the suspects were re-arrested on Wednesday and charged on Thursday. Police say both Marrian and Mwanthi, a director of Inland Africa Logistics Limited, had placed calls to the people processing the cargo at the port before it was impounded. Marrian and Mwanthi deny the charges. On his LinkedIn profile, Marrian describes himself as the head of sugar trading in south-east Africa at ED&F Sugar, a merchant that ships sugar, molasses and coffee around the world. His profile also says he is the managing director of Mshale Commodities, the Kenyan importer which the prosecution alleges was due to receive the shipment containing the cocaine. A spokeswoman for Mshale Commodities said: “Mshale is aware of speculation regarding an allegedly compromised shipment consigned to Mshale Commodities. We can confirm that Mshale’s managing director, Jack Marrian, is assisting the Kenyan authorities to provide them with whatever information they require. “Mshale operates stringent procedures to protect the integrity of its supply chain. Until these investigations are concluded, we are unable to comment further.” Growing up in an affluent part of Nairobi, Marrian went to the one of Kenya’s foremost international schools at the same time as three-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome. Crista Cullen, the English hockey player, was also at the Banda school at this time. It is understood that Marrian then studied at the elite Marlborough college, where the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Eugenie were students, before going on to the University of Bristol. In a one-word Facebook status posted on Monday, sent from the Spring Valley area of Nairobi, Marrian wrote “released”. The status has been responded to more than 30 times by friends on the social networking site but he has not updated his account since. Marrian’s aunt, Elizabeth Campbell, told the Guardian “he’s innocent, that’s all I can say”. She declined to comment further. A National Crime Agency spokesman said: “We are aware of the seizure and the subsequent arrest of a UK national, and have assisted our Kenyan and US law enforcement partners. However, this is now a matter for the Kenyan authorities so it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.” The maximum penalty for drug trafficking in Kenya is a life sentence and a fine of more than $10,000 (£7,600). The seizure was a rare one in Kenya, which has become a cocaine distribution hub in recent years, according to the UN and the US. Traffickers from South America are said to take advantage of Nairobi’s extensive air links to Europe and Asia. They also exploit Kenya’s Indian Ocean coastline and lack of adequate security controls at the port of Mombasa, the US Department of State’s 2016 narcotics control strategy report said. Stemming the flow of drugs is a challenge for Kenyan authorities, the report said, citing “corruption within the Kenyan government and business community ... High-level prosecutions or large seizures remain infrequent”. For more than a decade, police in Kenya have been named as the most corrupt institution in the country by the local body of global anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International."
2016-08-04T17:06:55Z,uk-news,UK news,London stabbing: suspect is Norwegian Somali with 'no evidence' of terror – as it happened,"The Israeli woman injured in the Russell Square stabbings is an 18-year-old from Tel Aviv on a pre-enlistment trip to London, according to an Israeli news report. Yuval Labkovsky was returning to her hotel with her grandfather, after eating in a Thai restaurant, when she was set upon. Labkovsky was lightly injured in her hand during the stabbing attack and released after treatment in hospital. According to a report on the Hebrew version of the Ynet news website Labkovsky described witnessing the attack and then being injured herself. “On the way back from the hotel, I heard screams and saw two men running toward me,” she told the site. I was afraid that it was a terror attack and was sure the two men were running away from the incident. “I approached the first and felt a pain in my hand. I thought I was just hit, but it turned out he was the stabber. The second man, who was chasing him, was the man who tried, and later succeeded, in catching him. “I saw a woman lying on the floor, covered in blood. Her husband supported her. Suddenly I realized I was also bleeding,” she added. “I’m not afraid in Israel, so I have no reason to start being afraid in London,” she says."
2016-08-04T17:09:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Retired vicar loses case over non-payment of Haringey council tax,"An anti-poverty campaigner in London has lost his case against Haringey council for non-payment of council tax since 2013. Paul Nicolson, a retired vicar, has claimed that millions of poorer people could be getting unfair bills for costs run up by local authority officials who take legal action against them for non-payment of council tax. Tottenham magistrates court, however, ruled on Thursday that he must pay the £2,831.42 he owes the council. In an emailed statement, Nicolson challenged the court to jail him. “I am refusing to pay £2,831.42 council tax because of the damage the tax is doing to the health of very badly off residents of Haringey some of whom have had their income stopped by a benefit sanction,” he wrote.
“Meanwhile Haringey council continues to tax the benefit incomes of its poorest residents, adding court costs, sending in the bailiffs, ignoring mental and physical ill health, the short life span, the low birth weight, food and fuel poverty, in some of the most deprived wards in the UK … I will stop protesting when Haringey stops taxing benefit incomes.” He also criticised the magistrates court for rubber-stamping “over 60,000 council tax liability orders … against Haringey residents over the past three years … adding to the mental health risks unmanageable debt damaging in the deprived wards on the court’s doorstep”. Nicolson, 84, of Tottenham, north London, had costs of £47,000 awarded against him last month after he lost a high court case against the London borough over the level of court charges imposed on residents for non-payment of council tax. He began litigation after complaining that magistrates ruling on allegations of council tax non-payment were failing to check the accuracy of costs said to have been accumulated by the Labour-controlled council. He refused to pay a council tax bill as a matter of principle. He said he was issued with a summons for non-payment of council tax by Haringey council. Magistrates in Tottenham took up a liability order against him and ordered him to pay £125 costs. Nicolson complained that costs were being wrongly “lumped on” to legal bills and were a penalty unfairly imposed on the poor. He also claimed the problem could be widespread. Nicolson was the vicar of Turville, Buckinghamshire, before retiring 16 years ago. The village was used as the setting for BBC television comedy The Vicar of Dibley. He said the case had nationwide implications because magistrates granted about 3 million liability orders every year to councils in England and Wales."
2016-08-04T19:19:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Corbyn's offer of peerage to Shami Chakrabarti causes Labour tensions,"Labour’s decision to nominate Shami Chakrabarti, the human rights and civil liberties campaigner, for a peerage has caused tensions at the top of the party. Jeremy Corbyn put Chakrabarti forward for a peerage, saying she shared his ambition for reform of the House of Lords and praised her career of public service. She has recently completed an inquiry into antisemitism for the party. However, a number of Labour MPs criticised the party leader’s decision to nominate her, given the row over cronyism engulfing David Cameron and No 10. Wes Streeting, Labour MP for Ilford North, said: “With just one Lords appointment, Corbyn has undermined criticism of Cameron’s list and the remaining credibility of his antisemitism inquiry.” Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, is understood not to have been consulted about the choice and believes the party should be boycotting the whole system. The Board of Deputies of British Jews, the leading group representing the Jewish community, also criticised the decision, as it was not happy with the antisemitism report. Marie van der Zyl, its vice-president, said: “It is beyond disappointing that Shami Chakrabarti has been offered, and accepted, a peerage from Labour following her so-called ‘independent’ inquiry. “The report, which was weak in several areas, now seems to have been rewarded with an honour. This ‘whitewash for peerages’ is a scandal that surely raises serious questions about the integrity of Ms Chakrabarti, her inquiry and the Labour leadership.” Others criticised Corbyn for deciding to nominate a peer after having said last year that he saw no reason to recommend any when the system needed reform. However, it is understood he has since felt the need to keep up the party’s numbers in the Lords as much as possible, especially since Cameron has nominated 13 peers.
Asked about the criticism, a Corbyn spokesperson said in a statement: “Shami Chakrabarti shares Jeremy’s ambition for reform of the House of Lords. Her career has been one of public service and human rights advocacy. “Her legal and campaigning skills, and the trust that she has gained from many ordinary Britons, will be a considerable asset to the House of Lords. Brexit will put many hard-fought rights at risk, so it is crucial that those equipped with the right skills are given the opportunity to hold this government to account.” Chakrabarti said: “I am honoured to accept Jeremy Corbyn’s challenge and the opportunity to help hold the government to account. This is a dangerous moment for our country and we share vital human rights values that need defending more than ever before in my lifetime.” Chakrabarti, former director of the rights group Liberty, was awarded a CBE in 2007, chosen to be one of eight Olympic flag bearers at the London Games of 2012 and served on the Leveson inquiry into the British press and phone hacking. She is the chancellor of the University of Essex, was previously chancellor of Oxford Brookes University and holds honorary professorships in the law departments of Manchester University and the London School of Economics."

But the world remained oblivious to the multiple stabbings for almost three hours. There was no media blackout requested by police, but for the first time possibly in the history of Twitter, the horror remained undocumented until the small hours. The first many knew of any attack was a police statement at 1.19am when Reuters reported: “One dead, up to six injured in knife incident in Russell Square, central London.” The absence of social media meant most of London went to sleep oblivious to the horrors that had struck."
2016-08-04T19:52:57Z,uk-news,UK news,London knife attack: victim named as Darlene Horton,"An American woman was killed and five other people injured when a teenager, who police believe was mentally ill, carried out a knife attack in central London on Wednesday, selecting his victims at random in a late-night assault. A 19-year-old Norwegian national of Somali origin, who has lived in the UK since 2002, was arrested on suspicion of murder at the scene in Russell Square, moments from the British Museum. The dead woman was named by the Metropolitan police on Thursday night as Darlene Horton, 64. She was the wife of a university professor from Florida who was reportedly hours away from flying home. Florida State University said psychology scholar Richard Wagner was teaching summer classes in London, and his wife had accompanied him to the capital. USA Today said the couple had planned to return to Tallahassee on Thursday. In a sign of the nervousness about the likelihood of a extremist attack on Britain, Scotland Yard initially said they were considering terrorism as a motive but later rowed back on this suggestion as the mental health history of the suspect emerged. Speaking outside Scotland Yard’s headquarters, a Met assistant commissioner, Mark Rowley, said there was no evidence that the suspect had been radicalised or was motivated by terrorism. “While the investigation is not yet complete, all of the work we have done so far increasingly points to this tragic incident as having been triggered by mental health issues,” Rowley said. “Indeed at this time we believe it was a spontaneous attack and the victims were selected at random.”
The Guardian understands the suspect was known to mental health services. It is believed the alleged attacker did not shout words associated with terrorism nor was material found at his address or on electronic devices pointing towards an interest in violent extremism. He was named by Sky News as Zakaria Bulhan from south London. In a tribute to the victim, Florida State University’s (FSU) president, John Thrasher, said: “There are no words to express our heartache over this terrible tragedy. We are shocked that such senseless violence has touched our own FSU family and we will do all we can to assist Prof Wagner and his loved ones as well as his friends and colleagues in the psychology department, as they mourn.” The stabbings – yards from the scene of the 7 July London bus bombing in 2005 – came amid warnings about the likelihood of a terrorist attack in the UK, following a series of incidents across Europe and the Middle East. But Rowley said officers had interviewed the suspect and his family, had searched addresses in north and south London and had liaised with security services. He said: “I emphasise that so far we’ve found no evidence of radicalisation that would suggest the man in our custody is in any way motivated by terrorism.” Among the five injured were Australian, American, Israeli and British nationals. Only the British male remained in hospital on Thursday, where he was said to be in a serious but stable condition. The others were released from hospital after being treated for their injuries. The suspect was taken to a south London police station after receiving hospital treatment. A postmortem is due to be carried out on Horton on Friday.
The 19-year-old was arrested at the scene after police stunned him with a Taser following the attack, which began at 10.30pm near the Imperial Hotel. Rowley said terrorism was an initial line of inquiry because in the “current climate of threat” and with recent events across Europe, all possibilities should be considered. Hotel guests described hearing screaming from the square below, while witnesses to the aftermath saw a body lying on the ground as armed police scrambled to the scene on Wednesday night six minutes after the first 999 call was received. Ambulances arrived seven minutes after the first call. Ellie Cattle, 21, who is staying in a hotel on Bedford Place, off Russell Square, said: “I looked out of my window because I heard sirens. I could see police – three police vans – coming down the road and all I heard was them shouting ‘put it down, put it down’.” Spanish tourists Anna Calderón and Laura Gómez said they saw one of the victims, a blonde woman in her 20s or 30s, running north up Southampton Row. Gómez said: “We saw a woman with her hand holding her side. She was running and shouting, ‘I need a hospital. I need a hospital.’ A man who looked like he was in his 60s and a woman stopped a taxi and helped her.” The investigation into the stabbings, understood to have occurred on the eastern side of the square, was being led by murder detectives on Thursday with the support of counter-terrorism officers. The Met’s commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said: “My thoughts are with the family of the woman who was murdered and those who were injured. A normal night out in our busy capital has ended in horrific circumstances. Our investigation is moving very quickly and our detectives have been working hard throughout the night. As we have already made clear, mental health remains a substantial focus for our investigation.” The incident came a day after Hogan-Howe said an undisclosed number of the force’s planned additional 600 armed officers were now fully trained and ready for deployment. David Cameron, the former prime minister, announced in April that police in England and Wales would train extra firearms officers after a review of armed policing, which was commissioned after the terrorist attacks in Paris in November, when 130 people were killed. Officers cordoned off the area overnight and were stopping people entering Bedford Place, just off Russell Square, where the suspect is believed to have been arrested. Forensic officers wearing protective suits examined the scene. Most cordons were lifted on Thursday, with one partial road closure still in place. Witnesses described how armed police arrived in large numbers after the attack and officers established a large cordon to seal off the square, where a forensics tent was later seen. Additional police were immediately deployed in the area, which is popular with students and tourists. The British Museum, the University of London and University College London are very close by. There are numerous hotels and restaurants in the area, including Hotel Russell and the Imperial. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, called for the public to remain calm and vigilant. The police were doing an incredibly difficult job, the mayor said, adding that the safety of Londoners was his “number one priority”."
2016-08-04T22:52:49Z,uk-news,UK news,London knife attack: victim tried to warn others as she lay dying,"The American woman who was one of the six victims of a 19-year-old attacker in London died while being cradled in the lap of a Spanish tourist who had tried to save her – shouting to a passing cyclist: “Call someone, call an ambulance.”
Darlene Horton, an American woman in her 60s, died after being stabbed in what police described as a “spontaneous attack”, with the victims selected at random. The teenage attacker, a Somali who came to Britain from Norway aged five, was arrested on suspicion of murder after being Tasered fleeing from the scene near Russell Square in Bloomsbury, central London shortly after 10.30pm when he went on the rampage. Scotland Yard said no evidence has been found of radicalisation or anything to suggest the man in custody was “in any way motivated by terrorism”. Eyewitnesses told how the attacker lashed out against victims in a sweeping motion. One witness said the woman who died tried to warn others their lives could also be in danger. “I was just trying to console her,” one of those who tried to help the woman said. “She said something about: ‘He’s still here, he’s still here’ – after that she was not lucid. That’s when I saw someone. He was meandering about. He was very disturbed.” Fernando, a Brazilian cyclist who came to her aid, said a family of four Spanish tourists were screaming for help. “They were shouting: ‘Call someone, call an ambulance.’ One of the Spanish family was comforting the older woman. I thought they were friends, but then I realised that they were just passing. No one knew each other.” He said the man had carried out the attack in silence. “He did not shout anything,” he said. “The moment the police arrived, they asked them if the man had been shouting. They said that he didn’t say anything. They said that when he stabbed the people he didn’t shout or scream anything.” Israeli victim Yuval Labkovsky, 18 – who had been out for dinner with her grandfather, told how she approached the attacker as he was fleeing. She mistook him for a victim and ended up being stabbed herself. “I was sure that the two men fleeing from the event were victims,” she said. “I went to help the first one of the men and felt pain in my hand. “I thought I just got hit, but it turned out he was stabbing me. The other man chasing him was trying to stop him, and in the end managed to catch him,” she told Y Net, an Israeli media outlet, adding: “Suddenly I discovered that I was bleeding. I looked and saw that the attacker stabbed me in the hand as I was running. Eyewitnesses said armed police were on the scene within minutes and had sealed off the area to help the wounded. “[Medics] tried to revive the woman covered in blood, but she had lost a lot of blood and within minutes she was dead,” said Labkovksy. The attacker ran off in the direction of Bloomsbury Square while another man gave chase, one witness said. Jodie Parry, who was in her hotel room when she heard a “commotion” in the street, told the BBC that the attacker ignored police as they screamed at him to stop running. “He was running down the street,” she said. “He was turning to see if the police were coming close. “I could hear the policeman screaming: ‘Stop, don’t move, don’t go any further, just stay where you are,’ and he turned around and continued running. He just wasn’t prepared to stop. He was actually carrying a knife in his hand and he had blood on his hands.” He collapsed after being Tasered to the ground and searched by a team of eight officers. The horror unfolded 14 hours after Metropolitan police had unveiled the first in a squad of 600 armed officers they plan deploy across the capital to protect it against attacks. Paul Ó Geibheannaigh, 45, a local resident, said he got to Russell Square 45 minutes after the incident after a night out at the cinema.
The atmosphere was “intense”, with “20 or 30 police vans” but, unusually there was nothing on social media when he got home. “It was really busy and no one knew what was going on, until I went home and checked Twitter,” he said. “I didn’t know at the time there had been other people injured. “People were standing around talking, no one knew what had happened but there was a body on the street. People were shocked. This is a well-heeled area but there’s nothing you can do about it, if it happens it happens. If someone comes at you in the street with a knife there’s nothing armed police can do about it. You’re in the wrong place at the wrong time.” Russell Square is also one of London’s prime tourist spots with thousands of hotel rooms for under £100 a night and was teeming with tourists in the summer peak season. The area remains haunted by the bus bombing of the 7/7 terrorist attack in 2005, which took place only metres away from the scene of Wednesday’s stabbing. Less than 12 hours after the attack, there was little sign of any disturbance apart from intense media presence and a handful of flowers where the woman had died. At 9am the police forensics team had left, their tent was dismantled and the pavement cleaned by a team who hosed down the street. “I feel mixed, having lived in the local area for a long time I think back to the 7/7 attacks but we don’t really know what this guy’s motives were,” said local resident Helen Edwards. “Living in central London, there’s always something in the back of your mind, you live with the threat of terrorism or crime.” London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, called for vigilance. “The safety of all Londoners is my number one priority and my heart goes out to the victims of the incident in Russell Square and their loved ones,” he said. American-born local resident Cynthia Petrow, 60, who lives in Russell Square, was close to tears when walking her dog in the square on Thursday morning. “This is my neighbourhood park,” she said. “I am out walking now and the thing that makes me saddest is that some woman is dead, but at least it was one person with a knife and not, where I am from, someone with an AK47. I am very sad about it. “My husband is a survivor of 9/11, so I take great joy in the very very boring things. I am going to keep doing my life otherwise …” This article was amended on 4 August 2016 to correct the day Cynthia Petrow was in Russell Square as Thursday, not Wednesday."
2016-08-05T06:00:54Z,uk-news,UK news,Thames garden bridge delays raise risk of major boat collision – expert,"Delays to construction work on London’s proposed garden bridge risk causing a major collision on the Thames on the scale of the 1989 Marchioness disaster, a leading marine civil engineer has warned. Construction of the controversial 367-metre tree and plant-lined bridge designed by Thomas Heatherwick had been due to start this summer, but a series of hiccups with the project have put the schedule back to autumn at the earliest.
The government’s Marine Management Organisation (MMO) has now granted the Garden Bridge Trust, which is behind the project, a construction licence. As part of a consultation process, however, the head of a leading marine engineering company wrote to say that delays mean the bridge will now coincide with other big projects involving large amounts of barge construction traffic on the Thames, the Architects Journal reported. The publication obtained the letter, from Tim Beckett, the co-founder of leading marine civil engineering consultancy Beckett Rankine, under freedom of information laws. It warns of a “hazardous juxtaposition of construction activities” between the bridge and projects including the construction of London’s so-called super sewer, the £4.2bn Thames Tideway Tunnel, or TTT, which will take away huge amounts of waste down the river.
Beckett’s letter noted that a previous risk assessment in 2014 had found that the area between Temple and South Bank where the bridge will sit, known as King’s Reach, had seen “significantly more vessel collisions and contacts than any other part of the river”. He wrote: “The TTT will involve a tripling of large freight movements on King’s Reach while the Northern line extension and Fulham football ground works are due to add even more heavy freight movements. Meanwhile passenger boat movements are at a record level and still rising. “During this unprecedented level of river traffic Blackfriars [Bridge] No 2 arch will be closed for the TTT works, further increasing navigational risk in King’s Reach. ‘To then add the two Garden Bridge cofferdams on top of all these other increased risks would, I believe, be an unnecessary and reckless risk. The likelihood of a major collision between a passenger vessel and a large freight vessel, such as happened 27 years ago with the Marchioness and Bowbelle, is simply too great.” Fifty-one people drowned in 1989, when the Bowbelle, a dredger, struck the Marchioness, a pleasure cruiser hosting a party, at night.
Beckett recommended in his letter that the garden bridge works be pushed back to reduce such risks. Separately, the head of the Thames Clippers commuter boat service said he did not feel there was a safety risk, but the volume of river traffic could affect his company’s services. Sean Collins told the Architects Journal: “Given the clash of construction events within the area this is likely to seriously impact on the punctuality and reliability of our service and hope that this can be resolved through constructive consultation.” In granting the construction licence, the MMO said the risks were acceptable if mitigation measures were in place, and that the Port of London Authority had no objections to the bridge on safety grounds. A Garden Bridge Trust spokeswoman said: “We have been in extensive dialogue with the TTT to ensure that our respective works are fully integrated with no construction clashes.”"
2016-08-05T10:48:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Is Britain doomed? How newspapers reacted to the interest rate cut,"Will the Bank of England’s cut in interest rates to an historic low of 0.25% prevent a post-Brexit recession? Is the bank’s governor, Mark Carney, a shrewd operator? Is Britain’s economy doomed? Let’s seek some answers in Friday’s national newspapers, beginning with the paper that should know: the Financial Times. If I read its leading article correctly, its replies to the three questions above run as follows: perhaps, maybe and possibly. Or, to borrow Chou En Lai’s famous quote: “it’s too early to tell.” The FT argues that Carney “has done his best” by adding to the rate cut by resuming another round of quantitative easing, a “correct” decision. But he has done so in the expectation of “higher unemployment, falls in house prices and household incomes, and a spike in inflation”, making it “highly likely that further stimulus will be needed.” For the pro-EU paper, the situation is further proof that “Brexit represents a huge supply-side shock that will suppress investment for years.” Carney has done what he can. Now the ball is int the government’s court: it must “deliver a well-targeted fiscal boost.” The Guardian, which also favoured remain, nods in agreement: the Bank of England “is at the limit of its effective policy reach” and “has bought the government some time.” So it is up to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to show what he can do. While warm about the call by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, for a cut in VAT, the paper believes “the money would be better invested in infrastructure.” It continues: “Better still might be to treat investment in human capital as another aspect of infrastructure spending... Improving Britain’s skills base by investing in the cash-strapped further education sector; picking up the bill for apprenticeships and vocational training... supporting technical training at schools... maybe even reconsidering tuition fees and student debt - these are all ideas that could ease the deep intergenerational injustice that has been so exacerbated by booming asset prices.” The pro-leave Daily Telegraph is determined to defend its anti-EU position in an editorial headlined “Don’t blame Brexit for this rate cut. Blame Project Fear.” So who is to blame? Everyone else, evidently: “David Cameron’s government, the Labour party, Barack Obama, global institutions, sections of the media and, of course, the Bank itself.” Brexit voters should be aware that “the pound has been overvalued for a very long time and that its recent fall was inevitable” and should also note the flaws in the Bank’s mix of low interest rates and quantitative easing. Worry not, says the Telegraph: “Britain is still in a relatively good position” to deal with current economic problems. “We continue to attract huge investment from overseas - and there is no evidence yet of capital flight from the UK, despite Remainers crying wolf.” Worries about faltering consumer confidence are the result of “Project Fear’s warnings that Britain would go to the back of the queue in trade deals, that migrants will all be sent home, that tariff walls would suddenly appear, cutting the British economy off from the rest of the world, and so on.” The Telegraph ses Brexit in positive terms because it “gives political and economic weight to the ongoing campaign to cut business rates, slash regulations and free up consumers to invest and spend their money the way they wish.” In the Times, Ed Conway contends that “Carney’s sledgehammer won’t crack a thing” because his “two-pronged strategy could end up doing more harm than good.” He is sceptical about the virtues of more quantitative easing and scornful of Carney for his “craving to demonstrate that he can see into the future.” Events reveal, writes Conway, the economics editor of Sky News, “how little our policymakers really know... most economists remain convinced that the Bank’s plan, big and bombastic as it looks, will make little profound difference.” The Daily Express is unimpressed with Carney on the grounds that he opposed Brexit which the paper claims will “actually be a boon for our economy.” It says: “It is satisfying to see Mr Carney admit that Brexit will not be a disaster but it remains scandalous that he did not have the honesty or integrity to do so before the referendum.” In the Mail, Alex Brummer thinks Carney’s move is bold, “but he is still relying on the good faith of high street banks to pass on the benefit to borrowers.” He believes that “the greatest flaw” in Carney’s plan “is that no one is quite sure of the post-Brexit health of the economy.” In effect, the Bank has “produced a huge insurance policy aimed at keeping the wheels of British enterprise turning. We now have to pray that it works.” The pro-Brexit Sun accepts that “things will get a bit bumpy” but asserts: “W e’re not going to panic.” It calls on Hammond to be “one of the boldest and most radical chancellors in history.” And how would he do that: “he should cut business taxes and regulation and lure business to Britain from across the world.” The Daily Mirror sees “some comfort” in the Bank’s measures but is concerned that they are only “a temporary dam which may not be able to withstand more torrential forces if the government cannot negotiate a successful EU withdrawal.” According to the collective wisdom of the national press, even if Britain is not doomed it is, at present, in a state of deep contemplation about its fate. There is a difference between the pro-Brexiteers, who tend to see light at the end of the tunnel, and the remainers, who believe the light is behind us."
2016-08-05T11:28:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Five days of rail strikes to go ahead as Southern talks break down,"Five days of strikes will go ahead on Southern rail services next week after talks broke down in recriminations between unions and the train company on Friday. GTR, Southern’s operating company, said it had tabled a series of compromises but remained determined to press ahead with changes to the roles of conductors, claiming that the RMT union was unwilling to bend. But the RMT claimed that the government had blocked any agreement. The union had earlier offered to suspend the strike planned from Monday if Southern could give similar guarantees to those it had accepted in a parallel dispute in Scotland. Planned strikes on ScotRail were suspended on Wednesday after operating company Abellio agreed to guarantee a conductor on every train with “full competency”, while entering into discussion with unions over how trains would be dispatched. In a letter to bosses at GTR, the RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said it was a “sensible and positive way forward” that would “bring an end to this dispute and enable Southern to start running a full service again”. But as talks broke down on Friday afternoon, Cash said: “It was clear right from the start of these talks that there was no serious intent from Govia Thameslink to engage in genuine negotiations and that their script was being written from behind the scenes by their government paymasters. “Compared to the progress we have been able to make on ScotRail, it is clear as day that GTR is being set up as a testing ground for a national union-busting experiment.” However, GTR said the union’s offer was a “red herring” and did not allow the company to modernise for passengers. GTR said no jobs were at risk and that they intended to have a rebranded “onboard supervisor” on trains – the company has wanted the flexibility to run trains with only a driver aboard should it need to, something it said the union refused to discuss. Passenger service director Angie Doll said: “We have gone the extra mile with our compromise offer, but the RMT has made it clear they are not prepared to negotiate. “We are deeply disappointed and angry on behalf of our passengers at this stance, which will cause misery for our passengers and untold damage to the local economy in the south-east.” The dispute has exacerbated problems at Southern in the last few months, with services thrown into disarray by staff shortages, compounding troubles from a new franchise and widespread engineering works. Currently it attempts to run about 85% of its trains, on an emergency timetable, although further cancellations and late-running services have persisted. Southern admitted this week there was no prospect of normal service being reinstated before September. On Thursday, with the addition of a hole that was discovered under rail tracks, cutting off many services to London, and a signal failure on the south coast, only one in three of the trains scheduled on the emergency timetable ran near schedule on the Southern mainline and metropolitan services, with one in six arriving at the right time. While talks were continuing at Acas, Southern said it would plan to run 60% of its trains next week, should the RMT strike go ahead. The dispute could yet escalate as two more unions, the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association and Aslef, have said they would ballot station staff and drivers for a strike. The Campaign for Better Transport and the Association of British Commuters are staging a protest march in London next Wednesday, calling on passengers to join them to bear a giant letter of protest against the failing Southern franchise to the rail minister. The march, starting at London Victoria station on Wednesday 10 August at 5.30pm, will end at the Department for Transport, where they will deliver demands for compensation and a fare freeze."

2016-08-05T12:26:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Russell Square knife attack suspect 'a polite and pleasant boy',"The teenager who allegedly killed an American woman and wounded five others in a stabbing spree in central London was a polite and pleasant boy who rarely got into trouble, according to neighbours. Zakaria Bulhan, 19, a Norwegian of Somali descent who has been identified as the suspect in the attack in Russell Square on Wednesday night, lived with his mother, 42, his younger brother, 16, and his sister, 24, in a flat in south London. Neighbours described him as a polite teenager as reports also emerged that he had wanted to harm himself. He allegedly launched the knife attack shortly after 10.30pm on Wednesday, killing 64-year-old Darlene Horton and injuring five others. Horton was pronounced dead at the scene, just hours before she was due to fly back to the US after the end of her summer break. She was stabbed in front of her husband, Richard Wagner, a psychology professor in Florida who had brought students to the UK to study how “the principles of psychology apply in different cultures” and to “immerse themselves in British culture”, according to the programme on the Florida State University website. Wagner was teaching summer classes at the university’s study centre, a short walk away on Great Russell Street, and the couple had booked to go home on Thursday.
Four of the wounded have been discharged from hospital, but a fifth, a British man who was stabbed in the stomach, has not. Kuljit Bhamra, a neighbour in Tooting Broadway, said: “I am shocked... He was a pleasant boy.” Her son Parmjit Singh Bhamra, who works as DJ Precious, said: “He was generally a good lad … We are all in shock. He was not a gangster or someone who got into trouble. He played with my nephews and was a polite kid. He was academic and as far as we were concerned he was happy. He was never involved in anything wrong.” According to Singh moved into the four-storey block of flats five or six years ago, but Bulhan’s father, who is Somali, moved out and returned to Norway. Zakaria was into football, basketball and rap music, he said. “The father came to visit about once or twice a year. He was here last year.” Police have said the suspect has a history of mental illness and that there is nothing to suggest that, as a Muslim, he had been radicalised. Murder squad detectives removed bags of belongings from his house in the early afternoon. Counter-terror officers were expected to on the scene later to examine any laptops or computer material as part of the wider murder investigation. A local postman, who asked not to be named, complained of music and other noises coming from the Bulhan house. “It’s frightening what’s happened. It’s shocking. It’s sad.” He said he went to Graveney secondary school and took A-levels. The Times newspaper quoted a “close family friend” who said Bulhan had called an ambulance six months ago “because he wanted to harm himself”. “He is a good boy. He has never been trouble. He has been very unwell. He wanted to kill himself. I saw his mother with an ambulance outside their flat and she said Zac had called it because he wanted to hurt himself,” the friend reportedly said. “He called the ambulance about two more times because he was feeling unwell. His mother was very afraid.” Bulhan’s former friend told the Daily Mail they did not believe him to be religious, but said he was bullied at school. One former classmate allegedly said: “He was quite quiet, but had friends. He was a little bullied but nothing too extreme.” Singh Bhamra said he had arrived home on Thursday morning at 3am after a night DJing and “there were police and CID everywhere”. On Friday morning the flat was sealed off and a squad of forensic officers dressed in blue paper suits were examining the interior and stairwell for any clues."
2016-08-05T12:39:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Inquiry launched after Scottish man pepper-sprayed by police dies,"Scotland’s police watchdog has launched an investigation after a man died in hospital the day after being pepper-sprayed by police. The police investigations and review commissioner (PIRC) said Alan Hay, 50, from Dalbeattie, was rushed to hospital when he fell ill minutes before he was due to be checked in at Barlinnie prison the day after his arrest over a disturbance. Police Scotland officers used a pepper spray incapacitant known as Captor PAVA during the incident, which took place on Monday. It is the second recent death involving Police Scotland’s use of pepper spray. The force is under criminal investigation by the PIRC and the Crown Office after the death of Sheku Bayoh, who died last year as he was being held down on a pavement, seconds after being hit with pepper spray and CS gas.
The Scottish Prison Service said Hay had collapsed as he left a G4S van which had brought him from court, but before he could be booked into the prison. “Health care staff at the prison gave him first aid and an ambulance was called; he was taken into hospital and died later,” a spokesman said. The Scottish Prison Service said in a statement: “Alan Hay, 50, an untried prisoner has died in G4S custody. He was remanded at Dumfries sheriff court on 2 August 2016. Police Scotland have been advised and the matter will be reported to the procurator fiscal. A fatal accident inquiry may be held in due course.” The PIRC said the commissioner had asked prosecutors at the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) to launch the inquiry into Hay’s death. But that investigation would not examine his transfer from court to Barlinnie. “The investigation will focus on the discharge of PAVA, and the period while the man was in police custody before being transferred on 2 August 2016 into the custody of the Scottish Prison Service following his appearance at court. “The man fell ill later that day and was taken to hospital for treatment but died shortly after. A report on the commissioner’s findings will be submitted to the COPFS in due course.” Aamer Anwar, the Bayoh family’s lawyer, said: “It would be premature to comment on this tragic case at this stage without the full facts, but I hope that PIRC has learned lessons from the disastrous manner in which it began its investigation into the death in custody of Sheku Bayoh. “All Police Scotland officers should be aware that following the use of sprays on an individual he must be monitored for several hours later as complications such as asphyxiation can occur, which can lead to death. “This is an area that PIRC will of course have to consider, but Mr Hay’s family are entitled to more than minimal answers. They must be provided with a robust and impartial inquiry that leaves no stone unturned.” An official report by the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) in 2012 said: “PAVA primarily affects the eyes causing closure and severe pain. The pain to the eyes is reported to be greater than that caused by CS. “The effectiveness rate is very high once PAVA gets into the eyes. However, there have been occasions where PAVA has failed to work, especially when the subject is under the influence of alcohol.” No details have been released about the cause of Hay’s death, but the Acpo document says PAVA spray can cause skin blistering and breathing problems. People hit with it need to be watched to the same degree as a detainee affected by drink or drugs. “Close monitoring of a subject throughout the recovery period is of utmost importance,” it said. “If the individual experiences difficulties in resuming normal breathing then medical assistance must be sought immediately and must be given precedence over conveying the subject to the police station.”"
2016-08-05T13:40:12Z,uk-news,UK news,CPS upholds decision not to charge over MI6 role in Libyans' rendition,"Prosecutors have rejected an attempt to overturn their decision not to charge anyone over the involvement of the British intelligence agency MI6 in the kidnapping of two Libyan dissidents in a joint operation with the CIA. Lawyers for the two families accused prosecutors of a “complete stitch-up” after failing to quash the decision not to bring any charges over the abduction of the dissidents and their families, including a pregnant woman and children. The Crown Prosecution Service announced in June that, after a Scotland Yard investigation lasting four years, it did not have enough evidence bring criminal charges. Detectives had compiled a 28,000-page file on how the CIA and MI6 had collaborated to abduct the families of the two prominent dissidents, Abdel Hakim Belhaj and Sami al-Saadi, and fly them to the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi’s prisons in 2004. Documents that came to light in 2011 after the toppling of Gaddafi revealed the UK’s participation in the abduction of Belhaj and his pregnant wife, and al-Saadi and his wife and four young children, from south-east Asia.
Detectives questioned Sir Mark Allen, the former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, about faxes from London to Tripoli, signed “Mark”, that acknowledged his role in the abduction of Belhaj. They also uncovered evidence that MI6 had sought political authority from ministers for some of their actions. The two families demanded a review of the CPS decision not to charge, as they were entitled to do so as victims under an official scheme. On Friday, Greg McGill, the CPS’s director of legal services, said: “As the result of a request under the victims’ right to review scheme, the decision to take no further action in this case was looked at again. After careful consideration of all the evidence I have decided to uphold the original decision in this case.” Cori Crider, a lawyer with the human rights group Reprieve, representing the two families, said: “This was exactly what we feared would happen when the CPS froze the victims out of the so-called ‘victims’ review’.” She said the review was “not a run-of-the-mill exercise” as the police investigation had examined the conduct of ministers and senior intelligence officers. “It was vital that the review command public confidence. Instead the CPS flogged it through in seven weeks, without making even the feeblest attempt to engage the victims about their concerns,” she said.
She added that Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, “came into post saying that women and child victims got a raw deal out of the justice system – and she promised to make it better. The Belhaj and al-Saadi families have seen no sign that those words meant anything.” In June, Belhaj and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, spoke of their distress at the decision not to charge anyone. Boudchar said she could not believe it. “I was heavily pregnant when Britain helped kidnap and deliver me to Gaddafi. My baby weighed four pounds when he was born,” she said. “I wonder how a British mother would have felt in my situation, if, while she was still carrying her baby, a gang of kidnappers seized her, took her to a secret cell, tortured her, taped her to a stretcher, and delivered her and her baby to a horrendous dictator.” The two families, who were living in exile when they were abducted, have described how they were tortured for years after they were sent back to Libya."
2016-08-05T14:43:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Ofsted chair apologises for calling Isle of Wight a ghetto full of inbreeding,"The Ofsted chair, David Hoare, has been forced to apologise after he described the Isle of Wight as a poor ghetto that suffers from inbreeding. Hoare, a former City banker, said the island was blighted by a “mass of crime, drug problems, huge unemployment” and underperforming schools. His extraordinary comments provoked a strong backlash from people on the Isle of Wight, where the council leader, Jonathan Bacon, condemned them as “an insult to the proud and hardworking Isle of Wight community”. Ofsted also moved swiftly to distance itself from its chairman, insisting that Hoare’s views “do not reflect the views of Ofsted or the chief inspector [of schools]”. In an interview with the Times Educational Supplement, he said: “They think of it as holiday land. But it is shocking. It’s a ghetto. There has been inbreeding. “Seven state schools were all less than good. There is a mass of crime, drug problems, huge unemployment.” Hoare later apologised for his remarks, insisting he had only intended to show his concern about school standards on the island. “I apologise for any upset or offence that I may have caused by the comments I made about the Isle of Wight at the recent Teach First conference,” he said. “My intention was to highlight how concerned I am about the unacceptably poor performance of schools on the Isle of Wight over many years and how this is damaging the prospects of young people who live on the island. Those who know me will realise that I am passionate about improving outcomes for children from our most disadvantaged communities and [that] my comments were made in this context. “It is important that we draw attention to low educational standards, especially among low-income white British communities in our coastal areas, so that collective action is taken to improve the situation. Indeed, I welcome the efforts that are being made, supported by Hampshire county council, to improve school performance on the island.” Speaking to TES, Hoare said coastal towns were often ignored in terms of poverty and educational underperformance. “I have a house overlooking the Isle of Wight and often over a dinner party, someone will ask ‘How is education?’” he said. “I say: ‘Fantastic, I love doing what I am doing. We’re really going to make a difference.’ But I say: ‘We’re living seven miles away from the second-worst local authority when it comes to secondary education and the third worst when it comes to primary education.’ “And I say: ‘Where is it? Portsmouth? No. Chichester? No. Bognor? No. We’re seven miles away and you don’t know we have a ghetto seven miles away.’ British, white, poor, living on the Isle of Wight.“Most people go there for sailing for two weeks a year. There’s a sailing club that is one of the best in the world, where there’s champagne. “But just within inches, there are people who live in a ghetto and we’ve allowed it to happen.” Bacon described Hoare’s comments as ill-judged. “The Isle of Wight is working hard to raise the aspirations and attainment of our young people – something which Ofsted itself has recognised, not least in assessing our school improvement services as being effective,” he said. The councillor acknowledged that the island had some significant challenges in terms of its education standards but said the council had made good progress, despite a long-term reduction in government funding. He offered a personal invitation to Hoare to visit the island. “I am sure that David would want to take every opportunity to clarify his position in respect of his views on island residents, and I would be delighted if he were able to do this on a visit to the Isle of Wight, which I would be happy to host.” John Pugh, the Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said: “To blame poor performance by the island’s schools on inbreeding is both insulting and ignorant. “Many coastal communities have excellent schools and those that don’t are not helped by the sort of unenlightened attitude that would have been challenged even in Victorian times. “If the best Mr Hoare can do is bring saloon bar comments to complex educational problems you have to wonder how he ended up as chair of Ofsted.” Joy Ballard, the headteacher at Ryde academy on the island, said she hoped none of her pupils read the comments attributed to Hoare. “I’m shocked that someone in such a senior position appears to be placing the blame for schools’ underperformance on the characteristics of the people who live here,” she said. “If he said this, his comments are extremely damaging, thoughtless and cruel.” Ballard joined the school last September after transforming the fortunes of Willows high school in Cardiff, which was featured in the Channel 4 series Educating Cardiff. “I’ve been working on the island since September and absolutely believe that its potential is enormous. Although there are pockets of deprivation, as there are in many towns across the country, the children who live here have been underachieving because of poor standards in schools and the low expectations of them,” she said. “Many of these children already have low aspirations and a lack of belief in themselves. I hope none of my pupils read his comments.”"
2016-08-05T15:00:07Z,uk-news,UK news,"Conditions that caused English riots even worse now, says leading expert","Tim Newburn, the LSE professor of criminology who researched the UK riots of 2011, has said many of the underlying conditions that helped cause them have now worsened. Prof Newburn, speaking ahead of the fifth anniversary of the outbreak of disorder in London, which then spread around the country, said there had not been enough improvement. “The underlying conditions for those riots still persist,” Newburn told the Guardian on Friday, before describing the conditions: rioters were drawn from the poorest communities, had a sense of being constantly harassed by the police, felt that their opportunities were limited and shrinking, and that the dearth of services and chances around them was the result of deliberate political choices, made by rich people who behaved with impunity.
“There’s no real sign that things have improved for the lives of the kinds of people who were involved and caught up in the riots. Certainly it’s not implausible that there could be more riots. But that’s not the same thing as expecting riots,” he said. Newburn traces this lack of progress directly to the political response in August 2011, following what he called “possibly the most significant civil disorder in the postwar period”.
Newburn, whose researchers partnered with the Guardian for the Reading the Riots study, said: “From the very moment of the Cameronesque [judgment of] ‘Criminality, pure and simple’, the political diagnosis was, ‘You don’t need to look below the surface here because there’s nothing to find. This is just people behaving criminally and immorally. As soon as the cops have learnt to do their job, it will all be fine’. “There was no sense that public policy had any role to play. So I don’t think there’s been any public policy response that you could link directly to the riots.“I’d say everything’s worsened. I think politically, things have worsened for those people. Economically, they have too.” The riots erupted after the police fatally shot Mark Duggan on Thursday 4 August 2011 as they tried to arrest him in Tottenham. Two days later, there was a protest outside the police station over the killing. Disorder flared later that day in the area. David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, echoed Newburn’s argument, writing in the Guardian that “rifts in society are wider than ever”. ‘I remember thinking, the youth had spoken ...’ Tottenham High Road, where a protest outside the police station turned to burning buildings and spilled into a ransacked retail park, still bears the odd scar. The post office burned down and is now in rather shambolic temporary premises 50 yards down the street, with a mobile phone unblocker in the corner and a fish stall on its doorstep.
A man in Anil foods, one of the many Turkish shops that was not looted, said: “The Poundland was on fire on one side. Post office on fire the other.”At the Costa in the nearby retail park, Abuntu and Lisa, both 32, who went to school together (not their real names), remembered the riots with the vividness of post-traumatic stress. “These kids were running down the street with giant screens in shopping trolleys. They all had bandanas on, and marigolds. It was unbelievable. I’d just had a baby, she was three weeks old,” Lisa recalled. Abuntu said: “Everything was on fire. I was heavily pregnant, and I just sat there, thinking … not ‘judgment day’, but … like the youth had spoken. A lot of youth provisions had been cut.” Lisa disagreed forcefully. “A lot of young people got involved and didn’t even know what they were rioting for,” she said. “There’s a hell of a lot of opportunities, there’s a huge amount that people just don’t access.” Abuntu worked in a youth programme, funding for which had been cut a month before the riots, while Lisa worked in young offending. They disagreed on everything from the causes of the riots to the harshness of the sentences. “The police were still knocking on doors a year later,” Lisa said approvingly, while Abuntu countered sadly: “There was a lot of young kids going to prison, and that’s a stain on them, isn’t it?”
Brandon was 13 when the riots broke out. He is now 18 and waiting to find out whether or not he has got into University College London to read mechanical engineering. He has no time for rioters. “It was just people being selfish and out for their personal gain,” Brandon said, and no time even for people caught up in trouble who did not necessarily do anything. “You should be at home. If trouble’s there, you should be at home.” But it is not always that easy. Moin, 27, remembers the night of the riots, driving down Tottenham Hale, boggling at the fires, but mainly the next morning. “I was going to pray with my dad, it was five in the morning and we got stopped by the police,” he said. “I can understand, people are doing their jobs. I’m not an argumentative person. But my dad is an argumentative person. He feels humiliated.” I asked if that was the first time it had happened, and he laughed. “No, I live in Edmonton, I get stopped all the time,” Moin said. “I’ll be honest with you, it’ll never change. It hasn’t been easy, living round here, from a Muslim background.” Abuntu said whenever she sees a young black man stopped by police, she stops her car to watch, to check that they being treated properly. “I’m often asked to move on. It’s terrible for their self-esteem. I’m so glad I haven’t got a son,” she said. If stop-and-search is still an issue, economic conditions have changed somewhat. Guardian analysis of the key wards in the east of the borough showed that benefit claims hit a peak in August 2011. They were also at a record high for the Broadwater Farm riot in 1985.
Since then, claims all over the country, including this area, have gone down. However, most people, from Newburn to Tracey, 54, whose daughter lost her job when the shop she worked at was burned down, and had to move out of the area, point to social cleansing rather than improved prospects for the original residents.
“I’ve been at a meeting,” Newburn said, “where people in Tottenham were talking about the local community, the regeneration around Tottenham Hotspur[’s football stadium], and the overriding emotion was one of anger: the money wasn’t really going to where it was needed, but actually it was aiding the gentrification of a poor area.” Critics have questioned some of the decline in benefit claimants, citing moves to impose sanctions on jobseekers’ allowance and caps on benefits, including housing benefit, arguing that this has driven poorer families out of London. And yet, more broadly, from Clapham Junction to Croydon, the overwhelming human urge to put a positive spin on almost anything (“My house got bombed, but it brought out this beautiful Blitz spirit”) nudges its way through.
Amy, 28, works at the Clapham Junction party shop that was set on fire. “We had a week off, but most of us had holiday to take. And then Clapham Junction had such a good reaction that we had a concession [a small store within a department store] in Debenhams by October,” she said. “We had to be up and running by Halloween, otherwise we’d have gone under. But now we’ve got concessions in Croydon, Guildford, Woking and Harrow. And I’m a supervisor. I used to be a sales assistant.” Data research: Helena Bengtsson and Sean Clarke"

2016-08-05T16:34:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Dissident republican weapons cache uncovered in Armagh,"Police in Northern Ireland have discovered a major dissident republican weapons cache including a fully primed bomb, homemade rocket-launchers and explosives. The terror arsenal was discovered on Friday after two days of searches in north Armagh by the Police Service of Northern Ireland. A senior PSNI officer described the weaponry, which was found near a disused house on the outskirts of Lurgan, as “significant and key”. The location is in a stronghold of the Continuity IRA – the oldest and more hardline of three main dissident republican factions opposed to the peace process and power-sharing in Northern Ireland. The arms and explosives haul also included homemade mortar launchers and a ready-to-go bomb.
The security operation has created disruption to the nearby railway linking Belfast and Dublin. The line between Lisburn in County Antrim and Portadown in County Armagh was still closed on Friday evening. PSNI DS Karen Baxter said the “fully constructed explosive device” her officers uncovered was ready to be used. Baxter said as a result of the search of woodland around the house other terror hides had been found and the security operation was ongoing. The policing board, which scrutinises the running of the PSNI, welcomed the find. Anne Connolly, the board’s chair, said: “It is a great result for the PSNI to find these firearms/munitions and take them away from those who would have used them to cause harm in our community.” The security operation near Lurgan marks the second major blow the PSNI has inflicted on the dissident republicans’ secret arsenals this year. Back in May the PSNI uncovered a terrorist hide in a forest near Larne in County Antrim into which the New IRA had secreted weapons including two anti-personnel mines and an armoured piercing rocket as well as three pipe-bombs and ammunition."
2016-08-05T20:30:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Teenager charged with murder over Russell Square stabbings,"A teenager has been charged with murder after the stabbings in central London on Wednesday night. Zakaria Bulhan, 19, will appear at Westminster magistrates’ court on Saturday, accused of murdering the 64-year-old US woman Darlene Horton in Russell Square. He was also charged with five counts of attempted murder, the Metropolitan police said. Horton was stabbed in front of her husband, Richard Wagner, a psychology professor in Florida who had brought students to the UK to study how “the principles of psychology apply in different cultures” and to “immerse themselves in British culture”, according to the programme on the Florida State University website. Wagner was teaching summer classes at the university’s study centre, a short walk away on Great Russell Street, and the couple had been booked to go home on Thursday. A British man who suffered a stab wound to his stomach remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition. An American man, an Australian man, an Australian woman and an Israeli woman were all discharged from hospital on Thursday after receiving treatment for their injuries. Yovel Lewkowski, 18, who was visiting London from Tel Aviv was stabbed in the upper arm. She said she did not know whether to call it “luck or fate” that she escaped death, adding that she had watched as Horton “perished in front of my eyes”. In a moving Facebook post, she wrote: “I’m not afraid, I want to keep going with the trip. “The last few hours have taught me to appreciate every second, I don’t know whether to call it luck or fate, but no doubt it is some sort of miracle compared to the woman who stood right next to me and perished in front of my eyes: a matter of seconds, metres, breaths.” Florida State University president John Thrasher said: “There are no words to express our heartache over this terrible tragedy. “We are shocked that such senseless violence has touched our own FSU family and we will do all we can to assist Prof Wagner and his loved ones, as well as his friends and colleagues in the psychology department, as they mourn.” Friends and neighbours expressed shock at the arrest of Bulhan, a former student at Graveney School in Tooting, south London. Neighbour Parmjit Singh Bhamra described Bulhan as a “quiet, academic boy who was a bit of a loner” who liked football, basketball and music. He said Bulhan, who is unemployed, lived at the flat with his younger brother, his elder sister and mother. Two police officers remained on duty outside the Bulhan family home on Friday, a council flat in south London."
2016-08-06T14:19:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Man killed after tree lands on tent in Edinburgh,"A man has been killed after a large tree crashed on to his tent in Edinburgh during the first weekend of the city’s internationally renowned festival. Police were called to woodland next to the Water of Leith – the river that runs through Edinburgh – at about 3.30am on Saturday. The area, accessed from Miller Row, is very close to the city centre. Officers said a very large tree had fallen on the tent in which the man and another man were sleeping. The man died at the scene, while his 35-year-old companion suffered minor injuries. He did not require medical attention, a Police Scotland spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman said: “Officers have consulted with the appropriate partners, who are confident that the tree fell as a result of natural occurrences. We’re currently working to trace the deceased’s next of kin, and a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal [Scottish public prosecutor].” There is huge demand for accommodation in the Scottish capital during August as it hosts the fringe festival - the world’s largest arts event, which officially began on Friday. In 2015 there were 50,459 performances of 3,314 shows in 313 venues across the three weeks. The event was first held in 1947 as a counterpart to the newly established Edinburgh international festival, which was programmed more conservatively."
2016-08-06T15:03:56Z,uk-news,UK news,Protest connected to Ulster loyalist parade suspended,"One of the longest-running protests connected to a contentious Ulster loyalist parade in Northern Ireland has been suspended. The postponement of a three-year-old protest camp at Twaddell Avenue – a sectarian interface between the Protestant/Loyalist Greater Shankill area and Catholic/Nationalist Ardoyne – points to a possible resolution of the marching dispute.
Since 2013 Orangemen from lodges in the Ligoniel area have been banned from returning home past the Ardoyne shops in North Belfast. The Orange lodges’ march is a feeder parade into the larger annual 12 July demonstration in the city. Since the ban Orange Order members and their supporters have established a protest camp close to the sectarian faultline between the two areas. In a statement on Friday night, the Ballysillan Orange Order lodge said: “We are left with no option but to suspend our protest. For our lodge this has always been about securing our human rights and we thank all those who have given their time and money. The linkage of funding to this deal is of significant concern: this was about human rights not money.” The Ballysillan Orange lodge was the only one which was not part of an aborted deal earlier in the summer between two other lodges and a nationalist residents’ group from Ardoyne that would have allowed Orangemen to return up the Crumlin Road on 1 July during battle of the Somme centenary celebrations. The suspension of the Ballysillan lodge’s protest signals moves towards a comprehensive resolution of the last main contentious Orange march across Northern Ireland. In recent years, the flashpoint on the Crumlin Road has been a scene of rioting, sectarian clashes and serious street disorder around 12 July when Ulster loyalists remember King William of Orange’s victory at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. However, Belfast is bracing itself for potential trouble breaking out of an Irish dissident republican march banned from the city centre on Sunday. The Anti-Internment League parade has been barred from entering central Belfast. Last year a standoff between dissident republicans and the Police Service of Northern Ireland resulted in rioting for several hours in North Belfast."
2016-08-06T18:12:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Two south-east London teenagers killed in knife attacks in same week,"Police are investigating the murders of two teenagers stabbed in separate incidents in nearby streets in south-east London. Officers were called to Colegrove Road in Peckham, SE15, shortly after 7pm on Friday and found a male, believed to be 16, suffering from stab wounds. He died at the scene a short time later. The teenager’s next of kin have been informed though formal identification has yet to be carried out. Detectives are investigating the murder and several weapons have been recovered from the scene. No arrests have been made. Meanwhile police have appealed for information and witnesses after Andrew Oteng-Owusu, 19, was murdered in New Cross late on Wednesday night. Police were called by ambulance staff to Sharratt Street, also in SE15, where he was found with stab wounds. Oteng-Owusu was taken to King’s College hospital but died late on Thursday morning.
A postmortem examination conducted on Friday found that the cause of death was a single stab wound. The Met officer leading the investigation, DI Mick Norman, said: “Andrew has been described as a ‘gentle giant’ who was clearly well liked on the Lovelinch estate and provided a good deal of support for his mother. I am grateful for the assistance we have received so far but I do need further information.” No arrests have yet been made in connection with the killing. Police want to talk to two key witnesses, one of whom helped Oteng-Owusu after he was stabbed and a man who helped police near the scene. “The first is a young black man who, after the stabbing, walked with Andrew to the block of flats where he lived,” Norman said. He is in his late teens or early 20s and was wearing a white T-shirt. “The second key witness – also a black man of similar age – was riding a moped and directed police into the estate to the area where Andrew had collapsed. He was wearing grey clothing.” Anyone with information is asked to contact the incident room at Lewisham police station on 020 8721 4961 or anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. Knife crime in the capital has risen by 16% in the past two years, with at least 10 young people dying on the streets of London in this way since January. Last month London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said that a knife crime summit would be held at City Hall in October. He also announced funding of £400,000 for two schemes that offer support for vulnerable young offenders across 12 boroughs in the capital. Khan said: “Every young death is an utter tragedy, yet both knife crime and youth violence are growing problems. Earlier this year, a 20-year-old Londoner was stabbed to death just yards from my own home. As mayor, and as a father of two teenage daughters, I am deeply concerned and determined to do everything I possibly can to help rid our communities of this terrible violence. We need to send a strong message that carrying a knife is completely unacceptable and is more likely to ruin your life than to save it.”"
2016-08-06T19:10:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Charities seek return of £425m lotto cash borrowed for London Olympics,"More than £400m diverted from supporting communities in need across the UK to help fund the London 2012 Olympics has yet to be returned, and the shortfall has raised questions about the Games’ legacy. With the 2016 Rio Olympics now underway, there are calls for the new mayor of London and the prime minister to ensure the cash – taken from the Big Lottery Fund which makes small grants to local charities – is paid back. The previous mayor of London, Boris Johnson, stated that a key legacy aim of the 2012 Games was the “convergence in life chances and prosperity between east and west London, and to bring the city and its communities together”. But charities say the failure to return the lottery cash has undermined this commitment. Ciaran Price, policy officer with the Directory of Social Change, the organisation that campaigns to improve conditions for charities in the UK and is leading calls for the return of the money, said: “The government failed to honour its promise to Britain’s communities, which have been struggling in the wake of a devastating recession, to repay the £425m it took from the Big Lottery Fund to construct the Olympic Village. “While many charities are seeing demand for their services rising at a speed never before experienced, and while they are finding it more and more difficult to get the financial support they need to meet this new level of demand, the government has been sitting on this money, continuously trying to kick it further into the long grass, hoping we’ll somehow forget about it.”
It emerged after the Games that the government had underspent on the Olympics by more than £500m but, despite this, none of the £425m taken from the Big Lottery Fund has been returned to good causes. Charities were further dismayed when the Olympic stadium, which cost £486m to build, was handed over to the Premier League football club West Ham on a 99-year lease, at a cost to the club of £2.5m a year. The Directory of Social Change has now written to both mayor of London Sadiq Khan and the prime minister, calling on them to intervene. The organisation says it is vital that lottery money goes to the charitable causes for which it is intended. In its letter to Theresa May, it points out that when she was shadow secretary for culture, media and sport she stated: “We believe that the lottery should be independent of government but accountable to parliament. It should not become a tool of government.” In a speech to parliament in 2005, May claimed that governments should not be able to raid lottery funds. “Every pound that the government choose to snaffle that way is a pound that cannot go to help community groups or to preserve our historic buildings.” Debra Allcock Tyler, chief executive of the Directory of Social Change, claims in the letters that more than 10,000 charities could be supported if the money were returned, and around eight million people would benefit. She acknowledges that the government has committed to repay the money via the sale of assets in the Olympic park. But the previous and current governments have said this will not happen until the next decade at the earliest, and possibly the one after. “This is too late for so many communities in need,” Allcock Tyler says in her letter to Khan. “We maintain that giving back this money now would make a huge difference to organisations and the individuals they serve across London and the rest of the UK at a time when so many people are in need of support.”
The Directory of Social Change claims that the Brexit vote has given a renewed urgency to claiming back the millions owed to the Big Lottery Fund. It points out that the EU currently gives £200m to 249 charities in the UK and that the future of this funding is now uncertain. “Now, in a period of unprecedented uncertainty in the wake of the EU referendum result, the money is needed more than ever,” Price said. “Charities are struggling to cope. The decision to give away the Olympic football stadium to West Ham United for the next century, for the private benefit of its wealthy club owners, casts serious doubt over the government’s sincerity. “In reality, £425m is such a small amount of money and it would have such a huge, positive impact for Britain’s communities, which will improve the lives of absolutely every person in the country. The government cannot deny the sector this money any longer.”"
2016-08-06T19:18:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Why activists brought the Black Lives Matter movement to the UK,"On the same day last week as protesters lay down in front of traffic on roads around England, a video of the shooting of an unarmed teenager by police in Chicago was released in the United States. Shock and anger greeted the death of 18-year-old Paul O’Neal and sympathy poured in for his family. Some 4,000 miles away, the peaceful protest being played out on the asphalt, the first ever day of action by Black Lives Matter UK, met with disbelief and irritation and a handful of arrests. Why were motorists being inconvenienced over a racism that was America’s problem? There lay the British complacency, said Natalie Jeffers, co-founder of Black Lives Matter UK. There might be fewer guns used in the UK, she said, “but there is a war going on against black people”. Her words are supported by statistics showing an alarming gulf between the experiences of black and white people in Britain – in education, in the justice and prison systems, and in employment. Stop and search is heavily targeted at young black men – who are four times more likely to be stopped by police than young white men – while people from black and ethnic minorities are far more likely to go to prison than a white person committing a similar offence.
In 2014 black people made up 10% of the total prison population, while making up 3.5% of the UK’s total population, according to the Equality and Human Rights Commission. There is a greater disparity between the proportion of black people in prison and in the general population than there is in the US. Research by the campaign group Inquest shows a disproportionate number of those who have died as a result of the use of force in police custody were black or from minority ethnic groups. Despite numerous scandals over abuse at immigration detention centres and allegations of brutality used during deportations, no criminal charges have ever been brought against anyone. It suggested a radically different picture, said Jeffers, of the kind of equality in British society than many like to paint. “We have dozens of British families left fighting for justice over their loved ones suffering state violence, so we know there’s a problem in the UK, and that’s before the Brexit debate that we’re now seeing reflected in the rise in racism at street level,” said Jeffers. It was no coincidence that Friday was the fifth anniversary of the police shooting of Mark Duggan, a 29-year-old north Londoner whose death sparked riots that spread across Britain in the summer of 2011, and whose inquest verdict of lawful killing is now being challenged by his family. Campaigners chose Heathrow for one of their sit-downs as a nod to both the proximity of two immigration detention centres and as an act of remembrance for Jimmy Mubenga, the 46-year-old who suffocated while being forcibly restrained by three G4S security guards on a deportation flight to Angola. The three were acquitted of manslaughter, and the judge in the case refused to accept that streams of racist texts on phones of two of the men were relevant. “We really are focused on sharing the British narrative,” said Jeffers. “It might have taken the shocking images from deaths in the US to awaken young people, but they’re aware of oppression at an individual household level, they see what happens within our communities.
“After Brexit, people are seeing the direct change in language online, aware of being seen as another in your own country. People of colour even being told to ‘go home’. There were vans bearing racist slogans being driven round British streets. We know there’s a direct link between street racism and state racism. “When you are walking around the streets of the UK as a black or brown person you’re seeing this, you’re feeling this. It’s an everyday occurrence. It’s been too often silenced by the national narrative of where the UK is at. “But we know the black and ethnic minority community was hit twice as hard by austerity as everyone else, we know a black woman is more likely to be unemployed than a white woman. We know black women and queer women are facing extreme levels of oppression. All the statistics that affect families here every day. “We need to look at high levels of violence in impoverished communities in the UK. I grew up in a mixed community. I saw black people, Asian people and white people facing the same sorts of oppression and difficulties. That is the way the white liberal left like to paint it. But the impact is enlarged when black people are involved. “In Britain somebody dies every six days in police custody, not just black people. But black people are over-represented in these cases. As is mental health – if a black man has a mental health episode, police are more likely to see that as a show of aggression than if a white person has the same episode.” Jeffers, from Birmingham, lost her brother, Luke, a 42-year-old schizophrenic, under tragic circumstances when his condition worsened after he lost his benefits. It is not clear how he died. “For him it was bureaucratic violence,” she said. “It’s not all about deaths. Look at Julian Cole, [a young black man] left in an unresponsive state in Bedfordshire, left with a broken neck. They said he was drunk, then back came the toxicology and he wasn’t. The family has no answers. Sean Rigg [who] died in 2008, his family [is] left to fight at a time when they are traumatised. It’s happening time and time again. Of 1,563 deaths in police custody since 1990, we have zero convictions.” Rigg’s sister Marcia has said the Black Lives Matter movement is an “absolutely vital” platform. An IPCC investigation into Rigg’s death identified no police misconduct, but in 2012 an inquest jury found that police had used “unsuitable” force. “Families like mine have been suffering for a long time and there has been an injustice,” she said. “Deaths are not just happening in the US, they are happening in the UK too, and so it’s the perfect platform to highlight those deaths in Britain because people are not aware of them.” Another case which was highlighted in Friday’s protest was the death of Sheku Bayoh, 31, who died after being restrained by officers in Fife in May last year. His cousin, Kadija Sesay, said: “People need to realise that this happens in the UK all of the time, in state institutions – it happens.”
Jeffers said the gun-driven brutality in the US was obviously not being replicated on the streets of Britain, but inequality and discrimination existed at alarming levels. Black Lives Matter in the US began initially as a hashtag on social media in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, who killed unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin. Co-founders Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi said they wanted to rebuild a black liberation movement, but one led by the most marginalised, giving a voice to women, to gay and transgender people. That, said Jeffers, was the same principle for the UK movement. “BLM UK gives us a new framework. Nobody is excluded from the room. But we have learned it’s important not to see the movement go the way a lot of anti-racist movements do, led by white people, middle-class white people. We welcome white allies, we want participation, but please do not take over from people who are directly affected by the oppression and acknowledge your privilege. Listen, but don’t dilute or devolve what is being said. Silence, white silence, is complicity and there is room for everyone to engage in change. We can be a powerful force. “It’s about how we can educate and inform our youth, the traumas that they are experiencing and the outlets for these traumas. The war on black people, these statistics for stop and search – disproportionate amount of police divested in ethnic poor areas and the lack of investment in educating and empowering black communities, working class communities. “A lot of people have lost their voice, they feel powerless. We want to give them their voice back.” • The University of Sussex podcast series The Glass Bead Game features an episode featuring Natalie Jeffers by Will Hood at www.theglassbeadgame.co.uk/episode/blacklivesmatter/ How it began The case that proved to be the catalyst in launching Black Lives Matter was the killing of Trayvon Martin, 17, in 2012. Martin, who President Barack Obama said “could have been my son, could have been me 35 years ago”, was shot dead inside the gated community in Florida where he had been visiting his father’s fiancee. The man who killed him, George Zimmerman, was a neighbourhood watch coordinator. Martin had gone out to buy a drink from a store and was 70 yards from home when an altercation with Zimmerman took place. Zimmerman’s claim he acted in self-defence was accepted during what was a flawed police investigation into Martin’s death. Initially no charges were brought against Zimmerman but, when he went to court, a jury found him not guilty. A survey by the Washington Post found 90% of African Americans called the shooting unjustified, compared with 33% of white Americans. After Zimmerman’s acquittal on a charge of second-degree murder in 2013, a widely distributed Facebook post used the phrase “black lives matter”, which quickly became the country’s newest black civil rights movement. The US group spawned a British offshoot and groups are being set up in Canada, Brazil, France and South Africa. In May this year, Zimmerman sold the pistol he had used to shoot Martin online for $250,000."
2016-08-06T22:26:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Russell Square attack suspect Zakaria Bulhan appears in court,"The teenager who allegedly killed a US tourist and injured five others in a random knife attack in Russell Square will appear at the Old Bailey on Tuesday after being remanded in custody following a brief appearance at Westminster magistrates court. Zakaria Bulhan, 19, has been charged with murdering the 64-year-old woman and attempting to murder five other people in the central London assault on Wednesday night. Bulhan, who wore a plain grey tracksuit, was asked to confirm his name, address and date of birth but kept one hand over his mouth, making his responses almost inaudible to the court. The court heard that he declined representation at the hearing, shaking his head when asked if he wanted to see the duty solicitor. The suspect held his head in his hands as the six charges were confirmed. He is accused of murdering US citizen Darlene Horton, who was due to fly back to America a day later, and the attempted murder of two other women and three men. They were named as Lillie Selletin, Yovel Lewronski, Martin Hoenisch, David Imber and Bernard Hepplewhite. One of the male victims, who suffered a stab wound to his stomach, remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition. The other four were all discharged on Thursday after being treated for their injuries. He is also charged with the attempted murder of Martin Hoenisch, Lillie Selletin, David Imber, Bernard Hepplewhite and Yovel Lewronski, who were all injured in the same attack. Bulhan is a Norwegian national of Somali origin who moved to the UK in 2002 and lives in Wandsworth, south London, with his mother, brother and sister. He will appear at the Old Bailey on Tuesday. Hoenisch is understood to be the American man injured in the attack. In the early hours of Friday morning, the Las Vegas resident posted on Facebook: “Thanks to everybody for reaching. Weird, Laurie [Kelly, his wife] and I thought we would take a stab at going to London and look what happened. Anyway thanks to everyone for reaching out, we’re still very saddened about the woman who was killed. Very unreal experience.” Hepplewhite is thought to be the British man who remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition after being stabbed in the stomach in the attack. He is believed to be from Rochester in Kent and in his early sixties. Imber is understood to be the Australian man hurt in the knife attack. According to his LinkedIn profile, Imber is parliamentary advocacy manager for Telstra, the Australian telecoms giant, based in Melbourne. Is it not clear whether he knows the Australian woman who was stabbed in the back during the incident. She is thought to be Selletin. A spokesman for the Australian foreign office said: “The department of foreign affairs and trade has been providing consular assistance to three Australians caught up in a stabbing attack in Russell Square, London. “A 40-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman both sustained non-life threatening injuries and have been discharged from hospital. “Another Australian woman was at the scene of the attack, but was not injured. The Australians concerned have requested that their privacy be respected.” Lewkowski, 18, who was visiting London from Tel Aviv, was stabbed in the upper arm. She said she did not know whether to call it “luck or fate” that she escaped death, adding that she had watched as Horton “perished in front of my eyes”. In a moving Facebook post, she wrote: “I’m not afraid, I want to keep going with the trip. “The last few hours have taught me to appreciate every second. I don’t know whether to call it luck or fate, but no doubt it is some sort of miracle compared to the woman who stood right next to me and perished in front of my eyes: a matter of seconds, metres, breaths.”"
2016-08-06T23:05:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Demolition threat looms for great Victorian buildings from English fishing’s golden age,"In the halcyon days of the 1950s, Fish Dock Road in Grimsby was so frantic that workers recall struggling to cross the crowded street. Back then, Grimsby hosted the world’s biggest fishing fleet; its 700 vessels trawled all the way to the Barents Sea. Only the grand Victorian buildings remain to testify to that golden era – for now at least. A huge stretch of Grimsby’s old port area – the Kasbah – faces demolition and that has sparked a battle to preserve the evidence of its glory days. Heritage groups have denounced the destruction, arguing that it demonstrates a callous disregard for Britain’s industrial legacy. The government’s adviser on such issues, Historic England, views the Kasbah’s surviving buildings as the “most important representation of the industrial-scale fishing trade in England”. The World Monument Fund hails them as an “integral part of Grimsby’s globally important fishing heritage”. In Grimsby itself, the razing of the Kasbah has triggered a debate over the town’s identity: how should a community balance the need to hold on to its past with the post-industrial need to reimagine itself for the modern global economy? Native Grimbarian Richard Enderby, who runs a traditional fish smokehouse opposite the doomed Cosalt buildings, accuses the port owner, Associated British Ports (ABP), of “malign neglect” and of deliberately running the Kasbah into the ground. But ABP says that levelling the buildings makes it easier to develop the port for future needs. The company, which owns 21 ports, 570 hectares of “strategic development land” and last year announced pre-tax profits of £324m, argues that it needs the space to develop Grimsby as a base for offshore wind farms. “The port needs to be ready to provide space for the industry to grow,” said a company spokesman.
Across the railway tracks that separate Fish Dock Road from the town lies the East Marsh ward, the location for Sacha Baron Cohen’s film Grimsby. More than half the children in this area are classified as living in poverty. Close to the high-rise flats off Albion Street, Darren Keening, 22, who is unemployed, said: “They can do what they want with the Kasbah. The place is a shithole.” Even the few people who still work nearby – only 100 people now work in the Kasbah compared with 10,000 at its peak in the 1950s – have ditched sentimentality. One staff member at Tom Taylor & Son, which sells equipment to fish processing businesses, pointed to the crumbling red brickwork and said: “The buildings have gone too far, they’re way past their sell-by date. At one point they could have been done up, but look at them.” That view was shared at nearby Excel Seafoods, opposite the fish market. “It’s time to move on, leave what happened in the past,” said one worker lugging crates of frozen seafood into the ice store. Enderby, who has worked in the Kasbah for 40 years, said that the sense that Grimsby had been ignored by politicians and major investors over many decades had sucked the fight from the town’s residents. “It’s defeatism. The town has lost all its pride, we’ve been ignored. We’ve never had any major government investment and now, in the case of the Kasbah, a small council has been intimidated by ABP.” North East Lincolnshire council approved demolishing the Cosalt buildings by six votes to four. Yet most anger is directed at central government. Labour has held Great Grimsby for more than 70 years, which many believe has countered political incentives to encourage and help the town to recover from the collapse of its fishing trade.
The sense of abandonment may explain Grimsby’s decision to vote overwhelmingly to leave the EU in the referendum, with 70% opting for Brexit, although some votes were no doubt inspired by anger at the perceived injustices of the EU’s common fisheries policy. Many believed that rejuvenating the Kasbah would have been the ideal place to start injecting hope back into Grimsby. Enderby visualises the Victorian cluster of buildings as a hub of artisan cuisine, fish restaurants and traditional cooking and smokehouses. The campaign group Save Britain’s Heritage even drew up plans to convert its buildings, with a covered market, shops, bars, galleries and restaurants overlooking the existing marina. Associated British Ports would not release images of how it intends to develop the dock. It also refused to comment on complaints by a smattering of businesses in the Kasbah of being offered six-month rolling leases that effectively prevent them from investing while maintaining buildings to a workable minimum. “The sword of Damocles hangs over us. We would have opened a shop, but it was impossible,” said Enderby. Other fears over ABP’s stewardship of the dock revolve around the Grade-II listed Ice Factory, once the world’s largest. Despite its historic and architectural importance, the Ice Factory has been left to decay for many years and now faces an uncertain future. Save Britain’s Heritage, which last week withdrew its legal objection to the Cosalt demolition due to costs, has described ABP’s stewardship of the Ice Factory as the “most callous neglect of an outstanding listed building we have seen in years”. ABP counters that new offshore wind farms will “revitalise areas of the port that have long lain idle and promise the creation of significant numbers of new jobs”. A Green Alliance report found that 231 direct offshore wind jobs have so far been created in Grimsby. But if and when the demolition on the Fish Dock Road goes ahead, the local sense that a once-thriving town is the victim of neglect and indifference will only deepen."
2016-08-06T23:05:20Z,uk-news,UK news,The Glorious Twelfth? Conservationists turn their fire on Scotland’s landowners,"Britain’s wild and beautiful places on Friday will echo once more to the sound of gunshots as a Barbour and tweed army go shooting. The “Glorious Twelfth” is upon us. After months of freedom scooting about the hills and glens, low-flying moorland birds find that they are fair game once more. This year, though, there will be an edge to the frivolities. For the hunting and shooting community are beginning to experience something of what it must be like to stare down the barrel of a gun. A campaign to ban outright driven grouse shooting has been gathering momentum these past few years and its champions are finally beginning to smell blood. A broad coalition of wildlife groups has launched a petition in the Scottish parliament urging the Holyrood government to act against landowners and their estate managers who have been killing eagles, red kites and hen harriers. They want a licensing system that would bar them from participating in sporting shoots on grouse moors.
Despite being protected by increasingly tougher legislation, raptors remain a target for some landowners who blame them for reducing stocks of the game birds on which they prey. Very few convictions have resulted where raptors are found to have been unlawfully slain. Wildlife groups claim that 10 birds of prey were poisoned and more than five were shot in Scotland in the past year. The Scottish Raptor Study Group, comprising 300 experts who monitor birds of prey, lodged the petition. It wants “urgent action to introduce a state regulated system of licensing of game bird hunting”. Earlier this year an e-petition, backed by a powerful lobby of conservationists, animal welfare groups and television naturalists, was launched asking the UK government to ban driven grouse shooting. Thus far it has gained almost 75,000 signatures. It followed the news that the National Trust had banned shooting on landed property it owned in Derbyshire. This was in response to claims that illegal shooting of hen harriers was taking place there. If it reaches 100,000 signatures, a debate in parliament must ensue.
The organisers of the e-petition are clear about what they stand for. “Grouse shooting for ‘sport’ depends on intensive habitat management which increases flood risk and greenhouse gas emissions, relies on killing foxes, stoats, mountain hares, etc in large numbers and often leads to the deliberate illegal killing of protected birds of prey, including hen harriers.” The landed community, however, are having none of it. They believe that the campaign is a manufactured one, fuelled in the main by the politics of class prejudice and by an implacable anti-shooting group who simply want to damage the shooting community at any cost. On Friday they started their fightback with an important courtroom victory. Following a high court ruling, for the first time ever in the UK buzzards can be shot under licence to protect young pheasants, a move that will benefit game shooting. The case was brought by a gamekeeper who claimed his livelihood was being damaged by buzzard attacks. The RSPB condemned the ruling. Its conservation director, Martin Harper, said: “It sets a worrying precedent. What will be next? Red kites, peregrines, hen harriers?” Tim Baynes, director of the Scottish Moorland Group which is part of the influential Scottish Land & Estates, was highly critical of the role of the RSPB in the campaign. “This body is supposed to be concerned with the welfare of all species of birds, but recently it seems to be championing the concerns about raptors above all others. “Why aren’t they concerned about falling numbers of wading birds like curlews, lapwings and golden plovers. If they were, they’d know that on managed estates these birds are plentiful. In Scotland, too, the numbers of hen harriers are healthy at about 500 pairs. Indeed Scottish Natural Heritage is currently carrying out a survey which we fully expect to show further increases. “We are working with SNH in a project where 13 estates across Scotland will monitor nesting pairs to discover why some nests fail. The evidence we have so far is that the two biggest reasons are inclement, wet weather and predation by foxes.”
The RSPB rejected these claims. Duncan Orr-Ewing, head of species and land management at RSPB Scotland, said: “The UK and Isle of Man population of hen harriers declined by 20% between 2004 and 2010, evidenced by national survey data, with a breeding population around one third of what it should be. It is wrong to speculate on the results of the current national hen harrier survey undertaken in 2016 as the results are only now being collated. There is a significant and increasing body of scientific evidence, including government-commissioned research, data from satellite tagged birds and documented incidents of wildlife crime, to show that the relentless illegal killing of hen harriers on land managed for driven grouse shooting is the main factor limiting the species’ population. To suggest otherwise is misleading.” Scottish Land & Estates claims that field sports in Scotland’s glens are worth £155m in tourism and that this will rise by another £30m by 2020. It has received a degree of succour in its fight to preserve its ways by Scotland’s rural economy minister, Fergus Ewing. In comments that hint at a clash of interests inside the SNP between countryside and reformers, he said: “Our tourism sector is a vital strand of the rural economy and country sports represent a significant proportion of this. Forecasts suggest this area is set to continue to grow over the coming years, which will bring further gains to rural communities in terms of employment and economic benefits.” All the signs, though, are beginning to point in the direction of change on the moors. Perhaps, like many other old habits, this one has had its day. One of the first signatories to the e-petition on grouse shooting was Bill Oddie, the celebrated bird-watcher and naturalist. “At a time when wildlife is being abused all over the world, killing for fun is surely sacrilege,” he said. FAIR GAME? RED KITE
The reintroduction of the red kite to England and Scotland has been one of the major conservation success stories of the past 20 years. In the 1930s only two breeding pairs of red kites were known to survive in the British Isles, both in central Wales. Today the Welsh population is thought to number between 750 and 900 pairs in Wales, while the first reintroductions to England and Scotland took place in 1989. There are now believed to be around 2,700 pairs across the country. HEN HARRIER
The hen harrier is one of the most persecuted birds of prey in the UK. It is the subject of intense monitoring by variousconservation bodies. As it feeds on grouse, it has been a target of gamekeepers seeking to protect numbers on shooting estates which specialise in driven grouse shooting. In the breeding season UK birds are to be found on the upland heather moorlands of Wales, Northern England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. In winter they move to lowland farmland, coastal marshes and river valleys. Those found in eastern and south-east England are probably mostly visitors from mainland Europe. GOLDEN EAGLE
There are thought to be about 440 pairs of golden eagles nesting in Scotland, the majority in the Highlands and Islands and Caithness and Sutherland. Golden eagles became extinct in England and Wales owing to persecution by sheep farmers in the 18th century and gamekeepers in the 19th century. The Scottish Raptor Study Group believes in Scotland the eagle is scarcest in areas where field sports are most prevalent."
2016-08-07T10:26:21Z,uk-news,UK news,UK government 'abandoned and betrayed' six former soldiers jailed in India,"The British government has “abandoned and betrayed” six former soldiers jailed in India for carrying firearms while protecting boats from pirates, the sister of one of the men has said. The men, who were arrested in 2013, were among 35 crew members sentenced by an Indian court to five years in prison in January for carrying unlicensed firearms. They were held while working for an anti-piracy security company protecting commercial ships off the coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean. The men, who have been backed by more than 20 MPs including David Cameron, have consistently maintained their innocence and launched an appeal to overturn their sentences. A petition calling for their release has garnered 375,000 signatures. Now the sister of Nick Dunn has urged Theresa May and the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, to intervene in the case amid concerns that the men’s mental state is beginning to deteriorate. “Nick’s always maintained that he feels abandoned and betrayed by the government and the country that he once served,” Lisa Dunn told the Guardian. “Now we have a new government in place I would like to personally reach out to Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Sir Alan Duncan [a Foreign Office minister] and respectfully request that they continue to keep this case at the top of their agendas as we have been assured many times previously. “There is overwhelming evidence that supports the men and proves that they were not involved in any wrongdoing. I plead with you all to help us in seeking the justice my brother and his colleagues deserve and overturning this travesty as quickly as possible to allow my brother and the men to finally return home.” Dunn, from Ashington in Northumberland, said the British government had issued the licences for the weapons, including semi-automatic G3 assault rifles, which the Indian courts have claimed are automatic weapons and therefore prohibited. Last month Edward Bell, the British government’s head of export controls, confirmed to the Indian court that Vince Cable, the then business secretary, granted licences for the firearms in 2012 and 2013. Licences were issued for the export of hundreds of semi-automatic rifles, plus thousands of rounds of ammunition, from the UK weapons supplier Switchblade International to AdvanFort, the US company who had employed the men. In a letter sent on 5 July 2015, seen by the Guardian, Bell said: “These export licences authorised the export of arms and other equipment, which included semi-automatic assault rifles, to AdvanFort.” Cameron made a personal appeal last year to Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, on behalf of the Britons, who had served in Afghanistan and Iraq. The newly appointed minister for Asia, Alok Sharma, also raised the case with India’s external affairs ministry in July. Dunn added: “I appreciate and understand that the government have spoken to various Indian counterparts over the last nearly three years, but for the evidence that’s there it’s beyond belief that our government haven’t pushed harder. “They keep saying we’ve talked with this Indian counterpart, but it was apparent a long, long time ago that talking makes no difference to the Indian authorities. We need more robust action.” The men’s prison conditions are said to be dire. Dunn said the men sleep on concrete in cells infested with snakes and rats, using a hole in the ground for a toilet. Government officials pledged to try to push along the appeals process but a hearing last week was postponed at the last minute to the dismay of the mens’ families. Dunn said: “This is what the British government promised that they would help with. They said to us that we will ensure that the appeals process is heard as quickly as possible and that delays don’t happen anymore. But immediately at the first hurdle the British government have failed again. “The government know the guys are innocent but they’re not fighting hard enough and we don’t know why.” Last week the men’s families went to Downing Street to deliver a petition signed by 375,000 people demanding their release. They have the support of Richard Phillips, who was portrayed by Tom Hanks in the film Captain Phillips which tells the story of the 2009 Maersk Alabama hijacking. Aside from Nick Dunn, the other British men are Ray Tindall, from Chester; Billy Irving, from Connel, Argyll; Paul Towers, from Pocklington, east Yorkshire; John Armstrong, from Wigton, Cumbria; and Nicholas Simpson, from Catterick, North Yorkshire. Six of the 35-man crew are from Ukraine, 13 from Estonia and 10 are of Indian nationality. AdvanFort has said that any arms and ammunition on the MV Seaman Guard Ohio were used solely to safeguard commercial ships against piracy in high-risk areas and were held legally. Lisa Dunn said the men had each lost at least one and half stone in their first six months in prison and suffered dysentery when they first arrived. “It’s slowly starting to take its toll on them,” she said. “It will be seven months tomorrow that they got put back in prison [having been released on bail] and it’s apparent from the reports we’re getting back that they’re really starting to struggle.” The Rev Canon Ken Peters, a director at the Mission to Seafarers, a charity whose patron is the Queen, said that “yet again” the men protecting ships from piracy were under attack. “The unwarranted detention of the crew of the MV Seaman Guard Ohio, in India, because of their possession of armaments used to defend against criminal violence, has dragged on for 1,000 days,” he said. “There is still no end in sight for the judicial process which has been subjected to adjournment after adjournment, delay after delay. Whilst pirates roam free, the crew and guards are held in prison. This really is the wrong way round.” A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: “Our staff in India and the UK remain in regular contact with all six men and are continuing to support them and their families, working to make sure their welfare is protected in prison. “We recognise what a difficult time this is for those involved. We cannot interfere with India’s independent legal system, just as other countries cannot interfere with ours, but we will continue efforts to make sure this case is resolved swiftly. Ministers will continue to raise this case at the highest levels.”"
2016-08-07T12:26:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Briton's family baffled by arrest in Kenya over 100kg cocaine haul,"The family of a Scottish aristocrat have said they are “baffled” by his arrest on suspicion of trafficking nearly 100kg of cocaine into Kenya, adding that his innocence is “palpable and obvious”. Jack Marrian, 31, the grandson of the sixth Earl Cawdor, is accused of trying to import £2.2m worth of the drug in shipping containers. The sugar trader, who attended a prestigious Kenyan school with the British cyclist Chris Froome, is to find out on Monday whether he will be released on bail when he appears in court in Nairobi. His mother told the Guardian his arrest after the massive haul was discovered last week had stunned the family and left them “incredibly distressed”. Lady Emma Campbell said: “[He] cannot possibly have had anything to do with the drugs. We are all hoping the legal system will find it fair to give Jack bail, so he can continue to assist the Kenyan police with their enquiries. “He has already cooperated with the police fully, so much so, the police saw fit to allow him out of custody for two days to be able to get them all the documents pertaining to the case they needed. He personally took them to the anti-narcotics division of CID at the time appointed. “We are baffled why they chose to re-arrest him and throw the trafficking charge at him, as his innocence is palpable and obvious. “We understand the Kenyan police must do due diligence in their research but we are expecting that they will see that Jack cannot possibly have had anything to do with the drugs discovered in the container which was also carrying his company shipment of sugar.” Campbell described some media coverage of her son’s arrest as “irresponsible and irrelevant”, adding: “We are very concerned for Jack’s wellbeing and fair treatment. So far he has been treated well in custody, for which we are grateful. We have great confidence in Jack’s lawyers Mr Sheetal Kapila and Mr Andrew Wandabwa and that Jack will soon be back with us.” The 100kg cocaine haul was found by Kenyan police and US Drug Enforcement Agency officials in containers that had arrived from Brazil at the main Kenyan seaport at Mombasa last week. The containers were labelled as carrying sugar destined for Uganda. The prosecution says documents found on the ship used to transport the cargo named Marrian as a director of Mshale Uganda Ltd, the firm that was to receive the containers. The maximum penalty for drug trafficking in Kenya is a life sentence and a fine of more than $10,000 (£7,600). Marrian, whose full name is Jack Alexander Wolf Marrian, was born into the famous line of Scottish nobility known as the Clan Campbell of Cawdor. He is the managing director of Mshale Commodities, the Kenyan importer that police allege was due to receive the shipment containing the cocaine. Large drug seizures are rare in Kenya, which has become a cocaine distribution hub in recent years, according to the UN and the US. Traffickers from South America are said to take advantage of Nairobi’s extensive air links to Europe and Asia."

A 29-year-old man from Solihull in the West Midlands handed himself in to police on Sunday and was detained on suspicion of assault. The arrest follows a suspected road rage attack on Friday evening in Kitts Green, that left a 37-year-old man in an induced coma in hospital. Police believe the victim was driving home from work to his partner and four-year-old child when his car and the van driven by the suspect were involved in a minor collision. Both men got out of their vehicles on to the road when the van driver allegedly punched the victim, police say. The man remains in hospital. His family have been made aware of the arrest and continue to be supported by specialist officers. DC Katie Lees, from Birmingham’s violent crime team, said on Saturday: “This was a vicious attack on a family man who was on his way home to his partner and four-year-old child. The road is really busy and we are sure there were lots of people who would have seen what happened and we are appealing for them to come forward. “The victim phoned home as he left work – like he does every night – to say that he was on his way. His partner became worried when he didn’t arrive home and it must have been devastating for them to discover the news that he had been injured in such a random and vicious attack.” Police had appealed for information for the van driver, saying on Saturday they had several lines of inquiry and that it was “only a matter of time before we come knocking at your door”. The 29-year-old man has not been charged and is helping police with their inquiries."

Approximately 2,000 people were blocked from entering central Belfast by riot squad officers and up to 30 armoured land rovers at the bottom of the Falls Road. The Anti Internment League held a parade on Sunday to mark the 45th anniversary of the introduction of internment without trial by the Stormont administration, with the support of the UK government, during the height of the Troubles in August 1971. The controversial policy of detaining terrorist suspects without trial ended four years later. Organisers claimed internment was still being used against republicans opposed to the peace process and power sharing in Northern Ireland through the use of lengthy remand periods before trials. Speaking at police lines on the spot where the march was not allowed to go any further, the league’s spokesman Gerard Fitzpatrick said the ban proved it was a myth that Belfast “was a shared city for all”. The Parades Commission, the body which adjudicates on contentious marches in Northern Ireland, ruled last month that the march should not be allowed into Belfast’s central shopping district. Last year three men and a woman were arrested during a riot after the same march was barred from the city centre. The Anti Internment League said it planned to take a civil legal action against the commission’s decision."

Appearance: A loudmouth foreigner in a Hawaiian shirt, demanding an upgrade. How dare you talk about me like that. Are you a Scottish lord? I am, although I prefer the term “laird”. Then I apologise. What’s your full title? I am Laird of Glencairn. You can check my credit card if you don’t believe me. Did you inherit this title? No. I purchased it. Online? For £30? Yes. From a company that promised you the title in return for buying 8 sq in of a Highland estate? Yes. Then be careful. The Court of the Lord Lyon, the official heraldic authority for Scotland, has just reaffirmed that titles bought online have no legal status. But I was just about to apply for a coat of arms. You definitely shouldn’t do that. The Court of the Lord Lyon would be furious. Its website has just been updated specifically to warn off people like you. What does it say? “In general, the governing factor in the case of an original Grant of Arms is the domicile of the petitioner rather than the ownership of property in Scotland.” Basically, you don’t get a coat of arms unless you actually live in Scotland. Do you live in Scotland? No. It also states the requirement that “the petitioner should be, in terms of the Lyon King of Arms Act 1672, a ‘virtuous and well-deserving person’”. Are you a virtuous and well-deserving person? Well, I call myself Laird on my credit cards in the hope that I will get a better table at a restaurant, so I suppose not. Just to make it completely clear, then, the Court of the Lord Lyon says: “The ownership of ‘souvenir’ plots of land of a few square feet or thereby, such as are marketed from time to time, is insufficient to bring anyone within the jurisdiction of the Lord Lyon King of Arms.” What does that mean? It means you are a weird fraud with ideas far above your station. It does get me good seats in restaurants, though. It does? Where can I buy one of these titles? Do say: “I am Laird of Glencairn.” Don’t say: “And so am I. And so is he. And everyone over there. And so is that guy’s dog.”"
2016-08-07T23:01:16Z,uk-news,UK news,"Third Heathrow runway would push up air fares, say campaigners","Passengers would be forced to pay substantially higher air fares if a new runway was built in the south-east and Britain kept to its carbon targets, according to an analysis of the Airports Commission’s backing for a third runway at Heathrow. A report published by the Campaign for Better Transport claims that carbon pricing, a measure the commission suggested could be needed to ensure British aviation emissions remain on target, would add hundreds of pounds to air fares by 2050, spelling the end of low-cost flights. Another consequence of the Airports Commission’s analysis is that growth at regional airports would have to be restricted to allow expanded capacity at Heathrow. A member of the government-appointed commission said that prohibitive pricing or other measures to curb demand for air travel would be needed whether or not a new runway was built in the south-east.
The CBT report, Air Traffic Controls, claims that the additional carbon price to offset the growing demand in air travel from a new runway could amount to more than the cost of the ticket itself on some flight. The extra costs, implied by the commission’s data but not previously calculated, would be up to £127 for return flights from Manchester to Tenerife, £148 from Newcastle to Sharm el-Sheikh or £221 from London to Florida.
Leo Murray, one of the report’s authors, said: “There has been far too little scrutiny of the Airports Commission’s proposals for squaring airport expansion in the south-east with the UK’s climate change targets, with the details hidden deep inside hundreds of pages of technical reports. Building a new runway, while still meeting our climate change commitments, is expected to add hundreds of pounds to the cost of flights from all of the UK’s airports if the commission’s proposals are enacted.” Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: “If the government approves a new runway in the south-east, it risks either breaking the national carbon budget, or pricing those on lower incomes out of the sky entirely. The Airports Commission uses heroic assumptions about technology and efficiency improvements which are at odds with the government’s own analysis. Worse, the huge sums the commission proposes adding to the cost of plane tickets to allow a new runway to be built have so far gone almost unnoticed.” However, Julia King, who was on the commission and is a member of the Committee on Climate Change, said it was impossible to make accurate fare predictions for 2050, but that the level was irrelevant to the commission’s verdict on runways. “We already have enough runway capacity in Britain to exceed carbon emissions as it is,” she said. “The reality is that independently of whether we build a new runway or not, we will have to control the increase in flights.”
The CBT report shows price rises are likely to see regional airports decline while London’s grow. King said that while it could seem “a harsh message”, the commission’s analysis of catchment areas and hub activity meant only expansion in the south-east would make longhaul flights to key destinations economically viable for airlines. “Clearly there would need to be slower growth at regional airports generally if you have additional capacity in London. All the indications were that the big demand is in the south-east.” She added: “If we are to have to compensate for reduced trade with the EU post-Brexit, the longhaul requirements become even more critical – and our conclusion that the need is best fulfilled from Heathrow becomes even stronger.” A Heathrow spokesperson said: “Heathrow supports the international aviation industry’s commitment to carbon-neutral growth from 2020 and the UN’s international civil aviation organisation, which plans to introduce a mandatory carbon offset system to achieve this goal.” A spokesperson for Gatwick airport said: “Our analysis shows that expansion at Heathrow would be significantly less carbon-efficient than expansion at Gatwick.” He added that Gatwick had pledged to cap landing charges, meaning fares would stay lower."
2016-08-07T23:01:16Z,uk-news,UK news,"Build a better HS3 now to rebalance economy and boost north, says IPPR","The government should prioritise the creation of a more ambitious high-speed rail network linking England’s northern cities to address the “stark” shortfall in investment compared with London, according to a UK thinktank. The IPPR says the chancellor, Philip Hammond, should take advantage of record low government borrowing costs to fund an ambitious new HS3 scheme. This high-speed line could connect Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle and other major cities, boosting economic growth across the region.
At present, the Institute for Public Policy Research says the government plans to spend just £280 per person on infrastructure projects in the north in the next five years. In contrast, London will get £1,870 per person between now and 2021. Tom Kibasi, Director of IPPR in London, says Britain needs to urgently upgrade its transport networks to match other advanced economies, and make it easier to travel around the country. “The time it takes to travel, on hugely dated infrastructure, between our great regional cities is a national disgrace – this is just not what happens in Germany, Japan or France, with their fantastic rail links, or the United States, with its highly developed regional air travel,” Kibasi says. Kibasi argues that Britain’s vote to leave the EU shows that regions away from London need more support. “Given the Brexit result, the north of England must urgently see growing prosperity. A proper east-west crossing would boost northern and UK growth, and must now take priority above all other major transport projects, including Crossrail 2 and HS2,” he added. London’s figures are skewed by Crossrail – the £7bn railway line under the capital, running from Reading and Heathrow in the west to stations across Essex in the east. Former chancellor George Osborne announced £60m to develop a plan for a new rail link between Manchester and Leeds in his March budget. Those cities are divided by the Pennines, making the 40-mile journey longer and more hassle than travellers would like.
The IPPR believe HS3 should be more ambitious to help more northern cities and to connect assets such as ports and national parks. The yields on UK government debt, or gilts, are at record lows, meaning the UK can borrow for a decade at just 0.7% per year. Hammond has suggested he could reset the government’s fiscal policy in the autumn statement, due later this year, and some City experts expect a jump in government borrowing and spending. David Owen, economist at investment bank Jefferies, agrees that the government should rethink its plans. “To the extent that Brexit represents a supply shock this also brings fiscal policy much more to the fore – perhaps with infrastructure bonds for infrastructure projects that the BoE ends up buying – as low gilt yields give the government more room for manoeuvre,” Owen said. People in the east Midlands are particularly starved of government cash, the IPPR found, with just £193 per capita coming their way between now and 2012 through the national infrastructure pipeline. The south-west is the next deprived, at £219 per person. Even if Crossrail is stripped out, Londoners are still due to receive £1,364 over the next five years. Lord Adonis, who was secretary of state for transport in the last Labour government, has argued that HS3 would help create a new generation of skilled workers. Writing in the Guardian in April, Adonis said: “High-speed rail will demand a high-skilled workforce – 50% of which is likely to require NVQ level 3 (A-level) qualification or above. Under existing demands the UK is, notoriously, failing to attract and train a sufficient number of engineers. That’s why the creation of two high-speed rail colleges in Birmingham and Doncaster is so important.”"
2016-08-07T23:01:16Z,uk-news,UK news,UK should monitor population with 'unique person numbers' – thinktank,"British people should be given a “unique person number” to help the government keep track of the population following the vote for Brexit, according to a new report by a leading thinktank. The paper from Policy Exchange said people feel Britain is being used as an “economic transit camp” and these fears could be allayed by creating a “population register”.
The controversial idea is likely to be met with opposition from civil liberties campaigners who stopped the Blair government bringing in ID cards. But the report said the numbers would not mean people carrying cards, but would help to distinguish between full and temporary citizens. David Goodhart, the author of the report, said: “Roughly 2 million people arrive in the UK on visas every year and too many are overstaying. We have to urgently address the resentment that people feel about the fact that some migrants use Britain as a sort of economic transit camp. “The government needs to get a grip on who is coming into Britain, where they are living and what public services they are accessing. A British population register which differentiates between full and temporary citizens will help the government concentrate rights, benefits and integration efforts on those who are making a full commitment to the country.” Policy Exchange, which was founded by the former Conservative ministers Michael Gove and Nick Boles in 2002, is considered an independent thinktank on the centre-right and has been addressed by leading Labour politicians as well as Conservative leaders over the years.
The paper says the databases of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), HMRC and the Home Office do not share information, meaning most people have several unique identifiers, such as an NHS number, National Insurance number and passport number. It claimed a unique person number stored in a central register would give the government a much more informed picture of migration flows. Goodhart argues that temporary citizens on visas such as students and short-term migrant workers – who currently account for two-thirds of the annual inflow into Britain – would not have full access to social and political rights, would not have an automatic right to bring in dependents and would leave after a specific period of time. He also suggested EU citizens who have been living in Britain for more than five years should be offered a special cut-price ‘Brexit citizenship’ and EU citizens should have to get work permits to come to the UK after leaving the EU."

The fatal shooting occurred in the Ballysillan area of north Belfast at about 9.50pm on Sunday night. It is understood that the killing is connected to a feud within the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), the loyalist paramilitary organisation. There have been violent clashes in recent months between the two rival UDA factions with the trouble centred on Carrickfergus on the East Antrim coast outside Belfast.
The victim has been named locally as John “Bonzer” Boland. Northern Ireland secretary James Brokenshire said he was “concerned to hear of the fatal shooting in north Belfast”, adding, “there is no place for violence in communities”. First minister Arlene Foster said she was, “shocked and disgusted” and urged “everyone to work with the police as they investigate.”"
2016-08-08T05:00:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Southern trains crisis: seven factors that threw services off the rails,"What has caused the crisis at Southern Railway and what is the dispute about? An emergency timetable, cutting over 300 daily services a day to help ensure a more resilient and predictable service, has failed to stem the problem. Operating company Govia Thameslink Railway now admits it does not know when what was intended as a temporary measure will be abandoned. To compound Southern passengers’ misery, five days of strike action start on Monday. Here are seven factors contributing to the mess. A sprawling franchise Its parent company, Govia, had operated Southern trains since 2001 relatively happily (stress on relatively – one key Brighton-London morning service was recorded arriving late every single journey throughout 2014). It had also operated Thameslink from privatisation until 2008. But since the two and Great Northern were linked as part of a new Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise, problems appear to have been compounded. The franchise was drafted, in a relatively unusual way, as a long-term management contract due to the challenges any operator was set to face (with the Thameslink upgrade programme and the redevelopment of London Bridge). Govia Thameslink Railway is paid to operate a service rather than being incentivised to maximise the revenue, as train companies generally are elsewhere. That means GTR only faces relatively small financial penalties for not meeting its service requirements – with its customers, paying thousands for season tickets, usually having no alternative but to struggle on to the trains. Engineering works At the geographical heart of the mega-franchise awarded to GTR in 2014 is the Thameslink programme, which has seen years of track work and redevelopment of stations, and most notably the rebuilding of London Bridge. With the introduction of new trains, this will allow much more efficient, metro-style services in central London from 2018. But the programme has caused immense disruption to commuters now – and 47 million passenger journeys on Southern pass through London Bridge.
Beyond this work, Southern has also been affected by signal failures, flooding and sinkholes under its tracks – infrastructure problems for which Network Rail is responsible, but affects the train company’s service and passengers. New trains Rolling stock ordered for both Southern and Thameslink will eventually mean more capacity for passengers but presented another logistical issue for GTR. It means retraining drivers: taking them off the normal operational timetable (trainers as well as trainees), contributing to staff shortages (see below). And the new trains also are intended for driver-only operation, potentially allowing conductors to be phased out as the driver takes sole charge of the doors – the issue at the heart of the industrial dispute. Staff shortages In a Commons select committee hearing, GTR admitted that it had underestimated the shortfall in drivers needed to operate the trains. Even the numbers they had reckoned on would rely on overtime, something train crew were happy to do for a premium. But overtime requires goodwill, which has vanished rapidly, meaning there just aren’t enough train crew to fill the rosters. Among conductors, meanwhile, sickness levels have almost doubled since the first strikes were called earlier this year – an incidence that GTR and ministers viewed as unofficial industrial action, a claim strongly rejected by unions. Industrial action Strikes called in May and June this year by the RMT marked a new phase of unreliability on Southern. The RMT and drivers’ union Aslef have agreed to oppose any extension of driver-only operation on trains, with the unions believing they had too readily conceded the principle in the past. Southern argues that it is an established practice on much of the British railway network – including on other parts of the GTR franchise. Longer trains have CCTV in the driver’s cab which should allow them to see clearly if anyone is attempting to board.
Many in the industry, including the Rail Safety and Standards Board, agree that it is fundamentally safe, with more station staff deployed to help dispatch a train on stations with curved platforms, or where there is reduced visibility. Unions, though, have compiled a list of incidents where passengers have been seriously injured when trapped between the train and platform or dragged along in closing doors. It is likely that risk analysts consider the numbers at an acceptably low level: the Department for Transport puts the value of preventing a fatality at about £1.96m (based on 2014 figures adjusted for inflation). For some, the question of who opens the doors is itself less of a concern than the fear that, once this duty is removed, conductors would be regarded as expendable, whatever the current pledges on having a second onboard staff member – with implications for passenger safety in unattended carriages, as well as in the possible event of an accident or the driver being incapacitated. Growth in rail usage
Rail passenger numbers have grown to record levels and three-quarters of journeys are around London and the south-east. More people pushed further out by house prices and looking to commute by rail, more pressure on services: there are 620,000 passenger journeys per day on Southern trains alone. Problems with rolling stock have also contributed to Southern often running shorter trains, exacerbating overcrowding. As well as being unpleasant for passengers – and making it impossible for some to board – crowding prolongs what should be quick stops at stations on busy commuter routes, meaning delays accumulate further. The financial context The stated ambition of the government has been to drive down the costs of rail, transferring more of the cost from taxpayer to passengers – but raising fares has become politically toxic. A 2011 report by Sir Roy McNulty said that costs in the UK were up to a third more expensive than in comparable European countries, for a variety of reasons. The DfT has looked to ensure new franchises drive down costs, and staffing is an obvious target – driver-only operation, enabled further on new fleets of train, could do that."

Picket lines are expected across the train operator’s network, including London Victoria and Brighton.

2016-08-08T11:19:00Z,uk-news,UK news,"Dr Edward Daly, cleric who helped wounded during Bloody Sunday, dies aged 82","The Catholic cleric who waved a white handkerchief to protect civilians during the Bloody Sunday shootings in Derry in 1972 has died. Dr Edward Daly, who later served as bishop of Derry from 1974 to 1993 was battling cancer in recent weeks. He was 82. Television footage of the atrocity includes a picture of the then priest waving the white handkerchief as he tried to bring wounded civilians through army lines to be treated by a doctor.
Thirteen people were killed when the Parachute Regiment opened fire on a civil rights march in Derry. The image of Daly waving the handkerchief is now portrayed on a mural to commemorate Bloody Sunday in the city. Daly was made a freeman of Derry, and won numerous Irish and international peace prizes for his work not only on Bloody Sunday but throughout the Troubles. The current Catholic bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, paid tribute to Daly for his work for peace and reconciliation in Ireland. He said: “Bishop Daly served, without any concern for himself, throughout the traumatic years of the Troubles, finding his ministry shaped by the experience of witnessing violence and its effects. Through this dreadful period he always strove to preach the gospel of the peace of Christ. “Bishop Daly provided an example of priestly ministry which was exemplary, inspired by service of God and the people he encountered. His ministry was characterised by his deep love of the people of this diocese, his dedicated visitation of parishes and his constant availability to others. “The bishops, priests and people of the diocese were blessed to have such a dedicated and faithful priest among them.”"

Researchers suggest that in official surveys people are under-reporting the number of calories they consume. This is causing health experts to focus on increasing people’s physical activity, rather than cutting their calorie intake. If calorie counts were correct, they say, the UK population would actually be losing weight. Participants in the study consumed closer to 3,000 calories on average, compared to the 2,000 often reported by adults in official statistics. A lack of awareness of the amount of calories contained in snacks, difficulty keeping track of snacking, and a desire to lose weight could all be responsible, according to the report. Although increasing physical activity is central to human health, researchers suggest that obesity-reduction efforts must focus mainly on reducing calorie consumption.

2016-08-08T14:03:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Stephen Lawrence: new images of potential witness released,"Detectives investigating the racially motivated murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence more than 23 years ago have issued new CCTV images of a potential witness they want to trace. Lawrence, 18, a would-be architect, was stabbed to death by a group of up to six white youths in an unprovoked racist attack as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London with a friend on 22 April 1993. New footage, which officers have digitally enhanced, shows a man who has never been identified wearing a distinctive V emblem jacket in an off-licence on Well Hall Road in Eltham at 8pm on the night Lawrence was murdered. The off-licence was 330 yards from the bus stop where he was attacked later that night.
It took more than 18 years before two of Lawrence’s killers – Gary Dobson and David Norris – were brought to justice. The pair were jailed for life in January 2012 for their role in the attack. The Metropolitan police said they would continue to pursue others involved. Releasing the new images of the potential witness, DCI Chris Le Pere, who is in charge of the investigation, said: “We are appealing for this man to come forward so we can speak to him to establish if he can assist with our inquiries, or if we can eliminate this strand of the investigation. “He was seen in the off-licence at 8pm and then again later that night not far from where Stephen was attacked. It is important that we speak with him. “The image of the distinctive jumper was previously circulated to media in 1993 and again in 2013. The CCTV was recently identified as part of a regular internal review of the case. Officers digitally enhanced it to give us the clearest possible image, and having carried out inquiries to trace him, now release it again to make a public appeal. “The investigation remains open. Two individuals were found guilty of murder, but officers continue to follow lines of inquiry. We are hoping that over the passage of time allegiances may have changed, people may have moved away and feel more confident coming forward.” Following an initial confrontation with a group of men, Lawrence was stabbed on Dickson Road. He escaped from the group and ran about 130 yards before collapsing. The suspects ran down Dickson Road. Lawrence was taken to Brook hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after arrival. Witnesses have previously reported seeing a man in a distinctive green jacket with the V emblem in the vicinity of Well Hall Road at about the same time Lawrence was attacked. As well as this witness, detectives believe there may have been others in the area who have never come forward or who have not been traced. One key reason witnesses were believed to have been put off was the belief in the area that some police officers were in the pocket of Clifford Norris – the father of David Norris, who was convicted alongside Dobson after forensic evidence tied them to the scene of the 1993 murder. Three other suspects remain free. Neil and Jamie Acourt and Luke Knight deny involvement in the murder. Detectives hoped the long-awaited convictions, and the passage of time, would lead to new evidence emerging, and some people coming forward who previously had been reluctant to do so. Detectives believe the witnesses they know were in the area and who have never been traced may have crucial information even if they did not see the murder or attack onLawrence. Witnesses to the events or individuals leading up to the attack could also be highly important, and potentially be the trigger for a fresh prosecution. This is because if a suspect could be placed as being part of the group that chased and attacked Lawrence, that would open the prospect of them being prosecuted under joint enterprise. The convictions of Dobson and Norris did not rely on evidence they had stabbed Lawrence. The forensic and DNA evidence was enough to convince a jury they were part of the attacking group engaged in a joint enterprise to murder him.
The Met was told to find the reluctant witnesses by the judge in the trial of Dobson and Norris. After sentencing the pair, Mr Justice Treacy said in January 2012: “The convictions of Gary Dobson and David Norris will not hopefully close the file on this matter. On the evidence before the court, there are still three or four other killers of Stephen Lawrence at large. “Just as advances in science have brought two people to justice, I hope the Metropolitan police will be alert to future lines of inquiry not only based on advances in science but perhaps also from information from those who have been silent so far, whoever they might be.” In addition to the man in the V emblem jacket, there are at least three other male witnesses police wish to trace who were close to the spot where Lawrence was murdered. The 1998 Macpherson inquiry into the police handling of the original murder investigation found evidence of institutional racism within the Met. An independent review, led by Mark Ellison, who led the prosecution that saw Dobson and Norris convicted, was published in March 2014 and prompted the then home secretary Theresa May to appoint a senior judge to lead another public inquiry, this time to examine a wide range of allegations surrounding the conduct of undercover police officers since 1968. The latest inquiry, led by Lord Justice Pitchford, is to hold public hearings into the police’s covert infiltration of hundreds of political groups. Pitchford will be scrutinising issues such as the long-term relationships formed by undercover officers with women, the theft of dead children’s identities and the monitoring of politicians. However, the Met is attempting to have large parts of the inquiry held in secret – a move criticised by the Lawrence family. In 2013, the 20th anniversary of Lawrence’s death, the Met commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, vowed to catch the remaining at-large suspects. He made the promise to Lawrence’s mother, Doreen, now Lady Lawrence, at a memorial service. “After taking too long, we did get convictions in two cases last year, and what we’re going to do is catch the other people involved,” Hogan-Howe said. “The Met won’t forget Stephen Lawrence.”"

The picture, uploaded to the GMP Traffic account, showed the pair wearing SS uniforms standing next to a German military Kübelwagen used in the second world war. The caption said: “M66 J22 on the west Yorkshire border. These two likely lads trying to invade.” The posting of the tweet on Sunday provoked a backlash from people who criticised it as offensive and insensitive. Among them was Shulem Stern, a member of the orthodox Jewish community in Stamford Hill, north London. He retweeted the offending post with the words “not right”, copying in GMP’s main Twitter account, as well as those of the force’s chief constable, Ian Hopkins, and its assistant chief constable. Shortly after he contacted them, the offending post was deleted and GMP tweeted Stern, saying: “It has been removed and we will speak to those involved. It was unacceptable.” A GMP spokesman said: “A tweet was posted on a GMP local social media account on Sunday 7 August 2016, which caused offence to a number of people. “This post was deleted as soon as were made aware of it and we apologise for its content, as it was unacceptable. This matter has been referred to GMP’s professional standards branch.”"
2016-08-08T15:19:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Firefighters tackle two major blazes in south-east London,"Scores of firefighters backed by 20 fire engines have been tackling two separate blazes in south-east London, one of which has closed the Blackwall tunnel. About 100 firefighters were dispatched to a fire in Greenwich’s Tunnel Avenue, where flames and thick black smoke rose into the air above local landmarks near the major commuting route, including the O2 Arena. One person, who suffered burns, was taken to hospital as a result of the blaze, which began on Monday morning and is expected to take until the evening to extinguish. About two hours after the alarm about the Greenwich fire was raised, 72 firefighters were called to a blaze at a new block of flats on the high street in Erith where they rescued a woman from the building. London fire brigade (LFB) said it received the first of more than 50 emergency calls about the Greenwich fire at about 11.45am on Monday and dispatched 15 fire engines from nine different stations to the scene.
Winston Douglas, the station manager at Islington fire station, said: “Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus rescued a man who has been taken to hospital by ambulance. This is a large fire and the smoke could be seen from across London, meaning we received a large number of emergency calls. Firefighters will be at the scene for the rest of the day, and possibly into the evening. “If you’re affected by smoke our advice is to keep doors and windows closed.”
A large part of the ground floor and part of the first floor of the Studio 338 nightclub, one of the country’s biggest, were on fire. An industrial warehouse was completely alight and a scrap paper processing yard containing a number of outbuildings was partly alight, with 40 pallets of paper ablaze. A London ambulance service (LAS) spokeswoman said they sent a single responder in a car, an ambulance crew, the hazardous area response team, two incident response officers and the air ambulance to the scene. “We treated one patient at the scene for burns,” she said. “They were taken to hospital by London’s air ambulance. We remain on the scene.” The firefighters’ job has been made more difficult by the presence of gas cylinders at the scene, which are at risk of exploding when exposed to heat. As a result a safety cordon has been set up around the site.
The LFB was called to the Erith fire at 1.35pm. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus rescued a woman from the building who was treated by LAS. Ten fire engines from nine different stations were sent to the blaze, which damaged part of two flats on the fifth floor, a communal corridor and the roof of the building."
2016-08-08T15:21:54Z,uk-news,UK news,Kenya: aristocrat's son's bail overturned after drug-smuggling charge,"A Kenyan court’s decision that the son of a Scottish aristocrat could be released on bail after being charged with smuggling 100kg (220lb) of cocaine into the country has been suspended by Kenya’s high court. Jack Marrian, 31, appeared in court in Nairobi on Monday morning after four nights in a Kenyan prison following the £2.2m drugs haul. The British sugar trader, the grandson of the sixth Earl Cawdor, was arrested after Kenyan police and US Drug Enforcement Agency officials seized a huge quantity of cocaine in containers that had arrived from Brazil at the main Kenyan seaport at Mombasa last week. But his family has maintained his innocence and told the Guardian they were “baffled” by his arrest. Marrian “cannot possible have had anything to do” with the drugs, his mother, Lady Emma Campbell, said, describing his innocence as “palpable and obvious”. Campbell, an interior designer, and Marrian’s father, the artist David Marrian, looked on as their son was granted bail by a magistrate. Senior resident magistrate Derrick Kuto rejected an application to deny the accused bail, saying the prosecution had offered no compelling reason to support their plea. He cited precedents in other Commonwealth jurisdictions including Nigeria to indicate that suspects in drug trafficking cases were entitled to bail, but said he had decided to impose unusually stringent terms to reflect the seriousness of the case. In addition to the bail amount of 70m shillings (£530,000), Marrian will have to find two Kenyans to stand surety. He was also asked to deposit his passport to court and to report to the investigative officer once a week. An application by Marrian’s lawyers for him to be taken back to the Kileleshwa police station in an upmarket suburb of Nairobi while the bail was being processed was rejected. Shortly after the hearing, Kenya’s director of public prosecutions, Keriako Tobiko, announced he would move to the high court to challenge the decision to free Marrrian and co-accused Roy Mwanthi, saying both might seek to jump bail and flee the country. The high court will hear arguments on Marrian’s and Mwanthi’s bail applications on Tuesday. Until those judges rule, Marrian is expected to remain in custody. The prosecution has said documents found on the ship used to transport the cargo named Marrian as a director of Mshale Uganda Ltd, the firm that was to receive the containers. The maximum penalty for drug trafficking in Kenya is a life sentence and a fine of more than $10,000 (£7,600). Marrian, whose full name is Jack Alexander Wolf Marrian, was born into the Clan Campbell of Cawdor line of Scottish nobility. He is the managing director of Mshale Commodities, the Kenyan importer that police allege was due to receive the shipment containing the cocaine. A spokeswoman for Mshale Commodities said after the bail hearing: “Mshale will continue to provide whatever support is required to ensure that justice is done based on facts and evidence. We are confident that Jack Marrian will be fully exonerated once the facts are presented.” Large drug seizures are rare in Kenya, which has become a cocaine distribution hub in recent years, according to the UN and the US. Traffickers from South America are said to take advantage of Nairobi’s extensive air links to Europe and Asia."
2016-08-08T15:34:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Oil rig runs aground in storm off Western Isles of Scotland,"The first attempt to refloat a 17,000-tonne drilling platform that was blown ashore during a storm off the Western Isles of Scotland could start on Tuesday. The Transocean Winner, which has 280 tonnes of diesel onboard, ran aground on the west coast of the Isle of Lewis early on Monday morning as it was being towed from Norway to Malta. No one was onboard when the rig’s tow line snapped in heavy seas. The beach at Dalmore, near Carloway, where the rig is ashore has been closed for safety reasons. A known beauty spot, Dalmore is highly regarded among surfers. Salvage experts and coastguard officials will meet the UK government’s maritime salvage representative, Hugh Shaw, at the site on Tuesday morning, to agree on a plan to refloat the 93-metre-long vessel. There is not thought to be any damage to the vessel or an immediate risk of the fuel leaking, but pollution specialists with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) are monitoring surrounding seas. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has launched an investigation into the incident, which has reignited the long-running row over the UK government’s decision in 2012 to withdraw emergency tug cover from the west coast. The only emergency tug available for the north and west of Scotland, the MCA’s vessel Herakles, has been sent to the scene from Orkney. Alasdair Allan, the local Scottish National party MSP and a Scottish government minister, said he was grateful no one had been hurt but added: “It does leave us with a significant environmental threat to deal with. “I am also deeply concerned to hear that the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s nearest emergency towing vessel was in the region of 14 hours away.”"
2016-08-08T15:44:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Top police officers' allowances and perks boost basic pay by 21%,"Britain’s police chiefs have their basic pay boosted by an average of 21% by allowances and benefits – many of them undeclared – according to Whitehall’s senior pay advisers. The unexpected scale of the continuing allowances and perks enjoyed by senior police officers will add to the pressure on police forces, led by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, to reveal how much their chief officers receive in benefits and perks over and above their basic pay. The drive for transparency in the rewards enjoyed by most senior officers follows the disclosure that one chief constable is living in a rent-free apartment in a castle, another took 64 days holiday in a year while a third claimed £30,000 in “allowances”, including money for his food and household bills. The details of a limited number of the locally determined allowances and benefits received by chief constables on top of their nationally set basic salaries emerged after a series of Freedom of Information Act requests by the Daily Mail. But many forces declined to release full details of their chief constables’ reward packages. The senior salaries review body, which reviews top public sector pay including for Britain’s 200 chief police officers, has been pressing forces to release full details of their allowances and benefits for more than a year. “We have been told that the provision of allowances and benefits to our remit group members varies greatly across police forces. We lack full details of what is received where, but … we provide a list of those details which we have been able to establish,” the SSRB said in its report on top police pay three weeks ago. “The Home Office told us that, before the Winsor review [a government commissioned inquiry into police pay and conditions], chief police officers received additional payments worth on average 21% of basic pay for chief constables and less for other ranks. In the future, it will be very important that we understand the value of these benefits at the time of our review.” The Whitehall senior pay advisers have been calling on the Home Office to provide them with an update on the exact current proportion of senior officer pay accounted for by allowances and benefits since the Winsor review was carried out in 2011. That review established that deputy chief constables received allowances and perks worth 14% on top of their basic pay while assistant chief constables got a further 10%. The senior salaries review body said that under national guidelines drawn up in 2003, chief police officers can receive relocation and removal expenses when a chief police officer moves home when joining a police force. All police officers also have the option of a “motor vehicle allowance”. Police and crime commissioners have discretion to top up a chief constable’s basic pay by up to 10% and can provide private healthcare schemes or medical insurance. They can also provide access to a car pool or a dedicated car at a value determined locally. They also usually agree to cover part of the costs of legal protection insurance. The SSRB, however, published details from only one force – the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Its chief constable receives a maximum of £18,000 rent/housing allowance on top of an £199,413 salary, a car allowance of £8,895, a healthcare allowance of £600 and a broadband allowance of £360. Rudd said she expected all forces to publish the details. “Directly elected PCCs are rightly responsible for decisions about the pay and allowances of their chief officers, and we are clear that these should be transparent and open to scrutiny by the communities they serve,” she said. “I am adamant that police forces cannot be opaque about such important matters, and I fully expect all forces to publish details of how they are spending taxpayer money.” Police chief officer pay is set by the Home Office on the recommendation of the senior salaries review body. Any expense payments outside the national regulations, including relocation costs, require approval by a force’s police and crime commissioner, who has the power to set such payments. Mark Polin, the chairman of the Chief Police Officers Staff Association (CPOSA), said the system had to strike a balance between value for money for the taxpayer and the need to recruit the best people for the top policing jobs. He said the staff association had long sought clarity on a “national remuneration framework”, including allowances and annual leave. He said: “We favour consistency and transparency on these issues, with investigations and appropriate action against any misuse. “There is a concern – shared by CPOSA, the National Police Chiefs Council, Home Office and Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary – that the number of applicants for top positions in the country is declining. Any system must strike the right balance between fair reward and value for taxpayers, allowing us to attract and retain talent across the country.”"
2016-08-08T17:27:50Z,uk-news,UK news,"EDF decision on Hinkley Point should be declared void, say French unions","EDF’s decision to invest in the £18bn Hinkley Point should be declared invalid, French trade unions have said, as pressure builds against the troubled nuclear power plant project. A trio of unions at the French firm said senior board members knew that the UK government was considering delaying its final decision on Hinkley, but nothing was said before last month’s vote on whether EDF should back the project. Jean-Bernard Lévy, the chairman and chief executive of EDF, sent a letter to fellow board members this month in which he admitted knowing about the probable delay before the board met to approve building and co-funding the first British nuclear power plant in a generation.
Theresa May quashed hopes that Hinkley would finally go ahead at last when it was announced that final government approval would be postponed until early autumn. The announcement came just hours before a signing ceremony was scheduled to take place at the site in Somerset, south-west England. The prime minister is thought to have ordered a delay owing to concerns about the role of China General Nuclear, which has a one-third stake in the Hinkley project. Unions said they believed some EDF board members knew the delay was probable, meaning the board’s approval – by 10 votes to seven – should be overturned. “Our three unions denounce this information asymmetry,” said the CGT, CFE-CGC and FO in a joint statement. “They therefore consider that the board’s Hinkley Point decision, taken on the basis of incomplete information, is null and void.” The three unions said the UK government’s supposed desire for a swift resolution had been cited by EDF’s leadership as a key reason to vote in favour of the project. The moderate CFDT union, which also represents EDF employees, did not sign the statement. In his letter to fellow EDF executives Lévy said he believed May only wanted “a few more days” to consider the Hinkley contract amid criticism over the cost to taxpayers. EDF said this week: “Reading the entire internal email sent on 2 August by the chairman and CEO of EDF to members of the executive committee confirms unambiguously that when the company’s board of directors was held, EDF and its chairman had no knowledge of the intention of the British government to conduct a further review of the Hinkley Point project. “All that was known before the press statement issued by the British government on 28 July was that the signing ceremony originally proposed for Friday 29 July would be postponed. “This potential date of signature had not been confirmed, and therefore had not been communicated either to the board nor the market. There was therefore no requirement to communicate its postponement.” EDF added that Lévy planned to sue the Sud Energie union, after it claimed that he lied when he told journalists he did not know the British government was planning to delay the project. The CGT, CFE-CGC and FO unions said not enough consideration was given to whether EDF board members were subject to a conflict of interest, because some are employed by companies that stand to benefit from Hinkley. “Who can say that with a rigorous management of the conflicts of interest and real transparency of information, the board decision would not have been different,” the unions said. Peter Atherton, an associate at Cornwall Energy consultants, said: “It would seem that communication between the two parties [the UK government and EDF] wasn’t the best.” He added that the cost of underwriting the project for UK taxpayers was excessive, after the government agreed a guaranteed price for electricity produced by Hinkley. “My position is that the economics of Hinkley are very hard to justify. The question is whether there are other benefits, such as the relationship with the French and Chinese and the industrial development you get from that, as well as economic benefits to the south-west.” Critics of Hinkley have argued that it is not good value for money because the government is offering EDF – which is 85%-owned by the French state – a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour to provide up to 7% of the UK’s energy needs. Atherton said: “The political will in the UK may have diminished now that George Osborne isn’t involved. The issue is whether the whole thing is being called into question.” Oliver Salvesen, equity analyst at stockbroker Jefferies, said there was still enough support for Hinkley within EDF for the project to go ahead, assuming the UK government chooses to support it. “It is surprising that the company can’t marry these two factions together. It’s a function of the fact that EDF has been very financially stressed because of poor market conditions,” he said. “The unions are very powerful and they’ll want to know that the company isn’t taking on unnecessary risk with an investment that could impact the French business and of course, the workforce. But this is a long-term project that they want to be involved with and will give very decent returns.” The UK government is conducting a review of the Hinkley Pointcontract, but it has not made public its scope of the review. May is thought to have been keen to examine more closely the role of Chinese companies in the project amid concerns about the impact on national security and despite her predecessor David Cameron’s strong support for Hinkley."
2016-08-08T17:47:14Z,uk-news,UK news,No 10 to proceed with ‘national living wage’ despite pressure,"Downing Street has dismissed pressure to slow the implementation of the ”national living wage” in the face of lobbying from businesses concerned about rising salary bills. The policy, which is expected to raise the minimum wage for the over-25s to approximately £9 an hour by 2020, was the centrepiece of George Osborne’s 2015 budget. It emerged on Monday that at least 16 trade bodies have written to the business secretary, Greg Clark, urging him to reconsider the plans in light of the economic slowdown expected after the UK’s vote to leave the European Union.
But Theresa May’s official spokeswoman pointed to her pledge, immediately after she became prime minister last month, to govern in the interests of families struggling to make ends meet. “The prime minister has been clear that we want to build an economy that works for everyone, where people up and down the country have a share in the benefits of the economy, and making sure that people earn a decent wage for a day’s work is an important part of that,” she said. Sacking Osborne was one of May’s first acts as prime minister, and she has struck a markedly different tone on some areas of economic policy by condemning excessive corporate pay and suggesting she could boost the power of shareholders to check lavish boardroom rewards. The beefed-up business department has had industrial strategy added to its title and Clark is expected to be more interventionist than his Thatcherite predecessor Sajid Javid, another early casualty of May’s arrival in Downing Street. The national living wage fits with May’s rhetoric about boosting the prospects for the poorest. Speaking directly to what she called the ordinary working-class family in her first Downing Street address May promised: “The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours.”
The Treasury is braced for a wave of lobbying in the run-up to new chancellor Phillip Hammond’s first autumn statement, as trade bodies and other interest groups seize the opportunity of a new minister in charge to try to win concessions. Hammond used a recent trip to China to promise a reset on economic policy. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is also expected to make sharp downgrades to its forecasts for growth when it publishes its latest projections alongside the autumn statement. The national living wage policy already makes some allowance for a downturn in economic growth because it is set in relation to median wages, and is targeting 60% of media UK pay by 2020. The minimum wage for over-25s rose by 50p an hour in April to £7.20 as a result. Conor D’Arcy, policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “By sensibly pegging the national living wage to typical earnings, the government has already built in flexibility to help steer it through choppy economic times.” A Treasury spokesman said: “Since April the new national living wage has been boosting the wages of the lowest paid. The independent Low Pay Commission will advise on the path future increases should take, taking into account the state of the economy.”"
2016-08-08T18:42:29Z,uk-news,UK news,"Police Scotland told to pay journalist £10,000 over illegal intercepts","Police Scotland has been ordered to pay a journalist £10,000 in damages after it illegally intercepted his communications data in an investigation into a botched murder case. The investigatory powers tribunal ruled the force had breached the human rights of Gerard Gallacher, a former police officer turned freelance journalist, who had spent 18 months investigating a cold murder case in which a prime suspect had been released without charge. Gallacher said he suffered “invasion of privacy, familial strife, personal stress and strain and loss of long-standing friendships” after detectives accessed 32 days of his communications data, ignoring clear court rulings to protect journalists and their sources. Police Scotland had been braced for an adverse ruling after Sir Stanley Burnton, the communications interception commissioner, ruled last November that the force had been reckless in its repeated abuse of its powers. Detectives in an elite anti-corruption unit breached the law five times when they collected phone records for Gallacher and two police officers suspected of leaking information, Burnton said. In its ruling on Monday on the cases of the six people affected – Gerard Gallacher and his wife Marjorie, the two officers David Moran and Steven Adams and a former officer and his wife named only as Mr and Mrs O – the tribunal agreed that the collection of their data breached the Human Rights Act and the European convention on human rights. Only Gallacher sought damages from the tribunal, and he was awarded £10,000 for stress and loss of earnings. The hearing focused on Gallacher’s investigation into the unsolved murder of Emma Caldwell in woods 40 miles from Glasgow in 2005, which sparked a huge police inquiry. Four Turkish men were arrested after an operation involving police from several countries and covert surveillance, but the trial collapsed after prosecutors realised the evidence against them was flawed. In 2013 Gallacher discovered that officers involved in the original case were upset that another suspect, who had admitted having sex with Caldwell in the same woods on numerous occasions, was allowed to go free without being charged seven months before the Turkish men were arrested. The Sunday Mail then ran a series of articles on the case based on Gallacher’s investigations over three successive weekends in May 2015. Prosecutors ordered Police Scotland to reopen the case, and the anti-corruption unit secretly opened its own parallel investigation into whether serving or former police officers had leaked intelligence to Gallacher. The tribunal stated that the detectives involved were told explicitly by a Police Scotland specialist that they needed a judge’s approval to bug a journalist or intercept their data, but the advice was ignored. In its ruling, the tribunal said the force also failed to assess whether seeking the data was proportional. It had “no coherent view as to what, if any, crime might have been committed by any person” and had no intelligence that one claimant had leaked the material to Gallacher or had even had access to it. Deputy chief constable Iain Livingstone said the force had already ordered an external review into the affair by Mike Barton, the head of Durham constabulary. The active investigation limited what he could say, Livingstone said, but he added that there had already been two reviews, both internally and by the HM Inspectorate of Constabulary Scotland, to ensure such breaches did not reoccur. “Police Scotland has fully accepted that standards fell below those required in this case,” he said. Moran said he was critical of the limited scope of Barton’s enquiry, because it did not cover criminal misconduct by the officers involved. The tribunal evidence made clear that every element of the case needed to be independently and impartially investigated, he said. “Nobody, including myself, knows the full detail of what happened, the level it reached within Police Scotland and who exactly caused officers to break the laws and codes governing the interception of communications,” he said. “Until that is fully established then, in my opinion, no assumption should be made that criminality was not involved.” David Kennedy, the deputy general secretary of the Scottish Police Federation (SPF) said: “This judgment leaves no doubt that the actions of the Police Service of Scotland towards our members [and others] breached their human rights. The SPF had no hesitation in supporting our members in seeking remedy for this breach, and we sincerely hope the service will reflect on this ruling when considering their future actions.” Paul Holleran, the Scottish regional secretary of the National Union of Journalists, said: “The police have been riding roughshod over people’s rights and we want an end to that. We welcome the recognition that their behaviour was out of order. Hopefully this will be a lesson learned.”"

2016-08-08T22:31:10Z,uk-news,UK news,China warns UK relations are at 'historical juncture' over Hinkley Point,"China has said that its relations with the UK are at a “crucial historical juncture” amid doubts over the future of the controversial Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. The intervention by the Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom comes after the British government’s decision last month to delay final approval of the project, which is receiving major financial support from China. “If Britain’s openness is a condition for bilateral co-operation, then mutual trust is the very foundation on which this is built,” Liu Xiaoming wrote in an article for the Financial Times, in which he placed the project at the centre of Britain’s evolving trade relationship with China. “Right now, the China-UK relationship is at a crucial historical juncture. Mutual trust should be treasured even more. I hope the UK will keep its door open to China and that the British government will continue to support Hinkley Point – and come to a decision as soon as possible so that the project can proceed smoothly.” The prime minister Theresa May is thought to have ordered a delay owing to concerns about the role of China General Nuclear, which has a one-third stake in the Hinkley project. Comments by May’s chief of staff, Nick Timothy, last year have led to claims that the delay has been prompted by concerns that Chinese state-owned companies were being allowed to invest in sensitive infrastructure. While not specifically addressing those concerns, Liu said that “security” was central to the debate surrounding the project, adding that the UK has “a state-of-the-art supervision regime and legal system”. The article comes in the wake of wider doubts about the future of the close relationship with China that David Cameron and George Osborne had heavily promoted. The ambassador, who said that Chinese companies have invested more in the UK than in Germany, France and Italy combined over the past five years, concluded by stating that it “has not been easy for China and the UK to have come this far”. “As long as both sides cherish what has been achieved and continue to expand and deepen our co-operation across the board, bilateral relations will maintain their strong momentum and work for the wellbeing of both the Chinese and British people,” Liu said.
Meanwhile, French unions have said that the decision by energy firm EDF to invest in Hinkley Point should be declared invalid. Three unions at the French state-owned firm said senior board members knew the British government was considering delaying its final decision on Hinkley, but nothing was said before last month’s vote on whether EDF should back the project.

2016-08-09T09:53:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Northumbria police dismiss ex-chief's claim of sexist 'boys' club',"A row has broken out between Northumbria police and its former police chief over allegations senior officers at the force presided over a sexist “boys’ club” culture. In interviews with the Daily Mail and BBC Radio 4, Sue Sim, a former chief constable of the force, claimed a significant number of top Northumbria officers did not like being led by a woman and were “money-grabbing” sexists. But the force issued a robust denial, saying Sim’s claims were “old and tired accusations”, that had been refuted by a wide range of individuals and institutions, including the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), and the GMB and Unison unions. Sim, who retired last year, was the top officer at Northumbria police when gunman Raoul Moat shot a policeman, his ex-girlfriend, and killed her new lover. She told the Mail: “My biggest battle was with a culture that was sexist, money-grabbing and run by a ‘boys’ club’ of senior officers who thought they could do what they damn well wanted.” After claiming that some officers made decisions about promotions while playing golf on the force’s time, she said: “I don’t think the public have any idea of the sort of attitudes that prevail in that force. It was a place of rampant sexism, cover-ups and the sort of behaviour that would not be tolerated in any other workplace.” She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme senior officers did not like being led by a woman who had “demanding standards”. By way of example, Sim said she stopped first-class travel to protect the force budget but a significant number of senior officers still wanted to claim it. She also stopped all bonuses being paid. Sim said there were senior officers who had been with the force for 30 years who “believed that they knew the way they wanted to do things”. “Unfortunately there are a series of senior officers in the force who believe they have the right to be where they are and that they’ve worked there,” she told the radio programme. “And don’t forget, when I joined 30 years ago that’s exactly what happened. When you got to the top of the service you were entitled to sit back, and you were entitled to earn your due.” Sim denied she was bitter and added: “The reason I’m pursuing this is it’s so important to change the culture of an organisation. “My position is I have a significant fear for female victims of crime, female officers within the force, the female staff members of the force. If people will be sexist towards a chief constable then what are they going to do to victims of crime, to officers and staff within the force? That’s why I’m doing this, I’m not doing this for me.” Sim gave evidence in a high-profile employment tribunal in May relating to alleged sexism in the force, which was lost by the appellant, Denise Aubrey, a former Northumbria police lawyer. All allegations of sexism were dismissed. However, Sim’s credibility as a witness was questioned in the judgment. It said: “We found that Mrs Sim’s evidence on this point was not credible.” A spokeswoman for Northumbria police said: “These are old and tired accusations and have been exhaustively looked at by three organisations at considerable taxpayers’ expense.” The force said Sim’s allegations had been investigated by the new chief constable, Steve Ashman, independent counsel on police misconduct matters and the IPCC and none supported her claims. In addition, all four staff associations that represent Northumbria police – the Police Superintendents’ Association, Police Federation, Unison and GMB – issued a joint statement on Friday in which they stated that the allegations of sexism in the employment tribunal “painted a picture of Northumbria police that they did not recognise”."
2016-08-09T10:04:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Southern rail strike: day two of commuter misery amid war of words,"The second day of a five-day strike on Southern Railway has seen commuters struggling with reduced services while the Rail, Maritime and Transport union ramped up its war of words with the government and threatened fresh industrial action elsewhere.The RMT announced that its members on Virgin Trains East Coast had voted by a large majority to strike in a separate dispute about the jobs of onboard staff. Virgin said it would still run a full service in the event of a strike. In the current dispute, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) said it was cancelling 946 of Southern’s 2,242 services each day of the walkout, and claims to have operated 88.5% of those remaining services to schedule – an improvement on many days in recent weeks. GTR said many conductors broke the strike on Monday, with one in five rostered to work turning out in defiance of the union. Its managers said on Tuesday it would meet the RMT for talks “any time, any place, anywhere” to end the strike. However, the RMT’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said members were “solid, determined and united again this morning on the second day of this phase of strike action”, adding that he believed the public understood and supported the strike. “Our message that rail safety has to be put before the profits of Govia Thameslink is ringing out loud and clear,” he said.
Passengers on some routes faced crowded trains and stations, with some branch lines closed altogether, although some stations have been quieter than usual during the strike, with regular users either on holiday or working from home.
The union, meanwhile, has piled pressure on the government by claiming it sabotaged a deal to resolve the escalating dispute over the role of conductors. Talks broke down last Friday between GTR and union bosses before an agreement was reached along similar lines to a deal in Scotland with Abellio. GTR said the RMT rejected a fresh offer. The company’s chief executive, Charles Horton, said: “Everyone is sick and tired of this pointless, needless and senseless strike, which is so damaging to people’s everyday lives and the south-east economy, and causing undue disruption and hardship to customers and employees. I urge the RMT to come back to the table to talk, have constructive and productive discussions on the way forward and shake hands on a deal. We are prepared to meet them directly or through Acas any time, any place, anywhere to let common sense prevail and give our customers back their trains and give them the service they expect.” Cash said the union remained open for talks, but added: “We were just getting into the detailed wording when suddenly the plug was pulled and our legs were kicked from under us. We have it on good authority that the deal, which would have enabled us to suspend the Southern strike action this week, was sabotaged by the government, with their director of rail, Peter Wilkinson, directing operations from outside the talks.” A spokesman for the Department for Transport said it had played no part in the negotiations. Wilkinson recently apologised to the transport select committee for comments he made earlier this year, when he said rail workers resisting changes to their working conditions could “get the hell out of my industry”, and predicted “punch-ups” and industrial action.
The RMT is planning to protest outside the DfT on Wednesday. Cash said: “We want the government to stop weaponising the Southern dispute for political purposes and we want them to stop treating passengers and staff as collateral damage in a war that Peter Wilkinson has unilaterally declared on the rail unions.” On Monday, the prime minister sharply criticised RMT leaders. But Theresa May’s official spokeswoman denied the government had a responsibility to resolve the dispute, saying it had to be settled between the company and unions. The RMT confirmed on Tuesday that 84% of its members on Virgin Trains East Coast had voted to strike over changes to jobs and conditions, which it claims could threaten up to 200 jobs. The East Coast franchise was in public hands until 2015, but passenger and revenue figures have come in below the forecasts of the Stagecoach-led joint venture behind the current operation, and unions fear that staff may bear the brunt of cost-cutting measures. While Virgin says it has given the union assurances, including pledging no compulsory redundancies, Cash said: “RMT will not sit back while nearly 200 members’ jobs are under threat and while conditions and safety are put at risk by a franchise which is clearly in financial trouble.” David Horne, the managing director for Virgin Trains East Coast, said the proposed changes were for a “modern customer service proposition”. He said: “We have worked hard to ensure there are comprehensive contingency plans in place and I want to reassure our customers that the timetable will be unaffected, should any strike go ahead.” Meanwhile, fears that industrial action on Southern could intensify were raised last week as two other unions, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association and Aslef, announced plans to ballot station staff and drivers over plans to close ticket offices and a breakdown in industrial relations. While the industrial dispute has dragged Southern’s performance down further, the franchise had been plagued by problems before strikes started in May. The Campaign for Better Transport and a Southern passenger group, the Association of British Commuters, are planning to march to the DfT on Wednesday to demand urgent action to resolve the problems and compensate passengers."

2016-08-09T10:56:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Scottish council offers Zimmer frame amnesty,"A Scottish council has offered an “amnesty” on Zimmer frames, in the hope that it can coax tens of thousands of disability aids out of the hands of residents who no longer need them but have failed to give them back. Authorities in Fife have made provision for the anonymous return of Zimmer frames, walking sticks and bath aids at eight recycling centres across the county, after a pilot scheme in one area led to an 8% boost in the number of mobility aids returned.
Residents’ failure to return expensive equipment costs Fife hundreds of thousands of pounds a year, with the council’s health and social care partnership estimating that more than 160,000 mobility aids are sitting at homes across the county. A council source told the Times: “Amnesties have been known to work for guns, knives and air rifles. Now it is the turn of Zimmers.” With Zimmer frames costing £90 a piece, the cost of missing assistive technology can quickly mount. Specially adapted toilet seats can cost up to £25, while trolleys with trays for cups of tea can cost £50. The latter have been seen used as plant pot stands in some cases, a council source said. There are no specific penalties for those who fail to return assistive technology. Andrew Rodger, chair of Fife’s Health and Social Care Partnership, said that often people simply don’t realise that equipment needs to be returned, or they forget about it. Rodger said: “Often it is because when a person passes away, the relatives, or those dealing with the estate, don’t know what to do with it, especially if the family have been living outside Fife and don’t know how the equipment appeared in the house in the first place. In other instances, the person has made a recovery and the equipment is tidied away in a cupboard and forgotten about.” Andrew Roger, a local councillor and chair of the health and social care partnership, told the Guardian: “Each year we deliver over 78,000 pieces of equipment to people’s homes but over the years there has been a buildup of equipment that has never been returned.

The boy, who was with his parents, had the pellet removed in hospital after the incident in Redbridge at 4.30pm on Monday, the Metropolitan police said. Detectives from the Met’s gang violence squad do not believe the boy and his parents were the intended target of the shooting. The child has since been discharged from hospital. A 22-year-old man remains in a critical condition in an east London hospital with shotgun injuries. It is not believed the man and the boy were known to each other, police said. DCI Simon Moring, from Trident and area crime command, which tackles gang violence, said: “This shooting has left a man in a critical condition and endangered an innocent child. “We would appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information to contact police immediately. Your call will be treated in complete confidence.” There have been no arrests and there are no descriptions of the suspects, the police said."

2016-08-09T11:33:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Man who murdered Glasgow shopkeeper Asad Shah in sectarian attack jailed,"A taxi driver from Bradford has been jailed for a minimum of 27 years for the “barbaric, premeditated” murder of a shopkeeper in Glasgow. Tanveer Ahmed, from Toller, had admitted to repeatedly stabbing Asad Shah to death outside his shop in the Shawlands area of the city in March this year in a sectarian attack motivated by hatred of Shah’s religious views.
Ahmed, 32, a Sunni Muslim, confessed to confronting and then attacking Shah because the newsagent was an open adherent of the Ahmadi branch of Islam, which believes the prophet Muhammad was not the final Muslim prophet. As he was led from the dock on Tuesday, Ahmed raised a clenched fist and shouted in Arabic: “Praise for the Prophet Muhammad, there is only one Prophet.” His cry was repeated by some supporters in the public gallery.
Passing sentence at the high court in Glasgow in a rare televised hearing, Lady Rae said the killing was an “appalling display of merciless violence” and a “barbaric, premeditated and wholly unjustified killing of a much-loved man”. Describing the murder as “in effect an execution”, she told Ahmed: “Your determination to kill Mr Shah was obvious. What is so chilling is that what you did was calculated and deliberate. You did not know the deceased but you decided that you had a duty to kill him.” It quickly emerged that Ahmed had singled Shah out because the shopkeeper, a father of three, was openly proselytising on social media and describing himself as a prophet. The belief that Muhammad is the final prophet is a central tenet of mainstream Islam; to believe otherwise is regarded as blasphemous. Sunni leaders in Pakistan and the UK, including several followed by Ahmed, have openly condemned Ahmadis for holding that other prophets have emerged since Muhammad. Ahmed had first called Shah by phone to challenge him, and then decided to travel to Glasgow to confront him. Ahmed had watched a video of Shah on his mobile phone en route, and was heard in a phone message stating: “Listen to this guy, something needs to be done, it needs nipped in the bud.”
Arriving at the shop on 24 March, he ordered Shah to stop describing himself as a prophet, warned he would kill him and began plunging a knife into Shah. As Shah’s brother and a shop assistant struggled to prevent the attack, Ahmed dragged Shah outside onto the pavement, stabbing, punching and stamping on him, shattering bones in his face. In a statement released through his lawyer after a court appearance in early April, Ahmed had admitted the murder, claiming: “This all happened for one reason and no other issues and no other intentions. Asad Shah disrespected the messenger of Islam the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Mr Shah claimed to be a prophet.” The Scottish government is to review the law covering religiously aggravated crimes in the wake of the case. The Crown Office decided the circumstances of the killing did not meet the “statutory test for an offence to be aggravated by religious prejudice” but Scotland’s chief law officer, James Wolffe QC, the lord advocate, has now written to the justice secretary as he believes the case highlighted a “potential gap” in legislation. If charged with an offence aggravated by religious prejudice, Ahmed could have faced a longer minimum sentence. Shah’s death led to an outpouring of grief among his customers and neighbours, and exposed significant levels of animosity and discrimination faced by the UK’s Ahmadi minority from other Muslims, particularly Pakistani Sunnis. Supporters of the Shah family accuse Sunni Muslim leaders from Glasgow Central Mosque of failing to condemn the ideology behind Ahmed’s stance, despite condemning the murder, and of being reluctant to support multi-faith vigils.
The Shahs are also said to be upset about what they perceive as the local Ahmadi leadership’s use of the murder to highlight the broader conflicts with orthodox Muslim thinking. One source said they felt his death had been turned into a “political football”. There is due to be an Ahmadi community press conference later on Tuesday in Glasgow but family sources say the Shahs were never consulted about the community leadership’s statements. In a statement issued on behalf of Shah’s family, their lawyer, Aamer Anwar, said many family members had either left or were preparing to leave Scotland, as a result of his murder and its impact on them. They had originally moved to Glasgow in 1990 to escape state-sanctioned religious persecution in Pakistan. “Asad’s family have lost a peaceful, kind and loving brother, son and uncle who can never be replaced. Most of his family have now left or are in the process of leaving Scotland, a country they came to seek safety in,” Anwar said. “They are grateful to the lord advocate, Crown Office and Police Scotland for their hard work and compassion. For those who choose to speak on behalf of Asad, his family say they have no permission to do so and request their privacy is respected.” An Ahmadi spokesman insisted they had not sought to speak for the family, but for the community in general. Describing his death as a “sacrifice”, they said it was very disturbing that Shah had become the first Ahmadi killed in the UK because hatred of their beliefs had seeped over from Pakistan. Rafiq Hayat, the national president of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association UK, said the community had found security and peace in British cities such as Glasgow, which upheld their right to follow their beliefs. “In Glasgow, as in many parts of the world, we have witnessed the evil of a warped and poisonous ideology of hate, that is at war with the whole of humanity,” Hayat said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr Shah and his family who have suffered immensely as a result of this brutal killing. No one should suffer or be murdered, least of all for their faith.” Scotland’s chief law officer, James Wolffe QC, the lord advocate, said: “Asad Shah was a well liked and respected member of the community who was savagely murdered by a total stranger,” Wolffe added. “This was a brutal, unprovoked and relentless attack on an unsuspecting victim. It has left his family and friends devastated at the loss of a kind and peace-loving man.”"
2016-08-09T12:05:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Pictures appear to show British special forces on Syrian frontline,"The first images of what appear to be British special forces operating on the ground in Syria have emerged, showing vehicles patrolling near the scene of an attack by Islamic State. The pictures were taken in June and were first published by the BBC.
It is believed to be the first time British forces have been photographed operating inside Syria, where they are engaged in relatively small numbers in wide-ranging roles that include surveillance, advisory and combat. The images depict British special forces sitting on Thalab long-range patrol vehicles as they move around the perimeter of a rebel base close to the Syria-Iraq border. The Thalab (Fox) vehicles are essentially modified, militarised and upgraded Toyota 4x4s used for long distance reconnaissance and surveillance missions, which were developed jointly in the middle of the last decade by a state-backed defence company in Jordan and the UK company Jankel. The vehicle, which has mounted weaponry and is often used for border patrols, has been primarily used by Jordanian special forces. Al-Tanf, where the vehicles were reportedly photographed, is a border crossing between Syria and Iraq that had been under Isis control, and is also not far from the Jordanian border. It is unclear how many Nato countries have deployed the modified trucks, though Belgium ordered a shipment of modified Fox vehicles earlier this year. The images seem to show British forces securing the perimeter of the rebel base following an attack by Isis, according to the BBC. The soldiers can be seen carrying anti-tank missiles, sniper rifles and other heavy artillery.
The BBC reported the soldiers were working at the base in a defensive role and a spokesman for the New Syrian Army acknowledged that British special forces had provided training, weapons and other equipment. The Ministry of Defence, as is standard with special forces, declined to comment on the photographs. But an independent source confirmed they were UK special forces, which are operating against Isis in Syria, Iraq and Libya. They prefer to operate in secrecy, at least until sufficient time has passed for the publication of memoirs. But, with cameras commonplace and the forces they operate alongside not feeling bound to respect that secrecy, it is becoming increasingly more difficult. The UK has about 300 conventional forces operating in Iraq mainly in and around Baghdad, restricted to training and advisory roles, operating from behind the relative safety of secure bases. Britain has also promised to provide between 800-1,200 troops to an Italian-led international force to support the Libyan government, though there is little sign of these being deployed. The special forces have a free-ranging role, operating in the border areas between the Isis stronghold of Raqqa in Syria and the towns and villages linking it to its northern Iraqi bastion, Mosul. The US special forces established a base in the Syrian desert between Raqqa and the Iraqi border aimed both at achieving this and in support of Syrian rebel forces trying to squeeze Raqqa. The UK parliament approved an air campaign against Isis in Syria but not ground troops. Special forces, though, have always been treated differently. The government mantra is that special forces can be deployed wherever there is judged to be a threat to the UK. The convention is that special forces are never mentioned on the floor of the British parliament but they are subject to oversight through the parliamentary intelligence committee. Defence ministers argue that it is illogical to expect special forces engaged against Isis to stop at the Iraqi border, given that the terror group does not recognise any border between Iraq and Syria. The New Syrian Army was established with American backing in 2015 as a moderate rebel force to primarily fight against Isis in Deir ez-Zor province, which is almost entirely under the control of the militants. The American training programmes for rebel forces have been widely seen as failures, primarily because few rebel fighters are willing to exclusively fight Isis while ignoring the regime of Bashar al-Assad. The US has had more success when it closely coordinated with fighters on the ground and backed them up with airstrikes, the modus operandi it has adopted with the mostly Kurdish fighters in northern Syria known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, who are on the verge of taking back the city of Manbij in northern Aleppo from Islamic State, and have conquered vast tracts of land over the past few months. The US also has special forces troops operating on the ground with the Kurds. The New Syrian Army has had a halting and uninspiring track record. Their most significant operation occurred in June this year, when the group launched an attack on Al-Bukamal, a town on the Iraqi border that has long been a crossing point for foreign jihadis during the American occupation, and which is now held by Isis. The attack failed, apparently due to the lack of sufficient air power backing by its western allies. One report in the Washington Post suggested American warplanes that were supposed to assist in the battle had to be diverted to Falluja, where they bombed a convoy of Isis vehicles fleeing the city."

2016-08-09T12:50:15Z,uk-news,UK news,The great Scottish Zimmer frame amnesty of 2016,"Name: Zimmer frames. Age: You mean the age at which you start using them, or when they were invented? I think you know what I mean OK, walking frames were invented by William Cribbes Robb in the late 1940s. He was based in the UK but, as with most inventions, we let it slip through our fingers. The Americans improved on Robb’s designs, and the Indiana-based company Zimmer Holdings became synonymous with the walking aids. Do I need to know any of this? The sun is shining, I could be doing something interesting. There is a point. Bear with me. Ask me the appearance question. Appearance: Come on. Everyone knows what a Zimmer frame looks like. You are in a playful mood. Just get to the point. Fife council has declared a Zimmer frame amnesty. The council reckons 160,000 mobility aids are lying unused across the region, and it wants them back – no questions asked.
Blimey, 160,000 sounds a lot. How many people are there in Fife? 365,000. That’s almost one walking aid for every two people. How could the local population get so enfeebled? Look, this is a funny article about a Zimmer frame amnesty, not a sociological survey of disability. What’s funny about a Zimmer frame amnesty? A council spokesman sums it up rather nicely: “Amnesties have been known to work for guns, knives and air rifles. Now it is the turn of Zimmers.” A bit contrived. It is August. Is there a serious purpose to it? There sure is. Age UK says lots of elderly and disabled people have to stay in hospital because of a shortage of disability aids. If people ransack their lofts and garages and return them, the situation will be transformed. Hurray!. When did we last discuss Zimmer frames? There is a rock band called the Zimmers, formed in 2007 to publicise the feelings of isolation felt by the elderly. The band members are 65-plus, and in May 2007 their cover of the Who’s My Generation reached 26 in the charts. Interesting, though they don’t actually sound that much older than the Who. As usual, you are missing the point. Not to be confused with: Rollators – Zimmers on wheels. Do say: “Zimmertime and the living is easy.” Don’t say: “The comedians at the Edinburgh festival should have some fun with this.”"
2016-08-09T13:29:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May seeks close ties with China despite Hinkley Point delay,"Theresa May is determined to maintain close economic ties with China despite her decision to review the Hinkley Point C nuclear project, the government insisted on Tuesday, after Beijing’s ambassador warned that cancelling the investment could jeopardise relations with the UK. A government spokesperson was keen to stress that the review of the £18bn Hinkley Point C reactor, which has been dogged by delays and questions over its cost-effectiveness, does not signal a general cooling of enthusiasm for China, which is due to part-fund the giant construction project alongside France’s EDF Energy. “As we’ve already made clear, this decision is about a huge infrastructure project and it’s right that the new government carefully considers it,” the spokesperson said. “We cooperate with China on a broad range of areas from the global economy to international issues and we will continue to seek a strong relationship with China.” Treasury sources added that Philip Hammond, who travelled to China last month for the G20 finance ministers’ meeting in his first overseas visit as chancellor, was no less committed to securing Chinese investment into Britain than his predecessor, George Osborne, who had promised to inaugurate a “golden decade” of cooperation between the two countries.
However, the Treasury will be involved in the review of the project. The guaranteed electricity price agreed as part of the conditions of the deal, to persuade the Chinese and French firms involved to sign up, would have to be scored in the public finances as a tax. The business secretary, Greg Clark, who will take on the energy brief as part of his newly expanded department and has a PhD in economics, is also keen to scrutinise the details of the project. China’s ambassador, Liu Xiaoming, used an article in the Financial Times on Tuesday to warn that the prime minister’s move to delay a final decision on Hinkley had placed ties between the UK and China at a “crucial historical juncture”. In the article, in which he set the project at the heart of Britain’s evolving trade relationship with China, Liu wrote: “If Britain’s openness is a condition for bilateral cooperation, then mutual trust is the very foundation on which this is built.
“Right now, the China-UK relationship is at a crucial historical juncture. Mutual trust should be treasured even more. I hope the UK will keep its door open to China and that the British government will continue to support Hinkley Point – and come to a decision as soon as possible so that the project can proceed smoothly.” France’s ruling Socialist party also has “cause for reservation” over Paris’s continued involvement in the project, it emerged on Tuesday. The party issued a statement saying it had “structural concerns” over state-owned EDF’s plans. Osborne toured China last year touting opportunities for Chinese investors in the UK, and his commercial secretary, former Goldman Sachs economist Lord O’Neill, who left government after May’s arrival in Downing Street, was brought in partly to help woo the Chinese. Such was Osborne’s enthusiasm for striking deals with China that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, quoted Mao Zedong’s Little Red Book across the dispatch box at him at last year’s autumn statement. But May is thought to have concerns about security issues raised by China playing a role in such a critical piece of national infrastructure, as well as whether the project represents value for money.
The shadow business secretary, Jon Trickett, said the new economic climate created by Britain’s planned exit from the EU meant that maintaining positive relations with Beijing was more important than ever. “During the referendum, one of the few firm proposals coming from the Brexit camp was that Britain’s economic prosperity outside of Europe could be secured by furthering our relations with China and other large, fast-growing economies in the east. Today we see that the prime minister has put that – and £40bn of inward investment – in jeopardy by bungling negotiations over Hinkley Point,” he said. Meanwhile, French unions have said the decision by EDF to invest in Hinkley Point C should be declared invalid. Three unions at the firm said senior board members knew the British government was considering delaying its final decision, but nothing was said before last month’s vote on whether EDF should back the project. Jean-Bernard Lévy, the chairman and chief executive of EDF, wrote to board members last week saying he knew about the delay before the board approved building and co-funding the first British nuclear site in a generation. And, just hours before a signing ceremony was due to take place at the site in Somerset, May put off government approval until early autumn."

Simon Brown, 24, originally from East Grinstead, Sussex, had moved to Bristol with his girlfriend and recently started a job with Hitachi Rail Europe. The accident occurred at 5.30pm on Sunday at Wandsworth Common station in south-west London while Brown was travelling on a Gatwick Express service. Brown’s family paid tribute to the “railway fanatic”. His father, Mike, told the Evening Standard: “As soon as he could toddle, Simon was into trains. At nine he volunteered with the Bluebell Railway in West Sussex and became a station master. “He worked on a Great Northern restoration project and left school at 18 to start an apprenticeship with Southern trains. He’d only got the job with Hitachi a couple of months ago and had moved to Stoke Gifford [near Bristol] to be with his girlfriend.” Brown’s girlfriend Missy Wilson, a student education leader at the University of the West of England, was being comforted by her family at her home in Kilgetty, Pembrokeshire. In joint tribute with Simon’s family, Wilson said: “Simon was a warm, loving individual whose unbounded passion and enthusiasm for life and all things related to trains of any kind - from model railways through steam to modern-day rail transport - infected everyone he met. “He will be sorely missed not only by his partner, his family and his friends but also by his many colleagues throughout the rail industry.” Brown’s friends, who have launched a fundraising page to raise money for a memorial, said he was a “real light in the railway world”. Reuben Smith wrote on the page: “He was always smiling, cheerful and would bend over backwards to help anyone. There’s now a massive hole in our close-knit community.” A spokesperson for Hitachi said: “Simon’s death comes as a great shock to everyone and, in particular, to people who knew him and worked with him. Our thoughts and sincerest condolences are with his family and girlfriend. “Simon joined us as a team technician at our train maintenance centre in west London in June this year and brought a clear passion for the railways to his work. He will be greatly missed.” British transport police said he appeared to have been leaning out of a train door window when he suffered a fatal blow to the head. A BTP spokesman said: “The death is being treated as non-suspicious and the circumstances, including what caused the head injuries, are still being investigated.” The Rail Accident Investigation Branch will begin an inquiry while a file is prepared for the coroner. A Gatwick Express spokesman said the train had been travelling to London Victoria station from Gatwick airport. “The emergency services attended the scene at Wandsworth Common station and, despite their best efforts, they were unable to save him. We send our condolences to his family,” the spokesman said. “We are cooperating fully with British transport police and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch, who are investigating this incident.”"

They are due to be winched down by helicopter on to the sloping deck of the Transocean Winner, a 17,000-tonne semi-submersible rig, on Tuesday. The rig was blown close to cliffs during a severe gale early on Monday. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) has set up a 300-metre wide exclusion zone around the beach at Dalmore near Carloway, for safety reasons and to prevent onlookers blocking access to the site for salvage teams and emergency services. The rig, which was being towed from Norway to Malta, was unmanned but is carrying 280 tonnes of diesel, raising the threat of a leak into the surrounding seas and coastline. Footage from the scene shows the rig, which is close to 100 metres tall, swaying against rocks in the swell. Hugh Shaw, the UK transport secretary’s representative for maritime salvage and intervention, who is overseeing the operation, said: “This initial recce will be checking a number of things including fuel tanks. “Weather permitting, it’s then intended to put a second larger group of salvors on tomorrow to carry out a more detailed inspection.” The Transocean Winner ran aground after a towing rope severed during a heavy storm at about 4am on Monday. The MCA sent its only emergency rescue tug in northern Scotland, the Orkney-based ETV Herakles, to the scene on Monday. Mark Rodaway, an MCA official, said the exclusion zone was necessary for public safety, as well as the salvage operation. “We understand that this incident is of interest to people living in the area but we’re asking them to stay away to ensure easy access for emergency services and salvage teams,” he said. “Also the last thing we want is for people to be injured or worse trying to get a closer look on remote cliff paths.”"
2016-08-09T15:56:05Z,uk-news,UK news,CCTV shows men suspected of releasing insects inside Byron restaurants,"Police are seeking three men suspected of releasing cockroaches inside two branches of Byron Hamburgers following revelations that the restaurant chain aided a Home Office immigration sting. Officers from the Metropolitan police public order unit have released images of the men they want to speak to in connection with the incidents on 29 July at Byron restaurants in St Giles High Street and Holborn in central London. In the first incident cockroaches and locusts were released on the restaurant floor and in the men’s toilets. “The suspects then moved on to a second branch of the chain in High Holborn where they also released insects,” the Met said. On both occasions, customers were asked by staff to vacate the premises and the restaurants were closed. The protest was organised by a group calling itself London Black Revolutionaries, following reports that 35 kitchen workers from Brazil, Nepal, Albania and Egypt were arrested after being duped into attending a meeting about the dangers of cooking burgers rare or medium rare.
The meetings in 12 London branches of the burger chain were in fact a joint operation with immigration enforcement officers who came to the restaurants with names and photographs of foreign workers supplied by management. The police described one of the suspects, Man A, as “dark-skinned, of medium to heavy build, unshaven with thinning hair”. They said he was wearing a bulky hooded anorak, brown shoes and blue jeans and was carrying a rucksack. Man B was described as “dark-skinned, of thin build, with long hair – tied at the back – and unshaven. He wore thick-rimmed glasses and a black tracksuit with white stripes along the arms, and carried a bag or satchel over his shoulder.” The third suspect was dark-skinned, of thin build with short hair and a short beard. “He was wearing a brown blazer, blue shirt and light grey or beige trousers,” police said. The Home Office confirmed that 25 of the 35 workers arrested during the operation at Byron have been removed from the UK, with others still going through the removals process."
2016-08-09T16:07:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Glasgow murder of Asad Shah spurred by sectarianism in Pakistan,"A sectarian dispute in Pakistan was played out in Glasgow when Bradford taxi driver Tanveer Ahmed stabbed shopkeeper Asad Shah to death in a religiously motivated murder. Simmering hatred towards Britain’s Ahmadiyya Muslim community spilled over into violence the day before Good Friday this year when Shah was murdered in his shop by Ahmed, who remained defiant even as he was sentenced on Tuesday. Ahmed, a Sunni Muslim, was offended by Shah’s religious proclamations on social media. On Wednesday morning, as Ahmed was being taken down to the cells after being jailed for a minimum of 27 years, there were chants from his supporters in the public gallery, and he shouted: “Muhammad is the prophet, he is the only one.” Shah, whose final Facebook update, posted a few hours before his death, had offered Easter greetings “to my beloved Christian nation”, was a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community. This minority group faces persecution – most recently in Pakistan and Indonesia – and is treated with open hostility by many orthodox Muslims because it differs from their belief that Muhammad is the final prophet. Some who identified themselves as friends or extended family of Shah’s 32-year-old murderer Ahmed, whom the Guardian spoke to in Bradford, refused to condemn the killing and claimed that he was driven to commit it by events unfolding thousands of miles away in his home country of Pakistan. The father of three, who came to Britain on a marriage visa more than a decade ago, was a staunch supporter of Islamic fundamentalist Mumtaz Qadri. Qadri, a policeman and bodyguard, was hanged in Pakistan for the murder of Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab, who campaigned against its blasphemy laws as well as Ahmadi persecution. The 2011 murder of Taseer was one of Pakistan’s most high-profile assassinations. The prominent liberal politician was an outspoken critic of the country’s harsh blasphemy laws, arguing that they discriminated against religious minorities, and sought liberal reforms. He had called for a pardon for Asia Bibi, a Christian woman who was sentenced to death in 2010 for insulting the prophet Muhammad. Taseer claimed Pakistan’s blasphemy laws were used primarily to terrorise and exact revenge on religious minorities there: from Shias and Ahmadis to Hindus and Sikhs. Yet, for some living in the UK, Taseer was a divisive figure and after his murder some hailed his killer Qadri as a hero. Ahmed was among this tranche of supporters. Friends said Ahmed became increasingly vocal about his support of Qadri. Living with his wife, Razia, and three children in the Gurlington area of Bradford, Ahmed would preach to friends about those he believed were committing blasphemy. Ahmed, who does not speak fluent English, is understood to have become aware of Shah online after the shopkeeper posted what he believed to be contentious comments. Just before murdering Shah it is understood Ahmed was offended by a remark Shah made where he allegedly purported to be a prophet of Islam. In a chilling turn of events Ahmed called Shah in the days before he murdered him. Ahmed’s friends said the two men had a heated discussion with Ahmed asking Shah to take back his assertion that he was a prophet. The pair also discussed the recent events in Pakistan. The night before Good Friday, Ahmed travelled more than 200 miles to Glasgow and stabbed Shah to death. In the aftermath of the killing pockets of support were identified for Ahmed with a Facebook group set up. The page has since been taken down but when the Guardian visited Ahmed’s home city some members of the community still supported his actions. One person, who refused to be named, claimed the shopkeeper “should not have been able to get away with” his actions. In a highly unusual move, following his second court appearance in April, Ahmed released a statement through his lawyer claiming that he had killed Shah because he disrespected Islam, stating: “This all happened for one reason and no other issues and no other intentions. Asad Shah disrespected the messenger of Islam, the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.” A friend of Ahmed, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said: “They rang Shah to discuss what he had been saying about the prophet. They told him what he said was wrong and told him to take his words back. It is a big sin to say the things he did and they talked about this dream he had about being a prophet and told him it was wrong.” He added: “We didn’t think Tanveer would do this but you will find that many people have a lot of sympathy for him over here.” It has been claimed that hate preaching against the UK’s Ahmadi community is an increasing concern. Lawyer Farooq Aftab told the Guardian earlier this year: “It is a growing phenomenon: shops boycotted, women assaulted, even my friends who are educated won’t eat with me now. The simple answer: it’s because you’re not a Muslim. We’ve gone through university together, we ate together, prayed together ...”"

Burnham won 51% of a vote from party members in the region, beating the area’s police and crime commissioner and interim mayor, Tony Lloyd (29%), and the MP for Bury South, Ivan Lewis, who was a government minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (19.8%). The MP for Leigh won the contest with 3,792 votes to Lloyd’s 2,163 and Lewis’s 1,472, on a turnout of 65.3%. “To be selected as Labour’s candidate for the first elected mayor of Greater Manchester is a great honour and I thank our members for the faith they have shown in me,” he said. “I will repay it by devoting all my energy to uniting the Labour family here, working to win back the voters we have lost and building a policy programme with broad appeal. I will bring forward real answers to our housing crisis and give new hope to our young people. “Today I have a clear message for the prime minister – you and your party were elected on a series of promises to the north of England and I will not let you walk away from them. You promised us a powerhouse and now you must give us the tools and investment to build it.” The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, congratulated Burnham, saying the mayoral race would be an opportunity for Labour to take its message for social justice to the region’s 2 million voters in next year’s election. “It’s crucial that we have a mayor willing to do everything possible to improve the lives of everyone in Greater Manchester and in Andy we have that candidate,” he said. Burnham said he would stand down as an MP at the “first and earliest opportunity” if he wins the race to become mayor next May, as appears likely given that almost all of Manchester’s council seats are filled by Labour.
Asked whether he would resign from the shadow cabinet, Burnham said: “Next month there will be a decision on the leadership of our party going forward and it will then be for the leader of the party to decide whether or not I remain in the shadow cabinet.” In the West Midlands, the region’s MEP and the former Labour MP for Birmingham Erdington, Siôn Simon, was selected as Labour’s candidate on Tuesday morning, winning 71% of the vote. He beat Steve Bedser, a former Birmingham city councillor and local businesman, who won 29%. A total of 3,817 ballots were cast. Simon, another former minister in Brown’s government, campaigned for the city to have an elected mayor before an unsuccessful referendum on the proposal in 2012. He said Labour could do “a better job of running our own region ourselves than the Tories ever have of running it from London”. “We need a West Midlands voice in the Brexit discussions. Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the City of London can’t be the only ‘special interests’ at the table,” said Simon. “The West Midlands is a £110bn economy, and it’s one that Whitehall doesn’t understand.” Greater Manchester and the West Midlands are Labour strongholds, meaning that Burnham and Simon will be odds-on favourites to win the elections next year. The party will announce its candidate for mayor of the Liverpool city region, another Labour-dominated area, on Wednesday. The creation of elected mayors is a condition of devolution arrangements agreed by the former chancellor George Osborne and a series of “metro” regions, including the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, the Liverpool and Sheffield city regions, the Tees Valley, the north-east, and Greater Lincolnshire. The West Midlands combined authority includes Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton and has a population of about 4 million. The new mayor will have responsibility for transport, adult skills and planning, and will oversee a £1.1bn, 30-year investment fund. The mayor of Greater Manchester, a city region with a population of 3.5 million, which covers Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan, will have control over a portfolio of public services, a £900m, 30-year investment fund and will sit on a board that oversees a devolved £6bn health and social care budget. Voting to select the candidates closed at 12pm on Friday. To be eligible to vote, Labour members were required to live in the relevant city region and have been a member of the party before 19 July 2015, a rule that has excluded a high proportion of the party’s new membership. The poll was conducted using the alternative vote system, and votes were cast by post and online. This article was amended on 9 August 2016. It originally stated that “Andy Burnham’s win means he will stand down as MP for Leigh”. To clarify, Burnham said he would stand down from his role as an MP if he wins the mayoral election next May."
2016-08-09T17:36:24Z,uk-news,UK news,Uber urges TfL to drop plans to make drivers do written English test,"Uber has urged Transport for London to drop new requirements for drivers to pass a written English exam, saying thousands could be put out of business. From 1 October, anyone from a non-English-speaking country who applies to TfL for a private car hire licence or to renew an existing licence will have to prove that they have passed an exam in English. Initial proposals called for proficiency only in spoken English, but updated plans from TfL include a requirement to pass a two-hour written exam as well, which will cost £200 to sit. Uber London’s general manager, Tom Elvidge, called on users of the ride-hailing app to write to the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. Elvidge said the new system would threaten the livelihood of thousands of drivers. Sample papers for the exams include an “extended writing” task in which candidates are asked to write a short essay.
One question reads: “Write an essay (100-130 words) for your teacher about a festival in a country you know.” Another reads: “A friend in another town is going to study at your college and wants to know about the college rules. Write a letter to your friend (100-130 words).” In his email to Uber users, Elvidge said the exam demands a higher level of English than the British citizenship test, which only asks for speaking and listening skills.
The requirement also exceeds the level demanded of government employees in “customer-facing roles”, such as a teaching assistant or someone answering the phone in a local authority office. The private care hire licence test is B1 level, also known as entry level 3, or the level of achievement that the national curriculum expects from nine- to 11-year-olds. Adults with skills below entry level 3 may not be able to understand price labels on pre-packaged food or pay household bills, according to the business ministry. The requirements from TfL build on proposals set out last year by the then London mayor, Boris Johnson. Johnson dropped some of the most rigorous proposals, such as charging operators more for a minicab licence or enforcing a minimum five-minute period between ordering a cab and starting the journey. After TfL’s surprise decision to require a written English qualification, Uber is asking users to copy and paste prepared text into an email and send it to Khan’s office.
It reads: “I agree with you that it’s vital London remains open and that everybody has the chance to succeed, whatever their background. However, I’m concerned that new rules from Transport for London will threaten the livelihoods of thousands of licensed private hire drivers in our city. “Forcing all drivers from non-English-speaking countries to pass a £200 two-hour written English exam goes way beyond what’s needed to help Londoners get from A to B.” TfL said: “These changes are being introduced to raise standards in London’s private hire industry, improving safety and convenience for customers.”
Uber also wants TfL to reconsider plans to force drivers to hold “hire and reward” commercial insurance all year round, even if they only work during set periods such as school term times. It also wants the transport body to reconsider requirements, already in force, that say “operators must inform TfL of any changes to the operating model of their business before they are made”. Uber says this forces it to notify TfL every time it updates its app, such as adding new payment methods, something it says will slow down the rollout of new features. A spokesperson for Khan said: “Sadiq is determined to create a vibrant taxi and private hire market, with space for all providers to flourish, while driving up standards by introducing a comprehensive package of measures that will improve safety and the quality of service offered to all Londoners.”"
2016-08-09T18:00:14Z,uk-news,UK news,"Post-Brexit Sunderland: 'If this money doesn't go to the NHS, I will go mad'","Early morning on the quay at the mouth of the Wear in Sunderland and two middle-aged men wearing flak jackets descend on a dwindling band of seafarers. Their nets lie idle, as the quotas for fish have been used up or sold off. Half the fishing boats here won’t be used to fish again. The trade has been forced into other catches. The “quota cops”, with their body-mounted cameras recording everything, oblige the men to account for the crabs and lobsters caught in pots deposited on the sea bed just outside the harbour. As the crustaceans are counted into a leather-bound register, the exasperated fishermen complain of harassment. These may be the men from the British government ministry, but in post-Brexit Britain, perception is everything. In the eyes of Arthur Mole, the inspectors are as much a product of Brussels as a fruit beer or a sprout. The EU is to blame. “We’ve been like this for 30 years now. On a downward decline. Now we can see a future,” he says. Taking back control can rarely appear so tangible as in the interaction between Brexit-supporting fishermen and the quota police. For Mole, it is the mere possibility of accountability from anyone on the same island.
He takes me on a tour of the harbour, past the old shipyards where his school friends used to build the red blood cells of the world trade system – giant ships and carriers. He points out where the old Wearmouth coal mine went out six miles underneath the North Sea. These are echoes of a time when this city had a specific role in Britain and its economy. With that position came lifelong employment and job certainty. I ask if he thinks leaving the EU might bring back the shipyards and the pits: “We’d like to think so.” He says he knows not one person among the 39% who voted remain. Even in Sunderland, remain and leave inhabit different worlds. He points to the old fishing marina, where some houses now cost £300,000. “An ordinary working person from Sunderland doesn’t have the money for them. Certainly not normal people, not from this area anyway. Maybe Nissan workers can.”
Mole is one of 82,934 Mackems who voted to leave the EU seven weeks ago. The political tumult unleashed by the decision has been put on hold by the summer holidays, but will soon return. The largest people’s mandate ever in British politics will now be given effect by the political system, with the cabinet, the Commons, the Lords and perhaps the supreme court having some say. “Brexit means Brexit” is the diplomatic tautology deployed by the new prime minister as others debate its definition. Many claims are now being made about what the leave mandate actually represents. The decisions made on how to leave could be as consequential as the decision to leave itself. Summer in Sunderland, the totemic leave town, might help clear some things up. The city provided the moment that announced Brexit to the world – the declaration at Sunderland showing 61% of this Labour heartland voting out. Sterling immediately dropped through the floor. One Irish paper christened the city “the town that broke the pound”. Sunderland had long been politically notable for just one thing – the rapidity of the council’s ability to count a completely predictable general election result for Labour. In swing terms, the only thing that changed was the margin of the Labour victory. Nothing had altered, in terms of political representation, for a half a century. Within the confines of our electoral system, large swaths of the UK – cities such as Sunderland – did not matter politically. That changed on 23 June, and spectacularly so.
Three themes come up repeatedly among leave voters. The promise to save the NHS, migration and trust in Boris Johnson. I meet a former social worker, Shirley Bain, who says that her family’s personal reliance on the NHS meant she was very influenced by the promises to divert EU funding. “It hit home with me because I’m using the NHS quite a lot at the minute. My son is really, really poorly in hospital and has been in and out since May. “He’s had a liver transplant and it went wrong, stuff like that – and where would I have been if I’d had to pay upfront for that? I know I’ve paid with my taxes because I’ve worked all my life. I just think that some of the money we are putting into the EU for other things could be put back into our own NHS.” Shirley invites me to a community centre where she volunteers, which recently had its funding for youth services cut. The £350m a week could also help reopen them, she says. Fellow volunteer Peta McDowall, a remain voter, suggests to her the figure was a lie. Peta considers herself a product of Europe – her parents arrived during the Spanish civil war and she attended university in Europe. “I don’t think it was about politics. I think the people who are in Brexit are idiots. I’m sorry, I don’t mean you, Shirley, I mean the head people. When I found out who was our minister for world affairs [Boris Johnson], it’s a joke.” Shirley seems genuinely worried that the £350m number might not be true. She resolves to charter a bus with Peta from the north-east to meet the new foreign secretary. “I would go mad if this money doesn’t go into the NHS, I will go mad. I want to be assured that this money – because that’s why I voted to come out,” says Shirley.
At the Colliery Tavern, which until the early 1990s would throng with miners coming back up from the coalface, and now serves Sunderland’s Stadium of Light, the landlord John Snaith, a leave voter, says it was a protest. “Voters voted because we’ve been neglected so long. They thought this is a chance for them to hear our voice,” he says. His wife, Theresa, says that council cutbacks played a big part. John is a rare thing in this city – a Conservative. But on this occasion, his vote mattered. On the night, when the presumption had been that remain would win, Conservative cabinet ministers started to report a similar phenomenon. “Labour” wards in Tory safe seats, where no party would bother to visit during a general election, were seeing massive turnout. Overall, 2.8m more votes were cast on 23 June than at the general election last year. Turnout spiked particularly in strongly leave areas. In the north-east, Hartlepool (70% leave) saw turnout up by 9%, as did Sunderland. Middlesborough (66% leave) saw turnout up by 12%. Just under 20,000 of those new voters were in Sunderland. One of them, Melanie Jordison, a travel agent, was in the Colliery. “It was something very real. A choice to stay or leave – and both had impacts, whereas in general elections there is no impact, so I thought it a good opportunity to make Britain great again,” she says. She is expecting cheaper food, gas and oil, and wants to close down the borders “a little bit” because “far too many immigrants [are] coming in taking our resources. We can’t afford to feed our own.” The main story on the leave side has been of a left-behind Britain of ignored white middle-class voters who wanted control over borders back and were inured to David Cameron’s “Project Fear” economic scaremongering. On the remain side, Sunderland became the symbol of a Labour heartland encouraged to shoot itself in the foot, with a gun handed to them by Conservative cabinet ministers and loaded with lies.
Politics defies simple narratives most of the time, and spectacularly so right now. I meet leavers completely relaxed about immigration. Car workers who voted out. Fishing industry workers who voted remain. If politics was done solely by numbers, there should have been no contest in the north-east. The region is the most dependent on EU funding of any English region – from the new aquatics centre on the old colliery site, to the university near the old shipyards, and the very fish quay building from where the fisherman lament the EU. The leave campaign promised the funding will be maintained, saying it is merely rerouted UK taxpayer funds, but the dependence will move to Westminster to continue this funding. On the signature issue of the Leave campaign – immigration – the north-east is the region with the smallest proportion of non-British residents: 3%. Figures from 2014 estimated there to be 40,000 European Union migrants and 42,000 non-EU migrants in the region, out of a total population of 2.5 million. If you concentrate on a place such as Sunderland, the migration crisis is rather stark. At the last census, Sunderland had the fastest rate of depopulation of any UK city. Since the 1980s, 8% of its population has gone. The success of the university in attracting international students has helped stabilise the decline in recent years, but its business model is built on increasing the net migration numbers that the government found so difficult to defend. At the very least, it is difficult to see how places such as Sunderland will be greatly affected by less EU migration, when the numbers are very small by the standards of a British city. On the other hand, any risk to the terms of trade between the UK and the remaining EU will hit the north-east first: in per-capita terms, it does more trade with the EU than any other English region. The north-east appears to be shouldering a disproportionate amount of the economic risk of a badly negotiated Brexit.
But politics is not done by numbers these days, still less by experts. For starters, there was little perception of any risk to the Nissan plant. Back at the fishing quay, the trader buying all the crabs and lobsters, Alan McLaughlan, asserts: “That Nissan plant is never, ever going to leave Sunderland. They’ll never, ever get a workforce like they’ve got in Sunderland, never ever.” But perhaps the best example of this are the workers in local supply chains for the industry who voted to leave. James Thoroughgood, a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, voted out despite job concerns, because the EU “needs to be transparent”. Before the vote, David Cameron had told me directly that Brexit could cause job losses at Nissan and that it would be a “self-inflicted wound”. Thoroughgood says such warnings were ignored: “If you’ve got nothing at all, and you are offered to stay where we are because we don’t know what is around the corner, people with nothing will go around the corner every time. What have they got to lose? I think there are lot of people in this area like that.” Vote Leave felt sufficiently confident that it even put Nissan’s logo on its leaflets, despite the threat of court action. But the risk is apparent. The history of the plant is difficult to escape. It only exists because Margaret Thatcher went to Japan in 1982 and visited the Nissan chiefs, personally assuring them of access for their cars to an embryonic British invention – Europe’s single market. She then went into battle for Nissan against French and Italian attempts to block tariff-free exports of the Sunderland-produced Nissan Bluebird. She helped establish the Nissan as a European car, designed for export into Europe and getting around strict quotas for Japanese imports in the face of French opposition.
One of the most influential businessmen in the city’s history will only talk to me off the record. He is flabbergasted that the government’s Brexit team is even contemplating leaving the single market. They have to if they want full immigration controls. And yet the impact of that extra border control will probably be mainly felt in London and the bigger cities – and, mainly, those places did not vote for it. He points me to a song about the Jarrow Crusade march for jobs, down the road. “If they don’t give you a decent job, then with my blessing, burn them down.” That was a song from the Geordie side of the Newcastle/Sunderland divide. “The ‘them’ here is ‘London Town’, and that’s what they’ve done with the leave vote,” he tells me. The common thread among everyone I spoke to was that this was a revolt against London, or perhaps, more specifically, the rest of the country becoming like London. Apart from that, the reasons and rationales were many and varied, and not always consistent – from hospital funding to cutting migration and reopening the pits and the yards. The Mackem mandate is mixed, whatever claims individual politicians will make for leave. Theresa May has more flexibility in defining Brexit than many, including she, might realise. But the cry from Wearside is about much more than the European Union. • Faisal Islam is Sky News’s political editor.

2016-08-09T18:27:04Z,uk-news,UK news,"UK will want to do business with China, regardless of Hinkley Point | Tania Branigan","Though the Chinese ambassador has called the UK’s decision on Hinkley Point C nuclear plant a “crucial historical juncture” for bilateral ties, it barely registers in the long sweep of the relationship. As any schoolchild in China could tell you – but probably rather fewer adults here – the nadir came a couple of centuries ago, when Britain sent in gunboats to protect its drug sales. Those events colour Chinese perceptions of the UK to this day. To the British, it was a necessary but not terribly grave imperial move, putting a decaying power in its place (“Albert is so amused at my having got the island of Hong Kong,” Queen Victoria blithely wrote). For the Chinese, it was a deep and abiding shame. The opium wars kicked off what Beijing terms, and promotes relentlessly, as the “century of humiliation” at the hands of foreign powers, ended only by the Communist party’s triumph.
The Chinese authorities’ claim to legitimacy rests upon their ability to provide economic wellbeing, which is proving increasingly tough, and this idea of renewed national pride, seized and amplified by Xi Jinping since he took power. It is one reason he wanted his people to see his red carpet welcome in London last year: the former aggressor was now bowing its knee. It also increases Beijing’s sensitivity to the 11th-hour halt on Hinkley Point and the public airing of suspicions about China’s behaviour and intentions. The undiplomatic handling will be almost as unwelcome as the decision. But the Chinese are pragmatic and the real lesson from history is that remembering the days when Britannia ruled the waves accentuates its decline. The UK is a waning power, especially since voting for Brexit, which “show[ed] a losing mindset”, in the words of one populist state-run Chinese newspaper. Beijing might, in fact, describe the UK somewhat as Lord Macartney, the first British envoy to China, described China: “An old, crazy, first-rate man of war, which a fortunate succession of able and vigilant officers have contrived to keep afloat ...” China, of course, has no need to force open our economy, because we begged for its cooperation. Engagement and trade has never been the kind of political issue in the UK that it is in the US, where China-bashing is a regular feature of the electoral cycle. The Osborne Doctrine went much further. It looked like business at all costs. And as plenty of diplomats have observed, Beijing does not respect weakness. We are useful, rather than important, thanks to the hangover from our imperial heyday: that permanent seat on the UN security council, for example, and our ability to set an example to others. We are less valuable outside the European Union – no longer China’s gateway to the EU, or its voice in discussions there – but canny investors may relish the prospect of Brexit bargains. China envies our soft power, too, which they have sought without success to buy or manufacture. Yes, we may seem quaint or entertaining – the country of Harry Potter, Downton Abbey and David Beckham – but the Chinese know far more about us than vice versa, even if they don’t always understand us. Their leaders have read Shakespeare and Adam Smith; you’d struggle to find British politicians who could identify Du Fu or Liang Qichao. Meanwhile, under Xi’s leadership, the talk of international friendship has gone hand in hand with increasing domestic stress on the idea that “hostile foreign forces” from the west want to contain China and unleash its disintegration. Talk of human rights is just another way to undermine the country, they say. What the UK and other western countries want most, as the former chancellor George Osborne’s strategy highlighted, is a stable China with which they can do business. Whether or not Theresa May decides Hinkley Point should go ahead, that is unlikely to change."
2016-08-10T08:58:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Hinkley Point: Mandelson urges government to support China-backed project,"Peter Mandelson, the former business secretary, has urged the government to go ahead with the controversial, Chinese-backed Hinkley Point nuclear project, saying that after Brexit “we can’t be too fussy about who we do trade with”. Lord Mandelson, an architect of New Labour who served in several key positions under the Blair and Brown governments, said security fears over Chinese involvement in the project were unfounded, and Britain should foster a relationship with the country as a “prized trading partner”. His intervention in the debate comes after China expressed apparent annoyance at a delay ordered by Theresa May, whose chief of staff last October wrote about how security experts were worried about giving the Chinese a role in Britain’s energy security. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mandelson, whose post-politics jobs include the presidency of the Great Britain China Centre, said he was not surprised that security agencies had made such conclusions, since “that’s their job”.
But he added: “The government has to consider China’s motivation for wanting to finance projects like this and, in my view and I guess in their view too, they judge that it would be commercial global suicide for China if they were to invest on the one hand and then try to mess around with other countries security on the next. “I mean, nobody would trust China ever again; nobody would want to do business with Chinese investors ever again. The truth is that China would have far, far too much to lose if it were to start compromising other countries’ national security.” Moreover, Britain’s vote to leave the European Union had put the country in a difficult position regarding trade, where we needed China more than it needed us, Mandelson said in comments that suggested that Britain could not afford to alienate Asia’s rising power. He said: “We are in a slightly invidious position in trade vis-a-vis China, despite the size of our market we are probably less relevant to China out of the European Union because we would be unable to influence that huge bloc’s future trade policies anymore and out of the EU we are probably more dependent on China’s goodwill because we will need to replace trade lost in Europe.
“So we are not in the happiest of positions, but this is the reality and we have got to adopt a pragmatic approach to this. We can’t be too fussy about who we do trade with, whilst at the same time trying not to be a pushover and become supplicants in world trade.” Mandelson’s comments came after China’s ambassador warned on Monday that relations with the UK could be jeopardised if the government chose to cancel Chinese investment in the £18bn Hinkley Point C reactor in Somerset. Liu Xiaoming wrote in an article for the Financial Times: “Right now, the China-UK relationship is at a crucial historical juncture. Mutual trust should be treasured even more. I hope the UK will keep its door open to China and that the British government will continue to support Hinkley Point – and come to a decision as soon as possible so that the project can proceed smoothly.” A government spokesman later said the delays did not signal a cooling of enthusiasm for trade with China. Treasury sources added that Philip Hammond, who travelled to China last month for the G20 finance ministers’ meeting in his first overseas visit as chancellor, was no less committed to securing Chinese investment into Britain than his predecessor, George Osborne, who had promised to inaugurate a “golden decade” of cooperation between the two countries. EDF, the French state energy company which is due to build Hinkley point C, brought China General Nuclear Power Corporation on board help spread the financial load by taking a 33% stake in the project. China is also expected to have a significant role in future reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex. The project is heavily subsidised by the UK taxpayer, and the government has promised to pay well over the current market rates for electricity generated by the new reactor."
2016-08-10T11:35:48Z,uk-news,UK news,New Duke of Westminster inherits £9bn fortune aged 25,"He is godfather to a future king, and now owns a large chunk of the most exclusive parts of London. At just 25, Hugh Richard Louis Grosvenor, who has become the 7th Duke of Westminster after the sudden death of his 64-year-old father on Tuesday, will inherit a family fortune estimated by American business magazine Forbes at about £9bn, and the ancestral seat Eaton Hall in Cheshire. Though the third of four siblings, the duke, previously known by the honorary title Earl Grosvenor, is the only son of the late Duke of Westminster and his wife, Natalia. Little is publicly known of the former student of countryside management at Newcastle University. His family guarded his privacy as he was growing up as heir apparent to the vast fortune, which now makes him the third wealthiest landowner in the UK, and, according to Forbes, the 68th wealthiest person in the world. He has kept largely out of the limelight, though found himself the subject of media attention when he became the youngest and wealthiest of Prince George’s godparents.
His 21st birthday party at Eaton Hall, which reportedly cost £5m, also made the newspapers. He hosted about 800 guests, including Prince Harry, at the “black tie and neon” bash, where comedian Michael McIntyre and hip-hop duo Rizzle Kicks topped the bill. Guests who wanted to give a gift were asked to contribute to the the young earl’s large wine collection. He told the Chester Chronicle at the time: “The party was simply amazing – a birthday and a party I will never forget. It is the beginning of a new era in my life and I look forward to the challenges that lie ahead.” Though the 7th Duke of Westminster has two older sisters, he inherits the title and estate, which includes 190 acres in Belgravia and thousands of acres in Scotland and Spain, through the rule of primogeniture, which puts male children ahead of female siblings irrespective of age. The primogeniture law for the British monarchy was abolished in 2013 before the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s first child, Prince George.
Described as “baby-faced” and “absurdly rich” by Vanity Fair magazine, the young earl made an appearance on the Tatler List, with the description: “Hughie’s a Newcastle graduate with his own wine collection who goes wild for the girls”, adding that after inheriting his father’s estate he would “own half of London”. Unlike many of his social contemporaries, the new duke was not educated at boarding school, but attended a state primary before going to a private day school close to home in Cheshire. He is two years younger than his father was when he took on the fortune aged 27, and currently works as an account manager for Bio-bean, a green technology company that recycles waste coffee grounds into advanced biofuels and biochemicals. His family has long had close links to the royals. His father was a close friend of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, who were said by Clarence House to be “deeply shocked and greatly saddened” by the death. Buckingham Palace said the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh had been made aware of the news and a message of condolence was being sent to the family, while Kensington Palace said: “The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were very sad to learn of the Duke of Westminster’s passing yesterday. Their thoughts are very much with his family this morning.” The 7th Duke of Westminster’s mother, Natalia, Duchess of Westminster, is one of Prince William’s godparents. His sister Lady Tamara is married to Edward Van Cutsem, whose family have long been close to Charles, William and Harry. Another Van Cutsem brother, William, is also a godparent to Prince George. Another sister, Lady Edwina, is married to the historian and television presenter Dan Snow. His youngest sister, Lady Viola Grosvenor, is a supporter of the children’s charity Kidscape.
Along with his inheritance, the new duke is also likely to take on responsibility for the Westminster Foundation, the charitable body that manages the philanthropic activities of the Grosvenor family. The foundation was set up in the 1970s and has awarded more than £40m in grants. Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, the 6th Duke of Westminster, was on his Abbeystead estate in the Trough of Bowland, Lancashire, when he became unwell. He was airlifted to Royal Preston hospital, where he died. A spokeswoman for Lancashire constabulary said there were no suspicious circumstances and a file would be passed to the coroner. The origins of the Grosvenor family fortune date back more than 300 years when an ancestor of the new duke, Sir Thomas Grosvenor, married wealthy heiress Mary Davies, who had inherited a medieval manor in Middlesex and 500 acres of undeveloped land west of London. Part of that land, which forms part of the Grosvenor’s London estate, was built on by the family in the early 18th century and became known as Mayfair, named after the annual Mayday fair. A second big development by the family 100 years later became Belgravia, named after the village of Belgrave, near the family’s country seat in Cheshire. After that the family business expanded globally with overseas developments in the Americas, Australia, Asia and Europe. The 6th Duke of Westminster was credited for his charity work, which included making a £500,000 donation to farmers during the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak. He also fought a legal battle against Westminster city council in 1990 to protect a number of social housing flats built on the family’s land in Pimlico, London, which the council wanted to sell.
Of his wealth, the duke once said: “Given the choice, I would rather not have been born wealthy, but I never think of giving it up. I can’t sell. It doesn’t belong to me.” He grew up in an isolated rural community in Northern Ireland believing he was destined to become a beef farmer. He was educated at Harrow, where he gained two O-levels, and Sandhurst, and later went to work on ranches in Australia and Canada. His inheritance meant he was forced to abandon later dreams of a military career, though he did serve with the Territorial Army. He had a nervous breakdown and depression in 1998, saying the pressures of business and the great number of public appearances he was making had overwhelmed him. Speaking about his son in 1993, he said: “He’s been born with the longest silver spoon anyone can have, but he can’t go through life sucking on it. He has to put back what he has been given.”"
2016-08-10T11:47:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Southern rail dispute: train firm boss accuses union of misleading staff,"The boss of Southern trains has stepped up his attacks on the RMT union, accusing it of repeatedly misleading the staff it represents, as hopes were dashed of fresh talks to bring an early end to this week’s strike. Writing in the Guardian, Charles Horton, the chief executive of Govia Thameslink Railway, which operates the Southern franchise, blamed the RMT for the collapse of talks last week and said its “intransigent and self-interested attitude” was at the root of the current problems.
Horton did say: “In recent months travelling on Southern trains has been a nightmare.” But he pointed the finger again at the RMT for “an unprecedented and bizarre epidemic of staff sickness [that] has left us unable to run the service people expect”. Horton said that proposed changes to the role of the conductors on Southern trains had been deemed safe by rail standards authorities, and jobs were guaranteed, so he was mystified why they were “causing the RMT to unleash such misery on passengers”. He added: “Some have suggested the real reason for their disproportionate reaction is that they fear a loss of their own power and control, and want to maintain their ability to stop services.” He said one in five conductors had worked this week in defiance of the strike, and praised staff as “overwhelmingly diligent and hard-working, and they care deeply about the rail service they provide”. But Horton added: “They are being led astray, and misled repeatedly, by a trade union acting in its own narrow, selfish interests and ignoring the interests of either commuters or their members.” He repeated an offer to meet. But the RMT said that its own offer to meet, without preconditions, had in effect been rejected as Southern management was demanding to discuss terms only once the principle of proposed changes to the operation of doors – a technicality at the heart of the dispute – was accepted. The union’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “Their position is that we can discuss anything we like as long as it’s only what they want to discuss. That makes a mockery of the negotiation process and proves that they have no intention of ending this dispute regardless of the cost.” Labour and the TUC, meanwhile, called on the government to urge GTR to restart talks. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said GTR should “urgently accept the offer of RMT to enter into immediate unconditional talks”. He said Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, should act at once, adding: “All he needs to do is pick up the phone to GTR and rail services can be restored in time for tomorrow’s rush hour. The long-suffering passengers will not understand why a government minister would do anything other than encourage all parties to embrace this opportunity.” The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Hundreds of thousands of commuters will be wondering today why Southern rail is refusing to talk. And rail workers would far rather negotiate than strike. The government must send a clear message to Southern rail that they expect public service companies to sit down and negotiate instead of prolonging a dispute.” Grayling and the rail minister, Paul Maynard, have ruled out direct talks between the government and the unions, but even some Conservatives now believe that such action could be necessary. Huw Merriman, a member of the transport select committee and the MP for Bexhill and Battle, whose constituents have been badly affected by the dispute, said Southern alone could not offer the guarantees on the future role of guards. He added: “I can understand the reluctance to pander to the RMT. But the situation is now so serious, and affecting the lives of so many commuters, that the government needs to be directly involved.” The strike, which started on Monday, has resulted in about 60% of normal services running. The train drivers’ union Aslef has also given notice of a ballot for industrial action, which could mean further strikes on Southern next month."
2016-08-10T12:49:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Scottish government to spend £100m to cushion post-Brexit vote effects,"The Scottish government is to redirect £100m from a budget underspend last year into a new initiative to help cushion the economy from the impacts of a post-EU referendum downturn. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said the spending was needed to help stimulate the already weak Scottish economy in the wake of the “deep and widespread uncertainty” caused by the Brexit vote in June. “The UK government has not yet taken any meaningful action to alleviate uncertainty or to boost confidence, and there are very real concerns that the damage to the economy and to jobs will be severe and long-lasting,” Sturgeon said. “It is against this background that the Scottish government is announcing early action to boost confidence, stimulate economic activity and support business.” The initiative, unveiled with a £5m capital project for new medical facilities at the Golden Jubilee hospital in Clydebank, will be known as a capital acceleration programme and will largely be devoted to speeding up existing projects. Despite the implication that the government was bringing forward future spending or using new money, Sturgeon’s official statement on Wednesday did not make it clear that the funds had come from a £115m underspend last year. A spokesman also added that the £100m had not yet been allocated or committed. There was no guarantee it would all be spent, and no date yet fixed for updating the Scottish parliament on how and where the money would be used. “There is a range of factors to be worked through. I can’t say whether this money will be used for new projects or accelerated projects,” he said. Holyrood was told in June that the Scottish government had underspent last year by £75m in its resource budget for day-to-day spending in colleges, schools, and community and housing, and £40m underspent in its capital budget. The finance secretary, Derek Mackay, also told MSPs there was a further £40m underspend from financial transactions, which was ringfenced for loans and equity investments in the private sector. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s economy spokeswoman, said the £100m seemed like a drop in the ocean against the cost of major infrastructure projects. “This money coming from previous SNP government underspends shows that it could already have been invested in vital projects,” she said. “It’s welcome that the SNP are taking Labour’s advice on responding to the economic shocks of Brexit, but this is beginning to look like an attempt to grab headlines rather than a meaningful programme of investment.” Economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute (FAI) warned in late July that the Brexit vote would have a significant impact on Scotland’s already weak economy, which has been underperforming compared to the UK overall since the global crash in oil prices, pushing it towards recession. The FAI downgraded its GDP forecasts for Scotland for each of the next three years, by 0.5% this year, 1.4% for next year and 1.3% in 2018. Scottish unemployment was likely to rise to 7% next year, it added. Sturgeon’s announcement follows her visit to Berlin on Tuesday to meet Germany’s Europe minister, Michael Roth, where she again set out her case for a favourable deal for Scotland with the EU in the Brexit talks. Little emerged about the content of the talks, but both ministers said they were constructive. Roth said his government was anxious to preserve Europe’s cohesion during and after the Brexit process. In a statement issued through the Scottish government, Roth said: “This has been a very pleasant and constructive conversation between two dedicated pro-Europeans and has demonstrated once again that a degree of Europe’s strength lies in its diversity. I hope that the UK finds a way forward that will benefit Europe as a whole in the end.” David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, was in Glasgow on Wednesday to meet business and community leaders to press the UK government’s competing case for a collective cross-government approach to Brexit. Business groups and the Scottish TUC welcomed Sturgeon’s announcement, although the Scottish Retail Consortium said it came as ministers were putting up business rates on top of a £62m rates hike for larger shops. Grahame Smith, the general secretary of the Scottish TUC, said he strongly the new strategy strongly. “The Scottish economy, already weak due to the downturn in the oil and gas sector, risks falling into technical recession as a result of Brexit-induced uncertainty. In this context, it is important that the Scottish government accelerates capital projects where feasible in order to support employment.”"
2016-08-10T13:23:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Southern rail dispute: Thursday and Friday strikes called off,"Strikes by Southern railway workers on Thursday and Friday have been called off to allow fresh talks in the row over the role of conductors, Acas said. The development came after the chief executive of Southern trains stepped up his attacks on the RMT union, accusing it of repeatedly misleading the staff it represents. The union had in turn accused Southern of making “a mockery of the negotiation process” and of having no intention of resolving the dispute. Following an offer from the RMT to suspend the action if Southern returned to talks without any preconditions, Acas announced that the strike, which began on Monday, would be suspended. A spokesman for the conciliation service said: “Southern and the RMT are returning to talks tomorrow under the auspices of Acas. Strike action has been suspended for Thursday and Friday.” The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said in a message to members that he had contacted Southern with a way forward to resolve the dispute. “Please be advised that I have now received communication from the conciliation service Acas informing me that the company will now enter into negotiations with our union officials without any preconditions.
“The national executive committee has had time to consider this matter and have acknowledged that some progress is being made. As the company have now agreed to meet with our union officials without the caveat of any preconditions the NEC has therefore instructed me to inform you and your colleagues that the strike action has now been suspended with immediate effect until further notice. “You and your colleagues are therefore instructed to return to work for all shifts commencing from 22.00hrs tonight. I would like to congratulate you all on your steadfast and unwavering support for your colleagues during this dispute and the bravery and strength of unity you have shown during this difficult time.” A Southern spokesman said: “We are encouraged that the RMT has accepted our offer to resume talks at Acas and has agreed to call off its strike action. For our passengers’ sake we truly hope these talks will be productive and bring this long-running dispute to an end. “At present, the strike timetable is still in the industry train planning systems for Thursday and Friday. Regrettably, this means tomorrow’s service will be based upon the present strike timetable, but we will do our very best to add services in and extend the hours of operation wherever possible. “On Friday we plan to revert to the revised timetable operating before the strike. We will update our website, www.southernrailway.com, as further information becomes available.” The strike, which started on Monday, has resulted in about 60% of normal services running. The dispute has centred on the role of conductors on new trains. Southern wants drivers to have responsibility for closing train doors, while retaining onboard staff to look after passengers on journeys. The union says safety would be compromised. The train drivers’ union, Aslef, has also given notice of a ballot for industrial action, which could mean further strikes on Southern next month. Transport secretary Chris Grayling said: “This is good news for passengers. This strike has inconvenienced people needlessly and I am glad to see RMT sitting round the table as I called for yesterday. “It’s important now to leave the union and the train operator to undertake these necessary talks. I hope they reach a positive conclusion as quickly as possible.”"
2016-08-10T14:50:38Z,uk-news,UK news,Woman killed in Wandsworth police chase named,"A woman who died in a police car chase after reports of a drone being flown into a prison has been identified in media reports. The Evening Standard identified the woman as Acacia Smith, 25, known to friends as Caysha. It described her as a nursery nurse. Smith died shortly after 3am on Tuesday when the vehicle she was in crashed near Wandsworth Bridge Road, south-west London, during a high-speed police chase after staff at Wandsworth prison reported seeing a quadcopter being flown nearby. A man who was also in the vehicle remains in a critical condition. Photos of the scene showed a silver car extensively damaged and lying on its side after having ploughed into the front wall of a house. The incident is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The Metropolitan police declined to confirm Smith’s identity when contacted by the Guardian and said it could not comment further on the incident. Kamara Rattrey, a close family friend, told the Evening Standard: “Caysha had a way of bringing people together. She loved children and was passionate about helping them to learn. The thing she will be best remembered for is her mischievous smile and cheeky laugh.” Tony Plummer, whose front wall the car crashed into, described the “devastation” of the crash to the Evening Standard. “You could hear the driver screaming out her name and the police were telling him not to move. He was totally traumatised … The paramedics were working on her in the street for at least half an hour and then they stopped and pulled the sheet over her. He was taken away in the ambulance.” Plummer said he had seen a quadcopter drone in the car during the recovery work. An IPCC spokesman said: “The Metropolitan police referred the matter to the IPCC because a police vehicle was following the car involved in the collision immediately prior to the incident. “IPCC investigators attended the scene and also the post-incident procedures where the officers involved are providing their accounts. The investigation is in its early stages.”"
2016-08-10T16:06:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Catholic priest jailed for 12 years for sexually abusing 13 children,"A Catholic priest and former children’s home worker has been jailed for 12 years after admitting the sexual abuse of 13 children dating back to the 1970s. Philip Temple, 66, was sentenced at Woolwich crown court after pleading guilty to 20 charges of sexual assault in April and a further seven charges this week. Temple twice stood trial in the late 1990s. In the first case the jury was unable to reach a verdict and Temple was acquitted in a retrial. Before passing sentence on Wednesday, the judge, Christopher Hehir, apologised to one of Temple’s victims that “justice was not done when you came to court in 1998 and 1999”. The court heard that the victim had become a self-harming recluse and had attempted suicide following the trials. “I can only imagine the damage he has caused to other victims. We can never escape from what he did and we can never be free of it,” the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the court. Temple was “an extremely skilled liar and manipulator with sociopathic qualities”, the victim added. The judge said there had been another missed opportunity to bring Temple to justice when the youngest known victim, who was six or seven when abused by Temple when he worked for Wandsworth council in south London, began civil proceedings against the council in 1991. According to Jonathan Polnay, prosecuting, the civil case “appeared to be settled with no payment” and police did not investigate when the victim reported the alleged abuse four years later. Temple sexually assaulted boys and one girl when working for Wandsworth and Lambeth councils in the 1970s. He became a priest in 1988 and abused two altar boys while serving at Christ the King monastery, Vita Et Pax in Cockfosters, north London, in the 1990s. The judge said he viewed Temple’s move to become ordained as a Catholic priest as an “aggravating factor”. Hehir said: “You of course exploited the opportunities your deceit as to your character had afforded you, not only by sexually abusing children but, as a priest, by lying on oath to deny the truthful accusations brought against you by one of your victims. “Your actions as a priest demonstrated that in truth you were a wolf in shepherd’s clothing.” Detectives from the Metropolitan police’s sexual offences, exploitation and child abuse (SOECA) command launched an investigation after receiving information that implicated Temple in multiple offences. He was arrested on 6 July last year. Lambeth council said it was cooperating with the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA). “We hope the outcome provides some solace to the victims of these dreadful crimes,” said a spokesman. In a statement, the diocese of Westminster said it was “aware of the sentencing of Philip Temple, a member of the Monte Oliveto Benedictine order. The diocese has fully cooperated with the statutory authorities throughout the investigation.” The statement added: “The diocese of Westminster has robust safeguarding policies in place and rigorous selection procedures for candidates for the priesthood.” Temple, of no fixed address, also admitted two counts of perjury relating to his earlier trials."
2016-08-10T17:35:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Oil rig in Western Isles may have leaked tonnes of diesel into Atlantic,"Salvage experts fear that tonnes of diesel has leaked into the Atlantic after a drilling rig ran aground, breaching its fuel tanks, in the Western Isles of Scotland earlier this week. The specialists believe two of the four fuel storage tanks on the Transocean Winner platform were damaged as well as water stability tanks, when the 17,000-tonne rig crashed into rocks near Carloway on the Isle of Lewis in a heavy storm. The platform, which ran aground close to Dalmore beach, a popular surfing spot, was carrying 280 tonnes (70,000 gallons) of diesel, but there has been no sign so far of an oil slick or other visible evidence that fuel was still leaking into the sea. Hugh Shaw, the UK government’s representative for maritime and salvage, said a Maritime and Coastguard Agency spotter plane was now scouring the area south of the rig for signs of a slick, but nothing had been seen or smelt since Monday. He said that suggested any fuel leak happened as the rig, which was unmanned at the time, first hit the rocks. It is unclear how much diesel has escaped. “We’re not getting any reports of anything or that anyone is seeing anything,” Shaw said. “It may well be that if the tanks have been breached, and we’ve lost the contents, it might well have been lost on Monday morning in the adverse weather when the installation ran ashore.” Shaw disclosed that it could be several months before the rig, which was being towed from Norway to Malta when a tow rope snapped during a gale at about 4.30am on Monday morning, could be removed. The breached tanks were detected by a team who spent three-and-a-half hours on the platform on Tuesday, using sounding pipes to test how much oil and ballast was in each tank. A plan to winch a larger inspection team down on to the rig on Wednesday morning, to continue those investigations over a full day, were scuppered because the wind was not strong enough to give the helicopter the right flying conditions for a safe operation. The forecast shows the weather is likely to worsen greatly for the next four days, further hampering the investigation, Shaw said. “We do know from the forecasts we’re getting from tomorrow, it’s going to start deteriorating,” he said. Speaking from Lewis, where he is overseeing the salvage operation, Shaw said that the salvors and Transocean, the rig’s owners, had to establish what kind of repairs were needed to seal up the ballast tank and oil tanks to make sure it was seaworthy. “Where she’s sitting, that could be very difficult,” he warned. They needed to get the right barges on site and wait for a clear weather window before attempting to pull it clear. “We’re certainly not talking days. We might not be talking weeks; it may be much longer than that” before the rig could be refloated, he said. The incident is now under investigation by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch, with two tugs on standby, including the MCA’s emergency tug ETV Herakles. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has imposed a 300-metre exclusion zone around the site, to prevent onlookers hampering the salvage teams and emergency services, and to stop onlookers venturing onto cliffs close to the beached rig. The disclosure of the suspected leak added further urgency to questions from the Scottish government and conservationists about the decision to tow the vessel during a storm, and the UK government decision to scrap an emergency tug based in Stornoway on Lewis in 2012. Dr Richard Dixon, the director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said the leak could pose a serious threat to local wildlife, including whales, dolphins and seabirds. Seven miles west of the grounding site was EU-protected Loch Roag coastal lagoons system. The risks posed to the marine environment by oil installations was likely to increase, with further decommissioning of rigs due soon and climate change certain to increase the severity and unpredictability of violent storms in the Atlantic. “If the diesel oil leaks into the environment, the clamour for answers as to why such a risky trip was attempted will grow much louder,” Dixon said. “Why was the rig taking this dangerous route off the mainland in such a storm? How do we make sure that companies don’t repeat these mistakes?” Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, said her government was already pressing the UK government for information on why the Transocean Winner was allowed to transit UK waters when a storm had been forecast. “Although the diesel is expected to rapidly disperse in the current sea conditions, the environment group, which is chaired by [the government agency] Marine Scotland, has put in place measures to swiftly identify any potential environmental impact on this precious and fragile marine habitat,” she said."
2016-08-10T18:58:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Judge and defendant exchange insults in court,"A judge who was verbally abused by a defendant reciprocated at a court hearing where he was being sentenced for breaching an antisocial behaviour order. John Hennigan, 50, who had breached the order by using racist language towards a black woman and her two children told Chelmsford crown court judge Patricia Lynch QC that she was “a bit of a cunt”. And Judge Lynch replied: “You are a bit of a cunt yourself.” When Hennigan screamed back “Go fuck yourself”, the judge replied: “You too.” He reportedly also shouted “Sieg Heil” – a pro-Hitler chant used in Nazi Germany – and banged the glass panel of the dock as he was jailed for 18 months. Hennigan, from Harlow, Essex, has dozens of previous convictions for offences including drug and firearm possession and common assault. An asbo was previously imposed on him in 2005 when a swastika was discovered daubed on the front door of his council house. He was in court for breaching the order in 2010, when he launched racist abuse at a newsagent before attacking him with a display of sweets. Appearing before an Old Bailey judge in October 2012 after making Nazi salutes at a pub in London, he claimed he had only been raising his arm to collect his change after paying for a drink. He was convicted of breaching an asbo. Sentencing him on that occasion, the judge, Nicholas Cooke QC, said: “In sentencing you, the court is not upholding some culture of political correctness. It is preserving public order and dealing with behaviour that is regarded by most people as way, way off the scale in terms of that which is acceptable. “In this crowded public house in this city you gave a Nazi salute and spoke provocatively of Jews. The Holocaust was a crime against humanity of enormous magnitude. Behaving in the way you did was appalling.”"
2016-08-10T19:54:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May calls on Argentina to lift Falklands oil exploration restrictions,"Theresa May has called on Argentina to discuss running more flights to the Falkland Islands and lifting its restrictions on oil exploration in the area. It is the prime minister’s first public communication with Argentina over the contested South Atlantic islands, which are governed by Britain, since she moved in to Downing Street last month. The letter she wrote to Argentina’s president, Mauricio Macri, was published by local media, but was not reported by Downing Street. Since taking office in December, Macri has sought to strengthen his country’s ties with Britain and end the confrontational approach of the previous administration. In a letter largely welcomed in Argentina, May wrote: “It is my sincere hope that, where we have differences, these can be acknowledged in an atmosphere of mutual respect and with the intention to act in a way that benefits all those concerned. “This includes making progress towards new air links between the Falkland Islands and third countries in the region and the removal of restrictive hydrocarbons measures.” Argentina’s foreign minister, Susana Malcorra, said later that London and Buenos Aires had been discussing the issue of flights for three months. “This conversation started during my visit to London in May when I met with my then counterpart Philip Hammond,” Malcorra said. “We began talking about the possibility of reestablishing flights. We’ve been exploring and looking at ways to do this but it hasn’t been resolved yet.” Malcorra said the possibility of a meeting between May and Macri at the G20 summit in China next month was under discussion. “We think it is a good opportunity for a first conversation,” the minister said. She added that the issue of hydrocarbons was also under discussion. “The United Kingdom has expressed interest in looking at the hydrocarbons law, we have our legal departments working on it, so I’d say that work is in progress.” The Chilean company Latam currently operates a flight from Santiago to the Falklands every Saturday via Punta Arenas in southern Chile. Once a month, the same flight also stops in Rio Gallegos in Argentina. Under the previous 12 years of leftwing government, Argentina restricted hydrocarbon exploration in the area around the Falklands. The UK has continually asked for the restrictions to be lifted. To do so may be difficult, because Macri is in a coalition and might not get the support of parliament. Macri met David Cameron at Davos earlier this year, and the two men agreed not to allow the Falklands dispute to damage wider relations between London and Buenos Aires. May’s letter appears in part to have been a response to lobbying by the Argentinian government to win UK support for its candidate to replace Ban Ki-moon as UN secretary general. Argentina is promoting Malcorra for the post. Britain is not expected to reveal how it voted, but it us likely to support Malcorra. Some, however, say it would be difficult to give her such a sensitive diplomatic role, given that the Falklands dispute means her neutrality would be questioned. May is likely to meet Macri at the G20 summit in China in September, when they are likely to discuss their mutual determination to fight international corruption. During a visit to Brussels in July, Macri said that “our claim will never change”, but hoped for dialogue with Britain."
2016-08-10T21:34:15Z,uk-news,UK news,Four people die in eight-vehicle crash on A34 in Berkshire,"A man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving after four people were killed in an eight-vehicle rush hour pile-up in Berkshire. Emergency services were called to the scene on a stretch of the A34 shortly after 5pm on Wednesday, following the collision involving four heavy goods vehicles and four cars.
Four people died at the scene while at least one man remained in John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford with life-threatening injuries. Two other people were taken to the Royal Berkshire hospital by ambulance with minor injuries. Nine others suffered minor injuries and were treated at the scene. The northbound carriageway between the M4 junction at Chieveley and West Ilsley was closed in the wake of the incident. The southbound carriageway was closed for a period of time to allow the air ambulance to land. Thames Valley police appealed for witnesses to the incident, which led to six-mile tailbacks on the route. Senior investigating officer Insp Andy Storey, from the joint operations unit for roads policing based at Three Mile Cross, said: “Officers are currently on the scene responding to this fatal collision. All motorists should avoid the area, use alternative routes and await further updates before attempting to travel on this route. We appreciate motorists’ patience while we deal with this incident. “I would like to appeal to anyone who witnessed the collision, including anyone travelling on the southbound carriageway who saw anything they believe is significant, to contact police.”"
2016-08-10T23:01:21Z,uk-news,UK news,UK confusion between integration and counter-terrorism hinders Muslims,"The government’s conflation of integration with counter-terrorism has exacerbated inequalities experienced by British Muslims, MPs have said.
Islamophobia, stereotyping, cultural traditions and insufficient role models have also contributed to Muslims experiencing the highest levels of unemployment among all religious and ethnic groups – 12.8% compared with 5.4% for the general population – according to the Commons women and equalities committee. The report, called Employment Opportunities for Muslims in the UK, published by the committee on Thursday, calls on the government to introduce specific policies to help Muslims overcome these issues but directs some of its strongest concerns towards integration policy. The MPs say that rather than focusing on issues such as language difficulties through the lens of counter-extremism, which they say happens at present, the emphasis should be on “how it improves the life chances of disadvantaged communities”. The committee’s chair, Maria Miller, said: “The government is making attempts to deal with the problems that Muslim people face in getting work but our analysis would be that their attempts are being undermined by this clear link that Muslim people are making between government policy on employment and government policy on counter-extremism.” While acknowledging the importance of the counter-terrorism strategy, the committee said it had destroyed trust within Muslim communities to the extent that some individuals were reluctant to talk to its members for fear they were part of the controversial Prevent programme. The report highlights that as well as experiencing the highest levels of unemployment, 41% of Muslims are economically inactive, compared with 21.8% of the general population. But it bemoaned the lack of data on Muslims, which it said must be addressed to help devise the government’s response to the inequalities. Other recommended policies include possible legislation to introduce name-blind recruitment by employers, local budgets for Jobcentre Plus offices to fund targeted support in areas with high levels of Muslim unemployment and a dedicated careers service for minority ethnic students in universities. The committee says there is a particularly pressing need to help women, who, it says, face the triple issue of being female, BME (black and minority ethnic) and Muslim and face the most barriers, when job-hunting and once in work. Millar said she was personally shocked by the inequalities they face. “It was made very clear to us that Muslim women face very real stereotypes to counter – both in the workplace and in their community – with respect to work.” The inquiry heard evidence that traditional family pressures holding that women are homemakers and the lack of women in governance roles at mosques are among the obstacles preventing Muslim women fulfilling their potential. To counter these, the committee suggests mosques should promote opportunities for women and the government should introduce a role models and mentoring programme aimed at Muslim women. It says employers should be made aware of their legal duties with respect to discrimination, especially with respect to women who may wear cultural or religious clothing. The MPs want the government to come up with a plan by the end of the year to tackle the inequalities it has highlighted. Farah Elahi, research and policy analyst at a race equality thinktank, the Runnymede Trust, welcomed the report and said it was time for government action. “The government should be concerned about these issues because they are legitimate [in their own right], not just through the prism of counter-terrorism.” A government spokeswoman said: “We want all people, regardless of their faith or gender to have access to the same opportunities so that they can reach their full potential. We are making progress – for example, there are now 45% more Muslim women in work than in 2011 – but we know there is much more to do. We will look carefully at the recommendations and respond in due course.”"
2016-08-10T23:01:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Prisons inspector praises immigration centre for families set for closure,"The chief inspector of prisons has praised an immigration detention centre for families facing forced removal from Britain, which ministers have decided to close. Peter Clarke, the chief inspector, says Cedars, which opened in 2011 near Gatwick airport, has been a “groundbreaking facility” that will now be lost despite significant human and financial investment over the past few years. “Cedars produced the best outcomes for detainees that we have seen anywhere in immigration detention,” Clarke says in his report on an unannounced inspection of the centre carried out in June, before its closure was announced.
Robert Goodwill, the new immigration minister who announced the closure of the facility on 21 July, said the decision had been taken on grounds of value for money, reflecting its low level of use in the past few years as more families facing removal chose to return to their home countries voluntarily. Goodwill said a “discrete unit” within the nearby Tinsley House immigration removal centre would be used instead. There is a 72-hour limit on the detention of families with children, extendable to up to seven days with ministerial authorisation. Cedars, a large Edwardian house with extensive grounds, was opened as a secure facility to detain families as a result of a Liberal Democrat initiative in the coalition government in 2010 to end the routine immigration detention of children.
A family returns policy, overseen by an independent panel, was set up with an emphasis on voluntary returns and Cedars was opened to be used only as a last resort. The number of children detained fell from 1,119 in 2009 to 110 in the year to March 2016. In his report, the chief inspector of prisons confirms that Cedars has been little used since it was last inspected in 2014, with 46 families having been held there and only 16 of them being removed from Britain. “The low and decreasing level of use was ascribed by the Home Office to the success of the returns process and the fact that more families were accepting voluntary assistance to leave the UK. In addition, two recent reports had made reference to the cost of Cedars,” says Clarke in his introduction. He adds that 2,442 families have “entered the family returns process” since 2014, 1,597 of which have been removed from Britain. The inspection report says the centre has been fitted out to a very high standard, with a kitchen and sitting room in each family apartment. There is also a fitness room, library, IT room, chapel, playroom and lounge areas. It adds that Cedars has gained an international reputation for the quality of its facilities.
Clarke praises the Home Office, the security company G4S and the children’s charity Barnardo’s for the way they jointly run the detention facility, saying it provides an excellent environment for children at a very stressful and potentially traumatic moment in their lives. He adds that force has not been used since the last inspection, nor family separation. The decision by Home Office ministers to use a “discrete unit” in Tinsley House has been criticised by the chief executive of Barnardo’s, Javed Khan. “We do not feel that the new proposed accommodation is in the best interests of the children and have told ministers we cannot support the move,” he said. The chief inspector of prisons will be monitoring the new facilities at Tinsley House."
2016-08-10T23:09:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Heathrow staff security passes suspended during police investigation,"Security passes for 300 staff providing services for the lounge areas at Heathrow have been suspended against the backdrop of a police investigation into alleged fraud linked to passes. Two women, aged 20 and 24, were arrested on 28 July and bailed until November on suspicion of fraud and money laundering, Scotland Yard said on Wednesday. Sodexo, a contractor at the airport, subsequently confirmed that the airside passes of around 300 employees were suspended as “as a precautionary measure”. The company said that the move was part of an ongoing investigation and that it was unable to provide further comment. The staff are believed to include cleaners and caterers. Police said other matters had arisen since the arrests, which are believed to relate to airside security passes at Heathrow – one of the busiest airports in the world. The concern is believed to be around the processing of passes, according to Sky News. However, Scotland Yard said there was “no evidence that airside passes have been sold”. A Metropolitan police spokeswoman confirmed two women had been arrested. “They have been arrested in relation to an allegation that money has been fraudulently taken from a bank account,” she said. “Other matters have come to light during the inquiries and form part of the ongoing investigation.” Permanent and temporary passes are provided to flight crews, baggage handlers and a range of other staff working at Heathrow, which has around 70,000 workers.
Tighter checks for airport staff and stronger restrictions on access to sensitive areas were introduced in 2002 following two multi-million pound robberies at the airport. Current vetting require applicants for airside passes to provide five years’ employment references without gaps. Although there is no indication that the arrests and the suspension of the airside passes are in any way terror-related, they come at a time when concerns about airport security have been brought into sharp focus once again in the wake of the attack on Brussels airport earlier this year. Aviation security in the UK is under constant review, according to the Department for Transport, while an increased police presence at Heathrow is believed to have been in place for some time. As recently as last month, a transport minister said that the government was taking “all steps necessary to keep the public safe” after a threat was reportedly made against the airport. An alert from non-governmental counter-terrorism organisation Site Intelligence Group warned of a threat being made by a “pro-Islamic State Twitter account”. It was reported to have threatened attacks on planes flying from Heathrow to the US across the US Independence Day holiday weekend. The alert also warned “there will be a device placed in either Heathrow, LAX [Los Angeles] or JFK [New York] airports”. Speaking about the latest concerns over access, the Department for Transport said: “We are aware of this issue. Safety and security of passengers is our priority.” “We keep aviation security under constant review, but as this matter is the subject of an ongoing police investigation we are unable to comment further at this time.”"
2016-08-11T00:11:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Nuclear espionage charge for China firm with one-third stake in UK's Hinkley Point,"The Chinese company with a major stake in the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station has been charged by the US government over nuclear espionage, according to the US justice department. In a 17-page indictment, the US government said nuclear engineer Allen Ho, employed by the China General Nuclear Power Company, and the company itself had unlawfully conspired to develop nuclear material in China without US approval and “with the intent to secure an advantage to the People’s Republic of China”.
CGNPC has a 33% stake in the £18bn Hinkley Point project in Somerset, which Theresa May has delayed partly because of concerns over China’s involvement. The delay prompted a warning earlier this week from the Chinese ambassador to the UK, who said that relations between the two countries are at a “crucial historical juncture”. Assistant US attorney general John P Carlin said: “Allen Ho, at the direction of a Chinese state-owned nuclear power company allegedly approached and enlisted US-based nuclear experts to provide integral assistance in developing and producing special nuclear material in China. “Ho did so without registering with the Department of Justice as an agent of a foreign nation or authorisation from the US Department of Energy”, Carlin continued. “Prosecuting those who seek to evade US law by attaining sensitive nuclear technology for foreign nations is a top priority for the National Security Division.” Ho allegedly conspired with China from 1997 to April 2016, said the indictment that was unsealed in April. Conspiring to unlawfully engage and participate in the development of nuclear material outside of the US carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and a fine of $250,000 (£192,000). Conspiring to act as an agent of a foreign government in the US carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. “The federal government has regulations in place to oversee civil nuclear cooperation”, said Michael Steinbach, executive assistant director of the FBI’s national security branch. “If those authorities are circumvented, this can result in significant damage to our national security. “The US will use all of its law enforcement tools to stop those who try to steal US nuclear technology and expertise.” Ho was born in China and is a naturalised US citizen with dual residency. CGNCP, the largest nuclear power company in China, is owned by that country’s state-owned assets supervision and administration commission of the state council."
2016-08-11T10:25:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan's big city way could be Labour's way forward nationally,"Speaking to Sky News, Sadiq Khan has urged Theresa May to delay pressing the Brexit button - triggering Article 50, which starts the formal process of withdrawal from the EU - until next autumn, arguing that this would improve the UK’s chances of getting a decent deal. By way of Square Mile free sheet City AM, Khan’s deputy mayor for business, Rajesh Agrawal, has said that City Hall officials are talking to counterparts in Paris and other cities beyond Europe about building their own business relationships for the Brexit age. This is a developing theme. Within days of the referendum result in June, Khan joined with the City of London in calling for UK-regulated banks to retain their existing “passporting rights”, the system that allows them to operate in the EU nations. Anything less would be “a disaster”, he said. More recently, he has reactivated the London Finance Commission, asking it to come up with further proposals for making London more autonomous, in the interests of the UK as a whole. He’s telling anyone who’ll listen that London Is Open. Khan is banging the devolution drum at every opportunity, seeking further scope for City Hall and the capital’s 33 local authorities to take command of the capital’s destiny. How far he will get depends heavily on how receptive the new prime minister and her colleagues are to his case, but it’s significant that the media as well as ministers are listening. That significance extends to the Labour Party. With its national leadership failing to provide effective opposition either in the House of Commons or the country at large, the views of Khan are seen as mattering still more. He is, after all, the Labour politician with the most power to put policies into effect and seems likely to remain so for some time. He should, though, have some company before long. Next May, counterpart “metro mayors” are due to be elected to lead Greater Manchester and the Liverpool and West Midlands city regions. Labour’s candidates for those jobs, now selected, are strong favourites to win. Their powers will vary and differ from Khan’s, as will the types of territories they serve. They will, though, look to London as a model. They too will negotiate with the Conservative government about ways to make their economies stronger. They too will surely also look beyond Westminster to the wider, post-Brexit world in their searches for growth and prosperity. They and Khan could be the faces of Labour in power in Britain for many years to come."
2016-08-11T12:01:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Complaints made after judge trades insults with defendant in court,"Complaints have been made against a judge who verbally abused a defendant in a retaliatory exchange after he launched a foul-mouthed tirade at her from the dock, the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office (JCIO) has said. Judge Patricia Lynch QC was sentencing John Hennigan at Chelmsford crown court for his ninth breach of an antisocial behaviour order in 11 years when the exchange took place. Lynch’s withering comments came when Hennigan, 50, told her she was “a bit of a cunt”, to which she retorted: “You are a bit of a cunt yourself. Being offensive to me does not help.” After Hennigan shouted back “Go fuck yourself”, she replied: “You too.” A spokesman for the JCIO, which handles complaints made about judges both in and outside court, said today: “The JCIO has received complaints regarding HHJ [Her Honour Judge] Patricia Lynch’s comments in court, which will be considered in accordance with the Judicial Conduct (Judicial and other officer holders) Rules 2014.” The spokesman said the JCIO “never comment on how many complaints have been received”.
During his court appearance, at the end of which he was jailed for 18 months for insulting and using racist language towards a black woman, Hennigan reportedly also shouted “Sieg Heil” and banged the glass panel of the dock. The exchange attracted much attention on social media, with many praising Lynch as a hero. Stan Keaton tweeted: “Judge Patricia Lynch QC has a cracking reply to a racist thug in her courtroom.” Others hailed her as a “legend” and a role model for children. Hennigan, of Harlow, Essex, has dozens of previous convictions for offences including drug and firearm possession and common assault. An antisocial behaviour order was previously imposed on him in 2005, when a swastika was discovered daubed on the front door of his council house. He has appeared in court for racially abusing a newsagent and for making Nazi salutes at a pub in London; he claimed he had only been raising his arm to collect his change after paying for a drink."
2016-08-11T12:05:00Z,uk-news,UK news,May urged to pull plug immediately on Hinkley C over spying allegations,"Theresa May is being urged to pull the plug on the controversial Hinkley Point C project immediately, after new allegations of spying in the US by a consultant working for the Chinese co-investor in the planned nuclear plant. The new government is currently in the middle of a review of the £18.5bn Hinkley scheme following a final investment decision by the developers, EDF of France and its Beijing-based partner China General Nuclear Power (CGN). Paul Dorfman, a senior research fellow at University College London, said the British prime minister could legitimately blame poor French reactor technology if she wanted to save face with the Chinese. “No other OECD country would let China into its critical nuclear infrastructure, given its history of nuclear weapon proliferation. May has already taken the diplomatic ‘hit’ for this, so what’s she got to lose?”
“If government wanted to, it could avoid taking China to task on this by reframing the problem in the context of the failed French EPR reactor, which is three times over-cost and over-time where it’s being built in Finland and France.” Angus MacNeil MP, the chair of the energy and climate change select committee, said the spying allegations raised grave concerns about corporate integrity and must form a key part of the government’s current review of Hinkley. “I am not sure the Chinese have anything to steal from Britain in the way of nuclear secrets. That is after all why they are being brought in, but it does raise questions about how honourable the company is and whether it could cut corners on construction methods and issues like that.” The name of China General Nuclear Power (CGN) has appeared as a defendant in US legal papers filed by the US authorities in a Tennessee district court.
Szuhsiung Ho, a senior adviser to CGN, is scheduled to appear in from of the court next week accused of trying to recruit US atomic experts to steal technology secrets to help speed up China’s own nuclear power programme. CGN said it could not immediately comment on the scandal, but promised it would put out a written statement. Brunswick, the high-profile City PR firm that has been working with CGN on Hinkley, said it was not “acting on behalf of CGN in respect of this matter”. The department of business, energy and industrial strategy also declined to comment on the implications of the court case. Dorfman said there had already been endless concern and discussion between strategic defence experts in London about the wisdom of allowing China to invest in UK nuclear projects, and not just Hinkley.
“China has and always will play economic hardball. For China, Hinkley was always a loss-leader for Bradwell. The deal was, if China invested in Hinkley, then it could build and run its own reactor at Bradwell, the nearest nuclear site to London. “Now the idea of China investing in Hinkley, then constructing and operating a reactor on British soil is really beginning to look like a Anglo-Sino bridge too far.” Greenpeace’s executive director, John Sauven, said there were very real concerns about handing over the keys to our future energy security to companies run by foreign governments. “There are a vast array of alternative power sources for the UK that Theresa May can choose from to keep the lights on, from solar, tidal and wind power through to interconnectors and storage. These are cutting edge technologies that will also attract investment into the UK, create jobs and don’t come with a huge health warning.”"
2016-08-11T12:05:29Z,uk-news,UK news,ONS to recruit data analytics apprentices after skills criticism,"The UK’s statistics office has begun recruiting its first data analytics apprentices, following a critical review into the quality of economic data by the former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Charles Bean. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said it was recruiting six apprentices at its Newport headquarters in south Wales, where its new data science campus is based. The creation of the campus, which will launch in the autumn, comes after Bean’s recommendation to set up a data hub that would allow the ONS to work with academics and other outside experts. Bean’s final report on government statistics, published in March, recommended “taking economic statistics back to the future”. It highlighted a failure to keep up with the digital revolution, with economic activity likely to have been underestimated and inflation overstated as a result. Bean has been highly critical of the skills levels at the ONS following its move from London to Newport after 2007, when it lost many senior staff. He told a parliamentary committee in January that the nation’s number crunchers could do better, and in March described the office as having “a relatively large number of relatively low-skilled people, who are basically processing surveys”. Andrew Tyrie, chair of the cross-party Treasury select committee, has also blasted the UK’s “rubbish” statistics and criticised the ONS for falling behind its international peers. The apprenticeship scheme is aimed at people with relevant A-levels or equivalent experience and will lead to an accredited level 4 diploma. Apprentices will be paid between £21,500 and £26,999, and their role will be to “collect, organise and study data to provide business insight”. The closing date for applications is 21 August and apprentices are expected to start work in November for two years. Heather Savory, the ONS’s deputy national statistician for data capability, said: “ONS is looking for the best people to take full advantage of cutting-edge tools and technologies and to help ONS make the most of the data revolution. Our role here at ONS is to provide high quality, trustworthy and relevant analytical evidence about our economy and society to help people make informed decisions.” The ONS employs 1,724 people in Newport, where it has had an office since the 1960s. It also has 53 staff in London; 665 in Titchfield, Hampshire, where the census is compiled every 10 years; and 664 in the field."
2016-08-11T14:05:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Duke of Westminster died from heart attack,"The Duke of Westminster, who died suddenly on Tuesday aged 64, had suffered a heart attack, Preston coroner’s office said. Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, whose estate is estimated to be worth about £9bn, died after being transferred from his Abbeystead estate in Lancashire to the Royal Preston hospital. A spokeswoman for Preston coroner’s office confirmed the cause of death was myocardial infarction, and that no inquest would be held since he had died from natural causes. The father of four was a close friend of the royal family and said to be the third wealthiest landowner in the UK. The Grosvenor estate portfolio includes Mayfair and Belgravia, as well as thousands of acres in Scotland and Spain.
A tribute posted on the Grosvenor website on Thursday read: “He was a passionate country man, committed soldier, and excellent shot, a true entrepreneur, and, importantly, he went out of his way to be courteous and humorous with all people, regardless of status or wealth. Distinctly down to earth, the [duke] was rarely seen without a Diet Coke and a cigarette (later electric). Not much of a sleeper, one might expect emails from him at any hour of the night, and an average week would see him up and down from home in Chester to London and all over the world to visit soldiers, businesses, charities and rural estates while representing and promoting numerous organisations.” The dukedom now passes to his only son, Hugh Grosvenor, 25, who through primogeniture has precedence over two older sisters, Lady Tamara and Lady Edwina. A third daughter, Lady Viola, is the youngest of the children."
2016-08-11T14:17:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Plan for cement factories in London Olympic park causes uproar,"While Britain basks in the glory of an increasing medal haul in Rio de Janeiro, controversy has erupted over plans to hand over part of the parkland left as a legacy of the 2012 London Olympics to four giant cement and concrete factories. Under the proposals, there would more than 900 movements of heavy goods vehicles a day to and from the Queen Elizabeth Olympic park, the largest urban park to be created in the UK for a century. The potential dramatic increase in traffic has outraged local residents, who enjoy an Olympic dividend in the shape of a green area larger than Hyde park.
Almost 10,000 people have signed a petition objecting to the plans submitted to the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), the body mandated to act as the planning authority for the Olympic park. Local councils Tower Hamlets and Newham have raised concerns about increased traffic, noise and the deterioration of air quality. Hazel Goldman, who has lived in the area for 61 years, wrote on a petition on Change.org: “To allow this development to happen will remind us that, as ever, the world sees fit to dump on the East End of London.” The vision for the 560-acre site, formerly an industrial area, was to create a residential, cultural and business centre in east London, with the sporting venues coupled with new arrivals such as V&A East and Sadler’s Wells theatre, and two universities. In 2012, Sebastian Coe, the chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Logoc), said he hoped it would be transformed into a parkland “to ensure generations to come will benefit from a golden summer”. Publicity for the Queen Elizabeth Olympic park described the takeover by LLDC as a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity ... to develop a dynamic new heart for east London”. However, the LLDC points out that the site, to the south-west of the park, which is close to the Olympic stadium and Pudding Mill Lane DLR station, was always zoned industrial. It is owned by Network Rail and leased to logistics company DB Schenker as an operational rail freight facility. The LLDC said post-Olympics transformation planning consent specifically required the area to be returned to its use as an operational rail freight facility. “Only development supporting the rail related and small-scale ancillary uses will be supported,” it said. The corporation pointed out that the use of the area as a warm-up zone for athletes during the 2012 Olympics was only temporary. “The site is safeguarded as strategic industrial land as it is a rail head and that is what it had to return to after its Games-time role had been completed,” a spokesman said. Several local residents who have submitted written objections acknowledge that the site was historically zoned for industry, but question whether this is appropriate given the number of people who now live in the regenerated area.
“I honestly can’t think of a worse place for a heavy industrial site than the Olympic park. Callous, short-term profiteering, with no regard for the families and people who live nearby having to breath this air, and live next to a blight upon Britain’s international legacy,” Jon Linnell from Leicester wrote on the petition. Raising an objection, local resident Adam Stork wrote to the LLDC, saying: “Although the site historically has been zoned for industrial use, the majority of local land has now been re-zoned for residential and commercial developments. “To allow high-level industrial activity nearby will reduce the quality of life for all around it.” Vivienne Bellamy, in a written submission to the LLDC, said: “This would not be allowed to happen in South Kensington, against which Olympicopolis is already measuring itself.” In a written submission, Tower Hamlets council said it had broadly accepted the principle of the land use, but said the predicted HGV traffic was “undoubtedly very high” and would have a significant impact on the environment. In the worst-case scenario, with the plants operating 24 hours a day, the council said there would be “935 HGV movements” in and out of the site daily. The architect Mark Brearley, a professor of cities at the Cass and previously a design adviser to the former London mayor Boris Johnson, has said he supports the plans. If anyone is at fault, he said, it is the mayor’s office for not coming up with a proper plan for mixed development on the Olympic park. “On the face of it, it is a good idea to reintroduce these uses for these sites. It it a rail serviced site, has potential water transport [via the river Lea]. There is an environmental challenge, for sure, but if we expel all industry, it defaults to a suburb on steroids with an economy that is only about sports, high-end services and education,” he said. The LLDC, he said, was to blame for the number of new residents, which was a result of “allowing so many residential developments”.
Brearley said much industry had been taken out of the area, and London had to get its cement and concrete from somewhere. “I think one of the biggest failures is the institution of the mayor, who was in charge of it, is that they failed to come up with a plan,” he said. A spokesman for the London mayor, Sadiq Kahn, said he had no powers to get involved in decision making. The plans will be discussed at an LLDC meeting in September, which will be open to the public, and representations can by made to the corporation via the planning website or by email."
2016-08-11T18:09:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Fabric to close this weekend after drug-related deaths,"The London nightclub Fabric is to close this weekend after the drug-related deaths of two teenagers. The most recent incident took place on Saturday, when an 18-year-old male collapsed outside the venue at 8.20am and was pronounced dead shortly after. Another 18-year-old died after he fell ill at the 2,500-capacity club in Farringdon on 25 June. Neither death is being treated as suspicious.
The club said on its website: “For the past two years Fabric has operated without incident, but tragically in the past nine weeks two 18-year-old boys have died as a consequence of drug overdoses.“In order to understand how this has happened we have agreed with the police and other agencies to suspend our operation while we investigate. The club will therefore be closed this weekend.” It said it would make a further statement next week and that all tickets for this weekend would be refunded. Over the past three years, Fabric has struggled to maintain its licence amid increasing pressure from the Metropolitan police and Islington council over drug-related incidents. In December 2014, the police requested the council “seriously consider” revoking the club’s licence, citing four deaths in the previous three years and eight other incidents in which clubbers collapsed. Fabric was able to remain open, though the council imposed strict licensing conditions, including sniffer dogs and ID scans, but in December 2015 it won an appeal against these conditions, on the grounds that they undermined efforts to confiscate drugs at the door.
The news follows a growing number of cases in which people have died after taking ecstasy. One of the most recent cases was 22-year-old Will Moss, who died in July after collapsing outside the Chameleon nightclub in Southend. In May, Faye Allen, 17, from Liverpool, died after taking ecstasy while at a nightclub in Manchester. According to ONS statistics released last year, deaths caused by ecstasy or MDMA – the active ingredient in ecstasy also sold in powder form – rose from eight in 2010 to 50 in 2014. This follows a spike in the purity of the drug, which is at its strongest in years. Harm reduction charities such as The Loop, which conducts drug testing and offers advice at festivals, has found pills containing up to 250mg of MDMA, more than double the average quantity found in pills during the late 90s. Common harm reduction advice is for users to test their reaction to a pill by taking half, or a quarter, and waiting before taking more. The Loop’s CrushDabWait campaign encourages users to consider the way they consume MDMA, advising those who want to take it to crush it into a fine powder, take a small finger dab and then wait one to two hours before considering taking more. • This article was amended on 12 August to correct a sentence that said Faye Allen died after taking ecstasy at a nightclub in Liverpool. The nightclub was in Manchester."
2016-08-11T18:25:59Z,uk-news,UK news,Third arrest in Heathrow security pass fraud investigation,"A third woman has been arrested in an investigation into possible fraudulent use of security passes at Heathrow airport. Two women are already in custody and the passes of some 300 employees were suspended by the catering firm Sodexo, after police began an inquiry into the vetting process for airside passes. The Metropolitan police announced the arrest in a statement on Thursday afternoon, confirming that a 28-year-old woman from Ealing is now in custody at a west London police station. There is no suggestion that the investigation is related to terrorism, the statement also said.
Detectives arrested the two other women from Surrey, aged 20 and 24, on suspicion of fraud and money laundering on 3 August. But the inquiry, which began as a fraud investigation, then expanded into looking into how airside passes were handed out. The passes allow baggage handlers, flight crews, shop and restaurant workers and other staff to access restricted areas beyond airport security. When the investigation was first announced on Wednesday, Scotland Yard said that there was no indication that the passes had been sold on. However, Sodexo decided to suspend the passes of 300 of its cleaners and caterers who work at Heathrow as a precaution. Airport security has been under the spotlight in recent months after Islamic State carried out attacks on Brussels airport earlier this year. It is also thought that the terror organisation smuggled a bomb on to a Russian jet which crashed in October, bringing it down over the Sinai peninsula and killing all on board. After the Heathrow arrests were first made public, a spokesman for the Department for Transport said: “We are aware of this issue. Safety and security of passengers is our priority. “We keep aviation security under constant review, but as this matter is the subject of an ongoing police investigation we are unable to comment further at this time.”"
2016-08-11T18:33:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Hinkley Point C: case against Chinese firm has the feel of a modern spy thriller,"A network of agents, payments from a Beijing-backed slush fund and a series of illicit transfers of highly sensitive nuclear knowhow: the case against Britain’s Chinese partner in the controversial Hinckley Point C project could have leapt from the pages of a modern spy thriller. According to the US Department of Justice, the FBI has discovered evidence that China General Nuclear Power (CGN) has been engaged in a conspiracy to steal US nuclear secrets stretching back almost two decades. Both CGN and one of the corporation’s senior advisers, Szuhsiung Ho, have been charged with conspiring to help the Chinese government develop nuclear material in a manner that is in clear breach of US law.
Ho, who is alleged to have boasted that “budget is no issue” while developing his network of co-conspirators, has also been charged with acting unlawfully as a foreign agent. His legal team argues that there is far less to this affair than meets the eye. It says he is an innocent, 66-year-old Chinese American known to most of his friends and neighbours as Allen Ho, who has been openly engaged in commercial activity involving non-classified information. Now, it says, overzealous prosecutors are turning his life upside down. The lawyers also say that Ho could not possibly have known about the clauses in the US Atomic Energy Act that he is alleged to have breached, because no one has previously been charged under them in the 60-odd years they have been on the statute. His lawyer, Peter Zeidenberg, says it is unclear to him whether any crime has actually been committed. Ho’s legal team, however, has a number of hurdles to overcome. The first is that one of his alleged agents, Ching Ning Guey, a senior manager with the Tennessee Valley Authority’s nuclear programme, has already pleaded guilty to unlawfully developing special nuclear material outside the US without government authority.
The guilty plea was sealed for more than a year, until Ho was arrested in Atlanta earlier this year, and both he and CGN were charged. Another is that among the many emails the FBI has gathered and used to build a case against Ho is one in which he allegedly describes a $15,555 (£12,000) payment made to Guey as coming from “his company’s slush fund”. CGN, Ho, and a company he owns called Energy Technology International, all face a charge that they “did conspire with each other and with others known and unknown to wilfully and knowingly engage and participate … in the development and production of special nuclear material outside of the United States, namely, in the People’s Republic of China”. According to sections 2077(b) and 2272(a) of the Atomic Energy Act, this can be done only with the permission of the US energy secretary. Ho faces a possible life sentence if convicted. The offence is also punishable by a $250,000 fine. There has been no immediate comment from CGN. According to the indictment, Ho’s efforts began in 1997 and only came to an end with his arrest in April. He is alleged to have been attempting to provide technical assistance for CGN’s small modular reactor programme, advanced fuel assembly programme, in-core detector systems and various nuclear-related computer codes. Operating from a large colonial-style mansion in the suburbs of Wilmington, Delaware, where he lives with his wife, Anne, Ho is alleged to have recruited Guey and five other nuclear specialists. Identified in the indictment as “US Persons 2 to 6”, they are all nuclear engineers or mechanical engineers working in the nuclear industry, and living in Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Colorado.
He is said to have made a series of payments in exchange for reports that the six individuals submitted. Some of them were also paid for answering a series of questions submitted by CGN employees, and Guey and “Persons 5 and 6” are alleged to have travelled to China to give presentations. Guey is said to have received his $15,555 payment in a cheque sent to an address in Chattanooga, and “Person 6” is said to have received $22,698 for consulting services and travel expenses. Ho was born in Taiwan and graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1971. Two years later he travelled to the US to take a master’s degree at the University of California, and married Anne the following year. He completed a PhD in nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois in 1980. The couple are naturalised US citizens. When Ho appeared in court in Knoxville, Tennessee, in April, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that prosecutors alleged he had channelled about $3m from a Chinese bank to various banks in the US. They also said that when arrested he was in possession of an encrypted Chinese bank card. Ho is also said to have a second wife and a nine-year-old son in China. The assistant US attorney Charles Atchley Jr was quoted as saying: “This man is not living in the US. He may be a US citizen, but he lives in China. His family is in China.” Zeidenberg insists that his client lives in Delaware, and on Tuesday he will ask the court in Knoxville to grant him bail, allowing him to live in the house with an electronic ankle tag. In November, in an article in the Washington Post, Zeidenberg wrote that he believed innocent Chinese Americans were being victimised by prosecutors swept up by an atmosphere of paranoia about the dangers of cyber-attacks and industrial espionage directed by Beijing. Two of his clients had been charged with illicitly handing over technical secrets, only for the charges to be dropped or dismissed, but by then their private and professional lives had been severely damaged. “While the danger posed by Chinese agents may indeed be real, so is the danger of overreacting to it,” he wrote."
2016-08-11T19:19:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Energy specialists raise concerns about Chinese Hinkley involvement,"Further concerns have been raised over China’s involvement in the £18bn Hinkley Point nuclear power project after it emerged that the state-owned company backing the plant is facing espionage charges in the US. The chair of the parliamentary energy and climate change committee said the allegations raised serious questions about the corporate integrity of China General Nuclear Power (CGN) and must be part of the government’s current review of Hinkley.
Warning that there are now “grave concerns” about CGN’s 33% stake in Hinkley, Angus MacNeil MP said: “It does raise questions about how honourable the company is and whether it could cut corners on construction methods and issues like that.” CGN has been named as a defendant in legal papers filed by the US authorities in a Tennessee district court, where the accused face charges of involvement in a conspiracy to steal nuclear secrets in order to help speed up China’s own nuclear power programme. Another defendant is a 66-year-old naturalised US citizen called Szuhsiung “Allen” Ho, also known as Allen Ho. A senior adviser to CGN, Ho is scheduled to appear next week accused of trying to recruit US atomic experts to gather nuclear technology secrets. Details of the charges emerged as Australia blocked the sale of a power grid company to a Chinese firm on security grounds. One energy expert urged Theresa May to immediately pull the plug on the Somerset power project, saying it was the final nail in a scheme already under threat after the prime minister ordered a review of the plant last month. Paul Dorfman, a senior research fellow at the energy institute at University College London and a former government adviser, said the decision to undertake a review, on the basis of security concerns about China’s involvement, had already upset Beijing. Referring to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, he said: “No other OECD country would let China into its critical nuclear infrastructure, given its history of nuclear weapon proliferation. May has already taken the diplomatic hit for this, so what’s she got to lose?” Dorfman said a convenient excuse for pulling out of Hinkley could be supplied by problems with the plant’s main backer, France’s EDF, which is committed to using European pressurised reactor (EPR) technology that is running over budget at sites in France and Finland. “If government wanted to, it could avoid taking China to task on this by reframing the problem in the context of the failed French EPR reactor, which is three times over-cost and over-time where it’s being built in Finland and France.”
Energy industry sources also raised questions over how much the former prime minister and chancellor knew about the CGN case in the US. One source said the Tennessee case had been known about in security circles for nearly a year because elements of it had been in the public domain but not highlighted by media. “It is inconceivable that George Osborne and David Cameron had not been told about the case by the security forces. May – as former home secretary – was perhaps willing to listen more intently to what they (MI5) were telling her,” said one. CGN said it could not immediately comment on the scandal but promised it would provide a written statement. Ho’s attorney, Peter Zeidenberg, said his client had been openly engaged in commercial activity involving non-classified information. The UK’s prime minister’s office and the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) also declined to discuss the issue or its implications. “This is a matter for the American authorities. It would be inappropriate for us to comment on a live court case,” said a BEIS spokesperson. Hinkley was meant to be a central part of George Osborne’s bid to usher in a “golden decade” of closer trade relations with China. Final details of the deal were announced as the former chancellor toured the country last year. In addition to potential security concerns, some in Whitehall had always harboured doubts about whether the vast reactor project was worth the generous subsidies that the government had had to pledge to get an investment agreement.
But Osborne was known to be so attached to the project that objections were pushed aside. The former chancellor, who was sacked by May last month in one of her first acts as prime minister, could not be reached for comment yesterday. Greg Clark, the new energy secretary, is known to be keen to scrutinise the financial details before formal approval is given. Downing Street has said a decision will be made next month while the Chinese have already made clear their irritation with the delay. Barry Gardiner, shadow energy secretary, expressed concern about the court case being used by ministers as an excuse for dumping Hinkley. “There are many reasons to criticise the Hinkley C deal: the vast cost; the long subsidy lock-in while other technologies fall in price and the technical feasibility of the project ever being built. These are genuine risks the government ought to have addressed two years ago. “The government says it wants to boost international trade. If the government held off the deal because of these allegations, they have jeopardised a relationship with a key future trade partner at a time when we need to be creating new friends and forging new trade alliances.”"
2016-08-11T23:00:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Election fraud report calls for stringent ID checks,"Voters could face more stringent identity checks and police cordons around polling stations, as part of a crackdown on electoral fraud recommended by Eric Pickles in a government-commissioned report. The former communities secretary was asked by David Cameron last year to examine how safeguards could be toughened up, after revelations of electoral malpractice in Tower Hamlets, east London, led to the removal of the mayor, Lutfur Rahman. In his report, presented to Theresa May, who has retained him as “anti-corruption champion”, Pickles warns that unless the government makes it harder to fiddle the system, Britain’s reputation for democracy could be undermined. “Our nation has a proud heritage as the ‘mother of parliaments’, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation. It is time to take action to take on the electoral crooks and defend Britain’s free and fair elections.” As communities secretary, Pickles sent commissioners into Tower Hamlets when the allegations of fraud emerged. His report makes 50 recommendations, including calling for pilot schemes under which voters would be asked to bring identification with them to polling stations. “A driving licence, passport or utility bills would not seem unreasonable to establish identity. The government may wish to pilot different methods. But the present system is unsatisfactory; perfection must not get in the way of a practical solution,” it says. With intimidation of the public on their way to cast their votes one of the issues identified in Tower Hamlets, Pickles also says returning officers, who oversee elections, and the police, should be given powers to establish cordons sanitaires around polling stations where particular problems are identified. He argues that rules on the use of postal votes, which have previously been identified as ripe for fraud, should be toughened up – with party activists no longer allowed to handle them, for example, and an end to the possibility of applying for a permanent postal vote. Rahman was found guilty of multiple charges of corruption and kicked out of office last year. He and his allies were found to have used vote-rigging and religious intimidation through local imams to return him to power. Backers of the Bangladeshi-born Rahman initially dismissed the claims against him as racism; and Pickles says in future, concerns about damaging community relations must not be an excuse for failing to investigate allegations of fraud. “There are sometimes challenging issues over divisive community politics, but this is no excuse for failing to enforce British law and protect the integrity of our democratic process. The law must be applied equally and fairly to everyone,” he said. The report cites evidence that pressure was put on vulnerable members of some minority ethnic communities to vote in accordance with the will of elders. “There were concerns that influence and intimidation within households may not be reported, and that state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of ‘politically correct’ over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion,” it says. Pickles would like to see the National Crime Agency, which looks at organised crime, be given a remit to examine complex cases of electoral fraud. The report also condemns the Electoral Commission, the government-backed body that scrutinises polls, for straying beyond its remit. “The Electoral Commission continues to act as a commentator and lobbyist on both policy and law. Yet government should not be lobbying government. It would be clearer for electoral law and electoral policy to be determined by the Cabinet Office, subject to parliamentary scrutiny and approval.”"
2016-08-12T06:09:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Yorkshire Ripper: tribunal rules Peter Sutcliffe can be sent to mainstream prison,"The Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, who murdered 13 women, may be released from the secure psychiatric hospital Broadmoor and sent to a mainstream prison after a tribunal concluded that his mental illness was under control. Sutcliffe was given 20 life sentences when he was convicted in 1981, but was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1984 and transferred to Broadmoor in Berkshire. On Thursday, a mental health tribunal ruled that he no longer required clinical treatment and could therefore be moved back into the mainstream prison system. He is serving a whole-life tariff and will die in jail.
The Ministry of Justice must now decide whether or not to approve the tribunal’s decision on Sutcliffe, now known as Peter Coonan. An MoJ spokeswoman said: “Decisions over whether prisoners are to be sent back to prison from secure hospitals are based on clinical assessments made by independent medical staff. “The high court ordered in 2010 that Peter Coonan should never be released. This was upheld by the court of appeal. Peter Coonan will remain locked up and will never be released for his evil crimes. Our thoughts are with Coonan’s victims and their families.” Sutcliffe killed 13 women, many of whom were prostitutes, and injured seven more in West Yorkshire between 1975 and 1980. He was finally captured by police after he was pulled over with a prostitute in his car while driving with false number plates. At his trial in 1981, he pleaded not guilty to 13 counts of murder, but pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, and claimed that he had heard the voice of God telling him to kill people. The judge dismissed this defence and insisted that the case be heard by a jury, who found him guilty on all 13 counts of murder. Sutcliffe applied to have a minimum term set to his sentence, but in 2010, the high court ruled that he would spend the rest of his life in prison. A psychiatric report submitted to the high court said he had been given anti-psychotic medication since 1993, which had successfully contained his mental illness. In December, a report by medical experts recommended that he be moved from psychiatric hospital to prison. This article was amended on 12 August 2016 to clarify that Peter Sutcliffe pleaded not guilty to 13 counts of murder, but guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility."
2016-08-12T10:44:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Virgin Trains East Coast staff to strike in row over jobs,"Rail staff at Virgin Trains East Coast will strike on two weekends in August in a row over jobs and working conditions following a vote for industrial action announced earlier this week. Members of the RMT union will hold three 24-hour strikes, on 19 August and around the bank holiday weekend on 26 and 29 August. They will also ban overtime for 48 hours from 27 August. The union said almost 200 jobs were under threat in a dispute that it claims has been aggravated by the company ignoring agreements and trying to persuade staff to accept cuts.
It is the latest outbreak of RMT-led industrial action on the railways after train managers on Eurostar began a four-day walkout on Friday, while conductors on Southern rail were on strike from Monday until Wednesday. Virgin has said it will continue to run a full service during the strike. The RMT said Virgin and Stagecoach, which run the franchise, were believed to have bid too much to win it and looking to recoup costs. The union’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “RMT will not sit back while nearly 200 members’ jobs are under threat, and while conditions and safety are put at risk by a franchise which is clearly in financial trouble. “We will also not tolerate the cavalier attitude to safety that is now on show as the company mobilises its scab army of managers.” “Our members will not pay the price for a crisis cooked up in the Virgin/Stagecoach boardroom. The action is on and the union remains available for serious talks.” However, Virgin said the RMT had walked out of talks on Thursday after refusing to enter further discussions. The company claimed that it had given assurances to the union, including ruling out any compulsory redundancies as a result of the changes. David Horne, the managing director of Virgin Trains East Coast, said: “We have worked hard to ensure there are comprehensive contingency plans in place and I want to reassure our customers that our timetable will be unaffected during these walkouts, as well as during any subsequent strikes by the RMT.” The rail minister, Paul Maynard, said of the strike: “This is yet another unnecessary and thoughtless action by the RMT, who simply do not care about the travelling public. “They appear determined to try and wreck the daily lives of passengers who do not deserve this disruption. These series of strikes on minor matters must end.”"
2016-08-12T11:36:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Man wearing back brace confused for suicide bomber in Bolton,"Police were called to a shopping centre in Bolton after a man wearing a back brace was mistaken for suicide bomber. Hinesh Vegad, 25, was on his lunch break at a shopping centre in Westhoughton on Wednesday when a concerned member of the public phoned the police saying he had seen an “Asian man wearing body armour which was packed at the bottom with wires hanging out”. But when officers from Greater Manchester police arrived, Vegad was no longer at the scene. Fortunately for him, one of his friends spoke to investigators and explained that Vegad had fractured his back during a paintballing accident and was walking with a brace around his torso. Vegad praised police officers for their sensible and friendly attitude when they later visited him at his home, and posed together for a photograph that he posted on Facebook.“I had no idea what was going on until I received a phone call from police explaining that they’d received reports of a man acting suspiciously,” he told Key 103 radio station. “Luckily they had spoken to my friend who works in a sandwich shop when they arrived on the high street to warn people. She told them that it was me and that I wear a back brace for my injury, and passed my contact details on. “Looking back, I can totally see the funny side of the situation, but that’s because it was handled correctly. The police officers were friendly.” Greater Manchester police confirmed that they had responded to a report of concerns about a man in Westhoughton town centre and said the situation was quickly resolved after they spoke to him. Vegad said: “It was all in the interest and safety of the public, and I couldn’t fault anything they [police] did. When they saw me, they were mainly concerned about me avoiding this happening again. “The brace sits very high above my shoulders because I have a high fracture, so wearing a jacket or jumper is near enough impossible.”"
2016-08-12T13:19:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Journalist investigating alleged ‘honour killing’ says he got death threats,"A prominent Pakistani journalist investigating the alleged murder of a British woman in an “honour killing” says he has received death threats. Samia Shahid, 28, from Bradford, was strangled to death while visiting her family in northern Punjab last month. Her husband, Mukhtar Syed Kazam, said he believed his wife was killed because her family disapproved of their marriage. Shahid’s first husband, Mohammad Shakeel, her father, Mohammad, and another cousin who are suspected of her murder are all on the run, according to Pakistani police. It is alleged that Shahid, 28, had been tricked into travelling to Pakistan in July and killed for divorcing her first husband and remarrying against the wishes of her family. The case, which has been highlighted by the Bradford West MP Naz Shah, has become a priority for Pakistan after the country’s interior minister, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, announced that he had ordered a rapid investigation. The Guardian has learned that a journalist in Pakistan, who has been investigating Shahid’s death, has made a formal complaint to police after allegedly receiving death threats from a British man. Raja Waqar said he received five disturbing phone calls in which he was told he would be killed and his children would also be harmed if he continued to pursue information about Shahid’s murder. During the phone calls, the longest of which is said to have lasted eight minutes, Waqar said he was told: “If you carry on doing this I’m going to kill you and your children.” Waqar, who works for the AAJ TV station in Karachi, says he began receiving calls from a British mobile phone number on 24 July. The calls, from a man who only identified himself as Ali, continued for two days and became increasingly disturbing, he said. Speaking from Pakistan, Waqar said: “When I started covering this story I started receiving threats from a man called Ali. He was ringing on an English mobile number. “He asked me why I was covering the story and I told him that as a journalist in the area for the past 15 years, it was my duty to cover the story and that I had smelled that this was not a natural death. “He told me to drop the story and when I refused he said he was going to kill me and my children.” Waqar was told by his bureau chief at the TV station to contact the police and filed a complaint in writing. He said: “This was my assignment and I was not going to allow him to threaten me. But after he kept calling and telling me to stop I had to call the police. He told me to leave it because Samia was not my sister but it was very clear to me that she had been murdered- I have no doubt about it.” A West Yorkshire police spokesman said: “We are aware of a report of a Pakistan-based journalist who has allegedly been receiving threats. They have reported this matter to the Pakistani police.” He added: “West Yorkshire police is currently reviewing all previous contact with Samia Shahid, including any alleged criminal offences and the action taken as a result. Her death remains a matter for the Pakistani authorities and we are continuing to liaise with them and with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.” Shahid returned to Bradford from Dubai, where she had been living with Kazam, her second husband, last September to try to build bridges with her family. She asked a female police officer to chaperone her to the family home in Manningham, Bradford, after allegedly being harassed by one of her relatives who wanted her to return to her first marriage. West Yorkshire police confirmed that a man received a harassment warning following the meeting but the force declined to identify the offender. Shahid’s friends in Bradford said the beauty therapist was not frightened for her life but was increasingly stressed about what some relatives were telling her mother and father. “I could tell from her Snapchats that she was really affected by her relatives saying stuff to her family, her parents,” one friend said. “She was saying ‘People can’t keep their nose out of things’.” She added: “She wasn’t a scared person. It would take a lot for her to fear stuff. She felt, ‘Why are they doing stuff like that?’ but I don’t think she was scared because she is a strong person in her character. “She was just stressed for her family – she didn’t want her parents to be stressed out because of what her relatives were doing. That was her main concern [rather] than being scared for herself.” Shahid’s family in Bradford claimed she had died from natural causes on 20 July and police initially said there were no visible injuries on her body. However, police last week launched a murder investigation after a forensic examination found she had died from asphyxiation."
2016-08-12T14:19:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Man jailed for drugging and raping men he met on Instagram,"A photographer who drugged and raped men after using Instagram to lure them to modelling shoots has been jailed for more than 11 years. Nigel Wilkinson, 43, met his victims on the photo-sharing app before inviting them to his house in Bristol for photoshoots in his mock studio. But once the men were in his home, he would ply them with alcohol and drugs, including Rohypnol, and then attack them. Wilkinson pleaded guilty at Bristol crown court to two counts of rape and three counts of administering a substance with intent to rape. He was jailed for 11 and a half years. He also admitted possession of the class C drugs Flunitrazepam, also known as Rohypnol, and Nitrazepam. The court heard that Wilkinson promoted himself as a male fitness photographer and set up a website called WilkoPhotography last summer. He would search for potential victims on Instagram and invite them to his house so he could help them put together a modelling portfolio. But during the photoshoots, he would render his victims “senseless and incapable” by giving them drinks, some of which were laced with sedatives. The court was told that he “liked to take the masculinity of straight men” and that his three victims had been left devastated by his crimes. The men often stayed at his home, where he committed sexual acts when his victims were in a drugged state.
DC Stacey Matthews said: “On the surface, Nigel Wilkinson was a photographer with an interest in male fitness models. In private, he was a cunning sexual offender who used his photography enterprise as a cover and catalyst for his deviant activities.” The force began investigating Wilkinson in February when Kent police were called by the girlfriend of a 19-year-old man. She had received a text message from her boyfriend stating that he believed he had been drugged. Officers went to Wilkinson’s home and found the man inside. He was taken to hospital and tests found traces of a sedative in his system. He attended a sexual assault referral centre for further tests and officers went to Wilkinson’s home to arrest him in April. When they arrived, they discovered a 23-year-old man asleep on the sofa. He was also taken to hospital. There was evidence that the man, who attended the Bridge sexual assault centre in Bristol, had been drugged and raped. During the investigation, officers identified a third victim, a 19-year-old from Wiltshire, who was also found to have traces of sedatives in his system. None of the victims had any memory of the acts committed on them. During searches of the house, police found photographs of a variety of males, some of whom were naked, on Wilkinson’s computer, as well as empty drug packets. Sentencing, Judge Michael Longman told him: “You wanted to have sex with as many attractive men as possible. All the victims were much younger than you and entrusted themselves to you. You abused the trust they placed in you.” Police are continuing to investigate Wilkinson’s background and want to speak to anyone who may have had contact with him through photography or dating websites. It is thought that due to the fact that the men had been drugged and left with no memory of events, there could be many more potential victims. Police say they expect the number of victims to run into double figures. PC Mike Steven said: “The circumstances of this case are truly horrifying. I’d encourage any other victim of Nigel WIlkinson to come forward and speak to us. We’re always here and ready to listen to, believe and respect victims.”"
2016-08-12T15:28:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Visitors are helping to keep London open. But for how long?,"Amid the flap and consternation in the capital that followed the Brexit vote came stories of a tourism bonanza thanks to a resulting plunge in the value of the pound. Now, new figures released by Airbnb indicate that the boom has had staying power. The company is reporting a 24% increase in visits to London by people using its service since the referendum result. That number is spectacular, yet also not out of line with the story of international visitors to London this year before the jarring result of 23 June. In the first three months of 2016, London received a record 3.8 million visits by overseas travellers, according to the Office for National Statistics international passenger survey. The pound was weak then too, and events like Lumiere London helped persuade tourists and others to spend over £2.2bn during that winter and early spring period, according to the city’s official promotional company, London and Partners - an increase of 4% compared with the same period in 2015. The burning question now is whether London’s increasing magnetism for visitors and their money can be sustained in the long term. Walking along Bankside and then through Theatreland to Piccadilly Circus on Thursday afternoon, it was hard to imagine the capital losing its allure. The place was heaving with sightseers and pleasure-seekers, wandering beside the river, watching entertainers in Leicester Square and Covent Garden and asking the way to Trafalgar Square. A summer holiday mood was evident around City Hall too (as the photograph above hopefully shows). But no one is taking anything for granted. The mayoral cry of “London Is Open” is being taken up with great urgency.
The London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, for example, welcomes the long-awaited start of the Night Tube service from 19 August, with its chief executive Colin Stanbridge saying it will “underpin the growth of our city” and be “a sign of confidence in London’s future,” but they continue to press the government to give the go-ahead for airport expansion. London and Partners are pumping out the message that the city is replete both with major events and attractions and with cultural “hidden gems”. Soon, the capital will be marking the 350th anniversary of the Great Fire of London and its aftermath. Local bloggers have compiled #SeeMoreLondon guides to cultural wonders away from the centre. Come, friendly foreigners. Enjoy our mighty city. Calm our nervous economy. Spend our puny pounds."
2016-08-12T19:32:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Police investigate deaths of two Nottinghamshire care home residents,"Police have launched a murder investigation after two elderly people died in quick succession at a nursing home in Nottinghamshire. Two women who work at the home were arrested, then released without charge as part of the investigation. They have since been suspended from duty, officers said. The deaths occurred on 2 and 3 August and the people who died have not yet been named. They were residents at the Springwater Lodge care home in the village of Calverton, north of Nottingham. “We are deeply shocked and distressed by these allegations,” said a spokeswoman for HC One, the company that runs the care home. She said the firm was cooperating with police and would be staying in close contact with the local council and the regulator. “Staff, residents and relatives will be kept as updated as possible and full management support is in place while police inquiries are ongoing,” she said. “We have brought in additional staff to ensure we can deliver continuity of care to our residents. We want to thank them, and their relatives, for their support at this very difficult time and reiterate that we will do everything we can to support the investigation.” Springwater Lodge is a purpose-built 50-bed facility that offers dementia, nursing, residential day care and end of life care for people aged 60 and over. After the home’s last inspection in March 2015, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said the service was not always safe. “People may not receive their medicines as intended due to errors in the handling and administration of medicines. Some areas of the home were not kept sufficiently clean,” it said. It also said people were “not always protected against the risks associated with medicines because, although the provider had appropriate arrangements in place to manage them safely, these procedures were not always followed”. But the CQC added: “People felt safe and the risk of abuse was minimised because the provider had systems in place to recognise and respond to allegations or incidents. Care and support was provided when people needed it as there were enough staff available to meet their needs.”"
2016-08-12T21:10:14Z,uk-news,UK news,London Bridge arrest investigated after complaint about use of spit hood,"The police watchdog is investigating the arrest of a man who was forcefully restrained by officers and had a spit hood put over his head after an argument with his partner. Video footage showed Ik Aihie screaming in pain as British Transport police (BTP) officers held him down on the floor of London Bridge station during the incident last month. He was approached by officers after his partner, Jessica McConkey, asked him to give her back her phone, the couple said. Police said he was arrested after he “became aggressive” and, during the arrest, that Aihie also threatened to spit at officers. The couple made a complaint to BTP that excessive force had been used and also said the officers had ignored Aihie when he repeatedly asked what he was being arrested for; only telling him when he arrived at the police station. He accepted a caution for a public order offence, BTP said. On Friday the Independent Police Complaints Commission confirmed it had received a referral from the force and had opened an independent investigation; the procedure normally reserved for more serious incidents. Aihie, who has met with IPCC investigators, said: “I hope there will now be a thorough investigation and I would ask any witnesses to my arrest to please contact the IPCC.” His solicitor, Shamik Dutta, of Bhatt Murphy, said: “It is imperative that all relevant evidence in this case is preserved without delay to ensure a robust inquiry into the officers’ conduct.” Aihie has previously said he felt he had been treated “like a dog” by the police. McConkey said she believed they officers assumed Aihie, who is black, had stolen her phone, leading each of them to accuse the officers of racism over the incident. McConkey has added, though, that she supports the police generally and Aihie said he doesn’t like to “play the race card”."
2016-08-13T06:00:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Has the RMT union's moderate Mick Cash turned militant?,"Even for a union that has never been shy of a fight, it has been a busy week. As a conductors’ strike on Southern rail left hundreds of thousands of commuters struggling, the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers’ union announced that its members on Virgin Trains East Coast had also voted to strike. It followed up by calling a walkout by train managers on Eurostar. General secretary Mick Cash, elected to succeed Bob Crow after the union’s leader died suddenly in 2014, was perceived as a moderate. Soon after taking the top job, he told the Guardian: “I got taught early doors, pick your fights.” But is Cash’s RMT more militant than ever? The union doesn’t see it that way, more as a series of long-running disputes that have come to a head at the same time – in August, when other news is scant. A spokesman said: “We’re an industrial union – we’re fighting on all kinds of fronts at all kinds of times.” Elsewhere, a temporary truce has been called on ScotRail, while a dispute involving London Underground engineers could yet derail the full introduction of the night tube. Other potential flashpoints loom with Merseyrail and Northern rail, where the RMT has unresolved issues over the future of its guards. But the change at the top, the RMT spokesman insisted, was irrelevant. “It’s bigger than that. It’s not about personalities – the ethos of a fighting union isn’t going to shift.” Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers’ union Aslef, pointed out that although the personalities may be different, Cash had “worked with [Crow] for 20 years and had Bob’s untold trust”. He added: “The real difference is, during that transitional period, there has never been a greater period of attack from the Department for Transport. I don’t think, strategically, you’d want to be fighting on so many fronts. But if you’ve got the government writing into franchises changes to the jobs of their members, deskilling them, you’ve got no choice.”
Cash also has to lead a union where being a moderate and a Labour party member does not aid him. In the election to succeed Crow, whose charismatic machismo made him a powerful force inside and outside the union, many candidates were, in the words of one observer, “trying to out-Bob Bob”. But Crow had also struck deals and was regarded by rail industry bosses as someone they could do business with: his unquestioned militancy allowed him to carry the union with him when he thought he had achieved all he could. According to someone on the other side of negotiations: “You could guarantee with 98% certainty that if Bob shook on a deal, that was enough.” Despite grabbing headlines, neither the Eurostar strike – suspended on Friday to allow further talks – nor the August bank holiday walkout on Virgin are expected to cause significant disruption. While the RMT has the muscle, its onboard staff can no longer stop services by withdrawal of their labour alone. London Underground strikes over the night tube caused far wider disruption once drivers joined the battle; even the RMT’s wide base among 15,000 maintenance workers on Network Rail would not bring services to an immediate halt with a short strike. Signallers, whose withdrawal of labour can cripple the railways more completely, could arguably become an even more concentrated power bloc in the digital future envisaged by Network Rail. But this increasingly white-collar cadre of the RMT has been less inclined to vote to strike.
That is why many see the RMT’s major current dispute, on Southern, as a straightforward example of the union needing at all costs to cling to its negotiating trump hand. To accept that a conductor’s role is not safety-critical means the loss of that ultimate sanction, the power to halt rail services. And unions don’t give the guarantees of future jobs – “onboard supervisors” or otherwise – much credence. Mistrust is understandable. In an unguarded outburst at a public meeting in early 2016, the DfT’s senior civil servant in charge of rail, Peter Wilkinson, predicted a “punch-up” with unionised workers, adding: “We have got to break them.” The McNulty report for the government in 2011 said costs in the railways should be slashed. And, according to Whelan, “The reality is that the only way they can reduce the billions they pay in subsidy to private firms is to cut staff.” But some in the industry wonder if the five-day Southern strike, brought to a premature end, may have backfired. “They pressed the nuclear button while parliament was in recess and people were on holiday,” said one source. More damagingly, even on routes where conductors are still deemed essential, Southern managed to run a service that, while poor, was only slightly poorer than in the weeks before the strike. Surveys show passengers value a second crew member on the train, which partly explains why large pockets of passenger sympathy for the RMT have held up, perhaps surprisingly given the largely Conservative constituencies affected by the dispute between London and Brighton. Commuters saw enough problems before the strikes to lay much of the blame at Southern’s door, but many are equally furious at the union action. The RMT spokesman was unrepentant: “It’s the only protection we’ve got. A lot of the people moaning are people who don’t have that, wage slaves hired and fired at will, on zero-hours contracts. The idea that we’re going to accept that in 2016 is nonsense.”"
2016-08-13T08:58:54Z,uk-news,UK news,"London football: income, regeneration and muddy memory lanes","Premier League football in London doesn’t only make money for its top flight clubs - currently Arsenal, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United - and their players, but also for the capital as a whole. Away fans travelling to the capital’s Premier League grounds spend over £134m a season on transport, accommodation and food and drink in London, according to one report. Visitors from the West Midlands and Merseyside will be pouring into Croydon and Islington for the new season’s first weekend. London’s football grounds make their own impact on the capital’s economy, not least as drivers of major development schemes. The new season, kicking off on Saturday, sees West Ham moving in to the converted 2012 Olympic stadium in Stratford and work commencing on transforming Spurs’s White Hart Lane stadium into a plush 61,000-seater as part of a wider regeneration project. Meanwhile, in the Championship, Queens Park Rangers are aiming to build a big time future with a brand new ground in the huge Old Oak and Park Royal site, and League One AFC Wimbledon are seeking to return to their forebear club’s original home. Stadium moves and upgrades excite mixed emotions, and their value to local areas and people is contested and unclear: a London Assembly report published last year said “the enhanced regeneration effects of stadia over other developments are as yet unproven” and stressed the need for public bodies - borough councils and mayors - to see that the benefits are maximised. The tensions between the desire for change and success and the countervailing power of territorialism and nostalgia are vividly illuminated by football. This last point provides a shameless pretext for a sometimes muddy trip down memory lane. The first part of London Weekend Television’s 21 Years of London Football 1968-89 is 27 minutes long, so make sure you’re sitting comfortably.

At home in the Premier League this weekend, Palace host West Bromwich Albion on Saturday and Arsenal are visited by Liverpool on Sunday, followed by Chelsea playing West Ham at Stamford Bridge on Monday evening in the new Premier League season’s first London derby. Also at home in London on Saturday are Championship Brentford, League One Charlton and Wimbledon and League Two Barnet and Leyton Orient."
2016-08-13T21:37:37Z,uk-news,UK news,Council planners must ‘inspire public sector development’ in Brexit aftermath,"Strong leadership is urgently required by council planners to inspire public sector development as post-Brexit uncertainty continues to paralyse private developers, a new report warns. Compounding the message are the findings of a new poll showing that three-quarters of planners believe cumulative changes to the planning system have seriously eroded their ability to deliver quality developments. The report, published by the Royal Town Planning Institute, says budget cuts and changes in planning policy over the last 30 years have undermined the powers of public sector planners to perform strategic leadership. The RTPI, which represents 23,000 professional planners, says the situation is most acute in England where the changes have created a complicated and uncertain system that has undermined the potential for new developments to be well-planned and connected to transport infrastructure, alongside a reduced number of affordable properties to rent or buy. Phil Williams, president of the RTPI, said: “For too long, planning has been relegated to a reactive, bureaucratic function instead of being able to plan strategically to drive development, jobs and growth.” He added: “Public sector planners’ ability to be proactive is especially important in these uncertain times. It is absolutely crucial we resource councils’ planning teams properly, so that planners can operate strategically.” The report says: “It is time to recognise that successive waves of change mean that we now have planning systems which struggle to deliver widely-shared economic, social and environmental goals. There is an urgent need to take stock of the planning systems we have now, what they can deliver, and to debate alternative futures for planning that might produce much better results.” After examining case studies across England, researchers found that stronger public sector leadership can make more land available by clearing up contaminated sites and encourage private investment by making sure the right infrastructure is in place. Among the developments the report applauds are Brindleyplace in Birmingham, a large-scale, carefully planned urban renewal which preserved the area’s heritage while revitalising it to attract new business and leisure uses. Others include Cranbrook in East Devon, effectively a new community created by proactive planning that aims to create more than 7,500 homes over the next 20 years. The report also calls for a stronger private sector role in development partnerships, based on the experiences of enterprise zones and urban development corporations, set up in the early 1980s to target deprived areas such as central Manchester and London’s Docklands.Rob Groves, regional director of Argent LLP behind Birmingham’s Brindleyplace development, said: “As many of our projects tend to be ‘problem’ sites in underperforming parts of cities, new thinking and imagination are needed to unlock their potential. “These sites benefit from the clear overall policy framework provided by a local authority – which supports the type of transformative mixed-use development in which we specialise – combined with the experience and innovation of a developer.”"
2016-08-13T22:19:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Role of UK police in training Bahrain’s forces ‘ignores abuses’,"British police have come under fire for their role in training Bahrain’s police force, which has been accused of ruthlessly suppressing public protests and dissent. A confidential 27-page “agreement for the provision of services”, obtained by the Observer, was signed on 14 June 2015 by the UK’s College of Policing and Bahrain’s Ministry of Interior. It spells out the explicitly commercial nature of the relationship between the two parties, but omits any mention of human rights issues. Since it was created in 2012, the college has earned more than £8.5m from its international work, but has faced questions about its remit. Parliament’s home affairs select committee recently criticised the college’s overseas training programme, claiming that “opaque” agreements with foreign governments, which have been criticised for human rights abuses, “threaten the integrity of the very brand of British policing that the college is trying to promote”.
The committee attacked the Foreign Office’s refusal to divulge such contracts on the grounds of commercial sensitivity as “completely unacceptable”. Now a law firm acting on behalf of a Bahraini activist allegedly tortured by the country’s security services has written to the Foreign Office, claiming that the nature of the agreement with Bahrain raises concerns about the UK’s commitment to protecting human rights. Daniel Carey, of DPG Law, said the government needed to give reassurances that the college was not providing assistance to the kingdom’s security forces that could undermine the UK’s commitment to human rights. “We know the college provides a wide range of training programmes domestically that are of potential concern, such as the use of communications data obtained by telecoms operators, the use of interception material, surveillance and undercover policing, and the scope of its courses to overseas customers is not limited in any accountable way,"" said Carey. He also questioned whether the college was a legitimate entity. “The College of Policing is doing something unusual for government in selling services overseas. It is a company limited by guarantee set up by the Home Office. Whether government ministers have the power to set up bodies effectively external to their own department through which they then run profit-making activities is a difficult question of constitutional law. The much safer course is to get parliament’s authority, which didn’t happen here.” The Foreign Office insists that all international work undertaken by the college is referred to the International Policing Assistance Board, which examines any potential impact on the UK’s commitment to human rights. It is understood that all sub-contracts governed by the umbrella agreement have built-in clauses referring to human rights.
A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: “It is not good enough to merely criticise other countries from the sidelines. Only by working with Bahrain are we able to bring about the changes we would like to see in the country. The UK is working closely with the government of Bahrain to provide extensive reform assistance focused on strengthening human rights and the rule of law. We see this support as the most constructive way to achieve long-lasting and sustainable reform in Bahrain.” But Carey said the omission of human rights in the agreement was significant: “The agreement cedes a lot of control to the Bahrain government to pick and choose the areas it would like training on. It provides for all of the other controls you would expect: freedom of information; force majeure; confidentiality; intellectual property; termination; bribery. Why not human rights? Saying that this will be slipped into a subcontract does not seem to be an effective way to protect against human rights risks, especially after resisting disclosure of any of these details to a parliamentary committee.” Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of advocacy at the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, called for the UK to end the commercial relationship between the college and Bahrain’s Ministry of Interior. “We have continued to document widespread and systemic rights violations committed by the Bahraini police throughout this training, which started in 2013,” he said. “If anything, abuses at the hands of the police have increased in 2016, amid a culture of impunity and a lack of transparency from both British and Bahraini institutions. As a result, the training has done little more than legitimise the status quo. Over the past few months, Bahrain has let go of all pretences of reform by cracking down on peaceful demonstrations, torturing detainees and arresting anyone with a critical voice.”"

(Insert joke about inserting joke here.) With the mercury rising, perhaps it’s time to elide the two, and turn a bewildering video game into a chance to meet future friends outside. Potential chat-up lines: “Come up and see my Bulbasaur sometime”; “Hey, you say Wigglytuff, I say Jigglypuff”; and the old faithful, “Wanna hatch an egg with me?”
2 Learn how to relive the wonder of 1976 Those of a certain age and a nostalgic disposition will find themselves hankering for the sight of cracked mud, standpipes and Denis Howell, appointed emergency drought minister as Britain roasted. It is hard to explain this to the young, but bottles of San Pellegrino were much scarcer in the “old days”, and nobody you knew belonged to a gym with a cooling rainforest shower. To go back in time you’ll need a paddling pool in the yard, Dancing Queen on the radio, Taxi Driver at the cinema and Brendan Foster running around the track in Montreal. Remember to share shallow baths and use the bath water for your begonias. See? Simpler, gentler times. If you happen to live near a hipster zone, be discreet: one false move and your house will morph into a 70s cafe filled with beardies with ironically knotted handkerchiefs on their heads. 3 Pull the curtains closed and watch other people sweat There is a certain finger-wagging that goes with pleasant weather: the sense that you must be out in it, for the pragmatic reason that it might be dreich and chilly tomorrow, and the less obvious reason that the gods of nature have sent it to you and to repudiate it would demonstrate ingratitude. Nested within this is the childhood memory of being told to go and play in the fresh air, essentially because your parents or teachers wanted five minutes free of your company. But you are an adult now and you don’t have to care about this. You can sit inside with the telly on and the blinds shut watching the Olympics, cricket, Premier League football or the latest grand prix. Why not make a viewing chart? Who’s to stop you? 4 Stimulate the economy, one festive bauble at a time Selfridges on London’s Oxford Street has already opened its Christmas shop, in large part to satisfy the summer tourist trade and – although it might seem incongruous to be stocking up on the tinsel – there’s wisdom to counter-intuitive consumerism. In the way that women are said to forget the trauma of childbirth between pregnancies, shoppers blank out the torment of standing, trapped within a heaving mass of desperation, holding an overpriced milk-frother that’s destined to end up in the hands of an aunt who’s only ever drunk tea. Seriously: go when it’s quiet.
5 Give the swerve to eating alfresco OK, there are exceptions. By all means eat a salad at the little table just outside your kitchen door, or the most basic of sandwiches on a park bench. Anything more elaborate, forget it: the inhabitants of this drizzly island are simply not cut out for outdoor troughing. Countless magazine articles will try to convince you otherwise, with pictures of salads dotted with pomegranate seeds, micro herbs (whatever they are), haunches of slickly marinated beast roasting beneath the stars and groups of friends laughing glamorously over cocktails. Hot-weather truthers tell it like it really is: egg sandwiches, warm Foster’s, wasps, unexpected gusts of wind that blow salt over everything, and a row about how to use the parking app.
6 Key to surviving the office: bosses must buy ice-creams It is vital that office workers should not dwell on what home-based colleagues might be up to: a spot of light gardening; floating around in a cool kaftan; bunking off early to watch cricket on the green. It’s not even accurate. Most of the time they’re not bothering to work at all. Think instead of what they’re missing – the camaraderie of the commute, with its opportunities to revive someone who has fainted; the moment the boss appears with ice-creams for all, as if a Solero could make up for the sheer humiliation of being sat, dripping with sweat, in front of a monitor; then there’s the morale-boosting outings to the packed pubs for a “cold one”; and the shared hatred for holidaying colleagues. And remember the rewards, for the powers-that-be are sure to notice your dedication. 7 Catch up on your reading The sensation of being becalmed during a hot spell has often inspired fiction writers, notably LP Hartley whose novel The Go-Between is set during a sultry Edwardian summer. Plunge into a bit of Hartley then meander into Maggie O’Farrell’s Instructions for a Heatwave via Ian McEwan’s The Cement Garden. And don’t miss Alexandra Harris’s Weatherland, a survey of writers’ and artists’ relationship with the climate that includes a wonderful description of Jonathan Swift sweating through a heatwave and eventually diving into the Thames at night (not recommended). 8 The fine art of complaining Few topics are as fun to complain about as the weather, a pursuit that is both entirely futile and boundless. There is always something coming out of the sky, and always will be until there isn’t, and then we really will have something to complain about. There is also much fun to be had with, say, air conditioning – lack of, as compared with fortunate America, and ecological evils of; the garden – who can keep up with the watering and everything’s over by August anyway; clothes shops – the ludicrousness of their being filled with autumn wear; pub gardens – the impossibility of getting a seat; neighbours – the inconsiderate nature of open windows; and sleep – who even bothers to try. That lot should keep you going until January. 9 Speaking of which … Take a rest from politics, or at least politics as currently conducted on social media. Bawling at people about Brexit, cavilling about Jeremy Corbyn – it’s a pastime surely best saved for when the evenings close in. Take a leaf out of Owen Smith’s book: last weekend saw him on Twitter posting a selfie taken after a swim at the London Fields Lido in Hackney, somewhat daringly given the prevailing political wind in north London. But while the heat is on the street, better that the hot air on Twitter should cool down, and everyone calm down, with some soothing pictures of animals having a paddle; it’s not called the silly season for nothing. Meanwhile, those referendum leaflets you haven’t got round to recycling are perfect for fanning a fevered brow. 10 Eat, drink and be merry, because tomorrow it rains If you have absorbed all of the above and find it wanting in joie de vivre, feel free to toss it out of the window. In reality, we know that, following a short season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, and a few pre-solstice jabs at jollity, courtesy of Bonfire Night and Hallowe’en, we will soon be plunged into greyness, rain, thermal vests and darkness by four. To some, this is very heaven, but it has the rest of us reaching for the SAD lamps and Googling sun-drenched beaches. So, grab this opportunity to play Frisbee in the park, sip long, icy drinks and generally do all manner of things that only usually appear in romcom montages."
2016-08-14T11:44:24Z,uk-news,UK news,London's night tube to get 100 extra police as 24-hour service begins,"Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, will announce a £3m investment for 100 extra police officers on the night tube to reassure passengers and communities as the capital prepares for the launch of 24-hour underground travel next weekend. While many in London eagerly await all-night trains, which businesses expect to give an immediate boost to bars and the entertainment sector, an internal risk assessment leaked this year suggested that Transport for London was anticipating higher levels of rowdy behaviour and assaults. London Underground bosses said the public should feel confident in the safety and security of the night tube, and said they would be monitoring the service closely.
The phased move into 24-hour operation will start with trains running all night on Fridays and Saturdays on the Central line, the tube’s main east-west artery, and the Victoria line, which runs from Brixton to Walthamstow Central. With trains roughly every 10 minutes through the night, TfL said nocturnal journeys would be 20 minutes quicker on average, with many passengers saving more than an hour. A test run took place over the weekend, with trains in service on the lines, but not carrying passengers. Khan said the night tube would bring great economic benefits for the capital and reinforce his message to the world, following the EU referendum, that London remains open. “What better way to illustrate that than the tube running 24 hours a day,” he said. The service would allow many more people to experience the city’s culture, nightlife, theatres and music venues, Khan said. “Over the last eight years we have lost, as a city, 50% of our clubs and 40% of our live music venues, and for the greatest city in the world, that’s not sustainable,” said Khan, suggesting that the night tube could help reverse this trend, while stating his intention to use planning laws to protect live venues and “preserve the heritage”. “I’m also aware that thousands of Londoners work 24 hours a day: many doctors, porters or security guards take two or three night buses to get home,” he said. In a reference to the delays in launching the night tube under his predecessor, Boris Johnson, Khan said: “I’m aware that the previous mayor set a date and broke his promise three times. By the end, he said we’d survived 150 years without one and could do without it. He’s wrong.” The service’s gestation has been fraught, with its launch delayed by almost a year. In what quickly came to be seen as a mistake, the night tube plan was unveiled by Johnson and transport chiefs, while burying accompanying “modernisation” plans to cut jobs and close ticket offices. Any union goodwill over rosters and work-life balance quickly evaporated, and an agreed date to launch the night tube was only reached after Johnson’s exit from City Hall. Finn Brennan, the Aslef union’s organiser for tube drivers, said: “Having the new mayor in place who was clear about wanting to work with staff and unions certainly changed the atmosphere.” Despite the progress, no date has been set for the three major other lines planned to follow in the autumn. Khan said: “The reason why I’m phasing them in is I’m keen to make sure that we don’t have noise pollution, and that the buses are working in parallel and there are enough police. What’s important is that we get the right processes in place.” He admitted that there were already some problems on late-night weekend services, with more than 500,000 passengers using the tube after 10pm. “Obviously with more people using public transport, there’s a legitimate concern over making sure we’ve got enough police,” Khan said. Noise from trains is an issue for residents, particularly those living along the outer reaches of the Central line. The mayor said there had been “a huge amount of preparatory works to ameliorate disturbance,” including upgrading tracks with shock-absorbent fixings to help deaden the sound. Station announcements will also be minimised. Despite the pitfalls and expenditure, with 500 additional staff having been recruited and revenue not expected to cover costs for many years, the economic prize, according to research by business group London First and services company EY, is high. It found that the capital’s night-time economy already supports about one in eight (723,000) jobs and could be worth nearly £30bn a year by 2030. But transport authorities are hoping, paradoxically, that the measure of success for the launch of the night tube is that passengers do not notice it. “It should be seamless,” said Mark Wild, the managing director of London Underground. While there may be a touch of internal fanfare on the first service, as it pulls out of Brixton station on Friday night, commuters should not see any difference from day to night, with staff working as normal on the platforms. Usual off-peak fares will apply, and journeys starting before 4.30am will be counted as part of the previous day, meaning that many passengers could in effect travel free at night if they have already reached Oyster or contactless card daily caps. The missing five hours from the last train to the first are not a time when the tube sleeps, even now. Wild was speaking from the control room at TfL’s Southwark HQ, which is staffed through the night, watching as maintenance trains run on the tracks, monitoring intersections of the tube and other rail networks, and ensuring that all those who go in come out. From here, on a bank of screens on the wall, every train’s whereabouts can be monitored and every underground platform in central London clearly viewed via CCTV cameras. Police sit alongside and information is rapidly transmitted to anyone who could be affected by an incident or delay. The man at the hot desk is, one operations manager said, the “single voice of truth” for information screens, news, phone apps and anyone following London transport. “We’ve already got eyes on the whole network and full control here, 24/7,” said Wild. A returning Briton, Wild ran the transport system in Melbourne and helped introduce weekend night services on the city’s tram and train network earlier this year. While the size of the network and the passenger numbers are a fraction of London’s, Wild said the move was transformative for the city and expected a similarly swift take-up of the service in London. TfL is confident of pent-up demand: the number of passengers travelling on the tube after 10pm on Friday and Saturday nights has gone up by 70% in the past 15 years. Even before the additional police were confirmed, Wild said the public should feel very safe and confident using the service. “People should feel as comfortable using this at night during the day. I expect it all to be pretty normal,” he said. Without the deadline of the last tube, Wild said, demand should be smoother and the rush avoided, while he played down the possibility of late-night passengers continuing drunken revelling in transit. “Everyone knows the rules. Coming here from different jurisdictions, people here are very well behaved. They should feel safe and secure,” he said."
2016-08-14T13:27:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Suspect arrested after man fatally assaulted at village pub,"Detectives investigating a fatal assault at a village pub have arrested a 61-year-old man on suspicion of murder. The victim was named locally as 48-year-old Dean Haverley, a father of five children. He died in hospital after being treated at the scene of the attack at the George Inn in Burnham, Buckinghamshire. The suspect was detained on Saturday night in connection with Haverley’s death, Thames Valley police said, and remained in police custody. Officers were called to the high-street pub at about midnight on Friday after reports of a man being assaulted inside the premises, shortly after last orders. The victim was described by friends on social media as an “upbeat, funny, guy who was a brilliant father”. Dougie McClean, Haverley’s son, paid tribute to his father on Facebook. In a post he wrote: “Even though we hadn’t seen each other for a while and I didn’t meet ya till late on in my life we still had some good times and laughs. I’m overly shocked and can’t get my nut around it r.i.p dad ... thoughts to all the rest of the family.” Haverley’s brother, Craig, told the Mail Online: “Dean was cruelly murdered while on a night out in Burnham around midnight on 12 August. He has left behind a wife, five children and two stepchildren. He was my best friend and my little brother and I’m going to miss him big time.” He described Haverley as a “brilliant father who doted” on his children. “He was a great dad and he absolutely loved all of them. He was an upbeat, funny guy, always laughing, and he had my kids in stitches. The last time I saw him was about two or three days ago when he came round to mine and we watched some TV and had a few beers.” DCI Simon Steel, leading the inquiry, described it as an isolated incident and appealed for more information. “My appeal is to anyone who was in the George Inn around midnight who witnessed the assault or has any information regarding the incident to contact police immediately.” A postmortem was due to take place on Sunday, police said. Haverley’s wife and children issued a message through the Thames Valley force asking for their privacy to be respected."
2016-08-14T16:00:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Wallabies flourishing in the wild on Isle of Man,"Wild wallabies, normally attuned to warmer climes, are thriving on the Isle of Man. The animals, native to Australia and Tasmania, have been flourishing on the tiny island in the middle of the Irish Sea ever since a pair escaped in the 1970s from a wildlife park in the Curraghs, an area of wetland in the north-west of the island.
Researchers believe now there are more than a 100 living in the wild. The scientists who have been monitoring them with hidden cameras to see their effect on the environment believe their numbers have increased due to lack of predators and competitors. The animals, which graze on grasslands, foraging willows and young shrubs, have normally confined themselves to the north of the island but scientists say they are on the move and they have been spotted in the south. Paige Havlin, who conducted a research project into the red-necked wallabies as part of her university thesis, found that the mammals had most likely descended from escapees of the Curraghs Wildlife Park, including Wanda, the wallaby who escaped shortly after the park opened and returned later the same year. Another incident occurred in 1989 when eight wallabies dug under their enclosure and escaped. She told the Isle of Man Today: “It is highly probable, though, that the wallaby population originated from the wildlife park. The strongest evidence for this is that the densest population of wallabies in the Isle of Man lives directly behind the wildlife park on the Curragh wetlands site.” Havlin, a graduate of Queen’s University Belfast, has amassed a collection of more than 1,000 videos of wallabies in the Ballaugh area, as well as hundreds of videos contributed by members of the public across the island. She said: “My research method used camera traps, which are small camera boxes that can be attached to a tree or post and which capture videos when triggered by movement. A very small minority of these wallabies appeared to have blindness; when individuals did appear to be blind (presenting as a cataract-like milky layer on one or both of their eyes) the problem was usually accompanied by other ailments such as an inner-ear infection, characterised by a tilted head. “Given that it is likely there have been more escapes over the years than have been reported it is likely the gene pool is much larger than just the genes from the often-quoted pair of escapees, and there have been no obvious signs of the effects of inbreeding. A genetic study of the population, though, would be required to fully dispel this myth.” The marsupials have now colonised the Archallagan plantation near Foxdale and the population is expected to increase, as greater numbers inhabit the island’s wooded and grassland areas."
2016-08-14T17:39:35Z,uk-news,UK news,UK's second heatwave of the summer on its way,"The UK is set for its second heatwave of the summer, with temperatures rivalling Barcelona, Algiers and Nice this week.
Greg Dewhurst, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said Britain would start to feel the burn on Monday, with temperatures peaking on Wednesday in the high 20s and almost breaking 30C in some places. “It looks like Wednesday will be the hottest day of the week with the best of the sunshine,” he said. “It’ll be a bit cooler further north and in the far west with the cloud amounts increasing, but overall a lovely day with plenty of sunshine across those eastern parts away from thicker clouds and showers in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and south-west England.” Between now and Wednesday it will stay dry with plenty of sunshine and high winds, but on Thursday and Friday the weather is set to cool slightly, with maximum temperatures reaching a still-sticky 24C, he said. The heatwave, which is being referred to as a “Spanish plume”, will see temperatures at their hottest in the south and south-east of England but will fall short of mid-July’s record this year of 33.5C. Billions of extra litres of water are being readied to pump into the south of England, with about 450m litres per day on standby – enough to fill 900,000 paddling pools, according to Thames Water. On a hot day, water consumption in London increases about 14%, and this shoots up to 27% in the Thames Valley region, the company said. According to the Met Office, warm air from eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, Iberia and the tropical Atlantic will all come together in layers and head towards the UK. In July 2015, the UK saw the hottest day on record since 2003, when temperatures reached 36.7C at Heathrow, Greater London. By comparison, this summer has been slightly hotter so far. The hottest day ever on record in the UK is 38.5C in Faversham, Kent, on 10 August 2003. However, earlier this week parts of Scotland saw frost and sub-zero temperatures, and in Carrbridge, Inverness, temperatures dived to -3.1C on Tuesday night. Alex Burkhill, another meteorologist at the Met Office, said that due to the heat wave air pollution levels will be moderate to high in some areas throughout the country. “We work closely with Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] and although most people won’t have any real problems, people with pre-existing conditions in areas with high levels of air pollution may need to reduce the amount of strenuous work they do outside,” he said. In April a flock of racing pigeons took to the skies of London to measure air pollution levels after it was found that nitrogen dioxide kills nearly 9,500 people in the capital each year. During a heatwave levels of air pollution can become toxic. The heatwave could also mean further misery for commuters as high temperatures can cause steel tracks to buckle. Network Rail has previously imposed speed limits to avoid danger to commuters."
2016-08-14T21:00:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Police to hire law firms to tackle cyber criminals in radical pilot project,"Private law firms will be hired by police to pursue criminal suspects for profit, under a radical new scheme to target cyber criminals and fraudsters. In a pilot project by the City of London police, the lead force on fraud in England and Wales, officers will pass details of suspects and cases to law firms, which will use civil courts to seize the money. The force says the scheme is a way of more effectively tackling fraud – which is now the biggest type of crime, estimated to cost £193bn a year. It is overwhelming police and the criminal justice system. The experiment, which is backed by the government and being closely watched by other law enforcement agencies, is expected to lead to cases reaching civil courts this year or early next year. Officers will use the private law firms to attempt to seize suspects’ assets. If unsuccessful, police could decide to leave it at that or pursue the case themselves through the criminal courts. Commander Chris Greany, head of economic crime at City of London police, said: “It is a huge shift … Civil recovery allows us to get hold of a criminal’s money sooner, and repay back victims sooner.”
One prominent criminal law firm was sceptical about the plans, expressing concern that a profit motive could damage the fairness of the process. Currently, police pursue people suspected of making millions through financial crimes by prosecuting them in the criminal courts, and need to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. After conviction, a lengthy process starts to seize the proceeds of crime, which can take years. Police believe some suspects use the delay to hide their assets. Under the shakeup being piloted, a law firm will pursue the suspect in the civil courts before any conviction and possibly even without a criminal charge. The burden of proof is lower in civil courts, and they will only have to show that the suspect stole the money on the balance of probabilities. Katie Wheatley, joint head of criminal law at Bindmans, a London law firm, expressed unease over the proposals, which she said gave police “what they would regard as an easy deterrent, without having the inconvenience of proving an offence to a criminal standard”. Greany said the law firm and others in the private sector would bear the risk, in return for a share of the money taken off the criminal suspect. The lead law firm taking part in the pilot is Mischon de Reya, best known for representing Princess Diana in her divorce from Prince Charles. Greany said: “Who benefits from this? The victim will benefit, because they will get their money back. We’ll benefit because the criminal will be skint and they will be brought back down to having nothing again, and have to get about their normal lives, and they won’t have status in the community.”
Money from fraud is being hidden around the world and getting a conviction and then seizing the assets of criminals can be very complex and lengthy. Greany said: “You can destabilise a criminal gang much faster by taking their asset off them [rather] than chasing them around the world for five years.” But Wheatley asked of the police: “What evidence would they be using to strip somebody of their assets? If a criminal prosecution has failed, well OK, the burden of proof is slightly different, but you still have to wonder whether evidence that has been rejected by a criminal court ought to be the first port of call for a civil forfeiture or a civil confiscation order.” Wheatley said the plan risked creating a conflict between private firms’ profit motive and the fairness of the process. “We’ve seen privatisation in this context in other ways, for example prison privatisation,” she said. “We all know how badly that’s gone wrong, particularly for young offenders. I appreciate they are not talking about convictions or detentions, but having possibly life savings, large assets stripped from you is a life-changing event. Whereas for the companies that the role was subcontracted to, it would just be a job.” Robert Wynn Jones, a specialist in fraud at Mishcon de Reya, said the “novel and pragmatic” scheme would boost the deterrent to criminals. Wynn Jones said victims might be asked to pay legal costs, or specialist insurers could fund the fees in return for a 20-30% share of the money taken off criminals. He said it would have to be financially worthwhile, meaning the scheme would only work for cases where losses ran into the hundreds of thousands. The use of private investigators would push up the cost. There are two main downsides. If the suspect appeals and wins, or is cleared in a criminal case, then the money seized has to be repaid with interest added. The second controversial aspect is the transfer of what was essentially punishment carried out through the state system, with established methods of accountability, to private firms, where it would be done for profit. However, Greany said: “It is a public-private partnership.” Wynn Jones accepted that the new scheme would “throw up some ethical, political and philosophical questions”, but added: “There is no way the police can investigate and pursue this level of fraud – they don’t have the resources.” The Office for National Statistics said in July that there had been more than 5.8m incidents of cybercrime in the past year, enough to virtually double the headline crime rate in England and Wales. The Conservatives have been keen to see greater private sector involvement and expertise used in the criminal justice system
A working group to oversee the experiment has been set up by the City of London police, officers from the National Crime Agency, and Metropolitan police, and law and private investigation firms. Greany said fraudsters were renting luxury items, such as cars, so they had no visible assets to be taken off them if they were caught. The Labour MP Keith Vaz, chair of the home affairs select committee, said a key problem in recovering the proceeds of crime was the “way recovery is incentivised”. He said: “The Asset Recovery Incentivisation Scheme does not appear to us, or the NAO [National Audit Office], to be fit for purpose. It does not sufficiently reward those who have to lay out the resources to recover ill-gotten gains. We suggested in the report that recovered assets be distributed differently to better incentivise recovery, and if the numbers of these pilots work out this could well be an effective way to do increase the proportion of proceeds of crime we recover. “We also recommend that a higher percentage should be returned to the communities affected by the crimes in question: if using commercial law firms enables us to net recover more, that is a win-win situation.” Additional reporting by Damien Gayle"
2016-08-15T12:26:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Talks break down in Southern rail dispute,"Talks between Southern and the RMT union aimed at settling the long-running railway dispute have broken down, meaning passengers could face renewed disruption from strikes. A five-day strike that started last Monday was suspended after three days and both sides returned to talks at the arbitration service Acas on Thursday. But a third day of talks came to an abrupt end on Monday morning. An Acas spokesperson said: “Acas conciliation talks have ended without the sides reaching agreement. There are no further talks planned but our services remain available.” Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which operates Southern trains, said it would press ahead with planned changes to staff roles, which were due to start being implemented next week. Conductors will no longer be responsible for closing train doors and will be rebranded as “onboard supervisors”. Unions say the move endangers safety and threatens jobs. Angie Doll, GTR’s passenger services director, said: “We have been talking to the union for nine months now and, despite several visits to Acas, the union won’t agree a deal. Passengers will be rightly exasperated that the RMT won’t agree to what most fair-minded people would believe is an incredibly good offer. “We have guaranteed to have a second person on as many trains as today, but the union is rigidly refusing our offer to agree a list of exceptional circumstances when we would be able to run our trains without a second staff member on board, such as during disruption to still get people home. This would create the crucial flexibility we need to ensure fewer cancelled trains for our passengers.”
Doll said the RMT had not raised safety issues during the latest talks, something she claimed “confirmed this dispute is purely about union power and control”. However, the RMT accused Southern of rejecting a proposal that would have ensured the presence of a second person on a train and that it said would have addressed all of the company’s concerns. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “We had a golden opportunity in these talks to make some serious progress on the core issue of a second person on the train who would have protected the safety of passengers, delivered customer service and ensured access to services for those with disabilities or needing assistance.” He said the breakdown of the talks was a “bitter blow”. The union’s executive was meeting on Monday afternoon to consider possible further strike action. An emergency timetable is still in place on the Southern network, with more than 300 services a day cut from the schedule, due to staff shortages. Commuter groups and opposition politicians have demanded the government strip GTR of the franchise after more than a year of delays and cancellations on one of Britain’s busiest commuter rail networks."
2016-08-15T12:47:43Z,uk-news,UK news,"Law firm at centre of Al-Sweady inquiry to close down, sayÂ reports","The government has said it is planning a clampdown on legal firms pursuing what it calls “spurious claims” against military personnel following reports that Iraq war law firm Public Interest Lawyers is to shut down. The firm, which submitted hundreds of allegations of misconduct and unlawful killing by British troops, is to cease operation at the end of August, weeks after being stripped of legal aid funding, according to a document seen by the Daily Mail. The document submitted to the high court by PIL reportedly asks judges to make an order that it has ceased to act for 187 Iraqi claimants due to its “permanent closure”. The firm will not pursue a further 1,000 compensation claims it planned to lodge. PIL represented complainants in the £31m Al-Sweady inquiry and was criticised when the inquiry’s 2014 report concluded the most serious allegations of war crimes following a 2004 battle in southern Iraq were based on “deliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility”. At the start of August it was announced the firm would no longer receive public funding after the legal aid agency (LAA) ruled it had breached contractual requirements. The agency took the decision after reviewing information submitted by the firm, following a Solicitors Regulation Authority investigation. The prime minister, Theresa May, was said to be “very much pleased” at the closure of the firm. “We made a manifesto commitment to addressing these types of spurious claims that companies like PIL are pursuing,” a No 10 spokesman said. “The closure of PIL shows that we are making progress on that, tackling these types of firms head-on to make sure we get the right outcome for our armed forces who show such bravery in the most difficult of circumstances.” The spokesman said ministers were currently looking at a suite of measures to prevent firms making bogus claims, including strengthening the penalties for those who abused the system. The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, said: “This is the right outcome for our armed forces, who show bravery and dedication in difficult circumstances. For too long, we’ve seen our legal system abused to impugn them falsely. We are now seeing progress and we will be announcing further measures to stamp out this practice.” The long-running Al-Sweady inquiry concluded in its final report that the conduct of some soldiers towards detainees breached the Geneva convention. But it was highly critical of the claims it was initially set up to investigate: that Iraqi detainees had been murdered, mutilated and tortured following the battle of Danny Boy on 14 May 2004 near al-Amarah in southern Iraq. It found British forces responded to a deadly ambush by insurgents with “exemplary courage, resolution and professionalism”. It suggested some of the detainees – all described as members or supporters of the Mahdi army insurgent group – consciously lied about the most serious allegations to discredit the British armed forces. Phil Shiner, who ran the firm, was charged by the SRA, which referred him to the solicitors disciplinary tribunal. Shiner has won the right to have the next stage of the disciplinary hearing held behind closed doors. The firm has had success in the courts, including a case in which it acted for Gurkhas who had been captured by Japanese troops, securing them £40m in compensation."
2016-08-15T14:26:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Dalian Atkinson: former footballer dies after police shoot him with Taser,"The former Aston Villa footballer Dalian Atkinson has died after police Tasered him near his father’s home in Telford. West Mercia police said a 48-year-old man had died. It is understood the man was Atkinson, who also played for Sheffield Wednesday and Ipswich Town. He is believed to have been visiting his 85-year-old father, Ernest. The force said officers fired a Taser at about 1.30am on Monday after responding to reports of concerns for a person’s safety. The man failed to respond to medical attention and was pronounced dead 90 minutes later. The incident was automatically referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) because it involved a death caused by police officers. West Mercia police said it was assisting the IPCC and was unable to comment further.
The IPCC confirmed it had launched an investigation. In a statement it said: “At this stage the IPCC is aware a Taser was used on the man before he became ill. The ambulance service attended but the man later died. “IPCC investigators are at the scene gathering the available information and are attending the post-incident procedures to supervise the recovery of initial evidence. “The IPCC is conducting a full and thorough investigation into all of the circumstances surrounding his death including the use of force.” Forensic officers were at the scene on Monday and Meadow Close remained cordoned off. Neighbours said the former footballer had made frequent visits in his Porsche. Matthew Bothwell said: “Every time he would come he would have crowds around him. It’s a close-knit community. I just can’t bear to think what his family are going through.” Tina Bothwell said: “He was loving, caring and got on with everybody in the street. He always got on with the kids because they absolutely loved his car.” Another resident, Paula Quinn, said Atkinson appeared to be “almost staggering” in the street before he was Tasered. She said he went down “like a lead balloon” after being hit by the stun gun. Quinn said: “I heard shouting and something smashing, which is what alerted me to look out of the window. I am feeling a bit sick knowing that the poor lad has passed. I don’t care what anybody has done. Nobody deserves to die as a result of something like that.” Tasers deliver an incapacitating 50,000-volt shock, and critics say the weapon is too often lethal. It has been linked to at least 10 deaths in England and Wales over the last decade. In 2013, Jordan Lee Begley, 23, died two hours after a Greater Manchester officer targeted him with a stun gun at his home. Police had been called to reports of an argument. A West Midlands ambulance service spokesman said: “We were called by West Mercia police to an address in Meadow Close in the Trench area of Telford at about 1.45am this morning. An ambulance was dispatched and upon arrival found a man who had been Tasered. “As he was being conveyed to Princess Royal hospital, his condition deteriorated and he went into cardiac arrest. Despite the efforts of the crew and hospital staff, it was not possible to save him and he was confirmed dead at hospital, shortly after arrival.” Campaigners said Atkinson’s death highlighted the need for a UK version of the American Black Lives Matter movement, which was launched earlier this month to highlight police violence against members of the black community. Kevin Maxwell, a former detective with Greater Manchester police and founder of Racism Ruins Lives, said: “Dalian Atkinson is a black man. Fact. He died in police custody. Fact. Black Lives Matter is about raising awareness of this. “Clearly, we do not know the full circumstances of what took place, but the deaths of black people in custody are a matter of concern. “Policing generally in Britain is disproportionate towards black people [who are] twice as likely to die in police custody than white people and 37 times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than white people.” Michael Naughton, reader in sociology and law at Bristol University, said: “The evidence is clear. Whether stop and search, deaths in police custody or deaths by the police during arrest. Black men (and their families) are massively disproportionately targeted and victimised in the UK, as in the US, by a system of policing that is systemically and institutionally racist.” Atkinson achieved acclaim for his goal of the season against Wimbledon in 1992 as part of an Aston Villa team that went on to secure the runners-up spot in the first year of the Premier League.
He also scored at Wembley in 1994 as Villa beat Manchester United to lift the League Cup. He started his career at Ipswich and then played for Sheffield Wednesday and the Spanish side Real Sociedad before moving to Villa. He was the first black player for Sociedad, scoring 12 goals in La Liga. At Villa he scored more than 20 Premier League goals between 1991 and 1995 before going on to play less successfully for teams including the Turkish side Fenerbahçe and Manchester City. He ended his playing career in South Korea in 2001. He was never capped for England, but was selected for the England B team. Former teammates and fellow professionals expressed their shock and sorrow following the news of his death, including the former Villa and Australia goalkeeper Mark Bosnich.
Tony Daley, who played for Aston Villa at the same time as Atkinson, tweeted: “Devastating news … RIP Dalian.” The former Blackburn and Celtic striker Chris Sutton tweeted his condolences to Atkinson’s family.
Ipswich Town paid tribute, tweeting: “Terribly sad news about our former striker. Our thoughts are with Dalian’s family and friends at this tragic time.” Sheffield Wednesday tweeted: “The thoughts of everyone at Wednesday are with the friends and family of Dalian Atkinson this morning. RIP.”"
2016-08-15T16:00:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Mother jailed for making children have surgery so she could claim benefits,"A mother who lied about her children being ill, forcing them to have surgery as part of a plan to falsely claim benefits, has been jailed for seven-and-a-half years.
The 49-year-old from Croydon, south London, told medical staff her children had asthma, autism and other health problems, meaning they were given drugs they did not need and went through invasive treatment including having tubes fitted in their stomachs. The woman’s lies, which spanned a decade, allowed her to claim more than £375,000 in benefits, before she was arrested by police in 2013. Following a three-year investigation, the woman, who cannot be named to protect her children’s identity, was sentenced to a prison term. She was convicted last month of cruelty, fraud, making a false representation and obtaining money transfer by deception. Addressing the woman at Croydon crown court, judge Elizabeth Smaller said: “I note that you have appeared to be very sad at times during this trial – but, watching you as I have for three months in court, in my view, it cannot be said to amount to remorse for what you did.” Smaller said the mother, despite being made aware of all the risks of surgery, had signed the consent forms to ensure it went ahead and noted she had not been “filled with the disquiet that most parents would” have at the thought of their child undergoing such an operation. The children, a young boy and girl, had surgery to fit them with gastrostomy tubes for feeding, despite being able to eat normally, after the woman lied to authorities to say they had stomach problems. Her son was given steroids after she claimed he suffered breathlessness and he was told to behave as though he had autism. In what the judge described as an embarrassing episode for him, he was also kept in nappies until he was taken into care aged seven-and-a-half. The woman was determined to find another problem when it looked as though others she had created were resolved, the judge said. “The lengths to which you went were creative and well thought through,” Smaller said. “They were wilful, prolonged and sometimes elaborate. … You seem not to have been able to see past your own actions to the indignity of your children.” Over at least 10 years, the mother presented her son and daughter to doctors and education professionals, maintaining they suffered from serious health conditions. Between October 2003 and February 2014 she falsely claimed £375,198 in disability living allowances and income support. This was despite living with her partner, who earned £38,000 a year. She forced her children to fake symptoms of illnesses, ranging from asthma to autism and urology problems, to secure her benefits. Steroids were given to her son even though he did not have severe asthma, as she claimed. She also had her son mimic behaviour consistent with autism and, as part of the fraud, resisted attempts by the child’s nursery to toilet-train him. The trial was the culmination of a three-year investigation. Police raided the woman’s home and arrested her in May 2013 after suspicions of fraud were raised. During the search they found a large quantity of items with an estimated cost to the NHS of £145,870, including asthma drugs and feeding equipment. Smaller said: “Despite everything, your children still love you – that is no doubt – which makes your exploitation of their unconditional love and trust, for them, all the more serious and bewildering.” After sentencing the woman, Smaller questioned how the situation had been allowed to go on for 10 years. She said: “It is a matter of regret that such qualified and experienced medical professionals at world-renowned hospitals did not maintain better channels of communication. However busy – and knowledgeable they are in their field – they might all with hindsight have agreed that they could have learned much about this defendant from speaking to [a doctor] and each other.” Malcolm McHaffie, deputy chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said the woman had shown extraordinary cruelty and had been motivated by dishonesty and greed. “That a mother should go to such lengths of child cruelty, spanning at least 10 years, to support the false and exaggerated benefits claims that she made is beyond comprehension,” he said. DS Stuart Parsons said, after the woman’s sentencing on Monday: “It is staggering to think that the mother’s wilful actions resulted in the children undergoing unnecessary surgical and medical interventions. She lied at every opportunity, presenting herself as a lone parent coping with ill and vulnerable children. The reality was that she resided with her partner and fabricated her children’s conditions for personal financial gain.”"
2016-08-15T16:24:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Salvage crew boards stricken Transocean Winner oil platform,"Fourteen salvage experts have boarded the drilling rig that ran aground on the coast of the Isle of Lewis in Scotland last week, as the official overseeing the operation confirmed it could take weeks before the stricken oil platform can be moved. The 17,000-tonne semi-submersible rig, Transocean Winner, ran aground close to Dalmore beach last Monday as it was being towed from Norway to Malta and its towline snapped in heavy seas. Hugh Shaw, the secretary of state’s representative for maritime salvage and intervention, told BBC Alba that any attempt to refloat the rig was still weeks away. The platform was carrying 280 tonnes of diesel, and specialists believe two of the four storage tanks were damaged when it hit rocks near Carloway, with a potential loss of 53 tonnes of fuel. But there has been no sign so far of an oil slick or reports of pollution. Smit Salvage confirmed on Monday that the remaining two diesel oil tanks in the hull were intact and plans were now under way to transfer their contents – a total of 137 tonnes – using onboard pumping systems to other tanks above the water line. Meanwhile, the salvage team, which includes staff from the rig’s owner, Transocean, will continue their damage assessment and preparations for the eventual refloat. A wire will be run between the shore and the rig to enable supplies and equipment to be delivered to those working onboard. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency is continuing to impose a 300-metre exclusion zone around the popular surfing spot covering sea and air, to prevent onlookers hampering the salvage teams and to prevent drones being used in the area. The Scottish operational environment group is closely monitoring the incident."
2016-08-15T19:10:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Body of man found after car plunged into Yorkshire reservoir,"Divers have recovered the body of a man after a car came off a country road and plunged into water at a reservoir. West Yorkshire police said the driver was believed to have been the only person in the car that entered the Booth Wood reservoir, on the moors between Halifax and Rochdale close to the M62 motorway on Sunday evening. A large-scale search operation was launched – including firefighters, paramedics and the police helicopter – after the alarm was raised shortly after 8.20pm that evening. Specialist underwater search teams entered the water on Monday, locating the vehicle and, a short time later, the body of a man. Sgt Adrian Newman, of the Safer Roads and Neighbourhoods Support Team West, said: “The underwater search team were on site this morning and first located the vehicle, before the body of the deceased was recovered at 11.55am. The family have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.” The driver is believed to have been aged in his 30s. The force is continuing to appeal for anyone who has any information about the incident to make contact with them. The car had been travelling west along the A672 Oldham Road, above Rishworth, close to the isolated Turnpike pub. The man-made reservoir, which was completed in 1971, supplies water to Wakefield and the surrounding area."
2016-08-16T07:53:31Z,uk-news,UK news,'Zombie knife' seller urges shoppers to buy before ban takes effect,"A company selling “zombie knives” has been criticised as irresponsible after it urged customers to buy the weapons “while you can” before a UK-wide ban comes into force later this week. Hunters Knives and Swords advertised a range of the horror film-inspired blades including swords, machetes and a £39.99 “crossbow pistol”. In a message posted on its website on Monday, the company said: “Order now – after 16th August 2016 you will no longer be able to purchase zombie knives in the UK, so grab them while you can!” New legislation comes into force on Thursday meaning that anyone caught in possession of a “zombie knife” will face up to four years in prison. Inspired by horror films and often advertised as collectors’ items, they are available on the internet for as little as £10. Last year a teenager was stabbed to death with a 25in (63cm) Zombie Killer machete in a north London park. After being contacted by journalists, Hunters Knives and Swords changed its website to say the items were out of stock. The company, based in Oldham, Greater Manchester, was described as irresponsible by the West Midlands police and crime commissioner, David Jamieson, who was instrumental in implementing the ban. “Promoting these pointless knives is irresponsible and flies in the face of what we are trying to achieve with this ban,” he said. “‘Zombie knives’ are monstrous weapons that serve no practical use whatsoever. They are being banned because they are dangerous and companies should act responsibly. They are not your average kitchen knife or garden tool: they are pointless, OTT [over the top] weapons that glamorise violence with names such as Head Splitter and Death Dagger. After a year of campaigning by my office, I am glad they are finally being banned.” Ch Con Alf Hitchcock, the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for knife-enabled crime, said: “‘Zombie knives’ are absolutely horrific weapons. Forces are determined to reduce the harm caused by these and all other dangerous weapons. “There is no place for knife crime within society and this ban is further commitment to keeping communities safe.” Ministers launched a crackdown on the blades, with the Home Office minister Sarah Newton saying: “This government will act wherever necessary to cut crime and keep our communities safe. Zombie killer knives glamorise violence and cause devastating damage – they have no place whatsoever in our society.” Figures show police are recording rising numbers of knife-related crimes. In the year ending in March, police logged 28,664 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument, a 10% jump compared with the previous 12 months."
2016-08-16T11:44:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Man dies in collision with Nottingham tram,"A man has died in a collision with a moving tram in Nottingham. Police were called to the David Lane tram stop and the Basford crossing in the north of the city at about 11.10pm on Monday. The man, who was in his 50s, died at the scene. The police said the full circumstances had not yet been established, but the death was not believed to be suspicious. A spokesman for Nottingham Express Transit said: “We can confirm a tram was involved in a fatal collision with a man between Basford and David Lane. The incident happened shortly before 11pm last night and emergency services were called to the scene. “Late-night services were disrupted as a result of the incident and the police have launched an investigation. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch have been informed and we are not able to make any further comment at this stage.” Although trams are considered green and safe, research by the Dutch Institute for Road Safety Research suggested that for each kilometre travelled, trams were 12 times more likely than a car to be involved in an accident resulting in a fatality or serious injury. Nottingham has 20 miles of tramway. The first section opened in 2004 and a second section, which more than doubled the size of the network, opened in August 2015."
2016-08-16T12:53:57Z,uk-news,UK news,"Amputee war veteran, 96, to join Jo Cox charity cycle ride","A second world war veteran who lost a leg below the knee will join a five-day cycle ride to commemorate the late MP Jo Cox and raise money for her charities. Franklin Medhurst, 96, will ride a special recumbent tricycle for the start of the event, called The Jo Cox Way, a 260-mile ride from Cox’s constituency in Birstall, West Yorkshire, to the House of Commons in London. Medhurst joins a group that includes the MP’s sister, Kim Leadbeater, and Brian Robinson, 85, from Mirfield in West Yorkshire, who in 1955 became the first Briton to finish the Tour de France. Medhurst, who completed six years of service in the RAF, is also known for a letter he wrote to the Guardian before the EU referendum that championed the peace and stability he said the union had brought to the continent. His letter went viral and was shared by thousands of people including Cox, just before she was killed. Other backers included the Labour MP Dan Jarvis, who said that as a veteran, Medhurst knew what was at stake.
The cyclists will set off from Princess Mary stadium in Cleckheaton at 10am on Wednesday and arrive in Westminster on Sunday 21 August, stopping off at different towns along the way. They will visit thriving community projects the public have nominated to highlight neighbourhood collaborations that have had a positive effect on people and their environments. Cyclists are encouraged to join the group for the entirety of the journey or just ride part of the way as the group passes through their local area. “It would be just excellent to share the ride and obtain encouragement from those in the UK that wish to ensure that Jo’s values take further seed and truly blossom,” the Facebook group for the event states. The Jo Cox Way was organised by Sarfraz Mian, the chief executive officer of the equestrian company Neue Schule, based in North Yorkshire. Mian said he was inspired to start the initiative after hearing negative stories about the country after the vote to leave the EU, particularly news regarding divisions within communities. He said: “I, like many people around the UK, was very disturbed by the discussion that went on in the Brexit debate. It started off at a reasonable temperature and just got hotter and more polarising. The language being used was setting people and communities against one another.
“Then we had the tragedy … I hadn’t previously known about Jo, I’m not hugely political, but what came across loud and clear in the following days was her personality. More importantly, the superb principles she held and her values really struck a chord with me and so many people around the world, the fact that communities are dependent on each other, we are much stronger when people are working together.” He added: “I really didn’t think the country was as bad as the divisions being portrayed, yes there were differences of opinion but so much of what was making the headlines was that people were against other people. I fundamentally don’t think that is the case. I actually think the reality is that you might have a very vocal minority that can articulate themselves and make their presence known but the majority of people actually get on and are doing all sorts of remarkable projects up and down the country.” Mian said he wanted to travel down the country carrying the positive message, and that having others embrace the idea and participate inspired hope. “I just felt compelled. It’s not that I’m a great cyclist, I’m the opposite, and it will be tough. But I absolutely didn’t think I was alone in these sentiments,” he said. “I think someone like Franklin taking part gives hope, he is somebody who gave up six years of his life for this country during the war and even at this point in time in his life, when you could completely forgive him for being focused on himself, what he’s actually doing is saying: ‘Look, I have a wealth of experience and nothing to lose from offering my insight.’ “I’ve had a couple of very good discussions with Franklin and he is, even at 96, so enthusiastic at supporting communities and ensuring that the things that Jo was working hard to try and achieve are maintained.”"
2016-08-16T14:03:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Man dies after West Yorkshire dog attack,"A man has died after being attacked by a dog which police returned to its owner last week despite concerns it was dangerous. West Yorkshire police were called to a house in the Sheepridge area of Huddersfield at 9.48am on Monday, where they found the 52-year-old victim, David Ellam. The man was treated by paramedics and taken to Huddersfield Royal infirmary, where he was pronounced dead at 9pm. Police seized the dog, a female bull terrier, in June following complaints from members of the public that it was dangerous. It was determined the animal was not a pit bull terrier, a breed banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act, and it was returned to its owner on 8 August. The dog’s owner, a 29-year-old man who is thought to be the victim’s neighbour, was arrested in connection with the incident and has been released on police bail pending further inquiries. His dog has been detained in police kennels. A referral has been made to the Independent Police Complaints Commission about the incident, and it is deciding whether or not to launch an investigation into the decision to return the dog to its owner. DCI Mark Swift of West Yorkshire police’s homicide and major inquiry team, who is leading the investigation, said: “Clearly our thoughts go out to the family at this tragic time. They are understandably devastated by what has happened and are being supported by specially trained officers. “Our investigation is continuing. We believe that the victim was out with his own dog at the time of the attack near to his home address on Riddings Road. His dog, a Yorkshire terrier, was also injured during the incident and received emergency veterinary care.” Neighbours told the Huddersfield Examiner they heard screams and attempted to throw the victim a kitchen knife to fend off the animal. They said the victim had been trying to protect his own dog and was left unconscious and bleeding. Upon arrival at the scene, a police officer fought the dog off the victim using a fire extinguisher. Under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act, pit bull terriers, Japanese tosas, dogo argentinos and fila brasileiros are banned from the UK unless the owner has been given a special court exemption. Dogs that have received an exemption must be muzzled, kept on a lead in public, neutered, tattooed and have a microchip implant. Dangerous dogs are classified by type rather than breed, so whether or not an animal falls under the legislation depends on its characteristics as judged by the authorities. Pit bull terriers were initially bred as fighting dogs by breeding bulldogs and terriers to produce a dog that was both agile and strong. This article was amended on 17 August 2016. A picture was removed of an English bull terrier, which is not the breed of dog involved in the attack."
2016-08-16T14:32:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Anjem Choudary convicted of supporting Islamic State,"Anjem Choudary, one of the most notorious hate preachers living in Britain, is facing jail after being found guilty of supporting Islamic State. Having avoided arrest for years despite his apparent sympathy for extremism and links to some of Britain’s most notorious terrorists, Choudary was convicted at the Old Bailey after jurors heard he had sworn an oath of allegiance to Isis. The 49-year-old, who has links to one of Lee Rigby’s killers, Michael Adebolajo, and the Islamist militant Omar Bakri Muhammad, also urged followers to support Isis in a series of talks broadcast on YouTube.
Choudary and his co-defendant, Mohammed Rahman, 33, told their supporters to obey Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Isis leader, who is also known as a caliph, and travel to Syria to support Isis or “the caliphate”, the court heard. They were convicted in July but details of the trial, including the verdict, could not be reported until now. Choudary and Rahman face up to 10 years in jail for inviting support for a proscribed organisation. They will be sentenced on 6 September at the Old Bailey. Commander Dean Haydon, head of the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command, said: “These men have stayed just within the law for many years, but there is no one within the counter-terrorism world that has any doubts of the influence that they have had, the hate they have spread and the people that they have encouraged to join terrorist organisations. “Over and over again we have seen people on trial for the most serious offences who have attended lectures or speeches given by these men. The oath of allegiance was a turning point for the police – at last we had the evidence that they had stepped over the line and we could prove they supported Isis.” Haydon said 20 years’ worth of material was considered in the investigation, with 333 electronic devices containing 12.1 terabytes of storage data assessed. It can now also be revealed that Choudary was encouraged to support Isis by a notorious British Isis fighter who fled to Syria while on police bail. The court heard that shortly after Isis was proscribed as a terror group Choudary was in contact with an individual named as Subject A. It can now be revealed Subject A was Siddartha Dhar – known on social media as Abu Rumaysah – who was arrested alongside Choudary before he fled to Syria to fight with Isis while on police bail. Dhar encouraged Choudary to express support for Isis on social media. Following on from Dhar’s encouragement, both defendants made their position on the newly declared caliphate clear in the “oath of allegiance”.Prosecutor Richard Whittam QC said: “The prosecution case is that whichever name is used, the evidence is quite clear: when these defendants were inviting support for an Islamic state or caliphate they were referring to the one declared in Syria and its environs by Ibrahim [Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi at the end of June 2014. “Terrorist organisations thrive and grow because people support them and that is what this case is about. Do not confuse that with the right of people to follow the religion of their choice or to proclaim support for a caliphate.” Choudary, who has a long history with groups involved in radical Islamist demonstrations, such as the now-banned al-Muhajiroun and Islam4UK, denied he was inviting support for Isis and claimed to be a “lecturer in sharia law” giving “the Islamic perspective”. He began studying sharia law under Syrian-born Bakri Muhammad, a Salafi Islamist militant leader who formed al-Muhajiroun with the aim of promoting sharia in the 1990s, the court heard. Bakri Muhammad fled to Lebanon in 2005, where he was joined by Choudary for about 10 weeks. Bakri Muhammad was ultimately jailed in Lebanon for terror offences.
Choudary admitted he was media spokesman for Islam4UK during a time in which the controversial group put out “incendiary statements” calling for Buckingham Palace to be turned into a mosque and Nelson’s Column to be destroyed. On the ninth anniversary of the London terror attacks – 7 July 2014 – Choudary and Rahman posted an oath of allegiance online under their kunyas or Islamic names, Abu Luqman, used by Choudary, and Abu Baraa, used by Rahman, on an extremist website. Between August and September 2014, Choudary and Rahman posted speeches on YouTube encouraging support for Isis. An audio clip, lasting one hour and six minutes and uploaded to Choudary’s YouTube channel on 9 September 2014, was played to jurors. Titled How Muslims Assess the Legitimacy of the Caliphate, the speech was played over the image of a map of northern Africa, the Middle East, north-west Asia and southern Europe. Choudary begins by setting out his views about the requirements of a legitimate Islamic caliphate, then explains why he sees Islamic State as meeting the criteria. “The lesson from this narration is that obedience to the caliph is an obligation, if they rule by the sharia. And to obey them obviously means they must be established,” Choudary said. He added: “I would just say, uh you know, for people who want to live under sharia law, obviously this is a great thing, and for those people who say we are promoting Isis, they are not even called Isis any more. Rather, you have an Islamic state where you have millions of people who are governed by the sharia law and I don’t think it is against the law to go and live there and want to abide by sharia law.” The prosecution also played an older lecture given by Choudary in March 2013, which did not form part of the charge but was provided to the jury for background.
In the lecture, titled Duties of the Khilafah State, Choudary makes clear his desire for the establishment of a caliphate as well as his support for the military action of Islamic State. He said: “That is why the kuffar [non-believers] are worried, my dear Muslims. When the Muslims of the subcontinent gather together. When the Taliban inshallah [God willing] and the mujahideen take Afghanistan and then declare jihad against the mourtad of Zardini and his army of tawaghit, and when they annex and take India and they take Bangladesh and they take Indonesia, you have over a billion Muslims in the area. “We don’t have any borders, my dear Muslims. It is about time we resumed conquering for the sake of Allah. “Next time when your child is at school and the teacher says ‘what do you want when you grow up, what is your ambition?’, they should say to dominate the whole world by Islam, including Britain, that is my ambition.” The prosecution told the court that the defendants were “acutely aware” of the potential criminal implications of being overt in their support for Isis. Whittam told the court: “The prosecution alleges that this led to great care in the way in which the defendants expressed themselves publicly, particularly after Isil was proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the home secretary.” Choudary also took to social media to express support for Isis, the court heard. In late July 2014, he engaged in a series of messages with others as to the authority for the declaration of Eid (the Islamic festival) coming from “the office of the Islamic State”. Born in north London, he initially studied medicine at Barts medical school before changing courses and enrolling at Guildford College of Law. He opened his own solicitor’s practice in his late 20s but told the court that by that point he had become religious and his beliefs did not sit easily with certain aspects of the law. Sue Hemming, Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) head of counter terrorism, said: “These two men knowingly sought to legitimise a terrorist organisation and encouraged others to support it. They used the power of social media to attempt to influence those who are susceptible to these types of messages, which might include the young or vulnerable. “Both men were fully aware that Daesh is a proscribed terrorist group, the brutal activities they are carrying out and that what they were doing was illegal. Terrorism can have no place in our society and those that encourage others to join such organisations will be prosecuted.” British Muslims had complained about the media attention paid to Choudary and the impression sometimes given to audiences that he was representative of British Islamic thought. Miqdaad Versi, of the Muslim Council of Britain, told the Guardian: “Mr Anjem Choudary has long been condemned by Muslim organisations and Muslims across the country, who consider him and his support for Daesh [Isis] to be despicable and contrary to the values of Islam and our nation. “Many Muslims have long been puzzled why this man was regularly approached by the media to give outrageous statements that inflamed Islamophobia. We hope the judgment serves as a lesson for anyone who follows this path of advocating hate and division.”"
2016-08-16T14:53:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Anjem Choudary: a hate preacher who spread terror in UK and Europe,"For years Anjem Choudary deflected claims that his words and actions were designed to push his followers into terrorism by claiming he believed in a “covenant of security”; that meant because Britain gave a home to Muslims, it should not be the target of violent jihad.
But the fact is that again and again, people connected to him and his Islamist groups became involved in terrorism. The sheer weight of that pattern, involving 100 people in Britain alone, points to this being not a coincidence but a deliberate aim. The lifting of legal restrictions on Tuesday means the public can be told of his conviction for encouraging support for Islamic State. Choudary and his co-defendant, Mohammed Rahman, 33, were convicted in July but details of the trial, including the verdict, could not be reported until now. It comes after years of widespread bafflement as to how he avoided going to jail for terrorism offences. The view that Choudary played a pernicious role in funneling people towards terrorism has remarkable levels of agreement across the political and religious spectrum. It is shared by intelligence agencies across Europe, with one saying his groups had a sometimes “explicitly violent ideology”. But it is also shared by groups on the political left and right, as well as moderate Muslims. Even some alleged extremist Muslim figures in Britain privately say they suspected all along that Choudary was pushing young Muslims towards terrorism, and were suspicious when he was not stopped.
Choudary first came to prominence as a spokesman for al-Muhajiroun. It was set up by Omar Bakri Muhammad, the “Tottenham Ayatollah”, and Choudary has proudly described himself as a student of Bakri Muhammad. Bakri Muhammad set up al-Muhajiroun (“the emigrants”) after he was fired in 1996 as the leader of the UK branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir (Party of Liberation), which he had turned into Britain’s fastest-growing Muslim group with his anti-Israeli, anti-homosexual, anti-liberal rhetoric. He was ousted when Hizb ut-Tahrir’s Middle Eastern leadership decided he was too extreme. By 2005 at the latest, the authorities in the UK had information showing al-Muhajiroun’s willingness to support jihad, according to documents seen by the Guardian. In a sworn statement, the terrorist-turned-supergrass Mohammed Junaid Babar said Bakri Muhammad had funded jihad and was willing to do so again. Babar attended a terrorist training camp in Pakistan with Mohammad Sidique Khan, the ringleader of the London suicide bombings on 7 July 2005. In a statement made after his arrest, Babar described events in 2001-02 as a group of jihadis and associates plotted an attack in Britain: “Around the same time Omar Bakri had given money to [name of suspect] for the jihad.” That money was used to fund those in Afghanistan fighting western forces. Bakri Muhammad also agreed on another occasion to give money for jihad.
Babar’s statement emerged during the UK investigation into a plot to bomb targets such as the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent. A number of the plotters had al-Muhajiroun links. Al-Muhajiroun was disbanded in 2004 before it could be legally banned and Bakri Muhammad left Britain. It re-emerged as a new group, frequently changing its name after being re-proscribed, with Choudary in effect its leader, in regular contact with Bakri Muhammad. Choudary courted publicity and controversy, making frequent media appearances, and managed to evade prosecution. In 2015, just before his arrest, Choudary claimed he was merely engaged in a “verbal jihad”. Questioned by America’s CBS News, Choudary used an argument he had relied on over the years to rebut claims that he was a terrorist menace. He said: “There was a report out recently which said that I inspired 500 people, in fact, to carry out operations here and abroad. And if that were really the case, don’t you think that I’d be arrested and I’d be sitting in prison?” He was on television so much he even has his own listing on the actor database IMDb. In the Muslim community, several sources said the view on the street was that Choudary was a spy or informant. One figure said: “Other people got banged up and nothing ever happened to this guy.” “He is a very clever individual,” said Commander Dean Haydon, the head of counter-terrorism at Scotland Yard, who denied Choudary had been allowed to remain active for the purposes of gathering intelligence, saying police would have leapt at the chance to prosecute: “If we had the evidence we would have done.” Some took matters into their own hands. There was even a secret British Muslim effort to entice some of his followers away. Some of those who left gave an insight into the style and content of his message. Two sources with knowledge of al-Muhajiroun recruits said Choudary would never, even in private, break the law by directly urging the carrying out of a specific terrorist act. His statements in public enticed those attracted by the idea of violent extremism. Then in private, sermons and lectures pointed them in the direction of violent jihad. He said Islam not only permitted violence but commanded it. With recruits ideologically primed, they were let loose. Again and again, people who joined his groups, attended the lectures and accepted his worldview went on to be involved in terrorism. Perhaps the best known example is Michael Adebolajo, who in May 2013 led an accomplice in the hacking to death of the soldier Lee Rigby on a London street. Adebolajo was a convert who learned his understanding of Islam from Choudary and his acolytes. “He was on our ideological wavelength,” said Choudary, days after the attack.
Adebolajo was a regular at the al-Muhajiroun stall on Woolwich High Street, handing out extremist literature. He attended meetings and demonstrations run by al-Muhajiroun and successor groups for at least five years, from around 2005 to 2011, during which he heard an extremist interpretation of Islam. Bakri Muhammad, talking to the Guardian days after Rigby’s murder horrified Britain, seemed to be verging on bragging. He said Adebolajo received special attention as a new convert: “In 2004 Muslims were feeling a lot of pressures from new laws and from Iraq.” Adebolajo asked the group when violence could be justified. “He asked these type of questions, like many others,” said Bakri Muhammad. “He was asking what to do, he was most likely affected by the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan.” Also tied to Choudary’s extremist groups was Brusthom Ziamani, who said he was en route to behead a soldier when he was arrested on a London street in 2014 carrying a knife and hammer in his bag. Ziamani, 19 when convicted, said he had been inspired by the killers of Rigby, describing one of them as “a legend”. He had been radicalised by members of al-Muhajiroun and the trial judge told the convert he had been “adopted and totally absorbed by a twisted interpretation of the holy Qur’an”. Members of al-Muhajiroun gave him clothes and a place to stay after he was asked to leave home by his parents. Ziamani in turn attended their talks and joined al-Muhajiroun’s demonstrations.
This year two men, again linked to al-Muhajiroun and its successor groups, were jailed for plotting to kill a soldier. Junead Khan, 25, used his job with a pharmaceutical firm as cover to scout US Air Force bases in East Anglia to plan an attack on military personnel. He was also convicted alongside his uncle Shazib Khan, 23, of preparing to go to Syria to join Isis. The judge in their trial said both men had been radicalised by al-Muhajiroun. As well as plots against the UK, members travelled to join Isis in Syria. Siddhartha Dhar, a convert from Hinduism who was close to Choudary, went to Syria and produced a recruitment pamphlet for Isis called A Brief Guide to the Islamic State. But away from Britain, Choudary is also tied to the spread of the message of violent jihad. In Belgium, which is coping with the aftermath of fatal terrorist attacks and fears more in future, Choudary helped set up Sharia4Belgium. In 2015 it was declared a terrorist group and 45 of its followers were charged. Thirty-six of them were absent for their trial and were believed to be fighting in Syria or to be dead on the battlefield. All bar one was convicted and Choudary’s response to the jailing of its leader for 15 years was to laud him as a hero. According to Europol, Sharia4Belgium “engaged in organised indoctrination and recruitment of young people to participate in the armed conflict in Syria”. Choudary’s influence in Europe was such that the Dutch intelligence agency AIVD assessed him to be a key influence in the spread of the country’s jihadi movement. A spokesperson for AIVD told the Guardian it still stands by its assessment of Choudary’s central role, set out in a 2014 document: “Since the 1980s the UK has harboured an active Islamist movement propagating an antidemocratic, intolerant and sometimes explicitly violent ideology. “At its heart is the now banned group Islam4UK, previously known as Al-Muhajiroun, al-Ghurabaa and Muslims Against Crusades. Its most familiar faces are Omar Bakri (currently resident in Lebanon) and Anjem Choudary, who acts as its spokesman. Modelling itself closely on this British movement, Sharia4Belgium was active in Belgium for several years but subsequently disbanded itself in a blaze of publicity.” Not for the first time a European intelligence agency was raising questions about how Britain dealt with a key jihadi player. The case of Choudary has parallels with that of Abu Hamza. In this cleric’s case, France led the incredulity at Britain’s failure to stop his activities, with Hamza and the Finsbury Park mosque in north London he controlled being linked to numerous plots. Like Hamza, Choudary operated for years in plain sight, with some dismissing him as a clown.
The leftwing, anti-extremist group Hope Not Hate, which usually targets rightwing fascists, investigated Choudary and his groups because of the damage they inflicted in communities. Nick Lowles, of Hope Not Hate, said: “Although he was treated as a somewhat clown-like, go-to figure for the press as a rent-a-quote extremist, he clearly promoted the disgusting and divisive ideals of Islamic State, while dozens of his supporters have been connected to terrorist plots, violence or heading overseas to fight in Syria, Iraq and other conflicts.” In a report on Choudary called Cheerleading for Islamic State, Hope Not Hate said: “While Syria and the Islamic State has been the most recent target for [al-Muhajiroun] activists, the organisation and its network has a long history of being a conduit through which jihadists have been funnelled to various war zones.” Lowles added: “In the six months following the creation of Islamic State, Choudary was its biggest cheerleader in the English-speaking world and the network he helped create became the largest recruiter for IS in Europe.”
One expert in counter-radicalisation said Choudary was useful for Isis in the early days, when it was looking to gain traction in the UK. But the likes of him are now needed barely at all because Isis’s reputation in jihadi circles and its online machine has grown so much. “They don’t need a middle man,” said the expert, who has knowledge of cases where those who attended Choudary’s lectures now bitterly resent ever becoming involved with him. Scotland Yard’s Haydon said of al-Muhajiroun: “It has been a force for the radicalisation and recruitment of both extremists and terrorists here in the UK.” The police chief added that Choudary was a “key individual in the UK”, enticing people to join Isis in Syria by posting vast amounts of material online that radicalised them. British Muslims had complained about the media attention paid to Choudary, the impression given to audiences that he was representative of British Islamic thought. Miqdaad Versi, of the Muslim Council of Britain, said on Tuesday: “Mr Anjem Choudary has long been condemned by Muslim organisations and Muslims across the country, who consider him and his support for Daesh [Isis] to be despicable and contrary to the values of Islam and our nation. Many Muslims have long been puzzled why this man was regularly approached by the media to give outrageous statements that inflamed Islamophobia. We hope the judgment serves as a lesson for anyone who follows this path of advocating hate and division.” His case, and the brazen nature of it, raises issues about the UK’s terrorism laws: do we need yet more, or to learn to better use the plethora we have already? During his trial Choudary seemed relaxed, chatting to one journalist as if at a garden party: “How long have we known each other? Twenty years?”, with a shy and uncertain smile coming across his face. “He was always a bit loopy,” says one long-term Muslim acquaintance of Choudary. But he got more extreme in the last 15 years: “He fell off the edge and got worse and worse.” It has been quite a journey for the son of a market trader who grew up in south-east London and went to Southampton University, where he was nicknamed “Andy” and knocked back pints in the student bar. He gained a law degree and worked at the Commission for Racial Equality for a while but left as he became increasingly consumed by Islamism. The married father-of-four spent his time propagating violent extremism without any income other than state welfare payments. As Choudary prepares for a long jail sentence there is a bitter reality for those trying to combat violent jihad. In his own malevolent terms, the number of people Choudary helped recruit to terrorism and the fact he did it under their noses represents a victory for his cause, and an added challenge to those whose values oppose it."
2016-08-16T16:24:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Southern and Thameslink station staff vote in favour of strikes,"Further strikes loom on Southern after station staff across the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise voted for industrial action over ticket office closures. The RMT union confirmed a 70% vote in favour of a strike, while it said almost 80% of staff who voted backed industrial action short of a strike. However, with a turnout of around 40%, GTR questioned the mandate for action. A spokesman said: “We note that only one in four (26.9%) voted for strike action, with more than half of RMT station staff members ignoring the ballot. “While disappointed we urge the union to stop this dispute and save our passengers and staff further pain by becoming part of the solution rather than the problem.” GTR said the impact of a possible strike was unclear, but it could compound the misery of commuters who have had timetables slashed and have suffered high levels of delays and cancellations, and on Tuesday found out their fares would rise by a further 1.9% in January. GTR, the company that runs Southern as well as Thameslink and Great Northern trains, is proposing to close ticket offices or cut their hours at 83 stations, while reorganising staff to create a new position of “Station Host”. The union fears that the changes will involve the loss of more than 100 jobs. RMT assistant general secretary Steve Hedley said: “The Govia Thameslink franchise is in meltdown and not fit for purpose. Not content with axing catering services, closing ticket offices and attacking the role of their guards they now want to threaten 130 station jobs and compromise the safety of both their passengers and staff alike.
“These plans fly in the face of the response from the thousands of passengers who objected to the closure of ticket offices and the de-staffing of stations as Govia drives on with plans for a faceless railway where the public are left to fend for themselves on rammed-out, dangerous and unreliable services.” The union’s executive will consider whether and when to call a strike. On Monday, talks at Acas broke down between GTR and the RMT in a parallel, long-running dispute over the role of conductors on Southern trains. Commuter services in Greater London and through Surrey, Sussex to the south coast have been decimated by strikes and staff shortages. Train drivers on Southern rail could also go on strike in September. The result of a ballot from their union, Aslef, is expected at the end of this month. Campaigners and local MPs have demanded a fares freeze for Southern passengers. Green MP Caroline Lucas, many of whose Brighton constituents rely on Southern trains, said the anticipated 1.9% rise was “particularly galling for commuters who have suffered appallingly poor service at the hands of Southern rail”. Meanwhile, the RMT has announced it has suspended strike action on Virgin Trains East Coast that was due to take place over the Bank Holiday weekend. The union said that while all issues over onboard crew and jobs had not been resolved, it was calling off the strike for now due to “significant progress” in talks."
2016-08-16T17:14:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Revealed: how Anjem Choudary influenced at least 100 British jihadis,"Anjem Choudary and his extremist groups are believed to have motivated at least 100 people from Britain to pursue terrorism, including organisations committed to campaigns of murder against the west, the Guardian has learned. Choudary avoided serious criminal charges for years, but his own conviction for terrorism, agreed unanimously by an Old Bailey jury in July, can now be reported after legal restrictions were lifted. Documents from intelligence sources say his groups were at the heart of the Islamist movement in Britain, which has been left facing a “severe” threat of jihadi attack.
Choudary and an acolyte, Mohammed Rahman, were convicted after they urged support for Islamic State and pledged allegiance to the group.
The conviction represents only a fraction of the jihadi mayhem to which the lawyer is linked. People connected to Choudary and his groups who turned to terrorism include Michael Adebolajo, one of the men who murdered the soldier Lee Rigby on a London street in 2013. He is also linked to foiled plots to kill in the UK over a decade ago, youngsters who have fled to join Isis in Syria, leaving their families distraught, and the alleged inspiration of violence across Europe. Choudary and his co-defendant, Mohammed Rahman, 33, told their supporters to obey Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Isis leader, who is also known as a caliph, and travel to Syria to support Isis or “the caliphate”. On the ninth anniversary of the London terror attacks – 7 July 2014 – Choudary and Rahman posted an oath of allegiance online under their kunyas or Islamic names, Abu Luqman, used by Choudary, and Abu Baraa, used by Rahman, on an extremist website.
Choudary was a key figure for a succession of extremist Islamist groups. He was dismissed as a clown by some, while helping motivate youngsters to turn to terrorism in Britain and Europe, and enjoyed frequent media appearances. He was a key figure in al-Muhajiroun before it was banned under terrorism legislation and relaunched itself as al-Ghurabaa, which again was banned under terrorism laws. Successor groups in turn were banned under terrorism legislation, such as Islam4Uk and Muslims Against Crusades. Commander Dean Haydon, the head of Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command, said his team had trawled through 20 years of Choudary’s statements to build the case against him. Haydon denied the extremist had been “allowed to run” so intelligence could be gained on the aspirant jihadis he attracted. Haydon said of Choudary and Rahman: “These men have stayed just within the law for many years, but there is no one within the counter-terrorism world that has any doubts of the influence that they have had, the hate they have spread and the people that they have encouraged to join terrorist organisations. “Over and over again we have seen people on trial for the most serious offences who have attended lectures or speeches given by these men.” A conservative estimate is that no less than 100 people from Britain linked to Choudary or his groups have fought or supported violent jihad, according to counter-terrorism sources. The figures were supported by a leftwing anti-extremism group that has studied the influence of al-Muhajiroun and its successor groups. That number increases on taking into account those in Europe who joined organisations such as Isis after being involved with extremist groups Choudary helped establish or influence, such as in Belgium and the Netherlands. Choudary’s influence in Europe was such that the Dutch intelligence agency AIVD assessed him to be a key influence in the spread of the jihadi movement in the Netherlands. A spokesperson for AIVD said it stood by its assessment of Choudary’s central role in the UK first, and then Europe, set out in a 2014 document: “Since the 1980s the UK has harboured an active Islamist movement propagating an anti-democratic, intolerant and sometimes explicitly violent ideology. “At its heart is the now banned group Islam4UK, previously known as al-Muhajiroun, al-Ghurabaa and Muslims Against Crusades. Its most familiar faces are Omar Bakri (currently resident in Lebanon) and Anjem Choudary, who acts as its spokesman. Modelling itself closely on this British movement, Sharia4Belgium was active in Belgium for several years …” The spokesperson for Dutch intelligence added that the fact Choudary operated publicly and could “step out of the shadows and into light” was an inspiration for others to do the same.
In Belgium, which is coping with the aftermath of terrorist attacks in March and fearing more to come, Choudary helped set up Sharia4Belgium. According to the European law enforcement agency Europol, Sharia4Belgium “engaged in organised indoctrination and recruitment of young people to participate in the armed conflict in Syria”. Choudary praised its leader after more than 40 of its members were convicted of terrorism. The groups Choudary led were “the single biggest gateway to terrorism in recent British history”, says one study on his activities, details of which are published here for the first time, from the leftwing group Hope Not Hate. It said: “Over the last 15 years he has influenced and inspired over 100 Britons who have carried out or attempted to carry out terrorist attacks at home and abroad.” According to research from Hope Not Hate, supported by a counter-radicalisation expert who has worked with al-Muhajiroun members, Choudary helped Isis gain British recruits. Hope Not Hate said: “In the six months following the creation of the Islamic State, Choudary was its biggest cheerleader in the English-speaking world and the network he helped create became the largest recruiter for IS in Europe.” Choudary’s ability to operate in plain sight, seemingly without legal sanction, raises many questions. Sources in Britain’s Muslim community say Choudary was reported to the police, with some in the UK’s Islamic communities left baffled about how he remained untouched for so long. Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command had previously attempted to build criminal cases against Choudary, only to be rebuffed by the Crown Prosecution Service, which judged there was insufficient chance of gaining a conviction. Haydon said of the conviction reported for the first time: “The oath of allegiance [made by Choudary to Isis] was a turning point for the police. At last we had the evidence that they had stepped over the line and we could prove they supported Isis.” Between August and September 2014, Choudary and Rahman posted speeches on YouTube encouraging support for Isis. An audio clip, lasting one hour and six minutes and uploaded to Choudary’s YouTube channel on 9 September 2014, was played to jurors. Titled How Muslims Assess the Legitimacy of the Caliphate, the speech was played over the image of a map of northern Africa, the Middle East, north-west Asia and southern Europe. Choudary begins by setting out his views about the requirements of a legitimate Islamic caliphate, then explains why he sees Islamic State as meeting the criteria. “The lesson from this narration is that obedience to the caliph is an obligation, if they rule by the sharia. And to obey them obviously means they must be established,” Choudary said. Estimates of how many people Choudary funnelled into violence range from 100 to 500. Hannah Stuart, of the Henry Jackson Society thinktank, said: “A quarter of all individuals convicted of Islamism-inspired terrorism and terrorism-related offences in the UK since 1999 had direct links with al-Muhajiroun (or its aliases), through public membership, al-Muhajiroun-linked activism or regular attendance at lectures and protests. One in 10 offenders had a proven personal relationship with Choudary in particular.” British Muslims had complained about the media attention paid to Choudary and the impression given to audiences that he was representative of British Islamic thought. Miqdaad Versi, of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: “Mr Anjem Choudary has long been condemned by Muslim organisations and Muslims across the country, who consider him and his support for Daesh [Isis] to be despicable and contrary to the values of Islam and our nation. “Many Muslims have long been puzzled why this man was regularly approached by the media to give outrageous statements that inflamed Islamophobia. One expert in counter-radicalisation said Choudary was useful for Isis in the early days, when it was looking to gain traction in the UK. But the likes of him are now needed barely at all because Isis’s reputation in jihadi circles and its online machine has grown so much. “They don’t need a middle man,” said the expert. Choudary and Rahman will be sentenced next month and face a maximum of 10 years in prison. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said: “The successful conviction of Anjem Choudary and Mohammed Rahman is recognition of the tireless efforts of police and security agencies to keep the people of this country safe. “These dangerous individuals were recruiting sergeants for Daesh. They poisoned the minds of vulnerable people and their warped and twisted propaganda offered support and succour to a murderous and barbaric terrorist organisation. “The government is clear. We will continue to confront those who promote hate and threaten our way of life. Together we will protect communities against extremism and defeat this toxic ideology.”"
2016-08-16T17:40:00Z,uk-news,UK news,UK police watchdog to investigate use of spit hood on black man,"The police watchdog has said it is to investigate the use of a spit hood during the arrest of a young black man who was allegedly pinned to the ground by four police officers. British Transport police (BTP) received a complaint about the conduct of its officers after IK Aihie, 20, was detained at London Bridge station on 21 July at 11.30pm. Footage filmed by a witness shows Aihie screaming as police officers hold him on the ground and later place the so-called spit guard over his head. The hood is a full face covering used by police to prevent a suspect from spitting at arresting officers. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it is investigating Aihie’s arrest and will consider whether the use of force, the arrest and the method of restraint, including the use of a spit guard, were proportionate. Aihie said: “I hope there will now be a thorough investigation and I would ask any witnesses to my arrest to please contact the IPCC.” Aihie’s solicitor, Shamik Dutta at Bhatt Murphy, said: “It is imperative that all relevant evidence in this case is preserved without delay to ensure a robust inquiry into the officers’ conduct.” In the footage, Aihie’s girlfriend, Jessica McConkey, can be seen in distress in the clip, claiming the couple were having an argument and the police arrested him. Aihie was held in a cell overnight in Islington and released the next day without charge but he did accept a caution for an offence under section 5 of the Public Order Act. BTP said Aihie became “aggressive” after police intervened in the argument, and threatened to spit at the officers. The commissioner of the IPCC, Cindy Butts, said: “This incident has generated a great deal of concern and debate among the public following footage released on social media and therefore it is important we conduct an independent investigation to thoroughly examine what happened. “This will include considering whether this arrest and the use of this type of restraint was necessary in the circumstances. We have met with the man involved and we will be keeping him and all interested parties updated throughout the investigation.” In June, Sussex police were strongly criticised by the IPCC after an 11-year-old disabled girl was placed in a spit hood, handcuffed and detained in custody for more than 60 hours. The girl, known as Child H, suffers from a rare neurological disorder similar to autism that can cause sudden outbursts of anger.

Choudary avoided arrest for years despite his apparent sympathy for extremism and links to some of Britain’s most notorious terrorists, but was finally convicted in July of supporting Islamic State. The 49-year-old and his acolyte Mohammed Rahman, 33, now face up to 10 years in jail for inviting support for a proscribed organisation, but British authorities face questions as to why Choudary was able to teeter along the boundaries of legal acceptability for so long. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said the criminal law for tackling the likes of Choudary might need to be refined.
“I think this is a problem we’ve been wrestling with for 15 or 20 years, how to deal with someone who doesn’t actually themselves commit, prepare or instigate acts of terrorism but who helps create a climate in which extremist views are acceptable. “The criminal law has already moved in the terrorism field much further than in other areas. We have already these precursor offences. There was the one he was convicted for the other day: inviting support for a proscribed organisation. There’s also the offence of giving direct or indirect encouragement of terrorism or disseminating terrorist material. “These are useful offences, they’re being increasingly used, but one would have to admit that until now the law has barely touched Anjem Choudary. In the meantime a lot of people have been radicalised and, yes, we do need to look at what might be done if there are impediments, technical reasons why it’s not as easy to get convictions under these laws as it should be.” Anderson said it was “very difficult to craft a law that can clearly distinguish people who are dangerous from people who are simply revolting”. The government unveiled its new counter-extremism bill in the Queen’s speech in May. It contains numerous new powers, including the ability to ban “extremist” organisations, gag individuals and empower local councils to close premises used to “promote hatred”. “It may be we need to be more clever than we already are in assembling evidence that can be used in a criminal court,” Anderson said. “The way forward is refining the application of the criminal law.” Choudary and his extremist groups are believed to have motivated at least 100 people from Britain to pursue terrorism, including organisations committed to campaigns of murder against the west. He is also linked to foiled plots to kill in the UK over a decade ago, youngsters who have fled to join Isis in Syria, leaving their families distraught, and the alleged fuelling of violence across Europe. The former solicitor was central to a succession of extremist Islamist groups. He was a key figure in al-Muhajiroun before it was banned under terrorism legislation and relaunched itself as al-Ghurabaa, which was also banned under terrorism laws. Successor groups such as Islam4Uk and Muslims Against Crusades were in turn banned. Choudary and Rahman urged their supporters to obey Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Isis leader, who is also known as a caliph, and travel to Syria to support Isis or “the caliphate”. On the ninth anniversary of the London terror attacks – 7 July 2014 – Choudary and Rahman posted an oath of allegiance online under their kunyas or Islamic names, Abu Luqman and Abu Baraa respectively, on an extremist website. Robb Leech, who made the documentary My Brother the Terrorist in 2014 about his brother Richard Dart, who was convicted of preparing acts of terrorism, told the Today programme Choudary was like a “father figure” to his now imprisoned brother. “Anjem always denied he had anything to do with facilitating Richard’s plans to go and get training with the Taliban but he always fully admitted he was responsible for shaping his beliefs and his kind of Islamic understanding,” Leech said. “I suggested he was the one responsible for radicalisation and the brainwashing of Richard and others like him and his words, typically brazen, were ‘well maybe some brains need washing’, which I think is typical. It goes a long way to what he was all about.” Choudary and Rahman will be sentenced on 6 September at the Old Bailey."
2016-08-17T10:30:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan names deputy mayor for environment and energy,"Having marked his first 100 days as London mayor, Sadiq Khan has chosen his 101st to announce the appointment of a deputy mayor for environment and energy. Shirley Rodrigues, who is currently acting executive director for climate change at the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), a philanthropic organisation which operates in developing countries, has previously worked at City Hall on implementing London’s Low Emission Zone and programmes for retrofitting buildings. She is also former director of policy at the Sustainable Development Commission. She will immediately take the lead on finalising Khan’s proposals for tackling London’s poor air quality, for which a consultation has already been conducted. The consultation results are to be published in September, followed by two further, more detailed, stages addressing plans for an initial £10 a day emissions surcharge on polluting vehicles entering central London and the forthcoming Ultra Low Emission Zone as a whole. This is a policy area the mayor will be wanting to show continuing rapid progress on, particularly as it will take longer and, in some cases, be more difficult to demonstrate that he’s delivering on some of his other high profile manifesto pledges. Rodrigues’s appointment has been welcomed by Friends of the Earth’s Sophie Neuberg, who says it is “a strong signal that our environment is on the agenda at City Hall”. Rodrigues will also be responsible for setting up a not-for-profit company to be called Energy for Londoners aimed at helping the city boost its recycling rates and produce more of its own, low carbon energy. During the election campaign, Khan paid an enthusiastic visit to the Bunhill Energy Centre in Islington, which diverts heat generated by the London Underground to heat homes. His manifesto says Energy for Londoners will provide: A comprehensive range of energy services to to help Londoners generate more low carbon energy and increase their energy efficiency, support local and community energy enterprises, and buy clean energy generated across the city, using it to power GLA and TfL facilities. Plenty for Rodrigues, Khan’s latest senior female appointee, to be getting on with, then. Here’s a clip of her talking about her work for CIFF with the C40 Cities climate change group.
Sadiq Khan’s manifesto pledges for creating “a greener, cleaner London” are here."
2016-08-17T11:43:49Z,uk-news,UK news,"Hartley killer Katrina Walsh 'was like a puppet', says ex-husband","Considering the extreme lengths both women went to in order to carry out and conceal their crime, it did not take long for Sarah Williams and Katrina Walsh to sell each other out. However, on Wednesday, the jury at Preston crown court saw through their attempts at self-preservation by blaming each other and found both guilty of murdering Sadie Hartley, the long-term partner of Williams’s lover, Ian Johnston.
Though it was Williams who dealt the fatal blows, Walsh was judged to have been an equal part of the planning. Digging deeper into their dysfunctional friendship reveals a history of broken marriages, loneliness and vulnerability. Speaking exclusively to the Guardian, Walsh’s ex-husband Kevin recalls how the balance of power between the two women changed over time. At first, a 17-year-old Williams – “shy and affected” and with a lazy eye – started hanging around the stables where Walsh, then in her 30s, kept her horse. Williams would “muck out the stables for free horse rides” and soon caught the eye of David Hardwick, a married horse enthusiast 40 years her senior. It was the 1990s and Kevin and Katrina Walsh were married, happy and content. She was a freelance artist, he worked on a farm and they had a shared love of cycling and wildlife. “I loved her because of the way she was, the person she was, everything that we had in common,” recalls Kevin. “They were very happy years of marriage.”
An unlikely foursome emerged: the Walshes, Williams and her married “sugar-daddy” Hardwick – an entrepreneur and keen horseman – would go away together in his mobile horse box with sleeping accommodation. “We called it the ‘purple passion wagon’,” says Kevin. “The four of us would load the horses up and go off around north Wales, riding the horses around the mountains and beaches.” The nomadic, carefree lifestyle ended when Kevin Walsh had an affair, split with Katrina and moved to North Yorkshire, 150 miles away. They divorced in 2008. He claims they remained close friends and she attended his mother’s 80th birthday party. But he cannot hide the guilt he feels for what followed. “Once I left, the two women got a lot closer and they started going on holidays together, subsidised by Sarah. Kit [Katrina] is a very intelligent woman, but she can be a little away with the fairies sometimes. “Kit was lonely. She was ripe for being taken advantage of and was suffering from health problems after multiple falls off her bike and the horses.” He added: “They were friends because they had the horses in common. But there was nothing to suggest anything sinister.”
During these intervening years Katrina Walsh was drawn further into Williams’s exciting world, becoming so close that some friends thought the two women were a couple. The truth was Williams had become infatuated with Johnston after they met at the indoor ski slope Chill Factore in Manchester in 2012. In August 2015 Kevin received a text message from his estranged wife saying Williams wanted to meet him, he said. Williams then called him directly offering a job suiting his “particular key skill” but that she preferred to discuss it in person. “Alarm bells were going off in my head,” he recounts. “Whatever she wanted was something dodgy. After the conversation I thought, ‘Hang on, I have never trusted this girl, just walk away now.’ “I told Kit and she replied saying, ‘Yes, knowing Sarah it will be something nefarious.’” Later, Walsh’s diaries revealed that the idea was for Kevin to murder Johnston’s partner, Sadie Hartley, using his archery skills gained from Viking re-enactments.
Kevin confesses to being “baffled” by the details that emerged during the trial, particularly by his ex-wife’s meticulous notes that revealed she was not merely a naive patsy who had been framed and manipulated by Williams. “I don’t know how to think anymore,” Kevin says. “My only explanation for this bizarre behaviour is that Kit lives in a fantasy world sometimes and I can see her getting caught up in something that sounds like a game. “But, it is hard to believe that someone is so naive really. I thought she was frightened of Sarah and maybe slightly in awe of her. It used to be the other way round and Sarah was in awe of her, but things shifted over the past few years. “I can’t explain everything that has come out in court. I’m just totally baffled by what has happened. She has changed so much in the last few years. She has become a lot more vulnerable. “I still feel that Kit was like a puppet, but the fact that she tried to involve me in this has left me utterly staggered and I will never be able to explain her motives. I just have to believe that she was being manipulated otherwise I wouldn’t know how to deal with it.”"
2016-08-17T11:59:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Partner of murdered Sadie Hartley denies responsibility for her death,"The cheating partner of murdered businesswoman Sadie Hartley admitted that he was “weak and foolish” for having an affair with her killer – but claimed he was also a victim. In an emotional interview, Ian Johnston denied being partly culpable for Hartley’s death, despite sleeping with Sarah Williams behind her back. He said he was now homeless after Hartley’s family made him remove all of his belongings from her home shortly after her “barbaric” and “savage” murder.
Johnston revealed that after her murder he discovered he was not in her will and had been shocked by his treatment. He repeatedly suggested he was also a victim of the planned assassination which occurred after he embarked on an explicit sexual relationship with travel agent Williams. He told how he had been targeted by the murderer, as had Hartley, and had been flattered by the attention of a younger woman, but refused to admit any responsibility for the murder. Asked directly if he had loved Hartley, Johnston replied that he did, adding it was a “cocoa and Kindles” relationship that “comes from being nearly 60”, but then went on to say that she had not provided for him in her will. Johnston, 57, told how he had been pursued by Williams and described their relationship as “entertainment” and purely of a sexual nature. He claimed that he had repeatedly tried to end it with her but she was “persistent” and “persuasive”.
Johnston said he had not met Williams again after she wrote to Hartley to reveal the affair a year before she killed her. However, he continued to send his ex-mistress explicit messages in the days before the fatal stabbing and accepted he had been “foolish to send and respond to some texts”. “There’s obvious responsibility, because in its simplest terms if I’d never met Sarah Williams she wouldn’t have been in this position where she would go ahead and murder Sadie,” he said. “I’ll never know what her motivation for that is. She’s decided to do that, it’s very much her responsibility. “How I absolutely wish I’d never, ever met her,” added Johnston. “I didn’t for one minute feel, or have any inkling at all that any of this was being planned, and even if I had, I’ve been assured by the police there was nothing I could do to stop this.” Johnston, whose mother died a month before Hartley’s murder, said: “I was vulnerable and I think she took advantage of that.” Johnston denied he was a “villain” whose dishonest actions led to his partner’s death and also denied leading Williams on. “Oh, I should’ve had more sense. The remorse I feel, the abject horror of what’s happened and the consequences of me meeting her, I just will regret that forever.” During the seven-week trial, explicit details of Johnston’s affair with the killer of his partner were laid bare. Only hours after Hartley’s murder he told her business partner, Julie Taylor, “I’m homeless now, you know.” He also asked whether Hartley had altered her will. In awkward and emotionally charged exchanges with barristers at Preston crown court, it emerged that Johnston had continued having an intermittent sexual relationship with Williams, described as his “bit on the side”. On 4 January, 10 days before Hartley’s murder, 30 messages were exchanged between the pair. Johnston met Williams – whom he described as respectable, young and engaging – at the Chill Factore indoor ski slope in Manchester in December 2012 and, under the guise of giving her ski lessons, they swapped numbers. The lessons never took place and the pair embarked on an affair instead. But by October 2014, Johnston told how he had tried to end the affair as Williams had become “delusional”.
Johnston said he had been “aghast” at Williams’s denials and arrogance in the witness box, considering the overwhelming evidence. “I’m absolutely and utterly appalled at her lack of emotion while she gave evidence in front of Sadie’s children, Harry and Charlotte, and brothers and family and my family and friends. That there was no remorse whatsoever, no attempt to defend her position. “The day that that door shuts, she’s anonymous forever and the rest of us are just left wondering why the hell this had to happen.” Johnston said that since the murder he had been shunned by Hartley’s family and that he had “lost everything”, with him being given a day to collect his belongings from her home. “There’s been absolutely no contact with Sadie’s family from the minute they found out she was dead. OK, no contact. I found out I’m not in the will when the juror asked a question, was I in the will.” Breaking down in tears, Johnston said: “I’ve lost everything. Can you imagine? This eight months has just been the most horrendous, you just get a kicking every day and I want the kicking to stop now and I know it won’t for a while. “And if anybody wants to blame that on a few ridiculous, bloody texts then it’s just outrageous. There was nothing I could do to foresee or stop this. I wasn’t culpable in the death of Sadie.”"
2016-08-17T14:02:57Z,uk-news,UK news,TfL plan for cab drivers' written English test prompts outcry,"Transport for London’s plan to force would-be cabbies to pass a written English exam before they can work in in the city has triggered outrage among Uber drivers and campaign groups. The rules, which only apply to people from certain countries where English is not the first language, are due to come into force on 1 October. Campaigners say that while spoken English is important, a written test is unnecessary and discriminatory. “While people should have a skillset, including language skills necessary to do their jobs, mandating an arbitrarily high level, or requiring written skills in a largely verbal job, is discriminatory and counterproductive,” said Chai Patel, the legal and policy director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants.
The race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust said the requirements were too stringent. “We already have employment regulations that say skills, like speaking English, must be necessary to do the job. It is unclear why the new TfL test requirements for private hire drivers are higher than for bus or train drivers. “Employment requirements should be in line with the skills that are necessary to successfully fulfil the role. Anything else would be indirect discrimination.” About 3.45 million non-UK nationals work in Britain, according to quarterly figures from the Office for National Statistics, up 242,000 on last year. Uber drivers said some workers who speak English well but have limited written skills could lose their livelihoods. Muhammad Shah, 37, originally from Pakistan, said: “You don’t have to write a single word, so what’s the point? Some colleagues are supporting their families, but they fear they’ll lose their jobs … If you’re asking this for private hire, why not for builders or people working in cafes?” He said the written test requirement was proposed in June, giving drivers little time to study before the rules come into force. “You have to do it slow-slow. They can’t ask you to pass this test in one month. If they want to do them they have to give time.” Shah said it was unfair that the requirements applied to people from India and Pakistan, but not to those from a list of English-speaking countries including Jamaica, New Zealand and Australia. “If you are asking people to do an English course you have to ask everyone, not just some nationalities. Some people hold a British passport but don’t speak English,” he said. Indian-born Sandeep Kumar, 33, is a sales manager who drives for Uber as a second job to top up his income. He said colleagues could be prevented from working by the tests. “If you’re living in this country you have to speak English. The problem is the written test. I’ve got a Romanian friend who speaks very well, everything correct. We understand each other. But I know he might have trouble with the written test. If it’s your first job and you don’t pass, then there is no money coming into the house.”"
2016-08-17T14:06:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadie Hartley murder: two women jailed for act of 'barbaric savagery',"Two women have been jailed for life for murdering a businesswoman in a planned killing of “barbaric savagery”. Sarah Williams, 35, stood trial alongside her friend Katrina Walsh, 56, jointly accused of the murder of Sadie Hartley in January. Hartley, 60, a communications director, was paralysed with a stun gun and repeatedly stabbed by Williams, who had wanted to resume an affair with Hartley’s long-term partner, Ian Johnston, a former firefighter. Williams was sentenced to a minimum of 30 years and Walsh will serve at least 25 years. It took the jury seven hours and nine minutes to return a guilty verdict. Justice Turner said the two women, both from Chester, had murdered Hartley for their own “amusement”. He said: “Sarah Williams, over a period of about 18 months you plotted the murder of a woman whose only crime was to love the man you wanted for yourself. But let no one make the mistake of thinking that this was a crime of passion. It was a crime of obsession, of arrogance, of barbarity, but above all it was a crime of pure evil. And over that period of 18 months of scheming, you found in Katrina Walsh both a fellow spirit and enthusiastic participant.”
Hartley, who had answered the door to Williams, was left in a pool of blood in the hallway of her home, having suffered more than 40 stab wounds. Johnston, 57, who was away on a skiing trip at the time, was the object of desire for “jealous and obsessive” Williams, who wanted Hartley out of the way. During the seven-week trial at Preston crown court, the jury heard details of explicit texts sent between Williams, a travel agent, and Johnston just days before Hartley was murdered. The jury was told Williams recruited her friend Walsh, a horse riding instructor, to execute the “perfect murder”.
John McDermott QC, prosecuting, told the jury that police had recovered Walsh’s detailed diary chronicling the pair’s 18-month plan to murder Hartley in a plot akin “to the stuff of spy novels”.
The jury heard the pair travelled to Germany to buy the stun gun last December and, exactly a week before Hartley was murdered, Walsh delivered flowers to her door in a dry run for their plans. Williams was a “kept woman” supported by her wealthy “sugar daddy” boyfriend, married David Hardwick, 75, the court heard. She was said to have become infatuated with Johnston after they met at Chill Factore, an indoor ski slope in Manchester, in 2012. After their brief relationship had broken down, Johnston began a new life with Hartley, and the two of them began living together in Helmshore, Lancashire. But sex texts and explicit photographs continued to be exchanged between Johnston and Williams up to just days before the murder, the court heard.
The court heard that Johnston had ended his affair with Williams after she became “possessive and difficult” but that she continued to harbour a “delusional hope of a dream life with her ideal man” and spent 17 months plotting the murder of Hartley with Walsh. Johnston has denied he “led her on”, telling the jury the relationship was “just sex”, but Walsh told police Williams would do anything to be with him, even planting tracker devices on his car to follow his movements.
On 14 January, the day after her daughter’s engagement, Hartley was found dead in the hallway of her home, having been stabbed and slashed 40 times. A barb from the stun gun was found in her collar. As the unanimous guilty verdicts were read out, Williams briefly closed her eyes before composing herself as Johnston, and Hartley’s daughter, Charlotte, broke down in tears. A gasp was heard from the public gallery as the jury returned another guilty verdict for Walsh."
2016-08-17T17:00:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Two G4S police control room staff fired over 999 'test calls',"Two police control room staff have been fired following an investigation into claims they made hundreds of 999 calls at quiet times to improve their perceived performance. The workers, who were employed by G4S Public Services and worked for Lincolnshire police, were among five suspended as part of an inquiry into “test calls” earlier this year. Two G4S employees resigned while under investigation, the firm said. They quit before disciplinary hearings, which took place at the end of July. The fifth returned to work after being cleared of any wrongdoing. It had been claimed that the handlers made hundreds of illegitimate calls in October, November and December 2015 in order to meet their target of answering 92% of calls within 10 seconds or less. If the target is not met G4S is fined, and figures showed 724 calls were made across those three months. The five suspended officers were all former Lincolnshire police employees who transferred to G4S four years ago when the private security company took over a £200m contract – the largest ever – to run the force’s back-office services. G4S claimed the contract would save the force £6m a year and hailed it as a potential model for the rest of British policing. A Lincolnshire police spokesman told the Guardian in May that an investigation had been started in January after its anti-corruption unit received internal allegations.
“We immediately informed the Independent Police Complaints Commission of the allegations and they have been kept fully informed of our investigation which has been under their supervision,” the spokesman said at the time. The force also said that at no stage had there been any risk to the safety of members of the public. Data for the control room seen by the Guardian showed that between January and September last year the number of 999 calls made to test the equipment were running at an average of between 30 and 40 a month and as few as eight in September. In October the number jumped to 139, then 236 in November and peaked at 349 in December. The figures showed that the control room received 8,153 calls in December of which 349 were test calls. Only 89% of the genuine calls were answered within the target of 10 seconds, but the inclusion of the test calls pushed answering performance one percentage point above the target of 92%. G4S has said two staff resigned before disciplinary hearings, which took place at the end of July. Two members of staff were dismissed and a fifth returned to work after being cleared of any wrongdoing."

George Low, a 22-year-old estate agent from Dartford, Kent, died and his friend, Ben Barker, was seriously wounded in a pre-dawn knife attack on Sunday as they holidayed in the coastal town, famous for its party atmosphere. Low was stabbed in the neck, while Barker was stabbed in the back. According to Cyprus police, a 48-year-old woman who appeared at a local court on Wednesday in connection with the case said her boyfriend had told her that he and a friend had carried out the attack after a row sparked by the tourists urinating in the street. The Greek Cypriot woman also told the court she picked up her boyfriend from the resort shortly after the stabbing and helped him change clothes, then returned to collect his mobile telephone from a spot where he had hidden it. A report by the Cyprus News Agency claimed that the woman, who was not named, and her boyfriend had been living together in her home in Larnaca for a year. The court ordered her into police custody for eight days to give investigators time to prepare a case against her as a potential accessory after the fact. Police spokesperson Andreas Angelides told Associated Press authorities are still searching for the two alleged attackers, who have been identified as Mehmet Akpinar, 22, and Sali Ahmet, 42. Pictures of the men and warrants for their arrest have been issued, and investigators who are treating the case as premeditated murder and attempted murder have appealed to locals to come forward with any information. A third Turkish Cypriot is being sought who may have helped the suspects slip across the border to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot republic in the north of the island, according to the Cyprus News Agency. Cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since a 1974 Turkish invasion in the wake of a coup aiming at union with Greece. Cypriot authorities have no control over the north and cannot make arrests there. Low’s mother, Helen, 47, said Barker and her son had been due to fly back home on Sunday. Her son had spent two previous seasons in the resort as a club rep and manager, and was last there in June celebrating his birthday. His death had left the entire family “numb”, she said, adding: “We’re just heartbroken. We cannot believe something like this could happen to our son.” • This article was amended on 18 August 2016 to clarify that the claim of urinating in public was made by the girlfriend of one of the suspects."
2016-08-18T09:34:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Owners of stranded oil rig to meet with Isle of Lewis residents,"The owners of a 17,000-tonne oil rig that has been stranded on the coast of the Isle of Lewis in Scotland for more than a week are to meet members of the local community for the first time. The semi-submersible rig, Transocean Winner, ran aground close to Dalmore beach near Carloway on 8 August. It was being towed from Norway to Malta when its towline snapped in heavy seas. Representatives from its owners, Transocean, alongside the salvage team, will take questions from islanders at a public meeting on Thursday night following criticism that they failed to attend a similar event attended by 80 people in Carloway on Monday. But the company will not be able discuss why the rig was being towed near the islands in such poor weather. It is blocked from doing so while a separate inquiry by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch considers the cause of the incident.
The Western Isles Fishermen’s Association announced it intended to seek compensation for four boats that regularly fish in the area surrounding the rig. They have been affected by the setting up of a 300-metre exclusion zone covering sea and air, to prevent onlookers hampering the salvage teams and to discourage the use of drones. The platform was carrying 280 tonnes of diesel. Experts believe two of the four storage tanks were damaged when it hit rocks near Carloway, with a potential loss of 53 tonnes of fuel. But there has been no sign so far of an oil slick nor any reports of pollution. Smit Salvage confirmed on Monday that the remaining two diesel oil tanks in the hull were intact and plans were in hand to transfer their contents – 137 tonnes – using onboard pumping systems to other tanks above the water line. A team of 15 salvage experts have boarded the drilling rig and will continue their damage assessment and preparations for the eventual refloat, which they believe could take many weeks. A helicopter based in Stornoway to support the operation has completed three trips, transferring additional salvage equipment and supplies to the team. Hugh Shaw, the UK government’s representative for maritime salvage and intervention, said: “Work is ongoing and we are making steady progress, this is due to the response from all involved. We fully appreciate the support that we have been getting from the local community and its leaders, as well as all those who live and work on the island.” Meanwhile, SNP politicians from the Highlands and Islands have written to the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, calling for the reintroduction of a second emergency towing vessel (ETV) in Scotland. Funding for a Western Isles ETV was scrapped by the UK government in 2010, and the last remaining Scottish tug is based in Orkney, about 150 miles from Lewis."
2016-08-18T10:50:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Images of Tay Road Bridge construction released on 50th anniversary,"When the Tay Road Bridge, one of the longest bridges in Europe, was opened by the Queen Mother on 18 August 1966, Joseph McKenzie and his camera were there. The McManus art gallery and museum in Dundee, which holds hundreds of McKenzie’s photographs, is marking the 50th anniversary this year by releasing a collection of his images of the 2,250-metre bridge and the men who built it. McKenzie was given access to all areas throughout the four-year project by the designer William Fairhurst. His photographs formed part of his exhibition in the late 1960s titled Dundee: City in Transition.
He had moved from his native London to Scotland to work as a photographer and teacher, and recalled once that he had repeatedly been told: “Nobody loves Dundee.” “Maybe this was the right moment to demonstrate something more,” he said. McKenzie, who died last year, taught a generation of young Scottish photographers at the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art. He worked entirely in black and white, and was fascinated by Scotland’s post-industrial heritage and the decaying urban fabric of many cities. “When I came to Dundee to teach photography in 1964 as a foreigner-incomer, I was at once poleaxed by the combination of wonderful light and an eroding urban texture of an unsophisticated tradition, which photography handles so well,” he said.
The most famous Tay bridge was the Victorian rail bridge that fell into the river along with a train crossing it in 1879, a disaster immortalised in magnificently bad verse by William Magonagall. The £6m road bridge, now free to cross but originally a toll road charging half a crown, rises gradually from the Dundee side to the Fife bank. Some years ago a local radio competition to find a slogan for the bridge was abandoned when the most popular suggestion was: “It’s all downhill to Dundee.”"
2016-08-18T11:24:19Z,uk-news,UK news,May reboots 'northern powerhouse' with Â£24m cycling pledge,"Theresa May pledged to support a bid to bring the cycling world championships to Yorkshire as she vowed her government would press ahead with George Osborne’s “northern powerhouse” project. After Team GB’s extraordinary medal success in the cycling events at the Rio Olympics, the prime minister used an article in the Yorkshire Post to promise that the government would underwrite the UK’s bid to host the world championships and provide £24m of investment.
The UK has hosted the world championships three times before, the last in 1982, and Yorkshire successfully hosted part of the Tour de France in 2014. May also insisted she was committed to the “northern powerhouse” strategy, championed by the former chancellor, to give more powers to city regions. Doubts had been raised about the new government’s support for the “northern powerhouse”. After the first meeting of the new economy and industrial strategy committee earlier this month, a spokesman made it clear that the phrase had not been used. But in her Yorkshire Post article, May said the “northern powerhouse” was a “plan to help the great cities and towns of the north pool their strengths and take on the world”. She added that she would boost the policy with a “proper industrial strategy” to support Yorkshire’s key sectors. “To help us realise the benefits, the government will now develop a proper industrial strategy to back Yorkshire’s strengths, whether it is financial and health technology in Leeds, advanced manufacturing in South Yorkshire, or innovative new textiles in West Yorkshire.” The prime minister added “industrial strategy” to the title of the new, beefed-up business department when she arrived in Downing Street, in a signal that she could take a more interventionist approach. Greg Clark, the business minister who replaced the free marketeer Sajid Javid, has a keen interest in devolution. Separately, May used an article in the Birmingham Mail to support the “Midlands engine”, her name for giving the region more devolved powers. “There is still so much more we need to do to build an economy that works for everyone, not just a privileged few. There is still so much untapped potential here, and right across the Midlands. The government I lead will help you unleash that potential and together we will make the Midlands – from Lincolnshire to Shropshire – a powerful engine for growth,” she said. New metropolitan mayors are due to be elected in Manchester, Liverpool and the West Midlands next spring. Ben Harrison, of the Centre for Cities thinktank, said May’s articles were significant and that her clear statement of support for devolution would provide “a degree of certainty for businesses”, especially coming after the government’s pledge to match EU project funding in areas such as science. May’s new government has appeared to strike a fresh tone on a number of issues, with health campaigners arguing that Thursday’s publication of the anti-obesity strategy marked a considerable watering down of previous proposals; and the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, promising a “reset” on economic policy. This article was amended on 18 August 2016. It mistakenly stated that the UK had never hosted the cycling world championships before. This has been corrected."
2016-08-18T13:42:34Z,uk-news,UK news,IPCC to investigate West Yorkshire police over release of dog that killed man,"West Yorkshire police force is to be investigated following the killing of a man by a dog days after it had been returned to its owner despite concerns it was dangerous. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the circumstances surrounding the dog being returned to its owner last week. David Ellam, 52, was trying to protect his own yorkshire terrier when the larger dog turned on him in Huddersfield on Monday. Neighbours described how they tried to save Ellam by throwing him a kitchen knife to fend off the animal, before a police officer fought it off using a fire extinguisher. Ellam was treated by paramedics and taken to Huddersfield Royal infirmary, but was pronounced dead hours later. The IPCC commissioner, Derrick Campbell, said: “The death of Mr Ellam was a tragic incident and my sympathies go to his family. “Our independent investigation will look closely at police actions prior to Mr Ellam’s death, including the decision-making around the removal, testing and return of the dog. “A criminal investigation into Mr Ellam’s death is being carried out by West Yorkshire police.” The dog’s owner, a 29-year-old man who is thought to be the victim’s neighbour, was arrested in connection with the incident and has been released on police bail pending further inquiries. His dog has been detained in police kennels. The dog, named Alex, had been seized by police after being assessed by a dog warden in June following concerns from residents that it was dangerous. The dog was not, however, a banned breed under the Dangerous Dogs Act so was returned to its owner after being screened. Carol Hanson, a friend of Ellam’s partner, told the BBC: “It had been locked up already for biting somebody. It’s only been out for five days. Why did they let that dog go? Why did they let that dog back out when it was vicious? “What needs to be looked at is these dangerous dogs shouldn’t be let back out, should they. Once they have bitten somebody that should be it. They shouldn’t get a second chance.” Under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act, pit bull terriers, Japanese tosas, dogo argentinos and fila brasileiros are banned from the UK unless the owner has been given a special court exemption. Dogs that have received an exemption must be muzzled, kept on a lead in public, neutered, tattooed and have a microchip implant."
2016-08-18T16:05:15Z,uk-news,UK news,"Katrina Walsh 'groomed' by Sadie Hartley's other killer, says ex-husband","The former husband of one of two women convicted of the murder of Sadie Hartley has expressed guilt about the collapse of their marriage, which he said allowed her to be “groomed” by the other killer. Kevin Walsh said that Katrina Walsh had become “a completely different woman” under the influence of Sarah Williams. Both women were sentenced to life in prison on Wednesday for murdering the businesswoman in a planned killing of “barbaric savagery”.
Kevin Walsh said: “I feel guilty for having left her all those years ago. If I had still been around, Sarah Williams would not have been able to groom and this would not have happened. “Kit was vulnerable after I left, but she would not have done something like this without someone leading her and I feel regret about that.” After Mr Walsh had an affair, the couple separated, and they divorced in 2008 after being married for 24 years. They remained close friends and Katrina Walsh attended her former mother-in-law’s 80th birthday party. In an interview with the Guardian, Mr Walsh said he was stunned by what had followed. “Kit has always lived in a bit of a fantasy world, but it was harmless stuff like dragons and that type of thing. What happened here absolutely baffles me and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to understand it.” Katrina Walsh, 56, stood trial for seven weeks alongside her friend Williams, 35, jointly accused of murdering Hartley in January. Hartley, 60, a communications director, was paralysed with a stun gun and repeatedly stabbed by Williams, who had wanted to resume an affair with Hartley’s long-term partner, Ian Johnston, a former firefighter.
Walsh had recorded their meticulous plans for committing the “perfect murder” in diaries. Williams was sentenced to a minimum of 30 years and Walsh will serve at least 25 years. It took the jury seven hours and nine minutes to return a guilty verdict. Since Walsh was arrested in January, she has exchanged around 20 letters with her former husband from her cell in New Hall prison, Wakefield. She also writes to her ex-husband’s current girlfriend. “With me she will discuss the case, but the letters to my girlfriend are more chatty, about our hens and various other things,” he said. “But the whole time, in all of the letters, she has always made out that she was innocent.” He said he planned to visit Walsh in prison next week, adding that he would confront her about the evidence that came out during the trial, which showed that she was a willing participant in the murder. “I do want answers because I have been lied to. Kit has obviously been more involved than she has let on to me. She could have been honest with me but the whole time she has lied,” he said. “Even in the last few letters, she said she wasn’t giving evidence because of her health, but never let on to me about her involvement in this murder and previous stalking stuff they did with Sarah’s other boyfriends.”
It also emerged during the trial that the two women were trying to recruit Mr Walsh to murder Hartley. In August 2015, he received a text message from his former wife saying Williams wanted to meet him. Williams then called him directly offering a job suiting his “particular key skill”, but said that she preferred to discuss it in person. The jury heard that Williams was using an untraceable, pay-as-you-go mobile phone, and Mr Walsh said “alarm bells were going off in my head” as he believed she was up to “something dodgy”. He said he had no idea why he was being contacted as he had not spoken to Williams for eight years. “I had had no contact with Sarah after I left and then, all of a sudden, she got in touch with me. She wanted to come up here and see me. She wouldn’t talk about it over the phone. I said I wasn’t interested because I have never trusted her,” he said. “She admitted that she was contacting me using a burner [untraceable phone]. So, funnily enough, alarm bells were going off at this stage. Whatever she wanted was something dodgy. She wanted to travel 150 miles to discuss something. “But after the conversation I thought, hang on – I have never trusted this girl. She has contacted me after eight years using a burner. No, just walk away now. So I didn’t bother getting back to her and then ignored her.”
He decided to block Williams’ number and cut off contact. In a diary entry, Walsh suggested that her ex had been sought out for his archery skills. Mr Walsh had first met Williams when she was 17 and “shy and affected” and with a lazy eye. She had started hanging around the stables where Walsh, then in her 30s, kept her horse. The teenage Williams was in a relationship with a man 40 years her senior – married “sugar-daddy” David Hardwick – and Mr Walsh said that he never trusted her, believing her to be manipulative.He said he felt he had been a “pawn” in the murder plot, because when he was called to give evidence in the trial Walsh kept him in the dark about her involvement. “I’m guessing she did that because she wanted me on her side and to come across to the jury like I believed she was innocent,” he said. “And up until that point, I did. I am annoyed, but I will continue to see her because she is just so vulnerable. I am completely baffled by what has happened but I feel a responsibility towards Kit.”"
2016-08-18T16:33:16Z,uk-news,UK news,Britain's youngest mayor and a brass band champ among A-level achievers,"A-levels are always hard. They can be even more of a challenge, however, when you have been left unable to write because of a brain tumour; when you have regular commitments to your clog-dancing club; or if have just found yourself elected as the UK’s youngest mayor. Here’s a round-up some of the most unique success stories this year.
Sisters see double
Two sisters have received identical A-level results in the same subjects one year apart. Leenah Abuelgasim achieved A* grades in biology, chemistry and maths, and A grades in Greek and general studies – just as her older sister Hiba did 12 months earlier. Leenah said the pair could not believe it when they saw their matching results. Her sister added: “I’m sure Sigmund Freud would say there was probably something in all that.” Both studied at Birmingham’s King Edward VI high school for girls, and Leenah will follow her sibling to study medicine at the University of Oxford. But the two differ in one respect: their choice of specialism. While Hiba wants to work in cardiology and possibly psychology, Leenah hopes to pursue radiology and diagnostic imaging. Travelling a new path
Traveller Stephanie Bagnall will become the first member of her family to go to university, stepping away from a multigeneration tradition of working at funfairs. The 18-year-old spent the majority of her life travelling in a caravan and working at funfairs, until she won a scholarship to study at the independent Wycliffe College in Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, two years ago. She achieved an A* in English literature, B in drama and C in business studies at A-level. Stephanie found out about her results in Spain where she is visiting a friend. “My life has changed so much,” she said. “It’s just amazing that I now have friends across the globe when just two years ago I only knew people in Gloucester. I feel like a much more complete person.” She will be reading English and theatre studies at Royal Holloway, University of London. Brain power
Six years ago, Lauren Pratt had a 10-hour operation to remove a tumour from her brain and was left unable to write. Now she has set her sights on the University of Cambridge after receiving A* A-level grades in business studies, English language and media studies at the John Cabot academy in Kingswood, South Gloucestershire. The 18-year-old, who used a wheelchair while she recovered from surgery and had to use a laptop during her exams, was shocked by her clean sweep of top grades. “I just cannot believe it,” she said. “I had to double check my results in case my eyes were deceiving me and it was all a mirage. It hasn’t sunk in yet.” She will fly to China on Friday to begin her gap year, which will involve teaching English for five months before traveling around Asia. “I am going to come back and do a linguistics degree at university,” she said. “I think I will apply to Cambridge. We’ll see what happens.” A hop, a skip and a jump to success
Robyn Wallace is adding impressive A-level results to some idiosyncratic extracurricular achievements. The 17-year-old, from near Rochdale, got an A in maths, and Bs in chemistry and physics. She has already won a prize for her percussion at the European Brass Band Championships and set up a 50-member clog-dancing club. She said: “When I first started dancing at about 12, I was the youngest. Now we have people aged eight up to in their 60s, although it is mostly older people. We practise once a week in a pub, so I made sure I had time to revise for my A-level exams around that.” As she prepares to study physics at the University of Sheffield, she hopes to keep up her unusual hobby. “There aren’t any clubs set up around there because clog dancing seems to be a Lancashire thing,” she said. “I might have to take the initiative myself.” Making up for lost time
Health problems forced Fabienne Zigrit to miss a chunk of her A-level lessons. The 18-year-old took five months off with kidney trouble – yet she still managed to secure an A* in geography, a B in physics and an A in the Welsh baccalaureate. Fabienne, who studied at Cardiff high school, told WalesOnline: “My kidney destroyed itself after it got obstructed and I was in hospital for months.” She spent three months in hospital last year, and was out of school for a further two months this year while she recovered from an operation in February. Fabienne said: “I’m over the moon. I checked this morning and I cried for a good half hour. I told my parents and they were as happy as I was.” She has won a place to study geography at Cardiff University. UK’s youngest mayor heads to Hull
Most A-level students will be out partying after their results, but Terence Smith, the UK’s youngest mayor, planned to spend his evening at a council planning meeting. The 19-year-old became mayor of Goole, east Yorkshire, in May, just one week before his first exam. He has now been accepted to study sociology at Hull after getting C grades in media studies and film studies, a U in law and a D in AS-level sociology. “It’s been a busy year really with me becoming mayor and also with a busy referendum campaign,” Smith, who has dyslexia, said. “Exams have always been challenging so really to have got what I’ve got is fantastic.” He said he did not mind spending the evening in a council meeting. “I was elected for four years [as a councillor] and I will serve those four years with pleasure. I’ve got plenty of time to go out partying.”"
2016-08-18T16:56:27Z,uk-news,UK news,"Knife attack that killed Briton in Ayia Napa was unprovoked, friend says","A British victim of a knife attack in Ayia Napa, in which his friend was killed, says it was unprovoked and they had never seen their attackers before, his sister has told the Guardian. Ben Barker, 22, from Dartford in Kent, is still in hospital after he was stabbed four times in the back as he made his way to his hotel in the early hours of Sunday morning. His friend, George Low, also 22, was stabbed in the neck and died. Ben’s sister, Rebecca Barker, who has travelled to Cyprus with her parents, said her brother strenuously denied claims by the girlfriend of one suspect that he and Low had been involved in a row with their attackers over urinating in the street. She said: “It’s caused quite severe upset and frustration to Ben, because he feels like they are being portrayed as ‘Brits abroad’ and that they aggravated the attack, which is completely untrue. They were just victims of a random attack by these men as they were walking home. “There wasn’t an altercation beforehand, they hadn’t seen them before, there weren’t any cross words, there wasn’t a fight over a girl or urinating or anything like that. It was just that these men decided that they were going to kill George and attempt to kill Ben.”
In the hours following the attack, Famagusta’s district assistant police chief, Georgios Economou, said the attack had taken place shortly after Barker and Low had been involved in a “shoving match” with another person.
Then, on Wednesday, a 48-year-old woman told a Famagusta court that her boyfriend, Mehmet Akpinar, 22, had told her that he and a friend had carried out the attack after a row sparked by the tourists urinating in the street. She also told the court that she picked up Akpinar from the resort shortly after the stabbing and helped him change clothes, then returned to collect his mobile phone from a spot where he had hidden it. The court ordered the woman, whom reports did not name, into police custody for eight days to give investigators time to prepare a case against her as a potential accessory after the fact. Rebecca Barker was critical of the woman’s testimony. She said: “She’s the person being held on remand for aiding the murderers’ escape. She wasn’t at the scene. She didn’t see it. She’s just relaying what she’s been told by one of the men.” Authorities are still searching for Akpinar and his suspected accomplice, Sali Ahmet, 42, and have issued pictures of the men and warrants for their arrest. However, it is feared that the men, both Turkish Cypriots, may have travelled across the border to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot republic on the north of the island. Ben Barker and Low had been due to fly home on the day they were attacked. Rebecca Barker said her brother was recovering in hospital. “The doctors are being really good and they are doing a really good job of looking after him, but I don’t think that they want to let him leave yet just because of the severity of the wounds,” she said."
2016-08-18T18:50:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Police officers investigated over Dalian Atkinson Taser death,"Two West Mercia police officers are under criminal investigation over the death of the former Premier League footballer Dalian Atkinson, who died after he was Tasered three times by police. The two officers were also being served with gross misconduct notices, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said on Thursday. Some eyewitnesses have also reported that Atkinson was struck by officers while he was on the ground. One woman has already told the BBC that she saw what she believed was Atkinson being kicked by police. The IPCC has stressed its decision to launch a criminal investigation does not mean the officers did anything wrong. The former Aston Villa footballer died after police Tasered him near his father’s home in Telford on Monday. West Mercia police said officers used a Taser at about 1.30am on Monday after responding to reports of concerns for a person’s safety. The man failed to respond to medical attention and was pronounced dead 90 minutes later. A postmortem examination was held on Wednesday and the cause of death was inconclusive. Further tests were due to be carried out. The IPCC is liaising with Her Majesty’s coroner. The key issues in the criminal investigation will be whether the decision to use force was justified and then whether the level of force was proportionate to Atkinson’s behaviour. One officer fired a Taser three times. Whether Atkinson’s behaviour at the time merited this response will be another key part of the inquiry. Atkinson’s family welcomed the decision by the IPCC to launch a criminal investigation. They have hired a law firm expert in cases against the police for deaths in custody and experienced in battling the IPCC to conduct a proper investigation. In a statement the family said: “We are still in shock as to the circumstances in which Dalian died. We are determined to get justice for him, which means getting to the truth. We welcome the IPCC’s decision that this is a criminal investigation and emphasise their request that there should be no speculation in the media as to what happened to Dalian, as this could prejudice the criminal investigation and any potential prosecution.“We are looking to the IPCC to carry out a thorough and robust investigation that will ultimately provide transparency and accountability. Dalian’s memory requires nothing less.” Atkinson’s brother, Kenroy, 53, previously said the ex-footballer had undergone dialysis for kidney failure and was “in a manic state and depressed” at the time of the incident. He said his brother had attacked their 85-year-old father, Ernest, at his home before police were called to the scene. The IPCC said it would carry out a full and thorough inquiry. The IPCC commissioner Derrick Campbell said: “Having carefully considered the evidence gathered so far, we are undertaking a criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr Atkinson’s death and the level and type of force used. Two police officers will be interviewed under criminal caution by IPCC investigators. “As this is a criminal investigation, the IPCC is limited in the amount of information which can be released into the public domain. I would ask people to be patient during the progress of our investigation and not to add to speculation about the circumstances of Mr Atkinson’s death. Speculation across the media as a whole can risk prejudice to the investigation process. “We will keep Mr Atkinson’s family updated and our thoughts remain with all of those affected by his death.” In a statement the IPCC added: “Two West Mercia Police officers have been advised they are under criminal investigation and are also being served with gross misconduct notices. “A criminal investigation does not mean that criminal charges will necessarily follow. “The IPCC investigation is at an early stage, and the position will be kept under review as the investigation progresses.” Tasers deliver an incapacitating 50,000-volt shock, and critics say the weapon is too often lethal. Its use has been linked to at least 10 deaths in England and Wales over the last decade. In 2013, Jordan Lee Begley, 23, died two hours after a Greater Manchester officer targeted him with a stun gun at his home. Police had been called to reports of an argument. Atkinson achieved acclaim for his goal of the season against Wimbledon in 1992 as part of an Aston Villa team that went on to secure the runners-up spot in the first year of the Premier League. He also scored at Wembley in 1994 when Villa beat Manchester United to lift the League Cup. He started his career at Ipswich Town and then played for Sheffield Wednesday and the Spanish side Real Sociedad before moving to Villa. He was the first black player for Sociedad, scoring 12 goals in La Liga. At Villa he scored more than 20 Premier League goals between 1991 and 1995 before going on to play less successfully for other teams, including the Turkish side Fenerbahçe and Manchester City."
2016-08-18T19:43:11Z,uk-news,UK news,"Charlie Webster out of coma after nearly dying, mother says","Television presenter Charlie Webster “nearly died” after falling ill with a rare strain of malaria at the opening ceremony of the Olympics, according to her mother, shortly after completing a 3,000 mile charity ride to make it to the games. At first, doctors treating the 33-year-old from Sheffield thought she was suffering from exhaustion and dehydration when she felt unwell and started vomiting at the event a fortnight ago. But over the following few days, Webster’s health sharply deteriorated and her family said that she fell unconscious last Thursday, although news of the seriousness of her condition only publicly emerged a week later. The presenter – who has worked for Sky Sports and ITV – remains seriously ill with kidney failure, but has been taken out of an induced coma and can speak to family members by her bedside, according to a family statement. Charlie’s mother Joy said: “Charlotte knows she nearly died, she mouthed to me earlier ‘look at all the machines keeping me alive’. Charlotte is really strong but as the doctors keep reminding me, everyone heals differently. I am just so thankful that she’s able to communicate with us again. “It’s been the worst imaginable time – we have been beside ourselves with worry, but the fact Charlotte is now conscious is amazing. Knowing Charlotte, the thing she’ll be most annoyed about is that she’s missed the Olympics. “She will be especially gutted not to have seen Nicola Adams fight today (Thursday) – there’s a TV on the wall, so hopefully she can at least watch the women’s boxing final”. Just hours before hospitalisation, Webster had tweeted about the “goosebumps” she felt attending the opening of the Olympics. Webster, who was due to have been a presenter at the Olympics, was put in a medically induced coma last Friday after her breathing became laboured and she was unable to breath unsupported. On Thursday, doctors said they are “very happy” with her “neurological results” suggesting she has not suffered any brain damage. However they cautioned that her kidneys were “still not responding to treatment and she remains on dialysis.”
When Webster first fell ill, she said that she still expected a speedy recovery and initially posted updates about her health on social media before the seriousness of her illness became apparent.
She had been due to stay on in the city as part of Team GB’s Great Britons campaign alongside DJ Nick Grimshaw and model Jodie Kidd. She remained positive telling followers three days later that she was improving.
Webster had cycled to Rio in memory of athlete Jane Tomlinson, who died 10 years ago of cancer. Together with widower Mike Tomlinson, she set off 39 days ago on the first leg of the Ride To Rio challenge on 27 June, cycling 1,300 miles (2,092km) from London to Lisbon. They cycled 90 miles (145km) a day with only one rest day each week before arriving at the Maracana stadium on 4 August. Her mother flew to Brazil to be at her daughter’s bedside, but the last time she saw her conscious was last Thursday. Webster remains in intensive care and on a respirator. She was taken out of her coma gradually while tests were conducted on her cognitive functions. An hour or so after having the endotracheal tube removed on Thursday, Webster was able to whisper to her mother. “I can’t believe you have been here all week”. Later on she looked at her mother and whispered “Have you been to the beach?”
Her family have thanked the public for all their support and said their priority was to get her “stable enough to fly back to the UK.” The Ride To Rio campaign wished Webster a speedy recovery via Twitter, describing her as a “tough lady”. Webster is no stranger to feats of endurance, having ridden the three UK stages of the 2014 Tour de France for charity, as well as completing her first Ironman triathlon in 2015. A Foreign Office spokesman said: “We are providing support to a British woman who is in hospital in Rio.”"
2016-08-18T23:45:31Z,uk-news,UK news,"Best man who swindled £8,000 from stag party jailed for 20 months","A best man who swindled a groom and his friends out of almost £8,000, failed to book flights for a stag do and lied about having terminal cancer has been jailed for 20 months. Martyn Galvin, 30, was sentenced on Thursday at Teesside crown court and ordered to repay the stolen funds.
The stag party – the groom and 16 of his friends – only realised the deception when they got to Newcastle airport in August last year to find there were no flights or accommodation reserved in Prague. Galvin tried to blame the travel agent for getting the dates wrong. The groom had asked Galvin – his closest friend – to be best man at his wedding before he had even proposed to his partner, prosecutor Jenny Haigh told the court. He said Galvin, from Yarm in North Yorkshire, constantly distracted him from wedding plans with problems about payments for the stag dos in the Czech capital and a day at York races. In a statement read out in court, the groom said: “When Martyn told me he had suspected cancer I was absolutely devastated for him and his family. I offered to take over the organising but he insisted, stating a groom should never have to organise his own stag do. How could I not feel guilty? I felt I had put too much on him.” Galvin’s claim to have terminal bowel cancer was exposed as a lie. “I was told by his mum that he did not have any sort of cancer and he had not left the house all week. I was beyond devastated,” the groom said. “I could not believe that Martyn had done this to me.” The victim said he now felt like he was known as “the groom whose best man screwed his friends and family over money, and I’m ashamed”. He added: “For months he conned me and a lot of our friends into thinking he was seriously ill for the plain reason of money. At no point did he hesitate in his scheme. He had six months to organise a stag do but he didn’t. He just took the money he was asking people for.” Despite the emotional turmoil that Galvin inflicted, the groom said he did not let the scam spoil his wedding. “I picked a new best man and the wedding day was the proudest, happiest day of my life with no mention of the existence of Martyn or the stag do,” he said. “Since he confessed what he had done, I’ve not seen Martyn and I never want to see him again.” Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC, the recorder of Middlesbrough, told Galvin that his scam was “perhaps one of the nastiest and meanest I’ve encountered in my time involved in criminal law”. “The fraud involved a string of quite dreadful lies, lies to your best friend, a man who entrusted in you the task and the honour of being his best man,” he added. Duncan McReddie, defending, said Galvin had a long-running gambling addiction. His client was truly remorseful and he and his family would compensate all the victims in full."
2016-08-19T07:47:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan to launch London's night tube service,"The mayor of London is to ride the first night tube on Friday evening when the much-delayed project finally goes into service. Trains will operate through the night on Fridays and Saturdays on the Victoria line and parts of the Central line, with the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines following in the autumn. Sadiq Khan expressed surprise at the delay in the scheme, a project that was first promised by his predecessor Boris Johnson almost two years ago. The former mayor pledged that the service would begin in September 2015, with Transport for London (TfL) promoting the benefits for spectators attending games at last year’s Rugby World Cup. But a bitter dispute with the rail unions delayed the project and Johnson was criticised for setting a start date before the issues were resolved. Khan told the Press Association (PA) that Johnson, now foreign secretary, gave up on the all-night tube before leaving City Hall in May.
He said: “It’s not me making a cheap point, but the previous mayor did announce the night tube start date on one occasion and that wasn’t met, on a second occasion, that wasn’t met, on a third occasion, that wasn’t met, and then gave up.” Earlier this week Khan boasted to the Guardian that the night tube would be launched in the week marking his 100th day in office. “I was told by the other guy it couldn’t be done,” he said. And he told PA: “It can’t be beyond the wit of a full-time mayor and TfL to make this work properly. “When I see the enthusiasm from employers in London, investors to London, tourists in London, about the night tube, it’s surprising it’s taken us this long to get it. I’m pleased and proud that we’re here.” The mayor said he had ensured the introduction of all-night services was meticulously planned, with just two lines being initially opened because “we don’t want a big bang [with] errors and mistakes”. He added: “There may well be teething problems when we first begin but the key thing is to learn from that and to improve upon that before we unveil the other lines later on this year.” Asked who would use the night tube, Khan said passengers would include nurses, security guards, tourists and even “a middle-aged clubber like me coming home after a late night out with your missus”. He has recorded welcome messages to be played over the public address system at Oxford Circus, which will be the busiest night tube station.
Around 100 British Transport police officers will be on patrol across the network on Friday and Saturday nights. Supt Chris Horton, the officer responsible for policing on the underground, insisted there was no reason why passengers would not be as safe as they were during the day. He said the force would focus on “being visible” and ensuring it was “able to intervene in places that are likely to see significant issues”. London Underground (LU) estimates that 200,000 people will use the night tube each weekend once it has been opened on all five lines. About half a million passengers currently use the tube after 10pm on Fridays and Saturdays combined. LU’s new managing director, Mark Wild, who launched night services in Melbourne, Australia, earlier this year, said: “What happened there is what I expect will happen here. It’s not just for revellers. It’s for the night-time economy: people working in hospitality, shift workers, nurses. “We expect a nice mix of people who enjoy the fantastic nightlife of the city, but it’s also a lot about giving people mobility.”"
2016-08-19T08:31:24Z,uk-news,UK news,How Ada aims to fill Britain's digital skills gap from Tottenham Hale,"As London rightly celebrates another year of outstanding A-level results - the best in England, except for the south-east - it’s worth noting that some young talents in the capital, as no doubt elsewhere, may still not be fully recognised by the school examinations system. Next month will see the opening of the Ada National College for Digital Skills, to be based at Tottenham Hale within the area’s redevelopment zone. Ada’s first sixth form intake will comprise up to 100 16-year-olds plus 50 apprentices aged 19 and above. Of these 150 students, 60% will live within a five-mile radius of the college and 40% within the borough of Haringey. There will be no fees and no qualifications required. Entry is by interview and aptitude with a logical problem-solving app. This is specialist further education, tailored not only to help fill the country’s digital skills gap but also to advance what Ada chief executive and co-founder Mark Smith calls a social mission in a part of town containing many disadvantaged young people and rebuilding after the damage done by the 2011 riots. “Our idea is to support low-income people into high tech jobs,” he says, stressing that Ada students need not have done especially well at school in general to have the abilities the college will seek to nurture. There can be several reasons for that lack, including poor English language skills. Smith’s reasoning is simple: “They might have struggled in some areas, but they could be great at maths and have a passion for digital knowledge. It’s all about untapped potential”. Smith is determined to encourage more girls and young women into the digital field. The college is named after Ada Lovelace, the early 19th century mathematician (and daughter of Lord Byron), who wrote what some regard as the first computer programme. He says that up to 18% of the college’s first intake will be female – a significant minority, given that the technology industry average for women has been put at just 13%. Ada has come about thanks to Smith pulling together a range of supporters to back his social enterprise. The project really got off the ground just before Christmas 2013 when the online gaming company Gamesys gave him £100,000, topped up with contributions of £12,000 from each of its two founders. It helps that Smith has an education background: he assisted Andrew Adonis with writing his book Education, Education, Education and both he and Ada co-founder Tom Fogden have been through the Teach First programme, which aims to get talented teachers into classrooms in low income areas. It is the only brand new college of the five across England national government is backing, and Gamesys has been joined by four more commercial partners: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deloitte, IBM and King, the creators of Candy Crush Saga. There’s also an education partner, the Aldridge Foundation charity. Haringey Council too has been important. Smith cites encouragement from councillor Joe Goldberg, who is the borough’s cabinet member for economic development, social inclusion and sustainability, and from its deputy chief executive Zina Etheridge, with whom he had a pivotal cup of coffee in a cafe on Tottenham High Road. Council leader Claire Kober, who has lately also become the chair of the influential local authority body London Councils, regards Ada as an example of how boroughs can facilitate endeavours like Smith’s by convening interested parties and providing practical help. After a two-week temporary stay in Here East on the Olympic Park, Ada will move into its permanent first home, a former Job Centre a five-minute walk from Tottenham Hale station which is being converted thanks to funding from the Greater London Authority and the government. It will expand over the next two years into a second premises in Whitechapel (yet to be chosen), and Smith says that in seven years’ time it will teach some 2,500 students. You can follow Ada’s progress on Twitter. The Ada initiative is an important part of the larger story of Tottenham in the post-riots period. I was introduced to other elements of it during my visit to the area and will report on those too in the coming months."
2016-08-19T08:36:07Z,uk-news,UK news,British summer: wet and windy weekend ahead,"Britons can pack away the suncream and get their brollies ready, as this weekend the country will see a return to wet and windy weather with fierce storms set to batter the west coast. Severe weather warnings are in place for Britain’s southern coasts on Saturday and rain is forecast for much of the country, marking the end of a heatwave that never quite happened.
London, the south-east, the south-west, the West Midlands, the east of England and Wales have all been given yellow warnings of unseasonably strong wind and heavy, blustery rain that will begin on Friday night and develop through Saturday. Residents in coastal areas have been warned to prepare themselves for gales. In Cornwall, coastal residents and sailors have been warned to beware of a fierce Atlantic storm beginning on Friday night, which will see swells of almost 28ft battering the coastline. Magicseaweed, a surf forecasting service, said it would be the second largest August storm in almost a decade. Storms of a similar size are usually not seen during the summer months. Ben Freeston, a forecaster for Magicseaweed, said: “The offshore buoys in the storm’s path towards Cornwall are reading 27ft and we expect the storm swell to peak on Friday evening. Unfortunately it will coincide with large spring high tides meaning the full energy of the swell will hit our coastline.” The wet and windy weather began in the south-west on Friday morning, with a band of rain pushing eastwards and northwards across the country during the day. Some clearer spells may appear behind that, but a strong area of low pressure to the west will whip up strong winds. Blustery, heavy showers will continue into Saturday, with longer spells of rain, as winds intensify in coastal areas. The Met Office is warning of gusts reaching up to 40-45mph inland and as high as 60mph in coastal areas.
“Please be aware that these may lead to disruption to transport, and in view of the time of the year there is increased potential for disruption to outdoor activities,” said a statement attached to the weather warning. According to a statement by the Met Office’s chief forecaster: “An area of low pressure developing to the south-west of the UK is expected to intensify into an unseasonably intense feature over the next 24 to 36 hours as it slowly moves north east. “Strengthening winds on its southern flank are likely to move into south-western areas on Friday, but the peak in wind strength will be across south-west England and south Wales at first on Saturday, spreading along the south coast of England through the course of the day.”"
2016-08-19T09:09:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Owners of stranded oil rig say salvage effort is at mercy of weather,"The owners of a 17,000-tonne oil rig that has been stranded on the coast of the Isle of Lewis in Scotland for 10 days have told locals that salvage experts are not ready to refloat the vast structure. The semi-submersible rig, Transocean Winner, ran aground close to Dalmore beach near Carloway on 8 August. It was being towed from Norway to Malta when its towline snapped in rough seas. At a public meeting on Thursday evening, representatives of the oil firm said the salvage effort remained at the mercy of the poor weather and strong tides, and apologised to the local community. Dave Walls, an operations director for Transocean, told islanders: “The other thing I would like to do is to apologise for the disruption to your daily lives.” He said that although good progress was being made in the operation to refloat the structure, it remained “tricky to predict” when that might actually take place. The 15-person salvage team now working aboard the rig have set up emergency generators, pumps and internal cameras. Compressors needed to provide buoyancy for the refloat are expected to arrive on the island by ferry on Friday. Walls said: “We need to get ourselves in the position where we’re ready to float and we’re not there yet. Once we’re ready to float we then need the ideal conditions to float and that’s a suitable weather window – no wind, the right tide. Everything needs to be just right because we get one opportunity to do it right.” He assured islanders that no trace of the rig would be left when the salvage operation – which will include a sweep of the seabed – was complete. The platform was carrying 280 tonnes of diesel when it ran aground. Experts believe two of the four storage tanks were damaged when it hit rocks near Carloway, with a potential loss of 53 tonnes of fuel. But there has been no sign so far of an oil slick nor any reports of pollution. Work to transfer the remaining diesel into undamaged tanks began on Thursday. On Friday morning the salvage team plans to test out procedures in the event of any fuel being spilled during the refloat, in order to ascertain how quickly equipment could be deployed from Carloway to other locations."
2016-08-19T10:56:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Cyclist who lost leg in lorry collision criticises driver's £625 fine,"A midwife whose leg was amputated at the roadside after she was hit by a Tesco lorry has said she is hugely disappointed that the driver was fined just £625 and given five points on his licence after he pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention.
Julie Dinsdale, 53, who was lucky to survive after the HGV drove over her leg and the wheels of her bike at Old Street roundabout in central London last year, said the verdict was evidence that the courts continued to treat cyclists as second-class citizens on UK roads. The collision happened after the driver, Florin Oprea, 24, turned left across Dinsdale’s path. Oprea had been driving in the UK for four months and started working for Tesco days before the incident. He had held a HGV licence for 18 months but had been working mainly in Italy before moving to the UK. Blackfriars crown court heard that days before the collision a driving assessor recommended Oprea needed to use his nearside mirrors more when driving. On the day of the accident Oprea was working unaccompanied for the first time, and it was alleged he was not following the route provided by Tesco, though Oprea argued he was following directions from his satellite navigation system. Dinsdale’s partner, Keith Bontrager, who created one of the most famous brands in cycling, was riding behind her at the time and witnessed the collision. Dinsdale spent five weeks in hospital after the incident. In her victim statement she described how her injuries had changed her life, which had previously been filled with running and cycling events. She had been the ninth female finisher in the San Francisco marathon in 2013. A week before the collision she had completed the Three Peaks cyclocross event, which involves climbing the three highest peaks in Yorkshire though a combination of cycling and running, for the sixth time.
Dinsdale said: “I am hugely disappointed by the decision of the court which finds that despite the evidence that I was visible to the driver, he should not be handed a more substantial sentence given the impact his actions have had on my life. “Every aspect of my life remains difficult and my inability to return to work or pursue my sporting and active lifestyle is an immense loss to me and causes me great distress.” She said her greatest concern was that the driver continued to drive HGVs. “What has happened to me is devastating and I would hate for someone else to go through the same. Despite cycling now being one of the country’s most loved sports, especially following the success of the British cycling team at successive Olympics, and the growing popularity of cycling as a means of transport in London, cyclists remain second-class citizens on the roads in the UK. This is reflected by the behaviour of drivers and the courts.” Dinsdale’s lawyer Sally Moore, head of personal injury at the firm Leigh Day, said they would now be taking civil legal action against Oprea and Tesco. “It remains a problem at the core of British society that serious collisions involving cyclists are still regarded as par for the course and appear to be treated as such by the courts,” Moore said."
2016-08-19T11:19:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Man held over Rotherham mosque bomb threat,"A man has been arrested by counter-terrorism officers over a bomb threat sent to a mosque in Rotherham. The 43-year-old man, from Plymouth, was held at 8am on Friday by officers from the north-east counter-terrorism unit. This month a letter was posted to the Jamia Masjid Abu Bakr mosque in the South Yorkshire town, saying: “Next time it will be a bomb, you Muslim scum.” The letter was signed with the number 1488, believed to be used by neo-Nazi groups. Ch Supt Rob Odell, of South Yorkshire police, said the town’s mosques had been offered security advice. Sabir Hussain, secretary of the mosque, described the bomb threat as “appalling and very frightening”. He told the BBC the Muslim community had felt “under siege” since the publication of the Jay report on the sexual exploitation of teenage girls by men predominantly of Pakistani heritage. He said community cohesion was “very low” in the town following far-right marches. “There is never a day goes by when we don’t get abuse. At first we thought the letter might be a prank with somebody messing about, but when we looked at the code and checked it on the internet then that made us think this is very, very serious and not just an ordinary prank.”"
2016-08-19T12:06:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Boris left in charge as Fox fumbles and a North Korean jumps ship,"Monday Six years ago the country took a collective deep breath when it realised one of the fallouts of coalition government was that Nick Clegg was being left in charge of the country while David Cameron went on holiday. Up till then the whole point of the Lib Dem leader in the national psyche was that he shouldn’t be left in charge of anything. Fast forward to this week and what we wouldn’t give for Nick, as we now have Boris Johnson in charge. Theresa May clearly understood how terrifying those of us left behind in Blighty would find the prospect as she made sure no one found out the news until she was safely out the country herself, on holiday in Switzerland. If it’s possible to worsen international relations and start a third world war in two weeks then you can rely on Boris to find a way. No one knows this better than our very own home secretary, Amber Rudd. During the referendum campaign, she described Boris as “not a man you want to drive you home at the end of a party”. Who better to deputise for the PM?
Tuesday With Owen Smith suggesting that Britain should start peace negotiations with Isis – good luck with emailing – the New Statesman’s Helen Lewis dug up some of the more bizarre parliamentary early day motions to which Jeremy Corbyn has added his name over the years. Predictably, given the row about Trotskyist entryists to the Labour party, the 1988 EDM in which Corbyn called on the Soviet government to give complete rehabilitation to Leon Trotsky was the one that made the headlines. But the one tabled in 2004, and signed by both him and John McDonnell, which declared “This house is appalled at the revelations in MI5 files regarding the inhumane proposals to use pigeons as flying bombs; recognises the important and life-saving role of carrier pigeons in two world wars and wonders at the lack of gratitude towards these gentle creatures; and believes that humans represent the most obscene, perverted, uncivilised and lethal species ever to inhabit the planet and looks forward to the day when the inevitable asteroid slams into the Earth and wipes them out thus giving nature the opportunity to start again” remains my favourite. Wednesday Trying to keep up with what Brexit means other than Brexit is becoming ever more confusing. Once we were going to be triggering article 50 the day after the country voted to leave the EU but now it keeps getting kicked further and further into the long grass. Some time in 2019 is now being suggested as the earliest date possible – a date so close to the next general election it almost certainly won’t happen until afterwards, at which point the next government will feel it has a mandate to push it back even further. Not even those who are meant to know what is going on seem to know what is going on. Last week Liam Fox issued a press release on the Department for International Trade’s website that in effect admitted that were Britain to leave the European single market it would trade with the rest of the EU under World Trade Organisation rules. This week that particular press release has been taken down from the department’s website. It seems that someone has finally got round to telling the Fantastic Mr Fox that telling everyone they will have to pay 10% more on imported cars and 12% more on clothes when he had previously assured the country the EU would be falling over backwards to conduct free trade deals with the UK was not being exactly on message. Thursday The Olympic medal haul keeps growing and growing. And long may it last. For years as a kid I had to live through the disappointment of Britain winning just four or five gold medals at best and can still remember the effort of trying to get excited about having a banker in Rodney Pattison in the Flying Dutchman sailing class. Nor do I care if the country’s success has been bought with lottery funding. Given the amount of money the government manages to waste on not being able to make up its mind on Hinkley Point C, HS2, London’s third runway and Brexit, a few million quid to Britain’s cyclists to cheer us all up once every four years seems like money very well spent.
But I do detect a certain complacency setting in. Not just in the “Oh, it’s only a silver” department but in the “We’re doing brilliantly to be second in the medal table”. Why settle for 20 or so golds when there are so many more we could be winning? Britain’s record in the shooting and fencing has been fairly dismal. Surely it wouldn’t take that much lottery money to train people to shoot straight or take someone out with a sword? An SAS sniper should be nailed on for a gold with a little more help. Friday MI5 has a new secret weapon. Along with being generally fed up with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean diplomat, Thae Yong-ho, cited “the London congestion charge” as one of the main reasons for his defection from his posting in the UK to South Korea. From now on, it seems as if traffic enforcement will have to join honey traps, dead letter drops, undercover surveillance and leaving top secret laptops in pubs in Vauxhall in the security service’s training manual for dealing with rogue states. Why stop at charging £11.50 per day to drive in central London (reduced to £10.50 if you pay by Autopay, but don’t tell foreign embassies that)? Let’s wheel clamp them into gridlock in the battle for hearts and minds. A few fixed penalty notices should have Isis rushing round the table to negotiate with Smith. The fly in the ointment is that Thae seems to be alone among London’s diplomatic community in being honest enough to pay the congestion charge. As of December last year, overseas embassies owed more than £80m in unpaid congestion charge fines. The US topped the list with £8m, closely followed by the Japanese, Russian and Nigerian embassies.

2016-08-19T13:10:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Student wins lawsuit forcing IPCC to re-examine assault claim,"A student who alleges he was assaulted by police during a demonstration has won a lawsuit forcing an official watchdog to conduct a fresh examination of his allegations. The Independent Police Complaints Commission had cleared the police of misconduct during the demonstration against education cuts at Warwick University in December 2014. But a high court judge ruled on Friday that the IPCC was wrong to dismiss Lawrence Green’s allegations. Green, 26, said he suffered excruciating pain and temporary blindness after a West Midlands police officer sprayed CS gas into his eyes at close range during the protest. He alleged that police broke national guidelines by spraying him from less than a metre away. The IPCC will now have to reconsider whether police should face misconduct charges after the deputy high court judge Robin Purchas quashed its original decision. He concluded the IPCC’s decision that the police had no case to answer relating to misconduct was unlawful as it was “not rationally supportable on the objective evidence”. On Friday, Green said: “I am very happy with this victory. I hope that this judgment provides help to others who find that the supposedly Independent Police Complaints Commission had tried to cover for and justify brutal violence by police officers.” He had launched legal action after the IPCC rejected his request to review its decision, which he alleged was flawed in a number of ways. He claimed that the IPCC had failed to examine his claims independently and fairly. At a high court hearing in July, his barrister, Fiona Murphy, had described how one of the protesters had assaulted a member of the university security staff when they went into the administration building during the demonstration in 2014. She had said there was a “demonstrably calm” atmosphere for about 50 minutes while the protesters discussed the issue of tuition fees until the police arrived. According to Green, there was chaos as the police “jumped into the group and started to push people around”. The police were attempting to arrest the protester who was later convicted of assaulting the university staff member. Green, from Milton Keynes, had told the court that he saw an officer, PC Simon Lloyd, grab one of his friends “aggressively and pull her forward and to the ground”. He said he had remonstrated with Lloyd, who allegedly “jabbed” at his neck and took out his CS spray. The court was told that Lloyd warned Green to step back but before Green was able to do so, he sprayed him with CS, leaving the student temporarily blinded. “His left eye and the side of his face felt like he had suffered a chemical burn. His sight returned to normal after about seven days and the discomfort to his skin resolved after an outer layer of skin had peeled off,” Murphy had told the court. The court had heard that the watchdog had decided that “there is no evidence to support the various allegations of assault or possible criminal action or misconduct given the circumstances during a public order incident at which the police officers were considered to provide a reasonable and proportionate justification for their use of force at the time”. On Friday, a spokesman for the IPCC said: “We will be carefully considering the judgment and our position over the coming weeks. It would be inappropriate to comment further before relevant decisions have been taken about how to progress the matter.” Lochlinn Parker, Green’s solicitor, said: “The IPCC aims to improve confidence in the police complaints system but in this case where serious deficiencies in the investigation were highlighted and when a high court judge has decided that their decision was irrational, the IPCC has not sought to acknowledge, let alone fix, the problem.”"
2016-08-19T13:18:51Z,uk-news,UK news,"Rip Off Britain's Gloria Hunniford defrauded by impostor, court told","Gloria Hunniford, presenter of the BBC1 consumer show Rip Off Britain, was defrauded of £120,000 by an impostor, the Old Bailey has heard. The broadcaster’s bank account was emptied of the sum days after the impostor arrived at a Santander branch with two people whom the woman claimed were her daughter and grandson. Aysha Davis, a personal banker who was accused of being part of the plot but was acquitted, said the woman told her she had “a few bob” in the bank and had come to add her teenage grandson as a signatory because she had been ill. Davis helped them complete the paperwork, including photocopying their driving licences, at the Croydon North End branch in south London.
Police are still hunting for the impostor and the supposed daughter. Alan Dowie, 18, from Oxted, Surrey, who pretended to be Hunniford’s grandson, was given a suspended sentence. Reyon Dillon, also 18, who laundered some of the cash from the scam, is due to be sentenced next month. The court heard that Santander had reimbursed the £120,000 stolen from Hunniford’s account. Giving evidence, Davis said she had never met Dowie before he walked into the bank, and had to Google Hunniford – who regularly appears on This Morning and The One Show – to find out who she was. “The name on the ID card was Mary Winifred Gloria Hunniford, and sorry to be stereotypical but this lady looked like a Mary,” she told jurors. “I had to Google Gloria Hunniford and even if I passed her on the street I wouldn’t recognise her because she’s not from my time.” Sheilagh Davies, prosecuting, said: “But she’s pretty famous.” Jurors giggled when the defendant replied: “In your opinion.” Handing Dowie an 18-month term of detention, suspended for two years, the judge Timothy Pontius said he accepted the teenager had been a “dupe” in the scam. Pontius told him: “You were the supposed grandson of the Gloria Hunniford lookalike – or look-not-very-much-alike.” He added: “You are not going inside today. I don’t think it would be right to deprive you of a golden opportunity to go to university, get a degree and pursue a productive, honest life in your chosen career.” A Santander spokesperson said: “Santander takes fraud extremely seriously. As soon as we identified this fraudulent activity we alerted the authorities as well as Ms Hunniford herself. We are very sympathetic to the distress caused to Ms Hunniford for being the victim of a scam and, as is our normal practice in a case like this, we have reimbursed her fully for her financial loss. “We have also made significant improvements to our processes to ensure this type of fraudulent activity is prevented in future.”"
2016-08-19T14:23:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Dalian Atkinson death asks hard questions of police and football,"Weeks before he died following a late-night confrontation with police, Dalian Atkinson picked up the phone to his former Aston Villa teammate Tony Daley. As ever, they talked football. The effervescent former striker was back on the football circuit after years in the retirement wilderness, Daley said. “He was getting back into football and seemed really happy. He was back in love with football.” But behind closed doors Atkinson’s health was deteriorating rapidly. For the past year, the 48-year-old had been receiving hospital treatment for a serious liver and kidney condition, with his family making increasingly desperate pleas for help from the football community. Geoff Scott, the CEO of the football welfare charity Xpro Life After Sport, told the Guardian that Atkinson’s family had sought financial assistance for his medical care and wanted help to move him to a private hospital.
Due to the complex nature of his illness, however, Scott’s charity could not help. The family turned to the Professional Footballers’ Association, which had been arranging his travel to hospital for more than a year. Atkinson spoke personally to Gordon Taylor, the PFA chief executive, last Friday. He had been due to see a specialist on Monday, the day he died after being Tasered by police on his father’s doorstep in the quiet Telford suburb of Trench, in Shropshire. Neighbours have described how Atkinson, who also played for Ipswich Town and Sheffield Wednesday, pulled up outside his father’s house in his Porsche 4x4 around midnight on Sunday. He was well loved on Meadow Close, where he first learned to kick a football. Children would flock around his grey Porsche, starstruck by a man who remained a local hero years after his retirement from football in 2001. On Sunday night, though, Atkinson was in “a real state”, his 85-year-old father, Ernest, told a local paper on Monday. “I don’t know if he was drunk or on drugs but he was very agitated, his mind was upset.” Atkinson’s brother Kenroy, 53, said he had ripped a dialysis tube out of his shoulder and was covered in blood, ranting in a “manic state and depressed”. “He got my dad by the throat and said he was going to kill him,” Kenroy told a newspaper. Neighbours were woken by the commotion and called the police. When two West Mercia police officers arrived at 1.30am, witnesses said the unarmed Atkinson stumbled towards them. The officers are said to have warned him he would be Tasered if he continued to move. Then, after another step, one officer fired an incapacitating 50,000-volt shock and the 1.88m (6ft 2in) Atkinson “went down like a lead balloon”, one neighbour said.
One neighbour, Paula Quinn, alleged that the officers discharged their stun guns twice more after Atkinson hit the pavement. Quinn has said that she believed she saw Atkinson being kicked by police. He died 90 minutes later after having a cardiac arrest on the way to hospital. The two police officers were placed under criminal investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, and had been suspended and served gross misconduct notices after witness accounts were given to investigators. Quinn, who lives in a first-floor flat overlooking where the incident happened, told the BBC earlier this week: “They were shouting and kicking so much all I could hear were the boots hitting him. And then the officer who released the Taser stepped back while the other officer still continued to kick, and then I could hear him shout to the other officer that was still kicking, ‘Back off, back off, back off.’ “And then the officer with the Taser asked the gentleman to put his hands behind his back and did so probably two or three times and reactivated the Taser another four or five times after that.” The IPCC has declined to comment on Quinn’s account but has said the type of force used will be investigated. The key issues in the criminal investigation will be whether the decision to use force was justified and then whether the level of force was proportionate to Atkinson’s behaviour. The IPCC has stressed its decision to launch a criminal investigation does not mean the officers did anything wrong. Atkinson’s death has left difficult questions for the police, amid heightened concerns about the disproportionate use of of Tasers against ethnic minorities. Black and ethnic minority people are three times more likely to be on the receiving end of the high-voltage stun gun when it is discharged by officers, according to official figures. Janet Hills, the Black Police Association president, has spoken out about this disproportionate Taser use and urged police to resist calls for the weapons to be made an option for all officers because of the the terrorism threat. In Birmingham, where Atkinson was a household name among football fans, there is simmering resentment that black men are stereotyped by police under “the three Bs: big, black equates to bad”, according to Desmond Jaddoo. The community leader and outreach worker at the Assemblies of the First Born church, opposite Atkinson’s former barber shop in Birmingham, said: “The question is this: was Dalian Atkinson stereotyped? Is that the stereotype that was applied? And if so, why? What threat was he? What de-escalation techniques were used? Why did it escalate to discharging a Taser potentially four times? These are the answers that people want. “We want a clear, open, transparent and rigorous investigation that provides answers and we no longer want to hear about lessons learned. What we want to see is them do something about it.” As the IPCC inquiry gathered pace this week, smashed glass remained scattered outside Ernest Atkinson’s boarded-up front door. On his driveway, where his son was felled, a row of flowers carried tributes to the former striker and a replica football shirt hung on his garden gate. The grief felt by friends and former teammates over Atkinson’s violent death was compounded by the fact that he had recently appeared to be turning his life around. Ian Taylor, another former Villa teammate, who spoke to Atkinson two weeks ago, said the Atkinson was working for a football consultancy firm and phoned him to see what players he could bring to his beloved Midlands club. “He said he was fine. He seemed all right. It was probably only every six months that I’d hear from him, but when he called it was like we spoke yesterday,” Taylor said.
Cyrille Regis, a Midlands football hero who played alongside Atkinson at Villa in the early 90s, bumped into his former teammate at a Wolves under-21s game in Telford recently. “He was the same Dalian – as effervescent as ever, chatty and funny,” Regis said. The former Villa winger Steve Froggatt said Atkinson, who had not let on about his illness, looked well at a Christmas party last year. “Dalian was one of those people who you could never read – you never knew what was going on because he always had that smile on his face,” Froggatt said. “He always had that bravado, so I don’t think anyone had a clue that he’d been struggling outside of football.” For Atkinson – once the “life and soul of the party”, according to Daley, and a big character in the dressing room – it may have been impossible to confide in his former teammates about his inner struggles once he hung up his boots. “With footballers it’s a pride thing,” Daley said. “I don’t think they want to go and ask for help. A lot of them are too proud, let everything get on top of them to the point when it’s a real issue and the cry for help is, in some ways, a little too late.” It remains unclear what drove a “manic” Atkinson to his father’s house late on Sunday evening. But what happened next will be the focus of a closely watched IPCC investigation, soul-searching among the professional football community and, perhaps mostly, a deep sense of grief among Atkinson’s many fans."
2016-08-19T17:36:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Man who has to inform police before having sex loses bid to have order lifted,"A man fighting an order under which he must give police 24 hours’ notice before having sex with a new partner has lost his legal battle to have the restriction lifted. John O’Neill, a 45-year-old IT consultant, could face up to five years in prison if he fails to comply with the unprecedented order. O’Neill was cleared of raping a woman last year, but in a rare move, the judge told the Crown Prosecution Service he still considered him to be dangerous. He was subsequently placed on an interim sexual risk order (SRO), making him the first person in the UK obliged to give police notice before he could have sex. Following the ruling, O’Neill went on television to say his life had been ruined. On Friday, he lost his case after police successfully argued that he posed a risk to the public. Describing him as an attention seeker, the district judge Adrian Lower said: “I have found Mr O’Neill to be a vain, manipulative and grandstanding individual who sought to persuade me that black is white and used the valuable time of professionals to describe sexual fantasies he may or may not have. There is a narcissistic streak to Mr O’Neill, who does trouble me in terms of further contact he may have with other people.” Lower did, however, query the terms of the order, and said they would be revisited, as in their current form they were “wholly disproportionate and frankly unpoliceable”. During the hearing, it was alleged that in 2014 O’Neill had made a series of worrying confessions to his GP and a psychiatric nurse, including the choking of a woman unconscious, that he had thought “a lot” about killing her, and that he needed women “to be scared, or I don’t respond”. York magistrates court heard that despite O’Neill being cleared of rape at Teesside crown court in November, the judge in the original trial, Simon Bourne-Arton, said after the jury was dismissed: “Please could you inform the authorities that although this man has been acquitted, it is my judgment that he is a very dangerous individual.” North Yorkshire police then applied for the order on the basis of comments the single father-of-two allegedly made in 2014. O’Neill, who says he is unable to work because of the terms of the order and has been living rough in a wood outside York, claims his words were misunderstood. The police began their case with statements from a community psychiatric nurse, Kevin Holmes, who had meetings with O’Neill in 2014. In a statement read to court he said O’Neill told him he was having sexually violent thoughts that continued all day. He also allegedly told Holmes he got into fights deliberately so that he would be beaten up and injured. Holmes said: “He said he had been sexually violent towards girlfriends and he was not sure whether they consented. He had stopped asking girlfriends if they consented to sex over the last 12 months.” The court was told O’Neill’s sexually violent thoughts dated back to his teenage years. The court also heard that his GP, Dr Miriam Hodgson, had made notes in which she recorded that his “sex life has become violent … [he] has been seeking out increasingly extreme sexual experiences”. She wrote: “Thinks he may have raped someone – it went further than she expected.” O’Neill said he was being penalised because of his interest in sado-masochism (S&M) and visits to fetish clubs. He said he had discussed S&M with his GP and Holmes in relation to his mental state, and that they had misunderstood what he was telling them. He also said the SRO had had a devastating effect on his personal life. O’Neill’s identity was made public earlier this year after an order protecting his anonymity was lifted. In June he threatened to go on hunger strike in protest at the order. SROs can be applied to any individual who police believe poses a risk of sexual harm, even if they have never been convicted of a crime. O’Neill said he was amazed that the police sought one after his acquittal. Lower, however, rejected his defence and said both Hodgson and Holmes had recorded accurate notes from their meetings with him. The new terms of O’Neill’s order, which also contains restrictions on his use of the internet and mobile phones and requires him to inform police of any change of address, will be agreed on 22 September. After the hearing O’Neill said: “It looks as though I may be able to get my life back after this. I’m still concerned about what the terms of the order will be and I’m very disappointed that the court decided it needed to continue. But it looks as though I will be able to work again, and because of that I may be able to find a home again.” North Yorkshire police said: “The judge has made it very clear that he believes Mr O’Neill poses a risk of sexual harm, and that it is right to have an order against him in place. We will work with the courts to agree suitable prohibitions that will protect the public from the risk Mr O’Neill poses.”"
2016-08-19T18:07:39Z,uk-news,UK news,Fire crews extinguish blaze at Shepherd's Bush tower block,"Fifty people face spending the night away from their homes after a fire ripped through five storeys of a high-rise building in west London. More than 100 firefighters from across west London extinguished a huge blaze in the tower block in Shepherd’s Bush that had engulfed parts of the seventh, eighth and ninth floors. Videos posted on social media on Friday afternoon showed smoke billowing around Shepherds Court, near Shepherd’s Bush Green. London Fire Brigade (LFB) said 20 fire engines and 120 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze at 3.44pm, and that it was under control by 5.30pm. Hundreds of residents were evacuated, many to a nearby community hall that is acting as a base for residents. One woman was treated for smoke inhalation and shock but the LFB said there were no other reports of injuries or unaccounted people. Station manager Paul Hobbs who was at the scene, said: “The fire spread from the seventh floor via the outside of the building. Crews wearing breathing apparatus used jets to extinguish the fire on each floor of the building. They worked quickly in difficult conditions to tackle the fire.”
Annie Oliver and her 19-year-old daughter, Katie McSweeney, were in their flat on the 16th floor. Annie said: “I saw the fire engine stop and I thought, ‘what the hell?’ So I looked out the window and realised the fire was in our building. I woke Katie up and said we had to go.” McSweeney said: “We couldn’t get out for ages. The stairs were full of smoke and completely blacked out so we went back and called the lift and it came, which we were surprised about. We thought they closed lifts down when there is a fire. It was full but we squeezed in. We were choking. “I get quite bad anxiety so I was fully shaking. I can’t believe nobody died. Apparently nobody was even really hurt. How is that possible?” Oliver added: “Our neighbour was hysterical but refused to leave her flat. I kept telling the police that she was there and begged them to go get her. We have been checked out by paramedics and we are fine.” Anwar Joseph, a 19-year-old bartender at a pub under the building, was first alerted to the fire by the smell. He said: “We could smell it from inside the building so a few customers went to the window and we could see a lot of smoke. We decided to go and check from the outside. There were a lot of flames everywhere. “About six windows had burst open. There was smoke everywhere and the flames were so big. I’ve not seen a fire this big before … I wasn’t scared myself but we were all worried about the people in the building.”
Jack Lim, who works in the Aroma restaurant in the shopping complex, saw some residents trapped in their flat. He said: “We saw some people screaming and leaning out of the window when we evacuated. They looked like a young family. I don’t know if they got hurt.” Anita Bidace works as a cashier at Morrisons in the same complex. She said: “We was just at work and we had the security coming in saying ‘evacuate, evacuate’ and we all had to come out. As we were coming out there was glass flying everywhere and so much smoke. It was really scary. “The people who got hurt were taken over to the park where the air ambulance landed,” she added. Natasha Wills, the assistant director of operations at London Ambulance Service, said: “We were called at 4:01pm to reports of a fire at an address in Shepherd’s Bush. “We sent multiple resources including ambulance crews, single responders in cars, our hazardous area response team and an incident response officer. We have treated one patient on scene, but they were not taken to hospital. We remain at the scene.”
The A402 Shepherd’s Bush Green was closed both ways. Witnesses also said on Twitter that a nearby cinema had been evacuated and the Shepherd’s Bush Central line tube station was temporarily closed. The fire was under control by 5.32pm but crews remained at the scene damping down. The brigade said that the cause of fire was under investigation."
2016-08-19T18:58:53Z,uk-news,UK news,"More than 50,000 Londoners trial first night tube","More than 50,000 travellers took advantage of the first-ever all-night services on the London Underground on Friday night, with officials hailing a “superb start” to the long anticipated night tube. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, was on board the first Victoria line service in the early hours of Saturday, telling fellow passengers they were “making history” by riding on the tube’s first all-night trains. “You can feel the buzz, you can feel the vibe. People are really excited,” Khan told the Press Association. Oxford Circus was one of the busiest stations, with 6,500 people tapping in, while 4,250 people tapped out at Stratford station, according to figures released by Transport for London. Mark Wild, London Underground’s managing director, said: “Night tube got off to a superb start last night with thousands of people making use of the new services. I was out on the network myself last night, seeing our staff and British Transport police (BTP) officers helping customers travel around the capital safely.” A spokeswoman for the BTP said it had been called to just four incidents on the first run of the night tube, which was “in line with what we would expect to see on a Friday night”. “At this stage we are not aware of any crimes being committed,” she added.
Arriving a year later than the date pledged by London’s former mayor, Boris Johnson, and limited initially to just two of the 11 lines, the new service was trumpeted on Friday by Khan, who said that passengers would include nurses, security guards, tourists and even “a middle-aged clubber like me coming home after a late night out with your missus”. Above ground, however, businesses ranging from hotels to pubs and retailers are hoping for an immediate fillip from the introduction of a service tipped to add as much as £77m to London’s economy annually and generate up to 2,200 new jobs. The phased move into 24-hour operation begins with trains running all night on Fridays and Saturdays on the Central line, the tube’s main east-west artery, and the Victoria line, which runs from Brixton to Walthamstow Central. With trains roughly every 10 minutes through the night, Transport for London (TfL) said nocturnal journeys would be 20 minutes quicker on average, with many passengers saving more than an hour. On the high street the first tentative economic ripples from the service were in evidence on Friday with an announcement by Tesco that several of its stores would be opening for 24 hours on a trial basis along the Victoria and Central lines.
“A night service is long overdue from London’s perspective and from an international one,” said David Lutton of the business lobby group London First, which co-authored a report into the impact of the service. Its supporters say London will now be able to compete with other “24-hour” European cities, including Amsterdam and Berlin. “New York has had one for more than a century for example, so it’s taken a while to catch up,” said Lutton. “What this particularly will give a boost to is the kind of leisure, hospitality and retail sectors of London which are already incredibly critical in terms of attracting the 35 million tourists who come here every year.” The service also feeds into changing labour trends, according to Lutton, which have seen people working later. “In a lot of ways the demand for 24-hour transport is employment-driven rather than entertainment-driven and if you think about it, small changes in productivity can make a big difference. That’s anything from an investment banker working late to the film and production companies of Soho who are exporting digital expertise to the west coast of the US and have to work to their client’s time expectations.” Concerns remain however not just about the social impact of the change, but also around claims by some industry cheerleaders that existing licensing regimes in parts of the city will prevent the night-time economy from fully benefiting. Alan D Miller, chair of the Night Time Industries Association, said that his members were looking forward to a service that would “prevent the last meal rush to get the last tube” but had concerns that much of London’s nightlife was being suffocated. “It’s come in a week when some of the best clubs in London have been in all sorts of trouble,” he said, instancing the case of the iconic nightclub Fabric, which closed its doors indefinitely this week as police investigate the drug-related deaths of two teenagers within weeks of each another. “The night tube is fantastic but we need somewhere to go. There are premises with licences that allow them to be open post-midnight through to 6am but there are only a few in London which are almost 24 hours and they are rapidly diminishing. We allegedly have 24-hour licensing but in many areas people have had venues reviewed and closed down by local authorities.” Khan has spoken of wanting to help London’s nightclubs to “flourish” and prevent a situation where young and creative Londoners abandon the city for Amsterdam, Berlin, or Prague. An investment of £3.4m by his mayoralty will result in about 100 British Transport police officers being on patrol across the network on Friday and Saturday nights. Supt Chris Horton, the officer responsible for policing on the underground, said there was no reason for passengers to be less safe than during the day. He said officers would focus on being visible and “in places that are likely to see significant issues”."

Share your stories and photographs,"Period drama series Poldark, set in Cornwall, was one of the most talked-about programmes of 2015. As Poldark returns to our screens for its second series, we’d like you to tell us what you love about Cornwall. Adapted by Debbie Horsfield from novels by Winston Graham, Poldark follows a handsome captain Ross Poldark who, after fighting in the American War of Independence, returns to Cornwall to take over his father’s mine. Yet he’s met with a different Cornwall to the one he left behind: the population is starving due to falls in the price of tin – the region’s largest export. A scene in which Aidan Turner, who plays Poldark, wields a scythe with his top off was voted top TV moment of 2015 by Radio Times readers. But fans of agrarian scenes and topless scything will be disappointed this time around, as programme makers have said the eponymous hero would keep his shirt on in the next series. Horsfield blames the Cornish weather: “unfortunately autumn is very chilly in Cornwall, so he won’t be doing any in that.” To celebrate the second series, we’d like you to tell us what you love about Cornwall. Show us what you love about the region by clicking the ‘Contribute’ button or by filling in our form below. We’ll use a selection of responses in our reporting."
2016-08-20T09:26:03Z,uk-news,UK news,London night tube: meet the people who travelled on the first night,"It was the night that London’s Underground finally became a 24-hour service, or, as one driver put it in an announcement: “It’s 4am and you lot are still on the tube.” The Victoria and Central lines are the first two underground lines launching a night service. The Northern, Jubilee and Piccadilly lines are expected to follow suit before the year is out. Friday’s service started with little fanfare at Walthamstow Central, as the 00.10 departure, newly classified on the timetable as a night tube, left with only a few people on board. Naso Koutzoukis was one of them. Originally from Athens, and having lived in London for five years, he’d travelled on the train specifically to head in to town to “see the drunken crowds. It should be fun.”
Passenger numbers swelled and the volume of chat rose as the train headed into central London. The aptly named Victoria from Brixton was unconvinced it really counted as the Victoria line night tube yet, as a train ran at this time every evening. She began asking people how they felt about being on the “almost night tube”. “I’m a fucking pest on the tube. People either love it or hate it, but I’m always asking who are you, where are you going, what are you doing.”
On the return journey from Brixton, Kevin Chauphary was much more sure he was on an actual night tube. “I definitely think it’s a momentous occasion for all of us Londoners. It increases safety massively. You are not just loitering around waiting for a night bus.”
Night bus services have also been improved to coincide with the night tube’s launch, with eight routes extended to 24-hour operation to provide additional connections to areas being served by the night tube. At 1.30am, back at Walthamstow Central, with a flurry of TfL officials, press people and a couple of Guardian Angels in attendance, London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, boarded the train. This was now definitely, officially, the night tube.
Asked if he could imagine himself using it when it wasn’t launch night, he said he could, and not just after late nights working at City Hall. “We’ve all been out at restaurants, checking our watches for the last tube home,” he said. “The joy of the night tube is that we won’t have to do that anymore.” He pointedly praised predecessor Boris Johnson for “announcing” the night tube, but stressed the amount of effort that he himself had put in to get the details right – not just with TfL and their workforce, but with entities such as the British Transport police and with local residents. “Cities like Berlin and Copenhagen have 24/7 metros at the weekend, and it’s time we had one too. By the end of the year we’ll have the five main tube lines running.”
Earlier, between journeys, crews of orange-clad contractors were trying to keep the trains clean. It was the first day on the job for one of the cleaners – proof that the night service is already delivering some of the promised economic benefits with new jobs. But how good are the jobs? Asked about the conditions of those helping the service to operate not directly employed by TfL, Khan said he wanted to raise standards. “I want to use the power of procurement at City Hall to ensure not only that we get value for money, but to ensure the people working on services get fair remuneration, and there is trade union recognition,” he said. By now the train was once again in central London, and passengers were gathering around the mayor to take pictures of him. “I was shellshocked,” said one, about seeing Khan on the Victoria line. “Is it appropriate to ask for a selfie with him?” she asked fellow travellers.
Julian, a bus driver, got on at Brixton for the return journey heading back north. He’d just finished working a shift from 6.20pm to 1.45am. “A short one,” he laughed, “normally it is 10 or 12 hours.” The night tube will make a significant difference to his weekend commute. What used to be a 90-minute journey to Finsbury Park by bus would now be just 25 minutes on the tube. “I think it would be a good idea to extend it to Thursday,” he said. “For a lot of people Thursday night is when the weekend starts. I wouldn’t do it on a Sunday though. Everyone would stay out late and not go to work on Monday.”
Away from the trains, at Oxford Circus station, Charlotte Campbell had been busking through the night – packing up at 3.30am. Unsurprisingly, she played her song written about the night tube, Free the Night, on more than one occasion. “It’s like New Year’s Eve,” she said. “I think the night tube brings that out in people. There hasn’t been any rowdiness. It’s been happy drunk, not nasty drunk.” That mood was demonstrated on the escalators at Oxford Circus at 3.45am, as two groups of passengers heading in different directions started chanting and singing “Night tube!” at each other.
One of them, Ibbi, said that the night tube will mean her “getting to do more of London. It’s exactly what London is about, and exactly what London needs.” Alex, who was with her, said the main benefit for him will be spending less money on Uber. It was a name that cropped up again and again in conversations about the alternative methods people would have used to get home without the tubes operating. One of Sadiq Khan’s party asked a passenger: “Are you getting the tube instead of an Uber?” But the reply was: “No, we are getting the tube to go and get an Uber.”
By 4am, Victoria line trains heading out of town had become less of a night tube party and more of a silent slumber. And there were still some of the finer details to sort out. Instead of stating that only the Victoria and Central lines were running, the automatic train announcements take the longer route of listing every other line in the capital as being suspended, which becomes a rather monotonous soundtrack over the course of a journey. The consensus of frontline staff seemed to be that there were fewer passengers than anticipated on opening night. On the ticket barriers at Victoria, one of the new night tube workers, who has taken his role as a second job for an extra bit of income, said that “people are asking questions that indicate really they don’t know much about the night tube. Asking about lines that aren’t even in the plans.” He expected next weekend to be busier, with it being the Notting Hill carnival and bank holiday weekend.
Earlier in the evening, a couple whose flight back from Barcelona was delayed were relieved to find the tube was still running when they reached Victoria, simplifying a journey back to Blackhorse Road that could have added yet more delay to their plans. By 4.30am it was airport traffic heading in an outbound direction using the service instead. The new tube saved at least one business traveller getting an Uber to Victoria in order to head to Gatwick.
At 5am passengers were beginning to include people looking fresh-faced enough that they must be heading out for the day, rather than heading home, and there was the sight of morning make-up being applied while waiting for a train.
But still there were people returning home from either work or leisure. Ahmed was travelling from Oxford Circus to Tottenham after a kitchen shift that finished at 4am. A couple of seats from him, Isobel was returning to Finsbury Park from Brixton, after a night at a house-warming party. The invite had suggested that getting the night tube journey home was one of the reasons it was worthwhile attending. “I’m not sure I’d have gone if it wasn’t for the night tube, or I would have gone but left much earlier. I wouldn’t have fancied the night bus.”
Not everyone had been impressed with the night. There was a group of friends lamenting that they were only 13 when alcohol was banned on the underground in 2008, and Londoners responded by having a boozy tube party. The night tube party hadn’t been anything in the same league, they said: “It’s better than the N91, but it’s not that exciting.” And the real losers last night? The tube’s mice – suddenly finding their weekend nocturnal peace disturbed by trains running every 10 minutes, and the humans that travel on them."
2016-08-20T10:32:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Man swept out to sea by 10ft wave in Cornwall dies,"A man has died after he and his family were swept off a beach in Cornwall by huge waves, despite a sea rescue by lifeboat volunteers. The man was with a woman and a two-year-old child when they got into trouble off Fistral beach, Newquay, on the county’s northwest coast, at about 5.20pm on Friday. Lifeguards managed to rescue all three people but the man died in hospital, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said. Two Newquay RNLI lifeboats, Fistral RNLI lifeguards, the Newquay coastguard rescue team, the police, the air ambulance and the ambulance service all attended the scene, local media reported. “RNLI lifeguards rescued a woman using their jetski and a man and two-year-old child were recovered from the sea by an RNLI lifeboat,” a coastguard spokesman said.
“The child and man were taken to hospital by the coastguard helicopter and the helimed [air ambulance] helicopter. The man, sadly, has since died in hospital.” Falmouth coastguard said conditions during the rescue were treacherous, with 13ft waves and 10ft breaking waves in the area.
According to local radio station Pirate FM, it is thought that the victims were standing on rocks at the beach when they were swept off their feet by a 10-foot wave. Severe coastal weather has seen thrill-seekers taking photos and filming themselves in treacherous conditions while videos of people getting swept along by waves have gone viral online. Craig Woolhouse, Environment Agency flood risk manager, said: “We urge people to stay safe on the coast and warn wave-watchers against the unnecessary dangers of taking ‘storm selfies’.” The rescue came as stormy weather brewed off the west coast of Britain and Ireland, with southwest coasts forecast to see the second-biggest August storm in a decade on Saturday. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning across most of England and Wales, with winds expected to reach 40mph to 50mph inland as a low-pressure system moves in from the west. Met Office forecaster Mark Wilson said parts of Devon were hit by 55mph winds, and Wales by 58mph winds, in the early hours of Saturday, but that they were expected to be “much, much lighter” on Sunday. No warnings have been issued for Sunday. Temperatures are expected to drop from a high of 28C (82F) earlier this week to the low 20s (68F) or high teens in many parts this weekend. However, warmer weather should return from the middle of next week before the August bank holiday. Nicola Maxey, from the Met Office, said autumn had not yet arrived. “There’s certainly some more sunshine around for next week depending on where you are in the country. It’s a low-pressure system passing through, it’s not the end of summer.” The Bournemouth Air festival, set to take place along the Bournemouth seafront, called off its show after exceptionally high water levels damaged the beach stage areas. “With the more severe storm conditions forecast for today, the decision has been taken to cancel the ticketed Sunsets on the Beach at Boscombe Pier and the evening entertainment on the stage at Bournemouth in the interests of public safety,” a spokesman said."
2016-08-20T16:02:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Edinburgh fringe Chilcot recital ends after 284 hours and 45 minutes,"Performers at the Edinburgh Fringe festival have finished a non-stop reading of the Chilcot report into the Iraq war, 284 hours and 45 minutes after starting the 2.6m-word document. Hundreds of volunteers have taken part in the reading, organisers said, which began in a garden shed on South College Street at 6pm on 8 August, and finished at 2.45pm on 20 August. The show’s producer, Bob Slayer, was emotional in the immediate aftermath of the end of the reading, which he called “powerful and phenomenal”. “[The report] wasn’t expected to be read,” he said. “The establishment didn’t expect anyone to read it. Rather like the Latin bible, it’s not for the public, it’s to be shelved away. And yet it has been read here.”
As one of the few people to have genuinely engaged with the 12-volume report in depth, Slayer said he was struck that it did not turn out to be a whitewash, which many people had feared. “This is the establishment admitting that they’ve fucked up,” he said. “Throughout the document you can see that they’ve fucked up. Why did they fuck up? Well, was it for incompetence? Was it for greed, selfishness? I think a combination of all of those. I just keep coming back to what can be done to ensure it doesn’t happen again?” Veterans of the Iraq war, a six-year-old girl, and a man celebrating his 82nd birthday were among the many volunteers who read from the report, according to organisers. “Just in the last hour there was a 14-year-old boy and an 84-year-old man, so there’s been a big range in the sorts of people that have read it,” Slayer said. “And then we had some people go in with guitars, some people rapped, and then there were very reverential readings. I didn’t see anyone who was not giving it respect, but they were doing it in their own way.” Asked about the most poignant moments, Slayer identified volume 12, which dealt with the preparation of the dossier on Saddam Hussein’s alleged weapons of mass destruction, as one that had affected him and other readers. “The quite clear implication was: which is the best way that would lead us to go to war? Which would convince the population and the media that we can go to war, as a PR and marketing machine?”
The longest reading stint was put in by Cammy Sinclair who stayed in the shed for five hours straight, from 2am to 7am on Saturday morning, dressed throughout as a giraffe. Sorcha Shanahan, who helped organise the volunteers, said the most important part of the performance was the way it connected people to the way power is exercised. “So many people have been coming out realising that people in power and people who make these really big decisions are not actually the wisest and doing it from completely altruistic point of view,” she said. “So many people kept coming out and saying: ‘Well, I could do that better than they did!’” Slayer said the reading had made them notice some bizarre coincidences in the report. “Mark Lawson read on page 666 the declaration to go to war; the executive summary has 911 chapters – nine eleven,” he said. After filming the whole of the performance, Slayer, Shanahan and the rest of the performance team now hope to take their footage and use it in another, more permanent work of art. “There’s more to be done with it, we’ve filmed everything. We’re talking about creating an installation or something that just keeps this from being forgotten,” Slayer said."
2016-08-20T22:22:00Z,uk-news,UK news,London night tube: itâ€™s not just clubbers who can expect to gain,"With the launch of the night tube, London joins a growing group of cities across the globe that have all-night metro services, including New York, Berlin, Sydney and Barcelona. The promotional tube carriages decked out in glittering stars conjure up images of late-night revellers going home after a night out, but night-time users of public transport are a far more diverse group. Transport for London (TfL) estimates that more than half of night bus passengers are commuting to and from work. Economists think the night tube could deliver a significant boost to London’s economy. Initially all-night trains will run only on Friday and Saturday nights on the Victoria and Central lines. The economic consultancy Volterra forecasts that the night tube will generate more than enough in extra fares to cover the costs of running it, create almost 2,000 extra permanent jobs and deliver £3.90 of wider economic benefit for every pound invested. Perhaps the pertinent question is why it has taken so long to get tube trains running overnight. There will be knock-on boosts to other sectors. Supermarket chain Tesco has announced that it will trial 24-hour opening at seven of its stores near Central and Victoria line stations. As high-profile chef Angela Hartnett has pointed out, the night tube will also mean easier lives for those already working in London’s night-time economy. For many in the hospitality industry, the reality of last orders at 11pm is not getting home until the early hours, after hours spent cleaning up and the long trek home on one or more night buses. But the night-time economy extends further than London’s buoyant hospitality industry. Business group London First estimates it is worth at least £17bn a year and employs more than 700,000 workers. The biggest employers are the transport, storage and health and care sectors. TfL estimates the night service will shave 20 minutes off average journey times. It will also add extra capacity to a creaking network: the demand for night buses has gone up by 170% in the past 15 years, far in excess of TfL’s daytime services. The benefits go beyond the economic: there will be cultural benefits from pubs and music venues able to open later (subject to licensing), and safety benefits thanks to reduced demand for illegal minicabs. The picture is not entirely rosy, though. London’s night-time sectors rely heavily on low-paid workers, who struggle to afford to live in zones one and two. Some may have to continue to rely on night buses because they can’t afford the tube fares, or there’s no 24-hour station near them. And many work at night throughout the week, not just at the weekend when the night tube will be running. Business groups have also cautioned that the night-time economy will need more than the night tube in order to thrive. Perhaps that’s why, following the example of Amsterdam, Sadiq Khan has pledged to create a “night mayor” to promote London’s night-time industry."
2016-08-20T23:05:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Life in the Devon village saved by San Francisco tech millionaire,"Woolsery in north Devon has all the features that might be expected of the present-day British village: towering hedgerows bordering winding lanes, tidy culs-de-sac bearing regimented rows of bungalows and, in the centre of the village, the medieval church, the empty listed building and the boarded-up pub. Sonia Hamilton, vice-chairwoman of the parish council, gestures at the listed building, known as the Manor House. “The state of that and the pub was depressing,” she says. On this blustery August day, however, there are signs of change. Workers in hard hats mill around, hoardings are about to go up around the Manor House and the dilapidated pub is sheathed in tarpaulin. Last week planning permission was granted to convert the Manor House into a 19-room hotel, while restoration of the Farmers Arms pub to something approaching its former glory is due to be completed by the end of next year. For unlike other villages across the country facing the plight of dwindling shops and services, coupled with declining populations and rising house prices, Woolsery (also known as Woolfardisworthy) is the unlikely beneficiary of the largesse, coupled with some business savvy, of Michael Birch, a laidback tech entrepreneur who lives in San Francisco.
Birch, who with his wife Xochi founded and then sold the social networking site Bebo, was born in Cambridgeshire but spent much of his childhood visiting relations in Woolsery, and there are members of six generations of his family buried in the churchyard. He was alerted to the village’s plight by his sister, Hilary, and decided to spend some of the £300m nest egg generated by the sale of Bebo on preserving the village. “What he’s doing is madness, of course, but he knows his pubs,” said Hamilton, who set up an action group with her husband to save the pub. Birch has professed to having fond childhood memories of the Farmers Arms, and bought the interior of an English pub and transplanted it to a club he set up in San Francisco. The irony of someone who made his fortune by creating a virtual social space choosing to invest that money in a physical social space goes unremarked. “He’s been good to his word, and everything he’s said he would do he’s come through and done it,” she said. “He’s spent a heck of a lot of money on it. He could become the local squire, I suppose, but it comes down to his personality and that’s not really him. He’s not coming here to lord it over us.” Birch also bought the fish and chip shop next to the pub, where manager Jay Oyarzabal enthused about working for him. “This is the spearhead of the operation,” said Oyarzabal, standing behind the counter before a blackboard offering fresh fish from nearby Ilfracombe and pulled pork hotdogs. “It’s not like working for a company,” said Oyarzabal. “It’s like family. I don’t have to turn a profit here. That’s not Michael’s thing. We break even. What he cares about is having it for the village. “It’s been blown up with people saying he’s the saviour of the broken village. The village is lovely as it is, but we’re incredibly lucky. I don’t think that anyone but a multimillionaire could do what he’s doing.
Next door, in the village shop, owner Andy Fryatt said that he had already seen the benefits of Birch’s activities. “The guys working on the site come in here to get bits and pieces, then the new businesses in the village will create jobs, there will be an impact on house prices, the whole package. There have been several remarks about dying villages that have put people’s backs up. In the centre of the village this shop was last man standing. We’ve been keeping the heart of the village beating. Now there’s going to be someone else.” He is another unusual figure in the village’s atypical story. While 200-300 village shops close every year, Fryatt, despite not having a background in retail, runs a thriving business. “Village retail has been in long-term decline for more than 20 years,” said Kenneth Parsons, chief executive of the Rural Shops Alliance. “In the past you could be an amateur but now customers don’t take prisoners; they expect high standards, supermarket-style standards.” Others point to transport and housing as causes of the decline of many villages, and even Hamilton admitted that one potential downside to Birch’s investment could be an increase in house prices. “It is great to see someone so clearly attached to the village aiming to give it a new lease of life, and restoring places at the centre of the community,” said Shaun Spiers, chief executive of the Campaign to Protect Rural England. Referring to research showing that only one in 10 rural houses were affordable to the local population, he said: “This of course has a knock-on effect. Many local people are unable to afford to stay and patronise the pub or shop, or send their children to the local school. Too many villages are being sealed off. Villages should be beautiful, but they must be vibrant communities full of life too.”
Hamilton, standing next to what will become a much-needed village green linking the school to the church, pondered the fate of Woolsery. “Is it a village in decline? As a community I don’t think it is, but the pub is a real centre. At the moment we’re spread to the four corners. It’s nice seeing it coming back to life.” Her thoughts are given an academic sheen by a study into the contribution of local pubs to rural communities published at the end of 2014 by Northumbria University in Newcastle. “The English rural pub is not simply a place for drink, it has become a hub for the community’s infrastructure offering events, support and friendship,” the report found. “Pubs function as physical hubs which foster engagement and involvement among the community, as well as creating jobs for locals and local suppliers.” Carol Bonnefin, who has lived in Woolsery for more than 30 years, was more straightforward. “What we need is a pub, and we need it now,” she said. “The Farmers Arms was somewhere you could go and have a pint. Tuesday evening was bell-ringing. You could do that and then go in the pub. It was the centre of the village. They used to hold parish council meetings upstairs, and the assizes.” Hilary Birch, the entrepreneur’s sister, agreed that the value of the pub and the hotel were greater than mere bricks and mortar. “It’s incredibly important to have these community buildings in a village,” she said. “It’s where people get a sense of community and of belonging.” • This article was amended on 23 August 2016 to add the other name of the village, Woolfardisworthy."
2016-08-21T07:51:22Z,uk-news,UK news,Mother and son killed as fierce winds and high waves hit UK coasts,"A mother and her seven-year-old son were among three people who died on Saturday as strong winds and rain battered parts of Britain’s coast. The 37-year-old woman and the boy were among five people pulled from the sea after they got into difficulty while playing at Aberdeen beach. They later died in hospital. Another boy, aged 13, was still being treated in hospital along with a 25-year-old woman and a man aged 28. They had yet to be named. Chf Insp Stewart Mackie, of Police Scotland, said: “This is a very tragic incident which has resulted in a woman and young boy sadly losing their lives. It will undoubtedly bring shock and sadness to the entire city of Aberdeen and farther afield. Given the recent weather we’d urge members of the public to take care, especially when near coastal or beach areas.” The third victim was a windsurfer, in his 60s, who died in hospital in Colchester shortly after being rescued by the crew of a lifeboat from the sea off West Mersea, in Essex. A police spokesman said they were trying to establish the events leading up to his death. Mersea Island, which is situated where the Blackwater estuary widens out into the North Sea, has become a hub for wind and kitesurfers in recent years. The Met Office issued a yellow “high winds” alert for East Anglia’s coast on Sunday, warning that winds could gust at more than 50mph. Earlier, on Friday, tragedy struck a family of five from Surrey who were on a trip to Fistral Beach in north-west Cornwall. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said a man was swept out to sea with his wife and two-year-old daughter, and he later died in hospital. Lifeguards reached the man and his wife, said to be in their 30s, and the girl, amid treacherous conditions with 13ft waves. Two other children in the family managed to scramble back on to the rocks. James Instance, of Falmouth coastguard, told the BBC: “We went through a 24-hour period where the waves went from half a metre to three to four metres. You are probably looking at 10ft breaking waves in this area.” Gales hit Wales and southern and central England, bringing a very unsettled and blustery end to the recent sunny spell. The unseasonal weather caused summer events to be cancelled at short notice and the Environment Agency called for walkers who were planning a coastal stroll this weekend to avoid taking photographs in dangerous spots. Craig Woolhouse, Environment Agency flood risk manager, said: “We urge people to stay safe on the coast and warn wave-watchers against the unnecessary dangers of taking ‘storm selfies’.” Temperatures are expected to drop from a high of 28C earlier this week to as low as 20C or even the high teens in many parts over the weekend. Warmer weather should return from the middle of next week, just in time for the August bank holiday."
2016-08-21T11:30:15Z,uk-news,UK news,"Pigs, Brexit and China: what’s the future for Britain’s farmers?","Anna Longthorp likes looking at her pigs. She stands, hands on hips, with the relaxed gait of a woman used to the challenges of keeping upright in a cracked and furrowed field, and watches her animals. “If your pigs are happy they’ll be more productive,” she says, bluntly. The sturdy porkers in front of us, part Landrace for the long loin, part Duroc for the intra-muscular fat, certainly look the part. Outdoor bred, free range reared, they snuffle in the sandy earth, breaking off to chase each other from one end of their low-density plot to another. Away in the distance are the heavy industry of the Drax and Eggborough power stations, but here, on this reclaimed airfield, is pig heaven. “A story sells,” Longthorp says, wryly. She knows that the manner in which she raises many of her animals is exactly what a lot of Britain’s food-aware customers want. Attach words such as “outdoor reared” and “free range” to the crackled Sunday roast and the price goes up. If the story is right it will attract a premium. But the bigger story of the British pig business is nowhere near as straightforward or cheery. It is an example of the way agriculture has become a globalised business; one in which even the produce raised closest to our kitchens is at the mercies of economic imperatives shaped far away. Shoppers may say they want a certain type of product: cared for in Britain by someone like Anna Longthorp; working for a family farm rather than some huge corporation; supplying their meat through as few hands as possible. But the reality can be rather different.
One of the reasons Longthorp likes looking at these pigs, spending their last few weeks on her unit near Snaith on Yorkshire’s East Riding, is that these are the ones she could afford to fatten up herself. The British pig industry goes through cycles of boom and bust and right now it is recovering from a major bust. In response to EU sanctions on Russia for its invasion of the Crimea in 2014, Russia introduced a tit-for-tat embargo on various food stuffs, including pig meat, from western Europe. Germany had ramped up production to meet Russia’s growing appetite. Suddenly that market was gone. That meant oversupply which in turn meant the European-wide price of pig meat plummeted. Britain has not generally exported to Russia. Still Britain’s pig farmers, locked into the European market price, suffered. It costs about 130p a kilo to produce pork. Earlier this year the price farmers were receiving dropped to just 112p. Many British farmers were losing between £10 and £20 a pig for every one they sold. Longthorp was partly protected from the worst of this. Eight years ago, in her mid-20s, she took over the pig business that had been established by her mother 25 years ago and set up a brand called Anna’s Happy Trotters. It sells her outdoor bred and free range animals and products such as bacon and sausages produced from them. Through hard marketing work, she established a premium price of 220p a kilo for meat sold under that brand, to take account of her much higher costs, and has been able to stick to it. There’s money in a good story. The business has two units, each with 700 breeding sows, and produces 650 pigs a week for slaughter, at a rate of around 23 piglets a year from each sow, across just over two litters annually. Only a quarter of that is free range due to lack of land. Her more standard production has been subject to lower prices. She also breeds too many pigs for the amount of space she has. She used to send some out for what’s called “bed and breakfasting”: getting another farmer to fatten them up before returning them to her for slaughter. But with prices plummeting she could no longer afford to do this. “I now sell a lot of weaners,” she says, referring to the piglets. “It’s a way of reducing risk and locking in some profit.” She’s not happy about it. The result of the past few rocky months has, unsurprisingly, been a contraction in the British industry. “We think we can identify about 20,000 breeding sows that have gone out of the national herd,” says Peter Crichton, a pig market expert who writes a trade magazine column on the industry. “That’s about 5% of the breeding herd. In the long term we will be shorter on domestic pork.” In the 1980s the UK breeding herd was more than 800,000. Now it’s fallen below 400,000. At one point we were about 80% self-sufficient in pork. Now it’s 55%. However, because of exports, only 40% of the pork we consume in Britain is actually produced here. That matters because Britain is unique in the way it raises its animals. In this country while only 2–3% is entirely free range, 40% is outdoor reared and another 30% is raised on straw in open sheds. Accreditation systems such as the Red Tractor mark, which require four visits a year from vets, enforce higher welfare regimes. In the rest of Europe – including the likes of Denmark and the Netherlands – pig farmers have historically followed lower welfare regimes. Almost all of it is intensively reared indoors on a slatted system without straw. This has cost efficiencies. In the straw-based system there’s the obvious cost of the straw and the labour to remove it when it’s soiled. In slatted systems, used for just 30% of UK pig production, faeces simply fall through the floor.
Longthorp’s pigs are raised in circumstances that could be described as bucolic; the slatted system really isn’t pretty. Those who are appalled by the very notion of farming pigs, who regard the realities of the industry described here as repellent, will make little distinction between methods. It will all be atrocious. But to many consumers these things matter, not that retailers always respond. The big supermarkets are still buying lots of this lower welfare pork, much of it imported, for their standard ranges. That pressure on price has partly come about through the rise of the discounters, Aldi and Lidl. Because they buy small ranges in large volume and spend little on frills, the discounters generally pay a good price and are regarded as good customers. “It’s the way the big four supermarkets try to take them on that’s the problem,” says Crichton. “When foreign pig meat is cheaper than ours they’ll simply bring it in.” Historically one of the reasons so much of Britain’s pig industry is less intensive is the difficulty of getting planning permission for the facilities. But there is also simply a greater interest in animal welfare in the UK compared to much of continental Europe. There is an understanding that pigs are not dumb; that they need stimulation. As Anna Longthorp says: “The consumer is willing to pay enough if the story is right.”
David Owers, a pig farmer from Lincolnshire these past 45 years, uses an indoor straw-based system. He says he thinks it’s best for welfare, though the supermarkets aren’t prepared to pay enough for it. We stand looking into one of his open-sided sheds, at sprightly pigs, now at around 35kg each, bouncing around bales of hay. “A slatted system would be cheaper but this is the most viable if you care about welfare,” he says. I suggest the best welfare system actually involves having them free range and outdoors. He disagrees; having sows indoors in crates for weaning stops them rolling over on to piglets. “Our mortality rate is about 5.5%. Outdoor reared systems have a mortality rate of 10% to 13%.” I put this to Longthorp, who surprises me by agreeing. “Our mortality figures aren’t as good as indoors,” she says, as she leads me around the fields housing the breeding unit. Here the sows come and go from the sheds in which they wean. And yes, they lose piglets. “But it’s about quality of life. Truth is, the label doesn’t mean much. You can have good free range and bad free range, good indoor and bad indoor.” So what can the consumer do? “Look for things like the Red Tractor mark,” she says. One of the big problems for British pig producers is the volatility of the market. After that low of 112p a kilo, producers in Germany slaughtered breeding sows to reduce supply. That lifted prices. Then Brexit happened and the pound began to slide, a nightmare for importers but for exporters paid in euros it was a godsend. Not only was the base price on the up, but so was the value of that currency.
But the greatest international influence on prices has been the Chinese market. The country now produces half of all the pork on the planet. A surprisingly large amount of that production has been on what would be recognised in Britain as a 19th-century model: peasant farmers keeping two or three pigs in their backyard. In the past year the Chinese introduced a new five-year plan to phase out backyard pig rearing and expand modern production. They also want to spread production more evenly around the country, rather than have it concentrated in small pockets. In response to the uncertainty, production in China has plummeted and prices have risen. Pork producers in China are now getting around 220p a kilo, ahead of most premium producers in the UK. They’ve also been importing more. It used to be just the so-called “fifth quarter” – offal that the British didn’t want. Now they are taking whole animals. Shipments to China from Britain in the year to May were up 72%. China now accounts for half of all British exports. This suggests opportunities for the future. However when prices settle, as they invariably will, it’s likely that the Chinese will come after the intensively reared European production, leaving the British once more out in the cold. As a result there are expectations that the industry will continue gently to contract and the family-owned model will become increasingly difficult to maintain. You may like the idea of your roast coming from an army of Anna Longthorps. The reality may well be rather different. “What we’ve seen for the past few years,” says Mick Sloyan, pork director of the industry body AHDB, the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, “is individual farms staying the same size but being taken over by farming corporations. Already just 16 farm businesses produce 50% of all the pigs in this country.” Currently, he says, there is a market in the UK for the 40% that are outdoor reared and then finished inside on straw. “They’ll be fine.” The rest will just have to hope the supermarkets are prepared to pay enough, or go intensive.
Or farmers will simply quit. Tim Chapman, from North Yorkshire, is one of these. He’s been at it for 36 years. He’s been through spikes in feed price and the foot and mouth crisis. Finally he’s had enough. He’s winding down his 550-strong breeding unit. “In the end it wasn’t just the money we were losing,” he says. “I needed further investment which was going to be tricky and there were staffing issues. It was just everything.” Then he had a conversation with a local butcher and discovered that however little he was paid as the farmer, the processor always made the same profit. “In this industry all the risk goes on the farmer.” And so another part of Britain’s pig-rearing tradition goes. What does all this mean for the future? In the long term, the pig industry will probably become more like the wine business. At one end will be a high-welfare, low-intensity premium product, flogged to those whose interest in the way the animals they eat are cared for is matched only by the depths of their pockets. The rest of the industry will be buffeted by the cold winds of the international markets. Mainstream consumers may claim an interest in welfare. They may say they want the best. But all too often it comes down to simple pounds and pence. At which point it’s the pigs that suffer."
2016-08-21T12:41:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Woman gets £2m   over near-drowning in school swimming lesson,"A woman who won a judgment against her local authority after she nearly drowned during a school swimming lesson 16 years ago has been awarded £2m in compensation. Annie Woodland was a 10-year-old pupil at Whitmore junior school in Basildon, Essex, when she was pulled from the water and resuscitated at Gloucester Park pool in July 2000. She suffered severe brain damage as a result. She still has memory problems, fatigue, poor balance and says the hidden nature of her injury makes it hard for people to understand. Her parents began a legal battle and, in 2013, the supreme court made a ruling that Essex county council owed a “non-delegable duty of care”, despite the swimming lessons being contracted out to a third party. At the trial that followed last year, the high court concluded that the lifeguards and swimming teachers responsible for supervising Woodland had breached their duty of care. A settlement of £2m has just been agreed, with the local authority paying two-thirds and the lifeguard at the time making up the rest. Woodland, now 26, lives in the Blackpool area with her partner, Sam Hill, and their 13-month-old son, Joey. “If I didn’t have Joey I would probably be in quite a bad way still. I have had years of depression, but I just look at him and I am happy,” she said. “I’ll never get over what happened, but I’ve got to move on with my life now and make the best of it for his sake.” Woodland is unable to work and lawyers handle her finances as she does not have the capacity to manage her own affairs. “I can’t even explain what it’s like,” she said. “It affects everything, but you try and explain what’s wrong with you and people don’t believe it ... It’s a lonely place to be.” Her mother, Alison, 50, said Annie had been “a happy, confident little girl”. She said the legal action had not been driven by money but to stop it happening to anyone else: “At least I know now that whatever happens in the future she is going to be safe and secure.” The family’s lawyer, Jennifer Maloney, a serious injury specialist at the law firm Slater and Gordon, said: “Annie is a brave young woman who has been forced to spend most of her childhood and all of her adult life dealing with the devastating consequences of what happened. She deserves some peace of mind which I hope this settlement will bring.” An Essex county council spokesman confirmed that the local authority had agreed the settlement."
2016-08-21T13:38:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Greater Manchester has as many Olympic golds as Brazil and Spain,"If Greater Manchester was a country, it would currently be sitting level on the Olympic leaderboard with Spain and just behind host nation Brazil. Residents of the region have now won seven gold medals, four silvers and one bronze in the Rio Games.
The figure can largely be explained by the phenomenal success of Team GB’s cycling squad, many of whom live near the Manchester velodrome, and who have won 11 medals. If the medals won by Greater Manchester residents were removed from Team GB’s overall haul, the UK would fall from second to fourth place. Theresa May announced on Saturday that Manchester would join London in hosting a parade for the UK’s Olympians in October, following calls for an official celebration to be held outside the capital to reflect the fact that the country’s athletes come from across the UK. The prime minister said it would be “a celebration fit for heroes – and rightly so, because that is exactly what they are.” The deputy leader of Manchester city council, Sue Murphy, said the city had been a “medal factory”, pumping out golds as the home of British cycling and British Taekwondo. “It’s fantastic to see the product of years of hard work and training at the centres of excellence in east Manchester,” she said. Among Greater Manchester’s Olympians are the cyclist couple Laura Trott and Jason Kenny, who won two and three gold medals respectively, and Taekwondo star Jade Jones. The National Cycling Centre’s velodrome was built in 1994 for Manchester’s failed bids to host the 1996 and 2000 Olympic Games, and was the UK’s first indoor cycling track. More than 15 track cycling world records have been set on the track, which hosted events in the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The National Taekwondo Centre is also in Manchester. This article was amended on Sunday 21 August. It had wrongly stated that an independent Greater Manchester would be sixth on the medal table"
2016-08-21T16:18:54Z,uk-news,UK news,Oil rig stranded off Isle of Lewis to be refloated at high tide,"Salvage experts have said they will try to refloat at high tide a 17,000-tonne oil rig that has been stranded on the coast of the Isle of Lewis for two weeks. The semi-submersible rig Transocean Winner ran aground close to Dalmore beach near Carloway, Scotland, on 8 August. It was being towed from Norway to Malta when a towline snapped in rough seas. If the planned refloat on Monday night is successful, the rig will be towed around the north of Lewis to Broad bay on the east coast, where it will remain until safely transportable to a repair facility. Hugh Shaw, the secretary of state’s representative for maritime salvage and intervention, said: “Good progress is being made in this operation. The plans for the refloat are in place, although this is dependent on the salvage team being able to recover enough buoyancy to enable the rig to refloat safely.” The platform was carrying 280 tonnes of diesel when it ran aground. Experts believe that two of the four storage tanks were damaged when the rig hit rocks, with a potential loss of 53 tonnes of fuel. But there has been no sign of an oil slick or any reports of pollution. Work to transfer the remaining diesel into undamaged tanks began on Thursday. On Sunday, oil company Transocean said 200 tonnes had been successfully transferred from the rig on to a supply vessel. The Marine Conservation Society is sending verification aircraft to fly over the rig and surrounding area to check for leakage. At a public meeting on Thursday evening near the site, Transocean representatives apologised to the local community and assured islanders that no trace of the rig would be left when the salvage operation, which will include a sweep of the seabed, is complete."
2016-08-21T18:25:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan attacks Jeremy Corbyn but mayors are Labour's route to power,"When I asked Sadiq Khan during a video interview to mark his first 100 days as London mayor if he could imagine Labour forming a government while Jeremy Corbyn is its leader, he provided what was then his stock sidestep: “I think what’s important is that we get back into the habit of winning elections.” Only last Wednesday, LBC Radio’s James O’Brien had no more luck than me. But finally, as he’d promised, Khan has set out his position on the Labour leadership contest. Unsurprisingly, he prefers Owen Smith, a fellow occupant of the “soft left” part of the Labour spectrum. “By every available measure, if Jeremy remains as leader, Labour is extremely unlikely to win the next general election,” he writes in the Observer. Winning matters to Khan, and his record shows he’s pretty good at it. Last May, he wasn’t favourite to even become Labour’s mayoral candidate and many doubted he would defeat his Conservative chief rival Zac Goldsmith to take command of City Hall. In the end, he won a dirty fight handsomely. Part of that was down to sheer know-how and steely self-discipline on the campaign trail. These habits seem quite ingrained. Back in July, after the challenge to Corbyn’s leadership began, I found myself walking behind Khan and his entourage as they approached Russell Square Underground station. Joining them, I teasingly inquired: “Mr Khan! Mr Khan! Would you like to become Labour leader?” “I’m not interested in that,” came the instant reply. “I’ve already got the best job in the world.” To which I might have said: “Sadiq, the election’s over. And can’t you tell I’m just winding you up?” I mention this by way of introduction to some parts of my 17-minute video interview that didn’t make the final, four-minute cut (the Guardian keeps these things snappy). Asked about the possibility of pro-EU London securing its own Visa system to enable London employers to continue recruiting and retaining workers from EU member states with relative ease after Brexit, Khan said that such a “work permit scheme” was being “looked into” and that arrangements of that type restricted to people living or working in the capital could also “ameliorate some of the concerns people outside London have about immigration” whilst enabling London - and, indirectly, the rest of the country - to continue deriving the benefits. Here was an example of how Brexit has helped Khan develop his wider case for greater autonomy for London within the UK. I then asked him if he looked forward to next year, when mayors in other large English city regions will be elected - very probably fellow Labour ones. Did he see himself working productively with those counterparts elsewhere in the country? He replied: The direction of travel in those countries that are doing well is devolution of power to cities. There’s a great saying- I think a former mayor of Detroit said this - that if the 19th century was the century for empires, the 20th for nation states, the 21st will be known as a century for cities. The government deserves credit, both the current government and the previous one led by David Cameron and George Osborne, about devolving power out of the civil service in Whitehall to the regions and cities. And I look forward to working with mayors in other parts of the country and, by the way, working also with Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland, with Carwyn Jones in Wales and with Northern Ireland [Assembly] as well. The genie is out of the bottle in Greater Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol, Birmingham and other regions of England. It’s really important for the government to enable us to represent our communities, as we know them best. Given the choice of civil servants in Whitehall making those decisions, or democratically elected mayors with big mandates, I know which I’d choose. Khan’s intervention in the Labour contest has, inevitably, triggering theorising about his long-term ambitions. Was he positioning himself for a future Labour leadership bid? It has also unleashed predictable crank abuse from the more extreme Corbyn admirers and the familiar assertions that Khan owes his victory in London to Corbyn - a highly debatable point, not least given that Khan almost daily distanced himself from Corbyn during the campaign while Goldsmith strenuously and wholly falsely strove to portray him as the Labour leader’s poodle. Whatever thoughts Khan may have about one day leading his party, and despite the boost his Observer article has given Owen Smith, Corbyn still looks set to lead Labour to defeat in 2020. By contrast, Khan’s outline sketch of fruitful collaborations between fellow Labour mayors and like-minded leaders of other devolved UK administrations looks like a piece of a nearer tomorrow in formation - not only for Khan, but for Labour nationally too. Dave Hill is the author of Zac versus Sadiq: the fight to become London Mayor."
2016-08-21T18:33:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Rights group challenges FoI refusal in Libyan rendition case,"A human rights group has challenged the government’s refusal to disclose whether ministers or Downing Street officials were involved in a decision not to prosecute anyone over an espionage operation to kidnap two Libyan dissidents. Reprieve, the group that represents the dissidents, has questioned whether Downing Street is covering up political interference in the decision not to bring charges over the abduction of the dissidents and their families, including a pregnant woman and four children. The group has lodged a complaint with the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, calling on her to investigate the secrecy. The complaint relates to a joint operation run by the CIA and MI6 to abduct Abdel Hakim Belhaj and Sami al-Saadi in south-east Asia and fly them to Libya, where they say they were tortured. Documents discovered by human rights workers in 2011 after the overthrow of the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi revealed how MI6 had participated in the operation in 2004. One was a congratulatory fax from Sir Mark Allen, then MI6’s head of counter-terrorism, to the Libyan government that disclosed that the tipoff for Belhaj’s whereabouts had come from the British.
In June the Crown Prosecution Service announced there was not enough evidence to charge anyone, after studying a 28,000-page file compiled by the Metropolitan police. The previous month Reprieve submitted a request to the Cabinet Office under the Freedom of Information Act asking whether any of its ministers or staff had met or corresponded with the CPS about the investigation. The Cabinet Office said it would not answer the question as it “could neither confirm nor deny whether any relevant information is held”. The department judged that this refusal was justified in the public interest to protect the enforcement of the law. As well as running the prime minister’s office, mandarins in the Cabinet Office advise the PM and other senior ministers on intelligence matters. They also co-ordinate the government’s response to sensitive issues relating to the UK’s spies. Reprieve submitted the same questions to the Foreign Office, which replied that none of its ministers or staff had met or corresponded with the CPS about the investigation, known as Operation Lydd, over a two-year period. The group has complained to the information commissioner, which adjudicates freedom of information disputes, saying the Cabinet Office’s refusal to answer the questions was not justified and made little sense compared to the substantive response from the Foreign Office. In its complaint, Reprieve said:”If the Cabinet Office held meetings or corresponded with the CPS, it could represent unacceptable political interference in an investigation into serious crimes committed by UK officials … The need for independence and the absence of political interference was paramount.”
Cori Crider, a lawyer at Reprieve who represents the two dissidents and their families, said: “Was there subtle political pressure not to bring charges? This response undermines confidence in the whole process.” A spokeswoman for the Cabinet Office said the government had “co-operated fully with the police investigation. It would not be appropriate to comment further as separate civil proceedings are ongoing.” Belhaj and his wife, Fatima Bouchar, have started legal action seeking an apology from the British government and symbolic damages of £1. The supreme court is deciding whether their claim should be allowed to go ahead. In August the CPS rejected an attempt by the dissidents to overturn its decision not to bring charges."

A man who got into trouble outside the safe swim area at Sandbanks beach in Poole, Dorset, on Saturday afternoon is the latest person to be confirmed to have died this weekend during rough coastal conditions. The man, who was seen having difficulties in the rip current, was recovered from the water by lifeguards who performed CPR, Dorset police said. An air ambulance and paramedics attended, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. Later on Saturday, a woman died after being recovered from treacherous seas off Jersey. Rescue boats from Jersey fire service and the RNLI were launched at about 8.20pm after two swimmers were reported to be in difficulty near Green Island beach. A male swimmer was rescued by a member of the public. The woman was later recovered from the water and transported to hospital, where she died, Jersey police said. It was revealed on Sunday that her name was Joy Godfray and she died the day before her 32nd birthday. Police said her family wanted to pass their “heartfelt thanks to the members of the public and all the emergency services who fought to save the life of their daughter”. Also on Saturday, the bodies of a mother and her six-year-old son were recovered from the sea off Aberdeen, and a windsurfer in his 60s died after being caught in difficult conditions off West Mersea, Essex. The pair in Aberdeen were named as Julie Walker, 37, and her son Lucas. It is believed that Walker had gone into the sea to try to rescue him and another boy, 13, who had got into trouble while swimming. The second boy and two other people believed to have gone in to help, a 25-year-old woman and a 28-year-old man, were taken to hospital. On Friday, a man died after he and his family were swept off rocks into the sea in Cornwall. He was named on social media as Rudy Bruynius, who was on holiday with his wife and three children. The family had been walking at South Fistral beach in Newquay. The two boys were able to scramble back on to the rocks and Bruynius’s wife, Lisinda, was rescued on a RNLI sea scooter. The boys were treated for minor injuries. A lifeboat was deployed to rescue Bruynius and the couple’s two-year-old daughter, McKayla. The pair were airlifted to Royal Cornwall hospital, where Bruynius died. McKayla remained in a critical condition on Sunday.
A crowdfunding page set up by a friend to support the family has already raised more than £16,000. An RNLI spokesperson said crews had had an extremely busy weekend with a high number of callouts, and warned people to take care in and around water. “Essentially, the conditions we’ve got are approaching more what you’d expect in late autumn or winter in terms of the swells,” said Peter Dawes, the RNLI lifesaving services manager. “It has caught a lot of people by surprise at the end of the summer holidays. It’s bigger and worse conditions than they’re used to. “We know that more than half the people who get in trouble had no intention of getting into the water – they’re swept off rocks, falling off paths or marinas into water. They have to be aware that water is a very unforgiving environment and you really can’t afford to make a mistake.” Mark Wilson, a Met Office meteorologist, said the rough conditions on Saturday had been caused by a combination of strong winds and spring tides. “We saw an unseasonably deep area of low pressure yesterday that brought strong winds,” he said. “Because that was combined with spring tides, it led to some large waves across western areas in particular. We saw some gusts of 50-60mph. It was this combination that caused these coastal conditions.” Conditions were improving on Sunday, with the low pressure system moving away."

Police and paramedics were called to Sunnyside Road in Islington just before 9pm on Saturday after reports of gunshots. They found the victim, named in local media as Dawud, with a gunshot wound. He was pronounced dead just after midnight on Sunday. Friends of the man said he lived locally and had a young daughter. The Metropolitan police said: “Detectives from the homicide and major crime command are investigating … No arrests have been made and enquires continue.” A 21-year-old man who said he had called police after discovering the victim in the doorway to the studio said the sight had troubled him. “Initially I thought he had been knocked out or something. But then I saw his head open,” he told the Evening Standard. “He had obviously been shot and there was blood everywhere. He was dying.” Friends of the victim reportedly gathered at the scene on Sunday night and lit candles. One told the Standard: “He was a really good guy and a father. And at the same time he used to do a lot to try and be a good influence on the youth in the area. “He was very popular and most importantly a very devout Muslim. It’s always the good guys this happens to.” Two of the candles lit at the vigil were still burning on Monday afternoon, and a cordon remained in place around the spot where the victim was shot. Two bunches of flowers had been placed by the side of the cordon, both with messages saying “RIP David”. The attention of police forensic investigators was focused on Big House Studios, at the top of Sunnyside Road, and a forensic tent stood in the middle of the street."
2016-08-22T14:57:59Z,uk-news,UK news,Scientists hope to prove pigtails belong to HMS Bounty mutineers,"A collection of hair taken from 18th-century pigtails and stored for more than a century in an old tobacco tin has arrived in London for analysis that could prove it belonged to some of the most famous troublemakers in naval history – the sailors responsible for the mutiny on the Bounty. Scientists hope to extract mitochondrial DNA, using the same technique that identified Richard III after the skeleton of the last Plantagenet king was found under a Leicester car park. Researchers would then have the even more challenging task of identifying an unbroken female line to a living descendant, to get a crucial match. “If the hair is in good condition, I don’t see that it would be impossible to extract the DNA – it’s a technique we regularly use in forensic work – but that’s where the difficulties will really begin,” said Denise Syndercombe-Court, the project leader from the analytical and environmental sciences division at King’s College London. The hair is said to be from seven of the nine mutineers and three of their female Polynesian companions, who cast Captain Bligh and the 18 crew members who remained loyal to him adrift on the south Pacific in a small boat in April 1789. The mutineers sailed to Tahiti and then on to establish a new home on the remote Pitcairn Island, where their descendants live to this day.
The incident inspired several books and films, most famously the 1962 version starring Marlon Brando as Fletcher Christian, the leader of the mutiny. One of the pigtails is said to be Christian’s. The pigtails were bought by an American collector at a Sotheby’s auction some years ago, and recently presented by his widow complete with the tobacco tin and a handwritten label with their claimed history, to the Pitcairn Islands Study Centre in California. Herb Ford, the centre’s director, said that despite the notoriety of the story, if the DNA testing and matching was successful it would be the only physical proof of the men’s identity. “If the tests and genealogical studies of this hair authenticates that it is of seven of the nine mutineers who hid out from British justice on Pitcairn Island in 1790, it will be the only tangible physical evidence of their having existed. There is only one known mutineer grave on Pitcairn – that of John Adams. Of the whereabouts of the remains of the eight others, we can only speculate.” Ford first contacted Scotland Yard for help in analysing the hair, and the Metropolitan police referred him to King’s College, whose scientists often work with the force on contemporary crime cases. He has appealed for public help in tracing the mothers of the mutineers, and their direct descendants.
Bligh, who was on a mission to collect breadfruit trees regarded as a possible crop to feed slaves in Caribbean plantations, has gone down in legend as a brutal commander, but in fact was regarded by his contemporaries as a moderate man, exceptionally concerned for the welfare of his sailors. He wrote to his wife: “I have been run down by my own Dogs,” and was baffled by the mutiny. He navigated the small open boat across more than 3,500 miles to the nearest European settlement, and eventually returned to England, where he was cleared in a court martial of losing the Bounty. He died in 1817, and is buried in Lambeth, south London, where his tomb is topped with a breadfruit. Although the package containing the pigtails has arrived safely at King’s, Syndercombe-Court has wrestled with her curiosity and refrained from opening it. “We need to open it under very special clean conditions to avoid contamination as much as possible, so we won’t open it until we are ready to begin work next month,” she said. “But I am told that there are definitely several different colours and textures of hair, so we know at least that we are dealing with several individuals.”"
2016-08-22T15:18:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Offer made on West Heslerton village put up for sale for Â£20m,"An offer has been made on a 2,000-acre North Yorkshire village that went on the market for £20m earlier this year. West Heslerton, which has been owned by the Dawnay family for more than 150 years, was put up for sale in April, giving wealthy individuals the chance to purchase a perfectly preserved, quintessential Yorkshire village where “time has stood still”. From childhood, the late Eve Dawnay, the former owner of West Heslerton, near Malton, loved to build miniature models. When her father bequeathed her the village, she set about creating an archetypal family hub. From its pub, garage, playing fields and sports pavilion, to a 21-bedroom hall and 43 houses, Eve Dawnay left a remarkable legacy when she died aged 84 in 2010: a functioning English village, with a population of about 375 people, preserved in time. With no single heir, the village was left to Eve’s wider family and they decided to sell, hoping to find a wealthy yet benevolent buyer, who would help to preserve the bucolic way of life. On Monday, estate agent Cundalls, which is handling the sale, confirmed that an offer was on the table. “It is correct that it is under offer and it has been for some time now. There was a lot of interest from many different buyers, but we cannot say any more at this stage,” said Tom Watson, the director of Cundalls. “Historically, we have dealt with many estates, but for the past 20 to 30 years, this is our biggest sale.” The village’s Rightmove listing said: “A once-in-a-generation opportunity to purchase a 2,116-acre mixed agricultural, residential and commercial estate with vast development and sporting potential, situated within a beautiful area of North Yorkshire.” The advert, which includes 86 photographs showing characterful cottages and sweeping scenic shots, is marked as being under offer. Eve Dawnay graduated from Oxford University with a degree in French in 1948, and worked in Paris and London before returning to the village. When her father died in 1964, she inherited the estate. The unmarried eccentric kept rents low and, with some clever social engineering, ensured that it retained a vibrant community supporting a host of amenities, including a primary school and football, cricket and bowling teams. The centrepiece of the estate is the 21-bedroom West Heslerton Hall, which has been empty for 30 years since Eve Dawnay downsized to a four-bedroom house in the village. The estate has more than 1,500 acres of agricultural land, including 112 acres of woodland. The annual rental and agricultural subsidy income is listed as about £390,000."
2016-08-23T15:15:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Soldier killed during live shooting exercise in Northumberland,"A soldier has been shot dead during a live firing exercise at a military training area in Northumberland, police have said. Officers were called to the Otterburn army training estate at 11.15pm on Monday. A male soldier had received a serious head wound and was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. A cordon remained in place on Tuesday and police said they would work with the Ministry of Defence to establish the circumstances of the death. The soldier’s name has not been released, but military officials have informed his next of kin. The armed forces minister, Mike Penning, said: “It is with great sadness that I can confirm that a soldier from the Royal Regiment of Scotland has died while taking part in a night live firing exercise at Otterburn training area in Northumberland. “My thoughts are with the soldier’s family, friends and colleagues at this difficult time. The safety of our personnel is our absolute priority and while deaths in training don’t happen often, any death is a tragedy. As well as a police investigation, MoD accident investigators are looking into the circumstances surrounding this tragic incident.” A spokesperson for Landmarc, which manages the base, said they weren’t going to comment on the soldier’s death. Earlier this year, the Unite union warned that the firing range risked becoming “a death trap” when the role of wardens, who prevented people walking into the line of fire, was withdrawn as part of a cost-cutting drive. In the 16 years to February 2016, 135 UK armed forces personnel died while on training or exercise. Eleven of those deaths occurred during live fire exercises. The Otterburn training estate, established in 1911 by Winston Churchill, covers about 93 sq miles of the southern Cheviot hills. It is used for training about 30,000 soldiers a year and is the UK’s second-largest firing range."
2016-08-23T16:35:54Z,uk-news,UK news,Rochdale Muslim leader 'was bludgeoned in Isis-inspired murder',"A former imam was bludgeoned to death in a children’s playground by two Islamic State supporters who believed he practised “black magic”, a court has heard. Jalal Uddin, 71, was murdered by two alleged Islamist extremists who harboured a “hatred and intolerance” of his form of Islam, jurors were told. The respected community leader was targeted as he made his way home from a mosque in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, after months of being surveilled by his alleged killers, the jury heard. The accused – Mohammed Hussain Syeedy, 21, and Mohammed Abdul Kadir, 24 – were Isis supporters who developed a hatred of Uddin after discovering he practised a form of Islamic healing called ruqya, jurors were told. Opening the trial at Manchester crown court, the prosecutor, Paul Greaney QC, told jurors that Syeedy and Kadir “stalked Jalal Uddin around the streets of Rochdale” before Kadir launched a savage attack on the older man in a playground. Kadir unleashed “repeated forceful blows” to Uddin’s head and mouth with a weapon believed to be a hammer, the court heard, leaving him with severe skull fractures. “These injuries were plainly not the result of a robbery gone wrong,” Greaney said. “On the contrary, they were obviously the result of an attack that was planned – why else did the killer have a hammer with him in a children’s park? – motivated by hatred and by a desire to humiliate Jalal Uddin and undoubtedly intended to kill or, at the very least, cause really serious harm.” Greaney said the severe blows to Uddin’s mouth were particularly significant. He said: “This was ... an attack driven by hate and the blow to the mouth was quite possibly the most symbolic of all: ‘You will not say anything of which we disapprove.’” The plot to murder Uddin began earlier this year, the court heard, after his alleged killers spent months conducting surveillance on the former imam while deciding how to “paralyse” his strain of Islam. Described as “quiet, dignified and well respected,” Uddin wore an amulet – known as a taweez – that some believe to protect the wearer against evil. However, Isis forbids the practice, considering it to be “black magic”, the court heard. Six months before the killing, Uddin’s books and notes on taweez were stolen from the Jalalia mosque in Rochdale, jurors were told. At the same time, one of Syeedy’s friends sent a text message to the defendant saying he had gone on a “taweez raid” at the mosque. When told his friend had found Uddin’s “stash”, Syeedy replied: “Burn it.” Jurors were told there was “clear and cogent” evidence that Syeedy and Kadir supported Isis, including reams of jihadi propaganda recovered from Syeedy’s iPhone. Jurors were shown photographs of the 21-year-old, who was born and raised in Rochdale, holding an Isis-style flag outside the Jalalia mosque where his victim prayed. In another, he wore a stab-proof vest outside the mosque. Other photographs showed Syeedy and two others holding a jihadi flag over a road sign in Rochdale that had been altered to read: “War Zone.” On Syeedy’s laptop, detectives found a poster saying “Don’t wear taweez” and the message “Whoever wears an amulet has committed shirk,” the jury heard. Shirk is a sin of practising idolatry, the jury was told. As their hatred of Uddin grew, Syeedy and his associates plotted to have the Bangladeshi-born community leader deported by immigration services. However, that plan was abandoned after a photograph emerged of Uddin with the Rochdale MP, Simon Danczuk, outside the Jalalia mosque in December last year. Their hostility towards Uddin escalated that month when Kadir and others discussed killing him. In a Facebook message, Kadir wrote: “Exposing their Kufir [disbeliever] isn’t sufficient as there are tooo many of them soo we may do what ever to paralyse them in sha Allah starting from the ring leader we know” – a reference, the crown says, to Uddin. Kadir added: “Soo please do made dua [prayers] that this happens and we do it in a systematic way so that we do not get caught.” Syeedy sat alone in the dock as the court heard that his co-accused was on the run – possibly in Syria – after catching a flight to Istanbul, via Copenhagen, three days after the killing on 18 February. Jurors were told Syeedy accepted Kadir murdered Uddin and that he was with his accomplice before and after the killing. However, he will deny that he knew anything about the murder beforehand or that he supports Isis. The trial continues."
2016-08-23T21:01:05Z,uk-news,UK news,London housing: TfL land set for affordable homes as Sadiq Khan picks expert team,"London mayor Sadiq Khan has announced two forward steps on his long and testing quest to improve the supply of new homes for low and middle income households. One is the release for development of a piece of Transport for London (TfL) land in Kidbrooke. The other is the start of assembling his expert Homes for Londoners unit at City Hall. The Kidbrooke site is the first brought forward by TfL under Khan’s manifesto pledge to supply “part-buy, part-rent” shared ownership homes on publicly-owned land for first-time buyers, giving “first dibs” to Londoners who’ve been renting for five years, especially in Outer London. It demonstrates both continuity of policy from what TfL did under Boris Johnson and significant adjustments of it. The transport body’s approach to making money from its developable land assets has been be to enter into joint ventures with developers to build housing and other things - schools, shops, medical facilities - on it, enabling TfL to take a share of the profits. The first example of this new departure for the transport body was the vast and controversial Earls Court Project - find seven years’ worth of mildly obsessive coverage here - which has so far seen the TfL land on which the Earls Court exhibition centre stood levelled and precisely no affordable homes, however defined, planned for it. Here is where Khan differs from his predecessor. TfL’s first priority under Johnson was to make as much money as fast as possible from its property deals: hence the zero “affordable” portion in the Earls Court redevelopment so far and a concentration on sites in expensive areas. Khan, by contrast, is to insist that an overall 50% of all homes built on TfL land must meet his definition of “affordable” - to be a more stringent one than the government uses - and has asked TfL to move more sites in Outer London up its priority list. Kidbrooke fits the bill. The land, which lies next to Kidbrooke railway station, is big enough for around 400 homes plus retail, commercial and open space. During the mayoral election campaign, Khan spoke of TfL retaining ownership of its land, which is usually advisable in any case since it tends to contain useful public transport stuff like stations. In this case, however, the land isn’t needed for TfL transport purposes which means it could be sold rather than retained. Such a sale could be to the highest bidder on the open market but, that high price would make it unlikely that 50% of any homes built on it were affordable, especially by Khan’s definition. However, the land can also be sold to a company that TfL is part of, logically at a price low enough to make 50% affordable financially feasible. According to paragraph 2.4 here it is “contemplated that TfL will dispose of the land to such a company.” An issue raised by a 50% affordable requirement, the minimum set out by Khan for the Kidbrooke site, is that TfL will get less from the development of the land in this way than they would have were the “affordable” proportion lower. City Hall officers’ advice to Khan is that were TfL itself or a subsidiary of it developing the land for less than the maximum possible return, it would be breaking the law in the form of the GLA Act, but that those provisions don’t apply to a non-subsidiary, such as a joint venture company. Khan has therefore formally directed TfL to sell or develop the Kidbrooke land by means of such a company, which will likely be formed with one of the 13 developers named in TfL’s property partnership framework in February. All this has brought criticism from Conservative London Assembly member Keith Prince, who speaks for the Tory group on transport. He has accused Khan of financial irresponsibility, saying his approach threatens TfL’s finances at a time when Khan is also freezing its fares income and the government is phasing out its grant. Planning applications for the development of TfL land and made by TfL itself under Mayor Johnson have contained proposals for affordable housing - at Nine Elms, Northwood and Parsons Green. The proportions in each case have been for substantially less than 50%, but still implied a smaller return for the transport body. Khan has said that Johnson hadn’t pushed TfL to move on the Kidbrooke site (although it has long been a contender for attention), the implication being that the transport body is already in line to be better off than it would have been under the previous mayor and that 200 more affordable homes will soon enter the supply pipeline too. Ensuring speedier housing delivery on is one way in which Khan can address the tension between TfL’s need for additional income and his commitment to building affordable homes on its land portfolio, And so to the second of Khan’s housing announcements. The Homes for Londoners line-up includes a “governance board” comprising Khan’s housing deputy James Murray, four borough leaders to be nominated by London Councils, TfL commissioner Mike Brown, the Greater London Authority’s executive director housing and land David Lunts, chair of the G15 group of leading housing associations David Montague and two “members of the residential property sector” who have yet to be named. Khan himself will chair the board, which will meet quarterly. The clear objective, in keeping with Khan’s manifesto, is to form an alliance of all those with an interest in building London homes. Khan has also announced that he’s assembling an in-house “viability expert team” to look closely at the often contested financial costings compiled by developers to justify the amount of “affordable” housing and other social infrastructure they supply as part of development schemes. The thinking is that cash-strapped boroughs are often bamboozled by property giants and end up getting less affordable housing out of deals than there could have been. Having a stronger viability scrutiny operation at the service of the mayor, who can block, shape or even take over the determination of planning applications, should help the boroughs and also promote greater consistency in viability negotiations - something it is hoped developers themselves might welcome, as the process can be costly and time-consuming for them too. The same experts will also help Khan develop his new London Plan and shape major parts of mayoral planning policy, such as opportunity areas and housing zones. The initiative has been welcomed by London Councils, business body London First and the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, reflecting broad agreement that London’s housing problems need to be tackled with greater interventionist vigour. Khan is hoping that Theresa May will join the chorus of agreement. Her chancellor’s autumn statement is awaited with interest."
2016-08-23T23:01:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Why India's leaders did not share Rushdie's Jewel in the Crown pain,"Indians were “very pleased” with the ITV drama The Jewel in the Crown, and did not agree with Salman Rushdie’s view that it was “grotesquely overpraised”, according to Foreign Office papers. Based on the novels of Paul Scott, The Jewel in the Crown was set against the backdrop of the last days of the British Raj. It was one of the TV hits of 1984 and featured a primarily white British cast including Charles Dance, Peggy Ashcroft and Tim Piggott-Smith. Writing in the Observer, Rushdie – who had won the Booker prize three years earlier with Midnight’s Children – took exception to the drama as well as to other recent portrayals of India including Richard Attenborough’s Oscar-winning film Gandhi. They were, according to Rushdie, examples of “Raj revisionism” and the “artistic counterpoint to the rise of conservative ideologies in modern Britain”. Rushdie also put the boot into what he called Scott’s “cliched” prose. The TV series was part of a “zombie-like revival of the defunct empire”.
The Indian government, however, disagreed - at least according to a memo sent in April 1984 by the diplomat Ronald Nash. Nash told his bosses in London: “It’s not my impression that many here share the Rushdie view. If anything people seem slightly flattered by all the attention.” Nash said he had dropped into Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official home of the president of India. There, the then deputy press secretary, Tarlochan Singh, had told him “the Indians – implying officially – were very pleased with the series and films on India based on various novels”. “That interest in India on the part of the British had been stimulated was undeniable. The tourist figures were well up. This renewed interest was a stimulus to a relationship that was much deeper than with any other European country.” Nash continued: “He dismissed the Rushdie romanticising-the-Raj thesis. He said Indians today were of a new generation and were no longer nervous of such harkings-back to the past which represented no threat.” The diplomat - who went on to be Britain’s ambassador to Nepal and Afghanistan - enclosed a press cutting from the Times of India, headlined “Rushdie’s Complaint”. In playful tones, the editorial noted that Rushdie had created “exceptional literary works” and was entitled to his strong opinions, reminiscent of George Orwell. The Times did not agree with his criticism, though. It wrote: “It will win him some standing in the left in Britain but some of us in India would perhaps prefer to shrug our shoulders. “Need Indians, native or expatriate, be so worked up every time white people say something disagreeable about us? They do nice things too – like giving some of us Booker prizes.” • This article was amended on 24 August 2016. An earlier version named Indira Gandhi as the president of India in 1984; she was prime minister."
2016-08-23T23:01:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Declassified papers reveal real reason for Thatcher's dash to Riyadh,"Margaret Thatcher dashed to Riyadh in order to “smoke out the Saudis” and persuade the country’s ruler, King Fahd, to spend billions on British Hawk and Tornado fighter jets, newly declassified Foreign Office papers show. A series of secret memos show the lengths to which Downing Street went to hide the real reason for Mrs Thatcher’s hastily arranged evening stop-off in Saudi Arabia, made in April 1985 on her way back from a tour of Asia. Britain had been negotiating with the Saudis over the purchase from British Aerospace of dozens of Hawk and Tornado fighter aircraft. The eventual al-Yamamah agreement – worth £48bn over two decades – was the biggest and most controversial deal in UK history. It nearly unravelled after the French began courting the Saudis in 1983 with a rival bid for Mirage aircraft. After frantic government lobbying, Prince Bandar – an anglophile and the influential Saudi ambassador to Washington – invited Mrs Thatcher to drop in to Riyadh.
Bandar had privately assured Downing Street the king preferred the British offer, but the Foreign Office was sceptical. One secret briefing note said that “on strictly foreign policy grounds” there was no reason for the prime minister to break her journey and to “call on the king”. It went on: “All the arguments therefore turn to the prospects for Tornado. British Aerospace and the Ministry of Defence are naturally anxious to take every possible step to sell the aircraft to the Saudis and we fully support their efforts. “To date, we only have Prince Bandar’s word for it that the king has decided to buy Tornado. We need to get this more precise and explicit. Tackling the king in person is probably the only way of smoking the Saudis out.” The Foreign Office believed that demanding a firm commitment from the Saudis before Thatcher’s arrival would look like “bazaar tactics and could gravely offend them”. It drew up a further memo setting out objectives and “tactical arguments”. Meanwhile, Charles Powell, Thatcher’s private secretary, discussed how Downing Street could keep the real purpose of the prime minister’s Riyadh dash under wraps – and away from nosy journalists. Powell wrote to the then foreign secretary, Geoffrey Howe: “My preliminary conclusion is that we should not add anyone to the PM’s party for the visit to Riyadh. To include someone from MoD sales would only serve to draw attention to the Tornado aspect (given that there will be 25 journalists on the aircraft).” Diplomats were also worried about how the sultan of Oman, Sultan Qaboos, might react to the Saudi stopover. Qaboos was a close British ally who resented what he perceived as “Saudi arrogance” and needed “sensitive handling”. In the end, Mrs Thatcher wrote him a friendly note. The meeting at the Nasiriyah Palace in Riyadh was a success. It went on for several hours. Over dinner, King Fahd told Thatcher: “Prime minister, the deal is yours.” Afterwards, the Saudi press was “warm”, the FCO noted. Thatcher sent the king a positive letter, thanking him that “were were able to discuss a further matter privately”.
Thatcher used similarly euphemistic language in another note to to Sir Patrick Wright, the UK’s then ambassador to Riyadh. Wright was one of a handful of British officials, including Powell and the cabinet secretary, Robin Butler, who took part in the sensitive talks. Thatcher wrote to Wright: “I was able to have a private word with him [the King] over lunch on the particular matter about which you know.” An agreement was signed in September 1985, with the Saudis keen to buy the jets to deter possible Iranian attack. The first Tornados were delivered in 1986. The files detail further steps strengthening Saudi-British defence cooperation. They were taken by Michael Heseltine, then defence minister, who months later stormed out of cabinet over the Westland affair. Heseltine told King Fahd he had appointed a special defence envoy to Riyadh, Lt Gen Sir John Akehurst. The al-Yamamah deal was subsequently overshadowed by long-running corruption claims. The Serious Fraud Office investigated whether BAE had paid bribes to secure the contract. BAE denied this. In 2006 Tony Blair controversially shelved the SFO’s inquiry, on the grounds that it wasn’t in the national interest to pursue it, and that it was doubtful anybody would be prosecuted."
2016-08-23T23:01:04Z,uk-news,UK news,How Zola Budd passport row reached the top of Thatcher's government,"The decision to grant the South African-born athlete Zola Budd a British passport provoked a bitter row at the top of Margaret Thatcher’s government, newly declassified papers show, pitching the then home secretary, Leon Brittan, against his sceptical colleague Sir Geoffrey Howe. Budd, a 17-year-old running sensation, was ineligible to compete in international competitions because of sanctions against apartheid South Africa. In April 1984 Brittan granted her British citizenship in a matter of weeks, after a vigorous campaign by the Daily Mail. This allowed her to compete for Britain in the 1984 Olympic Games. In one of the most notorious moments in Olympic sport, Budd collided with her US rival Mary Decker in the 3,000 metres, sending Decker sprawling to the ground. The files show that, in the run-up to the Games, Howe – then foreign secretary – was distinctly unimpressed by Budd’s preferential treatment, warning Brittan that the question of sport in pariah South Africa was “a political minefield”.
“I would have thought the high-profile exceptional treatment for Miss Budd would set an awkward precedent for you,” Howe wrote, in a letter copied to Thatcher and 10 Downing Street. “You recognise the case is receiving a measure of exceptional treatment … the question is just how exceptional.” Howe continued: “I can see the attraction (and the interest of the Daily Mail) in being able to announce to an unexpecting world that Zola Budd is now here, has British citizenship and will be able to run for Britain in the Olympic Games. “Given the strength of the reaction which exceptional treatment would provoke I would strongly urge you not to be rushed and to allow time to test the strength of those reactions.” Foreign Office diplomats also expressed dismay. They suggested that it was Sir David English, the Daily Mail’s all-powerful editor, who had forced the home secretary’s hand. The Mail had enthusiastically backed Budd’s application and paid for her and her parents to travel to and settle in the UK. One diplomat by the name of McFarlane dubbed the government “cynical” and said it had caved in to “cheque book journalism”. Another complained that the Home Office decisions were being made in response to Daily Mail pressure. Meanwhile, UK missions around the world were being bombarded with inquiries from potential citizens who – like Budd – had a British-born grandparent. “It is assumed that the Home Office attitude derived from the home secretary’s direct contacts with Sir David English over the case,” one note read. The Home Office had not taken account of reservations from the Foreign Office and sports ministry, it added, and had “a wish to get round them”.
Brittan, however, was unrepentant. He fired off a letter to David Howell, a former Thatcher minister, who shared Howe’s doubts and wondered about tabloid influence. Brittan wrote: “The role of the Daily Mail is clear. They supported her application … There is nothing wrong with that.” He continued: “It’s not for me, or the government, to judge Miss Budd’s actual athletic talent compared with that of other British woman athletes. That is for the sporting authorities.” The files - part of a hoard declassified by the Foreign Office on Wednesday - also include a catty portrait of Brian Vine, the late Daily Mail reporter who whisked Budd to Britain. Britain’s consul in Johannesburg, RJ Miller, accused Vine of bumptiousness and a “virtuoso display of name-dropping, from the prime minister downwards”. Budd finished seventh in her Olympic race, later admitting that she gave up after she was booed following Decker’s stumble. She competed in the 1992 Olympics for South Africa. “It has always seemed to me that Zola was the real victim of the Zola Budd affair,” one Foreign Office official, NJ Thorpe, noted. Budd now lives in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina."
2016-08-23T23:01:04Z,uk-news,UK news,"Nelson Mandela and the Gay Gordons put MoD in a spin, archives reveal","A decision by Aberdeen’s Labour council to give Nelson Mandela the freedom of the city caused turmoil inside the Ministry of Defence because of a dance performance by the Gordon Highlanders. Mandela – who at this point had been in prison for more than two decades – was given the honour in 1984. Aberdeen was the home of the Gordon Highlanders, known as the Gay Gordons, a regiment that performed traditional Scottish dances. Government papers declassified on Wednesday reveal that the MoD wrote to the Foreign Office to see if it had any concerns. “Music, colour and pageantry is generally supplied on such occasions by the Gordon Highlanders. [Would] there by any objections to the Gay Gordons performing and prancing on that occasion too?” the MoD asked. The Foreign Office initially took a laid-back view. One diplomat – A Adams – wrote: “I recommend we don’t object.” Another colleague, however, disagreed, writing: “The association of a Scottish band of the British army with the ceremony would certainly attract comment in South Africa. All in all it seems unwise.” MoD officials then got “cold feet”, eventually concluding that there should be no dancing. In November 1984 the MoD said that it “had a ruling about the army participating in political functions”. It added that it was inclined to regard the Mandela ceremony as “blatantly political”.
The incident came at a time when Margaret Thatcher’s government opposed apartheid in South Africa, but also insisted that it was not able to interfere directly in Mandela’s case, which it called “an internal affair”. Declassified Foreign Office files from 1984 and 1985 include dozens of letters from ordinary members of the public urging Thatcher to do more. One from Lucy Kelly of Clapham, London, dated 18 September 1984, read: “Please do something. I depend on you. You are our leader.” Others wanted the Foreign Office to pass on parcels to Mandela’s then wife, Winnie, at the time internally banished and under house arrest. These requests were declined. The government’s approach attracted widespread criticism from anti-apartheid campaigners led by the Anglican bishop Trevor Huddleston. Huddleston met the then junior Foreign Office minister Malcolm Rifkind and accused him of appeasement and “adopting the same approach” as Neville Chamberlain did towards Hitler, files show.
Huddleston dismissed South Africa’s new 1984 constitution which allowed limited non-white participation. He dubbed the government’s cautious welcome of it as “anodyne” and “totally indefensible”. Declassified papers reveal that at the same time the government was coming under intense pressure from the South African regime. In 1983 the South African ambassador to London demanded that the ANC’s office in London be shut down, and its periodicals banned. The office was “the centre for the planning of terrorist acts in South Africa”, he argued. The Foreign Office declined the request, noting: “The South Africans were able to produce no evidence to substantiate their claims.” It also said it had “long been concerned” at “improper activities” by South African intelligence agents based in London, who appeared to be behind break-ins at the offices of anti-apartheid groups."
2016-08-23T23:38:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Trio forced off easyJet plane over false claims they support Isis,"Three siblings were removed from a plane and questioned on the tarmac by armed police officers after passengers falsely accused them of being Islamic State supporters. Maryam Dharas, 19, Sakina Dharas, 24, and Ali Dharas, 21, had boarded the easyJet flight from Stansted to Naples when they were approached by a cabin crew member and asked to accompany her off the aircraft without explanation. In full view of the passengers on the plane, the trio from north-west London were grilled for an hour by officers, who first asked them: “Do you speak English?” Maryam, who will begin an English degree at King’s College London later this year, immediately said she, her brother and sister were born and raised in London, as was their mother, and they only spoke English. Speaking to the Guardian, Maryam said it was clear that she and her sister, a clinical pharmacist at University College London, had been subjected to racial profiling. They were both wearing headscarves at the time. Before being allowed back on to the flight, Sakina was told that further background checks would be conducted and officers would be waiting when the plane landed if any evidence were found. Maryam said: “I would like an apology. What happened was wrong. This kind of profiling shouldn’t take place. I don’t want this to happen again to anyone else.” EasyJet has apologised for any inconvenience caused, but insisted that security concerns had to be investigated, while Essex police offered no apology and said the report from a couple on the plane that led to the incident was of “good intent”. The family had chosen the Naples area, where they visited Pompeii, for a holiday as they had an interest in classical civilisations. They had taken their seats on the flight at about 6am on 18 August when they were approached by a cabin crew member, who demanded that they follow her off the plane. “I asked her ‘where are we going, can you explain where you’re taking us?’ She doesn’t reply, she completely ignores me. We’re told to walk down the stairs – at the bottom we can see there’s armed policemen,” Maryam said. The Dharas siblings, who are of Indian ethnic origin, were asked if they had Arabic text on their phones or copies of the Qur’an. They cannot speak, read or write Arabic. “I was shocked, my sister was close to tears,” Maryam said. “The first thing the policeman asks us is if we speak English, which I personally find quite patronising. Just because we look ethnic. I don’t speak any other language but English. “We’re told a couple had reported us having been reading Isis materials. [They said] the pair of us, meaning me and my sister, had been reading Isis material. My sister and I wear headscarves. We thought, there’s clearly profiling going on here. “We were just in shock. What is going on? None of us have been doing that. We’re absolutely flummoxed. “We were asked ‘have you had any Arabic on your phone? Have you been reading the Qur’an?’ We don’t even speak Arabic, we don’t know Arabic, we’re not even Arabs.” The passengers who complained had incorrectly claimed that the women had a reference to the phrase praise be to God on one of their phones. Maryam had been using her phone on the plane to send messages via WhatsApp to her father, a pharmacist born in Uganda, and had been having a conversation about the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Once off the plane, Sakina was separated from Maryam and Ali, and they were questioned by men in suits said to be from special branch. Sakina had a passport stamp from a visit to Iraq, when she and Ali had taken part in a sponsored walk to raise funds for Isis victims. The officers asked to see Maryam’s Twitter posts. “There was no evidence here,” she said. “We were being treated like criminals. The couple had lied and got away with it. It was offensive and hurtful. They tarnished our names in front of everyone on the flight, it was really humiliating.” The siblings were allowed to return to the plane and offered an apology for the inconvenience. “It was a humiliating walk back on to the flight, it was awful,” Maryam said. However, before they were allowed back on the flight, Sakina was warned by her interrogator that further background checks would be conducted while she was in Italy. “This was bizarre because, if we’re not a threat and we’re allowed on the plane, we’ve all agreed this has been a lie, then what’s the need?” Maryam said. “They said ‘if we find anything, we’ll be waiting for you when your plane lands’. What kind of threat was that to make?” The family returned on 20 August and no one was waiting for them. Sakina said: “What are my rights? We would only have been allowed back on the plane if there wasn’t a shred of doubt on their part, so someone must be the liar here; in which case, why were those passengers not removed for wasting police time, lying, making false allegations and racial profiling?” Earlier this year, a British man was removed from an easyJet plane by armed police at Luton airport after a fellow passenger read a message on his mobile phone about prayer and reported him as a security threat. Laolu Opebiyi, 40, from London, said he was forced to hand over his phone and reveal his password in order to establish his innocence, after he tried to arrange a conference call prayer with friends using WhatsApp. A detective subsequently questioned and cleared Opebiyi, but the pilot refused to allow him back on to the easyJet flight to Amsterdam. A statement from Essex police concerning the incident at Stansted said: “Essex police were contacted with reports of concern regarding the behaviour of three people who were looking at their mobile phones. “Officers at the airport spoke to them and examined their phones with their consent. They were quickly able to establish that no offences had been committed and the women boarded their flight. We are satisfied the call was of good intent.” A spokesman for easyJet said: “EasyJet can confirm that, following concerns raised by a passenger during the boarding, a member of ground staff requested the assistance of the police, who took the decision to talk to three passengers at the bottom of the aircraft steps, before departure. “The police then confirmed to the captain that the passengers were cleared to complete their journey and they reboarded the aircraft and the flight departed to Naples. “The safety and security of its passengers and crew is our highest priority, which means that if a security concern is raised, we will always investigate it as a precautionary measure. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused to the passengers.”"
2016-08-24T11:04:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Stranded Isle of Lewis oil rig towed to safety,"A 17,000-tonne oil rig that has been stranded on the coast of the Isle of Lewis for more than two weeks has been towed to a secure location after being successfully refloated. The semi-submersible rig, Transocean Winner, ran aground close to Dalmore beach near Carloway, on Lewis, on 8 August. It was being towed from Norway to Malta when a towline snapped in rough seas.
It has now arrived in Broad Bay on the east coast of Lewis, after being refloated on Monday night and towed for 54 miles around the north of the island, where it will remain until it can be made safely transportable to a repair facility. Eight anchors were laid out in Broad Bay to hold the rig in place when it arrived. The rig’s owners, Transocean, will now start their assessment process – which includes putting divers in the water – to look at the damage the rig has suffered. Salvage experts have said that the process could take until the middle of September. The journey took longer than initially estimated, with a travelling speed of 1-1.5 knots an hour, and the rig, which was towed by two tugs, exhibited a severe list to one side once in the water. The platform was carrying 280 tonnes of diesel when it ran aground, 200 of which was then successfully transferred from the rig on to a supply vessel on Sunday, but concerns remained about potential spillages en route to Broad Bay. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has been conducting counter-pollution flyover checks in the area to examine the water for any sign of discharge, sheen or pollution from the rig. No pollution was reported in the Dalmore Bay area, but a slight sheen was detected as the aircraft continued to follow the path of the rig. The sheen is thought to be associated with the ongoing pressurisation of tanks to maintain the rig’s stability. A temporary exclusion zone remains in place at Dalmore Bay, where the rig initially ran aground, until the seabed has been swept for any debris or environmental impact. Hugh Shaw, the secretary of state’s representative for maritime salvage and intervention, said: “We are taking advantage of the favourable weather conditions following this big step forward, and we will continue to closely monitor the rig. Once everything is declared safe, I will be looking at releasing the exclusion zone in Dalmore Bay.” “I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the Western Isles council and community for their patience and their gracious hospitality during this challenging and disruptive period. “This salvage operation has required the united cooperation from so many different organisations who have spared no effort to ensure that this rig reaches safer waters.”"
2016-08-24T11:08:40Z,uk-news,UK news,"Rochdale imam murder accused fled to Turkey, court hears","An alleged Islamic State supporter accused of murdering a respected imam is being hunted by police after fleeing to Turkey days after the killing, a court has heard. Mohammed Abdul Kadir, 24, bludgeoned Jalal Uddin, 71, to death because he viewed his use of healing amulets as “black magic”, jurors were told. The second day of the trial at Manchester crown court heard that Kadir “drained his bank account” and flew to Istanbul via Copenhagen three days after the killing in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, told the jury that efforts to trace Kadir had proved unsuccessful, which he said was “hardly surprising given that Istanbul has often been used as a staging post to Syria”. Uddin, a well-liked Muslim leader in Rochdale, was beaten to death with a hard object, believed to be a hammer, in a children’s playground by Kadir on 18 February, jurors have heard. The imam was left with head and facial fractures so severe that his skull was crushed into his brain, the court was told. Kadir and his co-accused, Mohammed Hussain Syeedy, 21, spent months watching Uddin before murdering him out of “hatred and intolerance”, jurors heard. Described as “quiet, dignified and well respected”, Uddin wore an amulet known as a taweez that some believe protects the wearer against evil. However, Isis forbids the practice, considering it to be “black magic”, the court heard. The prosecution claims the taweez gave Syeedy and Kadir their motive to murder Uddin. Professor Robert Gleave, an expert in Arab and Islamic Studies at the University of Exeter, told jurors of the verses found in the taweez that Uddin was wearing when he died: “Some of them are for good fortune but some are for protection from evil, the ability of the taweez to ward off evil spirits in the life of the wearer. “This quite possibly is a means whereby the wearer would be protecting himself from the intervention of evil spirits.” The taweez – a piece of paper covered in tinfoil-like wrapping – was found in Uddin’s clothing after his death. Appearing as an expert witness for the Crown, Gleave was asked about a text message sent by Syeedy that said “burn it” after being told that a friend had found Uddin’s “stash” of taweez notes in the mosque where he prayed. Gleave confirmed that Salafi Muslims – the ultra-conservative strain of Islam practiced by Isis – believe in burning taweez whenever it is found. He added, however, that the text message was not proof that Syeedy was a Salafi Muslim. Jurors were also shown four black arm patches found in Syeedy’s house, featuring the Islamic shahada quotation above a Kalashnikov rifle or a curved sword. The emblem, Gleave said, had “increasingly been associated with various jihadi movements”. Greaney told jurors on Wednesday that Syeedy had recently renewed his passport but had remained in the UK. Syeedy was spotted giving his Vauxhall Astra – which he allegedly used to drive Kadir to and from the children’s playground where Uddin was murdered – a “thorough clean, an event that was unusual”, said Greaney. Jurors were told that Kadir travelled back to his Oldham home after the killing while Syeedy returned to the murder scene, where a crowd had gathered. “The prosecution case is that the defendant [Syeedy] was on the street to see what was going on, so that he and Kadir could judge their next step,” Greaney said. In the hours that followed the murder, which took place at 8.42pm, Kadir and Syeedy exchanged a number of phone calls, the jury heard. Syeedy drove to Oldham to pick up Kadir before they both returned to Rochdale, near the murder scene, and later drove the alleged killer back. Jurors heard that Syeedy gave a statement to police when he was arrested four days after the murder that said: “I am not guilty of any offence in relation to the death of Mr Jalal Uddin. I make this statement believing it to be true and [that it] may be produced in evidence.” Greaney told the jury that Syeedy would claim he did not know Kadir intended to harm Uddin when he dropped the alleged killer off at the gates of the children’s playground. However, Greaney told the jury: “Our submission is that the combination of circumstances demonstrates beyond doubt that Mohammed Hussain Syeedy intentionally assisted and encouraged an attack by Kadir upon Jalal Uddin that was intended to cause that man really serious harm, if not kill him. If you are sure of that, the defendant will be guilty of murder.”"
2016-08-24T12:20:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Toddler swept out to sea with parents in Cornwall dies,"A two-year-old girl rescued by lifeboat volunteers after she and her parents were swept from a Cornish beach and out to sea by huge waves on Friday has died in hospital. McKayla Bruynius was pronounced dead at Bristol Children’s hospital on Tuesday night, after the incident which also claimed the life of her father, Rudy Bruynius. They are among seven people to have died over the weekend around Britain’s coasts. The family, who are from Surrey, had been on holiday in Newquay when the incident happened. In a statement released by Devon and Cornwall police, McKayla’s mother gave her thanks to the emergency services, medical workers and members of the public, as she paid tribute to her loved ones. “I am in disbelief at what has happened. I am so shocked at how quickly the sea condition changed on that day while we were enjoying a family time together in Cornwall,” Lisinda Bruynius said. “I pray that others can learn from our tragedy as I do not wish for anybody to go through our grief. “I would like to thank the RNLI, the staff at Royal Cornwall hospital, the staff from Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, the emergency services and all the members of public for their generous support and prayers they have given towards my family. “I would especially like to thank the people of Cornwall for their messages of love and offers of help. “I will never forget the close community spirit displayed towards us. Please respect our privacy at this really difficult time and allow my sons and I to try to come to terms with what has happened.” The parents were with McKayla and their two sons on South Fistral beach when a large wave washed three of them into the sea, sparking a rescue operation involving RNLI lifeboats, a coastguard rescue team, the police, the air ambulance and the ambulance service. According to Devon and Cornwall police Rudy and Lisinda Bruynius were rescued from the water by RNLI lifeguards, who attempted to resuscitate him before he was airlifted to Treliske hospital. McKayla was pulled from the sea by an RNLI lifeboat then flown to Derriford hospital. The coastguard found the family’s two sons, who had managed to stay on the rocks where the family had been walking. They had sustained minor injuries and were taken by ambulance to Treliske. Investigating officer DC Jarrod Yewen, from Newquay CID, said: “This is a tragic case for all those involved and our thoughts remain with the family at what is a deeply traumatic time for them. “The deaths are not being investigated as suspicious therefore the police will now prepare a file for HM coroner and an inquest will be held in due course.”"
2016-08-24T15:06:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Tributes paid to soldier killed in Otterburn live firing exercise,"Tributes have been paid to a “hugely committed” soldier who died after being shot during a live-firing exercise, four months after safety concerns were raised about military firing ranges. Pte Conor McPherson, 24, from the Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Scotland, died after suffering a serious head wound while taking part in a night live-firing exercise at Otterburn training area in Northumberland on Monday. In April, the Unite union warned that firing ranges had become “death traps” since the role of lookout wardens, who prevent people walking into the line of fire, had been withdrawn as part of a cost-cutting drive. A spokesperson for the company Landmarc, which manages the base, is yet to comment on the soldier’s death. McPherson’s commanding officer, Lt Col Alasdair Steele, described him as “a capable young soldier” who had previously trained in both Kenya and France. “He was hugely committed about his career in the army, he had aspirations to join the machine gun platoon and attend a junior leadership course at the start of next year,” he said. “He constantly drove to develop himself physically and was well liked among his peers for his sharp wit and sense of humour. However, Private McPherson’s true passion was to his parents and his older sister – he was part of a very close-knit family and his great joy was spending time with them at the weekends and over leave.” McPherson, from Paisley, Renfrewshire, enlisted into the Royal Regiment of Scotland in May 2014 as a combat infantryman. Police are working with Ministry of Defence accident investigators to establish the circumstances of his death. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, also sent her condolences to the soldier’s family, friends and colleagues, saying: “Our armed forces do a difficult and dangerous job at all times, and this is another stark reminder of that. My thoughts are with all who loved this brave soldier.” McPherson’s death comes a month after 26-year-old soldier Joshua Hoole, from Ecclefechan in Dumfries and Galloway, died while on a training exercise in Brecon, in south Wales, on the hottest day of the year. In April, the Defence Select Committee published a report calling for the MoD to become liable for prosecution for the deaths of armed forces personnel during training. The MoD currently enjoys crown immunity from corporate manslaughter laws in cases of gross negligence. In the 16 years to February 2016, 135 UK armed forces personnel died while on training or exercise, with 11 of those deaths occurring during live-fire exercises. The shadow defence secretary, Clive Lewis, described himself as deeply troubled by the fact that a solider had died during training for the second time in six weeks. “The MoD has a duty of care to our servicemen and women, which is why it is absolutely essential that a thorough investigation is now conducted into how this tragic incident came about,” he said. The Otterburn training estate, established in 1911 by Winston Churchill, covers about 93 sq miles of the southern Cheviot hills. It is used for training about 30,000 soldiers a year and is the UK’s second largest firing range. Matt-James Mcallahan, a friend of McPherson, writing on social media, said: “Rest in peace to one the best guys I know In such a tragic accident was Probably one of closest people I was to at the fort and il always remember you waking me up in the morning with a boxing glove to the face or you explaining your geeky game. “You will be missed a lot mate and see you soon enough like you always said in your game there is always a way of restarting it [sic].”"
2016-08-24T15:26:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May to chair Heathrow third runway committee,"Theresa May will chair a cabinet committee to make the final decision on Heathrow’s third runway plan, in order to push for a resolution by the autumn. The much-delayed decision will be made by the economic affairs (airports) sub-committee by October. The government’s latest target and full membership of the committee was set to be announced shortly, Downing Street said. A government spokesperson said: “In line with the approach of the last government, there will be a cabinet sub-committee to consider airport capacity in the south-east.
“This will be chaired by the prime minister. We will publish full details of all cabinet committees, implementation taskforces and their membership in due course.” The prime minister was returning for her first full day back at work on Wednesday after a walking holiday in the Swiss Alps. Several cabinet ministers including the prime minister are in a predicament because Heathrow expansion could adversely affect their constituencies. May’s Maidenhead constituency is under the night flight route and she was not a member of the influential committee as home secretary under David Cameron. In July, it was reported that a deleted web archive from the late 2000s revealed May had been a strong critic of airport expansion in west London, saying her constituents faced the “prospect of a reduction in their quality of life with more planes flying overhead”. Cameron also took personal charge of the committee, and was accused of “locking out” more anti-Heathrow cabinet members such as the then international development secretary, Justine Greening. Greening, now education secretary after May promoted her, is one of the most vocal critics of Heathrow expansion. She is the MP for Putney, Roehampton and Southfields. “Trying to expand Heathrow is like trying to build an eight-bedroom mansion on the site of a terraced house,” she told the Telegraph. “It is a hub airport that is just simply in the wrong place.” Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, also opposed the third runway as London mayor, and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said last year that he was in favour of expanding Gatwick instead. “London’s role as an international air transport hub can be maintained without additional runways at Heathrow,” he said. “A second runway at Gatwick, plus enhanced transport links between the airports and better transport links to London will create a ‘virtual’ hub airport, maintaining Heathrow’s role in the local economy without expanding it.” Members of the committee under Cameron included the then chancellor, George Osborne, who has since returned to the backbenches, as well as Amber Rudd, now home secretary, and the former environment minister Liz Truss, who is now lord chancellor and Patrick McLoughlin, who was transport secretary but is now chairman of the Conservative party. The Davies commission into airport expansion in the south-east concluded last year that a third runway at Heathrow was the best of three shortlisted options, which also included extending an existing Heathrow runway and building a new one at Gatwick. In December, the government postponed a final decision pending new analysis of the environmental impacts. After the report’s publication, the government postponed its decision to October 2015, then again to June this year. After the EU referendum result and Cameron’s resignation, McLoughlin said the decision would have to be made by the new prime minister. Last month, 36 Conservative MPs led by the former party chairman Grant Shapps, wrote to May to demand a decision on Heathrow, saying it was “a matter of extreme urgency”."

2016-08-24T16:56:39Z,uk-news,UK news,Scotland Yard investigating 'incitement' of Karachi violence,"Scotland Yard said it is examining whether a Pakistani political leader incited violence in Karachi when he addressed followers from his north-London base on Monday. Violence flared in the country’s biggest city on Monday after Altaf Hussain, the leader of the MQM party, who has lived in Edgware for more than 20 years, addressed supporters in the city via telephone calls that were broadcast to his followers. A spokeswoman told the Guardian that the police are examining Hussain’s speech following “numerous calls from the public” to see if his remarks broke any English laws. She added: “Where evidence of criminal activity is found we will consult with the Crown Prosecution Service,” the spokeswoman added. The Pakistani authorities say Hussain described the country as a “cancer” and incited his followers to attack two media stations that he accused of bias. But a spokesman for MQM told the Guardian that the violence erupted after the party’s supporters were fired on by police where one person was killed.Hussain has already been under investigation since last summer following previous speeches The Metropolitan police have been investigating previous speeches made by Hussain, who holds joint British-Pakistani citizenship, since last summer. It is one of three separate investigations by the force into Hussain and other senior members of the MQM who have effectively run a significant portion of Karachi’s political scene from London’s suburbs. In September 2010, MQM’s deputy leader Dr Imran Farooq was beaten and stabbed to death outside his north London home, triggering a murder investigation that continues to this day. “Detectives from the Met Police Counter Terrorism Command (SO15) are investigating Dr Farooq’s murder and remain committed to putting before the courts those responsible,” the Met spokeswoman told the Guardian. In the course of the investigation, police raided properties linked to the MQM and found large amounts of cash, leading to a separate money-laundering investigation by fraud specialists. Hussain was arrested as part of the money-laundering investigation in June 2014 and released on bail; five other leaders of the MQM based in London were also arrested and bailed, although bail was cancelled on all six men in February 2016. A file on the money-laundering investigation was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether to charge in April, although no decision has yet been made. Wasay Jalil, a member of MQM’s coordination committee based in London, said it was not the case that the party was using London as a base to incite violence. “We’ve never used British soil for terrorism,” he told the Guardian on Tuesday. “We always act within peaceful political structures.” The party says that the MQM has faced growing political persecution in Pakistan, claiming that 66 party activists have been killed extrajudicially and 125 have disappeared since 2013, while 1,500 party workers have been jailed. On Tuesday afternoon, Hussain apologised for his remarks, blaming “mental stress”. Although Jalil sought to play down rumours of a split in the MQM, a senior party member in Pakistan distanced the party from Hussain’s comments, saying in a press conference the MQM should be run “from Pakistan alone”."
2016-08-24T22:57:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Royal Marine arrested over suspected Northern Ireland terrorist plot,"A serving member of the Royal Marines has been arrested on the orders of security officials trying to stop Irish terrorists staging attacks against Britain. There were also searches of woodlands in rural south Devon suspected of containing bombs and weapons smuggled from Ulster. Wednesday’s dramatic day of activity included the arrest of the 30-year-old marine, named locally as Ciaran Maxwell, and a security operation spanning a swath of the south of Britain and Northern Ireland involving four police forces and the domestic intelligence service, MI5. It is understood the genesis of the incidents was the discovery in March, and then May, of arms dumps in County Antrim belonging to dissident republicans, called the New IRA, which police in Northern Ireland had hailed as significant. The weapons caches were discovered by chance by members of the public. Among the deadly items were pipe bombs, magazines and ammunition for an assault rifle, and anti-personnel mines. The find and subsequent inquiries led security officials to decide in May that the threat to the British mainland from Irish terrorism needed to be raised to substantial and a race was begun to trace all those connected to the arms dumps before they could stage attacks. At 12.20pm on Wednesday, police arrested the marine in Somerset for alleged involvement in preparing acts of terrorism. Police said searches were under way in “a wooded area in south Devon” and in Northern Ireland. The searches in south Devon were for materials linked to republican terrorism, such as weapons or material related to explosives, which may have come from the terrorist haul linked to finds in Co Antrim. Officers are potentially looking for storage dumps where material that could be used in an attack may have been hidden. In a statement, police said: “Today’s arrest was planned and intelligence-led as part of an investigation into Northern Ireland-related terrorism being led by SO15 [Met’s counter-terrorism command] in collaboration with Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and the south west counter-terrorism intelligence unit. No armed police were involved in today’s arrest. “The public can be reassured that there is no intelligence to suggest an immediate threat to our communities.” Past targets for dissident republicans in Northern Ireland have been figures of the state such as prison officers, military and police officers. The threat from dissident republican terrorism has become increasingly potent and they are gaining in the capability to stage attacks in England and other parts of the UK, as well as Northern Ireland.
The arrest is understood to be linked to the two suspected dissident republican arsenals uncovered in Carnfunnock and Capanagh parks near Larne within three months of each other. An armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines were among the cache recovered at Capanagh in May. Police said four barrels were unearthed at Carnfunnock – two barrels were empty but two others contained a variety of bomb-making components, including wiring, toggle switches, circuit boards, partially constructed timer power units, ball bearings and a small quantity of explosives. In a statement, the Ministry of Defence said: “We are aware of a police investigation involving the arrest of a member of the armed forces under the 2000 Terrorism Act and will assist this investigation fully. It would be inappropriate to comment further on an ongoing investigation.” PSNI searches on Wednesday were focused on a stretch of terraced homes on the Old Glenarm Road in Larne.The fact that police chiefs decided there was no need to send armed officers suggests they did not believe the suspect had access to a firearm. The timing of the arrest was unusual. Police usually prefer to mount counter-terrorism raids in the early morning, for the element of surprise and to minimise the chances of a suspect fleeing. Devon and Cornwall police were helping counter-terrorism police search the south Devon woods, while Avon and Somerset officers were helping with searches of an address in Somerset. The police operations in England were led by SO15."
2016-08-25T06:00:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Two police officers to be interviewed over death of Dalian Atkinson,"Two police officers being investigated following the Tasering and death of Dalian Atkinson will be interviewed within days under criminal caution, investigators have said. The two officers will be interviewed as potential suspects by the end of next week at the latest, the Independent Police Complaints Commission confirmed. Atkinson, a former Premier League football star, died after a clash with police during which he was shot with a Taser electric weapon outside his father’s home in Telford, Shropshire. A criminal inquiry into the death of the 48-year-old will take nine months and forensic investigations are continuing into the cause of death. A significant stage in the investigation is the interviewing of the officers by the IPCC. A spokesperson for the IPCC said: “Our independent investigation into the death of Dalian Atkinson is expected to take around nine months. We recognise there is significant public interest and while we will carry out the investigation as swiftly as possible, we need to ensure it is thorough and robust. “Interviews under criminal caution with two West Mercia police officers will take place shortly.” The two officers have been suspended from duty and issued with notices they are being investigated for gross misconduct. The IPCC has stressed that its decision to launch a criminal investigation does not mean the officers did anything wrong. The former Aston Villa footballer died after police Tasered him three times last Monday. Efforts to save him by medics, including 35 minutes of CPR, did not work. Some eyewitnesses claimed Atkinson was struck by officers while he was on the ground. One told the media that she saw what she believed was Atkinson being kicked by police. The key issues in the criminal investigation will be whether the decision to use force was justified and then whether the level of force was proportionate to Atkinson’s behaviour. Atkinson’s brother, Kenroy, 53, previously said the ex-footballer had undergone dialysis for kidney failure and was “in a manic state” and depressed at the time of the incident. He said his brother had attacked their 85-year-old father, Ernest, at his home before police were called to the scene. West Mercia police said officers used a Taser at about 1.30am on Monday after responding to reports of concerns for a person’s safety. Officers attended after a call from a neighbour who heard raised voices. Atkinson was pronounced dead 90 minutes after the Taser was fired. A postmortem examination was held last Wednesday and the cause of death was inconclusive."
2016-08-25T11:40:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Three men seek answers after being arrested at gunpoint by Kent police,"Three businessmen from Manchester are seeking answers from Kent police after their taxi was stopped and they were arrested by heavily armed masked officers before being held in cells for hours and then released at 4am without explanation. Joe Taylor, 32, said he and his two colleagues were “petrified” by the chain of events, which took place when they were visiting the south-east on a work trip. Speaking to the Guardian, Taylor said that more than a dozen police, some carrying assault rifles and wearing masks, surrounded them after their taxi was stopped on the A2 shortly after they left their hotel in Northfleet. They were on their way to eat at the Bluewater shopping centre after a day viewing potential worksites. Taylor, who runs his family’s Lancashire-based lighting firm, said he was on the phone to his family at the time and was told by police: “If you don’t put that fucking phone down I’ll blow your head off.” He said he and his colleagues were taken from the taxi and made to lie on the ground with guns to their heads, and were then held in a police station before being released at 4am without any charges or explanation. Kent police confirmed that the car stop happened and that the men were arrested on suspicion of firearms offences but subsequently released. Taylor said he and his colleagues were still coming to terms with what had happened to them on Tuesday and had not subsequently had an explanation from the force. “We are three lads who have never been in trouble at all,” said Taylor. “You just don’t know how to act in a situation like this. You are kind of naive, thinking at the time that it’s all going to get sorted out in a few minutes, but then it’s not. We were almost like [in] a state of shock really. It was a bit of a blur and we were on the floors in handcuffs, machine guns at our heads and being escorted off.” Taylor said he had spent all Wednesday on the phone to Kent police trying to get an explanation and that he was still stranded because his car remained impounded. “We don’t even know if it’s a member of the public or a CCTV operative who has seen something that they have misconstrued as a gun. They told us they would not be able to answer any questions until we were interviewed. But then we were given nothing, with no one accepting responsibility. We were just let out the back door of a Kent police station without an answer.” A spokeswoman for Kent police confirmed on Thursday that armed officers had stopped a vehicle shortly after 6pm on Tuesday on the London-bound carriageway of the A2. “The vehicle was stopped to make urgent inquiries in connection with a serious investigation on behalf of Essex police,” she added. “Three men were arrested on suspicion of firearms offences and were arrested at the scene. “Armed officers making enquiries of subjects expect them to comply with instructions. Officers follow the national authorised professional practice, which define standards and tactics necessary to maintain the safety of the public, the individuals themselves and the officers. “No complaint has been received by Kent Police. Anyone wishing to make a complaint is encouraged to contact the relevant force to do so.” The force also said that there was no risk to the wider public."
2016-08-25T13:13:16Z,uk-news,UK news,Royal Marine held on terror charges is from 'highly respected' family,"The Royal Marine arrested over republican dissident-related terrorism charges has served in the British armed forces for at least six years and belongs to a respected Catholic family in the Ulster loyalist-dominated town of Larne. A close friend of Ciaran Maxwell’s family told the Guardian he was “shocked and shaken” by the news that the 30-year-old soldier was in detention in relation to the discovery of a terrorist arsenal in Northern Ireland earlier this year. The family friend, who has asked not be named, described Maxwell as a “straightforward” young man “with his head screwed on”. He revealed that the Royal Marine, who faces a second night in custody as he is questioned by detectives, has one young son and is in a long-term relationship. The soldier has served a tour of duty in Afghanistan, the family friend said. He attended the local Catholic secondary school in Larne, St Comgall’s, and won trophies and medals there in track and field events. It has emerged that when he was 16, Maxwell was the victim of a savage beating in his home town. He sustained a fractured skull and suffered multiple other injuries when a gang of loyalists attacked him with iron bars and golf clubs. During his recovery, he recounted the incident to republican newspaper An Phoblacht in an article that was accompanied by a picture showing the extent of his injuries. On a possible alleged link to dissident republican terror groups, the family friend said: “He seemed to be settled with his girlfriend and a new child so this is a complete bolt from the blue. All the family are highly respected in the town and seen as moderate.” He explained how many Catholics in Larne had served in the British armed forces. “Larne is not like parts of Belfast or some of the divided towns in Northern Ireland like Portadown. There are no Catholic enclaves in Larne, which is Protestant and loyalist dominated. Catholics over the years had to integrate and some through generations served in the British military. There have been chairmen and senior officials in the local British Legion for instance from the Catholic community here. “Ciaran’s mother is a highly regarded member of the Larne community, as are her other sons. So you can imagine how shocked and shaken those that know them are when they heard about Ciaran’s arrest,” he said. The family friend added: “There are a few young bucks in the Catholic community who boast that they are republican dissidents, but you wouldn’t send them out to the shop for a newspaper because they would buy the wrong one. It’s a bit different up and down the Antrim coast, where there are pockets of more serious people who support the dissident cause. If this connection is true with Ciaran – and I sincerely hope it isn’t – then you are talking about a committed soldier who knows what he is doing.” On his Facebook page, Maxwell makes no obvious reference to his career in the British military, which is standard personal security procedure for soldiers and police officers either serving or who come from Northern Ireland, given the continuing threat to their lives from republican dissident terror groups. However, there are some military videos that appear to have been taken from a phone. Over the past decade or more, the Real IRA, New IRA and Continuity IRA – the three main factions opposed to peace and power sharing in Northern Ireland – have killed two soldiers, two police officers and two members of the local prison service. Meanwhile, local security sources in Belfast have told the Guardian that the discovery of two military Claymore anti-personnel mines at a New IRA arms dump in a forest near Larne in May was one link in the chain leading to the arrest of the soldier in Somerset on Wednesday. The mines were part of a large arsenal of homemade bombs, explosives, components for other bombs and ammunition discovered in Capanagh forest in Co Antrim in May. The Police Service of Northern Ireland described that find as one of the most significant terrorist arms hauls in recent years. Security sources in Belfast said the investigation that led to Wednesday’s arrest of the Royal Marine was in part due to the tracing of the two Claymore anti-personnel mines to a specific military base from which they were stolen. “Everyone was involved in this operation, including the security service’s listening station at GCHQ in Cheltenham to MI5 regional headquarters based in Northern Ireland, the PSNI and the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command. The mines were the key to tracking down where they came from and creating a trail of suspects,” they said. Just before the discovery of the weapons in Capanagh forest park, which also included armour-piercing rockets, the then home secretary, Theresa May, said the threat from the New IRA and other hardline republican dissident groups of a bombing campaign in England was at its highest for many years. On Thursday, officers from the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command and local uniformed officers were continuing to carry out searches at a property in Exminster. DCI Antony Hart, of Devon and Cornwall police, said: “Local officers will be in the Exminster area and will be speaking to residents to help offer reassurance. “Searches are expected to continue throughout the weekend at the property in question. Searches are also continuing at the nearby wooded area. “Road closures will be in place on some of the minor roads surrounding the wooded area and are also expected to remain in place throughout the weekend,” he added. “We apologise for any inconvenience this will cause and thank the public for their patience.”"
2016-08-25T15:03:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Camber Sands: family express anger over deaths of five friends from London,"The five young men who died at Camber Sands were two brothers and their friends enjoying a day trip to the popular beach, it has emerged, as the family of one of the victims questioned why no safety measures had been brought in following the death of a man last month. Three of the men were pulled out of the sea at Camber Sands, near Rye, East Sussex, on Wednesday afternoon and two others were found later that evening when the tide receded. They have been named locally as Nitharsan Ravi, 22, Inthushan Sriskantharasa, 23, brothers Kobi, 22, and Ken Nathan, 19, and Kurushanth Srithavarajah, 27. The five, all from Greater London, had travelled in a car belonging to Ravi, a student at the University of Brighton studying aeronautical engineering. One theory is they had been playing football on a sandbar and got cut off by a strong tide. As relatives and friends gathered in support at Ravi’s family home in Plumstead, south-east London, his distraught younger sister Mayura, 17, sobbed and clutched her brother’s T-shirt as she said: “The people he died with are all his best friends, really close mates.”
The family were feeling angry that the stretch of beach had not been blocked off after a man died there last month, his sister said. She added: “Now it’s been blocked. Why didn’t they do it before? They could have saved five other lives.” Ravi’s brother Ajirthan, 19, said police came to their door at 11pm on Wednesday as his brother’s Golf GTI was one of the only vehicles left in the car park. “Because of the incident, they were assuming that the five passengers of the car were the five people they found,” he said. “We were distraught, we were so disappointed. We were so upset. It took a while for the police to verify the exact people. Then, about four hours later, they confirmed it’s my brother and his four friends.” He said the emergency services had told the family that Ken and Inthushan had got into difficulty first, getting trapped in quicksand or mud beneath the water, then his brother, Kobi Nathan and Kurushanth had tried to rescue them. “Ken and Indu got stuck underneath the water,” he said. “What they did is the three boys tried to save them. The three boys went under water to try to save them.” He said attempts failed and Kurushanth was brought out first and declared dead straight away. “My bro and Kobi had heartbeats and managed to survive for a few minutes but after first aid they couldn’t recover.” Both died within 15 minutes after being pulled from the water, he said. The bodies of Ken Nathan and Sriskantharasa were discovered later that evening, he said, adding that he thought they had got their legs caught in the “slippery mud” and sand on the sea bottom. Paying tribute to his brother he said: “My brother knew Kurushanth through sport. They played football and cricket together. He had been friends with Kobi since secondary school. They were very close. They also went to university together. “Kobi’s and Ken’s parents have lost both their children. I’m devastated for everyone. I knew all the men. They were good innocent people who have lost their lives. They had just gone down for a day at the beach, like normal people. And unfortunately this happened.” In tribute to Sriskantharasa, Ranu Kumar wrote on Facebook: “Was one of the best, genuine, one of my closest cousins in UK.” Friends of Ravi paid tribute to him on social media. Jackson Bosco wrote: “RIP Nitharsan Ravi. Can’t believe to hear the news that you were one of the boys at Camber Sands. You were truly a good person with a good heart. You are going to be missed on this earth.” Another friend, Charles Bosco, 27, told the Guardian that Ravi “was a really nice and quiet boy. He will truly be missed by all his friends and family. We still can’t believe he’s gone. May he rest in peace.”
Bosco said he had known Ravi since they were 10 and they had gone to Tamil school together. He said they had gone on a pilgrimage to Walsingham for a Tamil festival every year. Ch Supt Di Roskilly said: “We believe we now know who the men are and that they came to the beach together for the day. We believe they are all in their late teens and early 20s and come from the Greater London area. These men were not fully clothed when they were pulled from the sea but wearing clothes appropriate for being at the beach for the day. “We have no further reports of anyone else missing from Camber and there are no ongoing searches related to this incident. This has been an incredibly tragic incident and we are offering their next of kin support at this difficult time and our thoughts are with them.” It was believed a sixth person was missing but there was no search operation at the beach on Thursday and day trippers were continuing to arrive.There was a previous death at Camber Sands in July, when Gustavo Silva Da Cruz, 19, died after getting into difficulty while swimming. Da Cruz was one of three men who got into trouble at that time – the two others, who were not connected to him, were a man aged 35 and his 17-year-old son. The deaths have intensified calls for lifeguards to be stationed at the beach. There are no permanent lifeguards at Camber Sands, and a petition on Change.org set up last month by Josie Holloway, from Greatstone, a coastal town about 10 miles away, called for them to be stationed there during the summer. The petition has received more than 5,000 signatures and states: “Camber Sands gets unbelievably busy during summer time. They have beach patrol but no lifeguards … I feel it could save lives.”
The list of signatories has been growing rapidly since Wednesday’s deaths. Camber Sands was quiet early on Thursday with only a few dozen people on the beach. A member of staff at Antonio’s cafe near the seafront, who has lived in Camber for 46 years, said Rother district council needed to reinvest the tourism revenues into safety features for the beach. The woman, who asked not to be named, said: “The council needs to start putting the thousands of pounds of revenue they receive from the village back into saving lives,” she said. “There’s a beach patrol but no lifeguard. The beach patrol focuses on helping distressed parents with lost children. I’d love to know what training they have for things like first aid. I’d be surprised if they had any at all.”
Whitney Bibby, 20, who works in a cafe near the beachfront and was raised in Camber, said she believed the most likely cause of the tragedy was the strong riptides in the area. Bibby said it was a commonly held view that revenues raised in Camber were disproportionately spent on the affluent town of Bexhill, about 20 miles away. “There should be lifeguards,” she said. “It’s £12 a day in the car park, so much is raised they should put some back.”A member of staff at Laguna gift shop, who has been in Camber for more than 40 years, said up until the recent deaths she could not recall a similar tragedy in three decades. The 79-year-old said it was “disgusting” that there were no lifeguards. Jane Walker, 26, from south London, went swimming in the sea off Camber Sands on Thursday. “It’s awful what happened, obviously, but we’re not swimming out far and we’ve been down here a few times before so know the area,” she said. Walker said she was shocked by the deaths of the five men. “I couldn’t believe it when we found out the day before we were coming down. It’s really sad. Five is so many it makes you wonder what could have gone wrong.” She added: “I am really surprised there are no lifeguards. In fact, I don’t think I ever noticed that before. That’s crazy. It’s such a long beach and it can get so busy.” The RNLI said that while it was too early to determine any change in the location of its lifeguards, the policy was under constant review and Wednesday’s events would be factored into the charity’s planning. A spokesperson for Rother district council said: “We are very saddened to hear of this incident and our thoughts are with the families of those involved. “Regular assessments are carried out at Camber beach, along with the RNLI, to inform what measures need to be taken to guide visitor safety and ensure the beach is safe. To date this has not identified the need for lifeguards to be deployed at the beach and there have never been lifeguards employed at the beach.”The RNLI has urged seaside visitors to take care and respect the water after Wednesday’s incident brought the number of deaths around Britain’s coastline in the past week up to 12. “The sea may look appealing and the RNLI would encourage people to use it, but do so safely – it can be dangerously unpredictable,” a spokeswoman said.

2016-08-25T15:22:45Z,uk-news,UK news,SNP veteran Michael Russell appointed Scottish Brexit minister,"Nicola Sturgeon has brought a combative and veteran former minister back into government as her new minister for Brexit. Michael Russell, a former education secretary and Scottish National party chief executive under Alex Salmond, will lead the first minister’s efforts to influence the shape and detail of Theresa May’s deal on leaving the EU after nearly two years on the backbenches. His appointment follows strong signals from Sturgeon earlier this week that she is switching the focus from planning a fresh independence referendum as her chief priority to accepting Scotland will probably leave the EU with the rest of the UK. As she named Russell as her Brexit minister on Thursday, Sturgeon said: “In the period ahead of article 50 being triggered, influencing the UK position will be crucial to our efforts to protect Scotland’s interests and our relationship with Europe, especially the single market.” Russell will stand aside as a part-time professor of Scottish culture and governance at Glasgow University – a role created for him after he left his post as education secretary following Salmond’s resignation as first minster when he lost the 2014 independence referendum – while he remains in government. A pragmatist on the centre-right of the Scottish National party, Russell is by some distance one of the most experienced figures at Holyrood and in the SNP. He served as party chief executive under Salmond before devolution, and held several ministerial posts. His role as minister for UK negotiations on Scotland’s place in Europe, where he will report directly to Sturgeon, will focus on building political alliances in Scotland to strengthen his hand in any policy conflicts with the UK government in London. “Following the overwhelming vote in Scotland to remain in the EU, it is essential that Scotland comes together to defend our national interest. Accordingly in these discussions, it is important that the nation speaks, as much as possible, with one voice,” Russell said. “I will therefore want to listen and learn from the widest range of individuals, communities, organisations and companies about their hopes and fears for the future.” Scottish Labour’s Europe spokesman, the MSP Lewis Macdonald, said Russell’s first task should be to release all Scottish government minutes on Sturgeon’s meetings in Europe and any legal advice on Brexit’s impact on Scotland and its future in the EU. “The Scottish people have a right to know what was discussed in Brussels. Anything less would be unacceptable from the SNP,” Macdonald said. “Labour gave Nicola Sturgeon our full support to negotiate with the UK government and EU institutions to find the best deal for the people of Scotland. That support came with an expectation of transparency.” The Scottish government’s switch of emphasis away from a second independence vote, which has also included the SNP postponing a heavily trailed plan to launch a pro-independence project this summer, came as the latest official figures confirmed the country has a huge budget deficit. The government expenditure and revenue Scotland data, released on Wednesday, disclosed an increased £14.8bn net fiscal deficit between tax raised and public spending last year, equal to 21% of overall spending and 9.5% of its GDP – more than double the figure for the UK as a whole, which fell last year. Critics pointed out that this would probably leave Scotland with the largest deficit in the EU if it became independent – higher than that of Greece, and three times higher than the 3% deficit limit set by EU rules. Derek Mackay, the recently appointed finance secretary who is also due to oversee preparations for a possible independence referendum, insisted that was no bar to Scotland staying in the EU. Implying that if Scotland did become independent, its membership would be a continuation of the UK’s current membership, he said on BBC Radio Scotland that no one had asked the UK to leave after the financial crash in 2008. “Take financial year 2009/10. Coming out the financial crisis, the UK deficit in terms of relative to GDP was over 10%,” Mackay said on Good Morning Scotland. “No one suggested the UK was bankrupt then and would have to exit the EU.” Murdo Fraser, a Tory MSP, said the SNP plan regarding the deficit was to “shut their eyes as tight as possible in the hope everyone else does too”. “If ever an independent Scotland did seek EU membership, it would need to convince other EU nations that it had a plan to bear down on the huge deficit we’re running. The last thing the EU would want is to take on the risk of another bailout,” Fraser said."
2016-08-25T23:01:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May announces Â£40m fund to boost post-Brexit UK tourism,"Theresa May has pledged Brexit will create “real opportunities for growth” in the tourism sector as she announced a new £40m fund for tourism projects across the country, though just one of the projects which have won funding so far is based in the north of England. Ahead of the August bank holiday weekend, the prime minister also announced several new schemes to attract visitors to Britain, including relaxing licensing laws to allow B&Bs to offer a welcome drink to guests and to pick visitors up from train stations.
The first grants from the £40m Discover England fund have been awarded to projects and organisations in different geographic areas intended to attract tourism outside of London. Of the seven announced so far, five are based in the south of England, including Kent, Surrey and Devon, though of those, Golf Tourism England runs trips across the UK, as does Gloucestershire-based Compass Holidays, which has been funded to develop its tourism app. Birmingham-based Leopold Marketing won funding with the brief to develop tourism outside London and Scotland. Just one of the projects is based in the north of England, UK Countryside Tours in Derbyshire, which runs tours across the country including Yorkshire, Cumbria and the Peak District. A DCMS spokesman said more projects which had won funding would be announced in due course. As well as the relaxation of licensing laws, Number 10 announced a new government-backed deal with train companies will offer visitors the ability to book five scenic rail itineraries around the UK. May said in a statement that tourism would be an even more vital industry after the UK leaves the EU. “The British people’s decision to leave the European Union creates real opportunities for growth and we will work in close partnership with the tourism industry, to ensure it continues to thrive as negotiations on the UK’s exit progress,” she said. “We are making it easier for visitors to travel beyond London and experience all of the world-class attractions the UK has to offer, to make sure the benefits of this thriving industry are felt by the many and not the few.” Karen Bradley, the new secretary of state for culture, media and sport, said the initiative would “further strengthen tourism outside of London to ensure that growth from the sector is enjoyed right across the country.” The sharp drop in the pound post-EU referendum has been a bonus for foreign tourists, making holidaying in the UK cheaper. Last week it was reported that tax-free spending had increased from visitors from Asia and the US. Shipping company Global Blue reported a 7% year-on-year increase in UK international tax-free shopping in July. Communities minister, Andrew Percy, has also announced a scheme to create 20 new coastal community teams in seaside towns across the UK in order to boost tourism for Britain’s beaches. “Across our Great British Coast we’ve got an amazing variety of resorts to be proud of from Cleethorpes to Brighton and beyond,” Percy said. “People in those areas can now come together and bid for government cash to revive tourist attractions to their former glory.”"
2016-08-26T11:50:15Z,uk-news,UK news,London children: what can the mayor's champion for education do?,"During my recent visit to Tottenham I heard a story about some local school children who didn’t know the Thames when they saw it. A teacher had taken them to the Globe theatre. On arrival a member of her party pointed at the wide ribbon of water flowing by and asked: “What’s that?” Such stories are not unusual. Many disadvantaged London children, taking after their parents, rarely travel beyond their own corner of the capital. The wider London of dazzling variety and rich possibility can remain foreign and even threatening to them. One of the reasons housing benefit reform seems not to have resulted in London households moving homes in as large numbers or over as large distances as some had feared is that many low income families appear willing to make considerable sacrifices in other areas of their lives in order to bridge their rent gaps and stay put, rather than break important local family and friendship ties. Might there also be a related attainment gap between the excellent exam results so many London school children obtain and the uses to which they put them once they’ve left school? Might attainment levels among London’s less affluent children - of whom there are far too many - themselves be depressed by a limited sense of the opportunities London offers them, arising from a limited sense of belonging to London as a whole? Such questions have certainly been raised before and perhaps are in the mind of Joanne McCartney, the experienced Labour London Assembly member and recently-appointed statutory deputy mayor to whom Sadiq Khan has now also handed responsibility for education and childcare. Mayors currently have no formal, direct powers over London schooling, but the profile of City Hall means that they and their lieutenants can highlight issues, mobilise opinion and bring people together to launch and support new initiatives. Boris Johnson sponsored academy schools, encouraged the learning of musical instruments, formed a gold club to recognise schools that had done well in adverse circumstances and commissioned a report which called for a pan-London education authority to be set up, taking control over admissions, building connections between schools - more and more of which are outside local authority control - and raising standards. Last November, he advocated the creation of a London schools commissioner to address the capital’s need for more school places and to recruit and retain teachers. Johnson has strong views on education, not all of them daft. Though a fan of the absurd Tory movement to bring back grammar schools and predictably enthused by the idea of free schools being mini-Etons on the state, he’s also a champion of the arts and foreign languages - not only Latin - and a believer that education is about something more than being good at doing tests. Just before leaving City Hall he announced a scheme called Stepping Stones, designed to help vulnerable children make the transition from primary to secondary school. It is based at a Tottenham primary. Joanne McCartney’s constituency, which she has represented since 2004, contains Tottenham, so she’ll be well aware of the situation there. But, of course, her new remit takes in the whole of the capital and also includes pre-school care. Her priorities are listed as improving pre-school childcare provision, helping boroughs to provide school places and bolstering a city-wide effort to recruit a new generation of headteachers. “We’re lucky that our schools are amongst the best in the country and young Londoners are full of bright talent,” she says. “But we still have a job to do to make sure all London’s young people receive the schooling they deserve. I’m looking forward to working with London boroughs, teachers and most importantly, schoolchildren to ensure that together we can ensure that all children, regardless of their background, are able to flourish and excel from early-years through to their chosen career path.” Wish her luck in her new role. Perhaps she could begin by organising a mass visit to the Thames."
2016-08-26T12:14:59Z,uk-news,UK news,Imam murder trial jury shown photo of suspect in stab-proof vest,"Jurors have been shown an image of the alleged Islamic State supporter accused of murdering a respected imam in Greater Manchester posing for the camera in a stab-proof vest. The picture of Mohammed Hussain Syeedy, 21, was presented at the trial for the murder of Jalal Uddin, 71, in February. In another photograph shown to the jury, Syeedy points a finger to the sky while holding a white flag over a Rochdale road sign that had been changed to read “war zone”.
Syeedy is accused along with Mohammed Abdul Kadir, 24, of murdering Uddin. They allegedly viewed the elderly imam’s use of healing amulets as “black magic”. The trial at Manchester crown court heard how Syeedy and Kadir stalked Uddin around the streets of Rochdale before Kadir attacked him with a hammer-like object in a playground. The pair mounted covert surveillance on Uddin six months before the killing on 18 February when they discovered he practised ruqya, a form of Islamic healing, the court has heard. The use of healing amulets, known as taweez, is considered a sin worthy of severe punishment – including death – by some Salafi Muslims and Isis supporters, jurors have been told. Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, told the jury there was “clear and cogent” evidence that Syeedy and Kadir supported Isis.
In another photograph shown to jurors, Syeedy poses with a “Rochdale 2 Syria” banner before embarking on what they described as an aid trip in 2013. He smiles alongside friends wearing black badges that show either a Kalashnikov or curved sword, widely used by Isis and other jihadi groups. Jurors have been told that the co-accused Kadir is being hunted by police after he fled to Turkey three days after the killing. Syeedy was shown on CCTV driving his Vauxhall Astra closely behind Uddin before dropping Kadir off at the gates of a playground before the attack at 8.42pm. Kadir, from Oldham, inflicted “repeated forceful blows” to Uddin’s head and mouth with a weapon believed to be a hammer, the court has heard, leaving him with severe skull fractures. Syeedy, from Rochdale, could then be seen picking Kadir up at the other side of the playground at 8.43pm. Jurors have heard that Syeedy admits being with Kadir before and after the attack but denies knowing that the older defendant planned to murder Uddin. The trial continues."

A lot of people talk nonsense about legacy and increased participation in sport for a week or so. Then most of the country forgets all about the Olympics for another four years and piles on the pounds. It’s almost as if there’s a quantity theory of exercise: the more medals Team GB wins, the fatter and lazier everyone else becomes. Breaking this cycle might be a little easier if we weren’t so obviously insincere in mouthing off platitudes like “It’s not the winning, it’s the taking part” when those athletes who came back from Rio without a medal are treated like pariahs. On the plane home, it was the gold medallists who got to turn left and pose with the cabin crew in first class. The silver and bronze medallists got to sit in premium economy, while the rest had to wedge themselves into the favelas of steerage. If that wasn’t bad enough, the losers were airbrushed out of all the “hero’s welcome” photos and left to make their own way home, where there was almost certainly a letter waiting for them saying their lottery funding had been cut.
Tuesday Embarrassment is now becoming second nature to the Labour party, but its cock-up architects excelled themselves with Traingate. Releasing at least eight different versions of the same event is never a good look. Nor is the discovery that none of Jeremy Corbyn’s advisers could get hold of him to agree one of the eight versions because the Labour leader was at a critical point in his jam making. But regardless of whether there were or weren’t any free seats available on the Virgin train from London to Newcastle, one thing stands out. The trip to Gateshead wasn’t planned at the last minute, so why did no one think to reserve the four seats on the service? Corbyn has at least four people working for him: surely one of them must have had some experience in booking train tickets on the internet? There seems to be only one way to make sure this kind of thing never happens again. Nationalise his back office. Wednesday The day is rapidly approaching when Theresa May’s government is actually going to have to do something, rather than talking about what it isn’t going to do. Most eyes will be on the Toxic Triumvirate of Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox, who are nailed-on certainties to fall out over the Brexit negotiations, but those looking for amusement in likely Tory incompetence should also keep a look out for Jeremy Hunt, Andrea Leadsom and Chris Grayling. Hunt has achieved a unique double by being the first health secretary to be equally disliked by the NHS and his own government department. Meanwhile, as environment, food and rural affairs secretary, Leadsom has the poisoned chalice of explaining to all those people in Cornwall and Wales who voted for Brexit why the government won’t be matching the EU subsidies, as she promised in the referendum campaign. The dark horse, though, is Grayling. As the man behind May’s ascent to No 10, he might have expected one of the great offices of state. That May felt she could only give him transport shows how little faith she has in his abilities. Expect some fun with the third runway and HS2.
Thursday “Moist” is the frontrunner in an online poll conducted by Oxford Dictionaries to find the country’s most hated word. Moist also happens to be one of the favourite words of presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins in The Great British Innuendo, which began its seventh series on Wednesday and was watched by more than 10 million viewers. So I’d guess the country can’t hate “moist” that much. The return of Bake Off rather passed me by – I can’t get too worked up about people beating the odds to create the perfect lemon drizzle cake. There’s something about a programme that has been perfectly edited to be deliberately feelgood that leaves me feeling anything but. Not that I’m immune to emotional manipulation; it’s just I prefer it to be done with a little more subtlety, so I can believe my tears are forming of their own volition. Which is why my own autumn TV highlight is sure to be the return of Cold Feet. Heartstrings tugged at room temperature.
Friday It’s not yet clear who paid for Nigel Farage to make a guest appearance at Donald Trump’s election rally in Mississippi, but, based on past form, it is unlikely to have been him. Nigel generally likes to let others – the EU in particular – take the strain when it comes to his political adventures. It’s also probable that just as few Americans knew who the hell he was as there are Brits who recognise any of the names on the list of candidates to take over the Ukip leadership. With Suzanne Evans suspended for being too normal and Steven Woolfe, Farage’s preferred candidate, being too dopey to submit his forms on time, the field has been left clear for a bunch of no-hopers that have almost as little name recognition within the party as without. Anyone heard of Lisa Duffy, Phillip Broughton, Bill Etheridge or Elizabeth Jones? Thought not. Even Liam Fox might stand a chance against that lot. The frontrunner is Diane James, who has put everyone’s backs up by refusing to turn up for any of the hustings. Stand by for the fallout when the new leader is announced at Ukip’s conference on 16 September. Digested week, digested: Repetitive train injury"
2016-08-26T14:35:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Three men charged over UK horsemeat scandal,"Three men have been charged with fraud over the selling of horsemeat in 2012, shortly before it was revealed that UK supermarkets were stocking beef products with traces of horse DNA. Alex Ostler-Beech, 43, from Hull, Ulrik Nielsen, 57, from Gentofte, Denmark, and Andrew Sideras, 54, from Southgate, London, have all been charged with fraud offences. All three men will appear at the City of London magistrates court on 27 September. Kristin Jones, head of specialist fraud for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “The CPS has today authorised charges against three men, relating to the sale of mixed beef and horsemeat products that were sold as beef. “After carefully considering evidence from the UK and overseas, the CPS has decided that there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to charge these three men. “This decision comes after a thorough investigation conducted by the City of London police in liaison with partner agencies. “May I remind all concerned that criminal proceedings against Nielsen, Ostler-Beech and Sideras will now be commenced and of their right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.” The details of the charge are that between 1 January 2012 and 31 October 2012, Ostler-Beech, Nielsen and Sideras conspired together, and with others, to defraud purchasers of goods that contained, wholly or in part, a mixture of beef and horsemeat, by dishonestly arranging for beef and horsemeat to be combined for sale as beef. The charges follow an international criminal investigation that saw the City of London police, which is the National Policing Lead for Fraud, work with law enforcement agencies from across the UK and Europe."
2016-08-26T15:10:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Activists occupy CPS offices over Kingsley Burrell's death,"Activists have occupied the lobby of the Crown Prosecution Service offices in Birmingham, calling for police officers to be prosecuted over the 2011 death of a student. On Friday, about 20 protesters chanted “Who are the murderers? Police are the murderers”, “no justice, no peace” and “black lives matter”, waved placards that read “shut it down”, and recited the names of black men who had died after coming into contact with the police. They vowed not to leave until a senior representative of the CPS spoke to them. Desmond Jaddoo, coordinator of the Justice for Kingsley Burrell campaign, said the protest was the start of more direct action. The sit-in included members of the Black Lives Matter campaign, who were wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts or displaying banners with the slogan. A CPS area business manager, Karen Sawicki, came to the lobby more than two hours into the sit-in to accept a letter that the protesters asked be passed directly to Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, highlighting the delays in reaching a charging decision. “We need justice now as justice delayed is justice denied,” the letter said. Burrell’s sister Kadisha said afterwards: “I think today definitely went well – we managed to have our direct action in a peaceful way. Getting a reaction from the community to let them know that Kingsley’s death hasn’t been in vain – it goes to show it’s a serious issue, what happened to Kingsley.” Burrell, a student and father of three, died in March 2011 from a heart attack four days after being detained under the Mental Health Act. He was 29.
His sister told a rally in front of Birmingham Cathedral before the CPS protest that the family had campaigned for justice ever since, adding: “What happened to Kingsley, nobody should go through that ill-treatment. He was treated like a dog. He was treated like an animal.” She and their mother, Janet Burrell, joined those occupying the CPS offices. Jaddoo told the Guardian the case had been “shrouded in delays” from the outset. He said: “It took 18 months for them to release his body for burial, and four years to get to inquest.” The inquest recorded what Jaddoo described as a “damning verdict of negligence” against agencies including the police, but the family was concerned by the evidence given by three officers and complained to theIndependent Police Complaints Commission that they appeared to have perjured themselves. The IPCC passed a file to the CPS for a charging decision last October. The family met the CPS on Tuesday and told the demonstrators they expect to hear in the next fortnight whether charges would be brought against the officers. Kadisha Burrell said: “It doesn’t look promising at all.” She added: “We want them to prosecute: there’s more than enough evidence … we’re anxious. We can’t wait any more.” She denied her brother had mental health problems. The CPS had previously declined to bring charges against the officers. It said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute after the IPCC’s initial investigation into the death. Janet Burrell told the Guardian about the wait for the CPS decision. She said: “You can’t move on with your life. Your life’s left on hold, you’re constantly waiting, waiting in vain for answers. “I’m hoping we get the right answers. The state has a duty of care to protect vulnerable young people. I just want to know why my son’s not here today … My son called the police for help and ended up dead, and that was the result, and nobody can tell me the reason why.” Her son’s inquest last year heard he was taken into custody after calling police to say he was being threatened with a gun in Birmingham city centre. After CCTV showed that he was not being followed, he was detained. There was a violent struggle with police officers in the back of an ambulance and Burrell had a heart attack that led to brain damage, the inquest heard. Burrell had been left handcuffed on the hospital floor for five or six hours before being assessed, and had wet himself. At one point he had a covering put over his face. Jurors at the six-week inquest found that neglect by police officers and ambulance staff who forcibly restrained him caused his death. The verdict led his family to call for a public inquiry. The IPCC, which investigates deaths in police custody, launched an investigation in April 2011 during which four West Midlands police officers were interviewed under police caution, a spokesman said. Dorset police force carried out a separate investigation into medical staff. More than two years later, the IPCC passed a file to the CPS for a decision on whether three officers should be charged with gross misconduct on the grounds of honesty and integrity. The CPS decided there was insufficient evidence prosecute in June 2014. The officers gave evidence at the inquest, leading to a complaint on behalf of the family to the IPCC, which again investigated and passed a file to the CPS, which has not yet announced a decision. A CPS spokesman said on Friday that officials had met the family three days earlier to update them on the case. He added: “The CPS has been considering this matter since it was referred to us by the IPCC in October 2015 and are mindful of the impact this continues to have on the family. “We are still considering the evidence passed to us and will make a decision in due course.” Jaddoo said the case highlighted “consistent inequalities and injustices that the black community face[s] when coming into contact with the police”."
2016-08-26T16:19:29Z,uk-news,UK news,No children reported missing after report of boy 'forced into van',"Detectives investigating claims that a boy was taken into a van in Surrey insist they are completely satisfied they have a credible witness, despite not receiving any reports of missing children 24 hours after the incident. Det Supt Chris Edwards said officers were investigating two theories following a claim that a child had been abducted in Redhill on Thursday afternoon. The boy, aged about six or seven and wearing a red T-shirt and navy jeans, was reported to have been taken into the side of a black Volkswagen Transporter with an 02 licence plate between 4.25pm and 4.40pm. â€œWeâ€™re operating two particular theories. The first one and the priority line of investigation is that this is exactly as portrayed and reported, and that a child has been abducted from the roadside,â€� Edwards said of the inquiry, which has been dubbed Operation Bigfoot. â€œThe second theory that we are operating, and this a heartfelt plea to anybody who may have information in support of the second theory, is that if you were at that location and involved in an incident yesterday involving your own child, or a child that you are connected to, we would urge you to come forward and make contact immediately in order that we can scale this investigation back and offer messages of reassurance to the public.â€� Edwards added it was â€œimplicitâ€� that a child would be in danger given the circumstances as it appeared the child was taken â€œagainst their willâ€�, although there was â€œno information to suggest a struggleâ€�. He stressed the â€œcredibility of the witnessâ€� as being important to inquiries and said there had been 130 reports by members of the public relating to the investigation. He said police were keeping an open mind but added: â€œI can confirm that we still donâ€™t have, within the county, within the region or nationally, a report of a missing person fitting that description to date.â€� Edwards also ruled out from the inquiry a black VW van about which police had previously appealed for information. The force is now searching for a modified van, which is described as having an 02 number plate and three BBS alloy wheels, with one missing at the front driverâ€™s side. The vehicle had no rear windows, a sliding side door and chrome sidesteps.
The mystery deepened on Friday after a mountain bike believed to have been left behind by the boy at the scene was revealed to have been there for days. The landlord of a nearby pub, who did not want to be named, said he had moved the Frantic Giant bike, which has a silver frame with black and yellow detail, next to some bins after finding it dumped outside his premises earlier in the week. He said: â€œOn Wednesday it was outside at about 10am. At about 1pm I moved it to the back of the old arcade where the bins are, assuming someone would pick it up â€“ all the kids play around there.â€�
A statement from Surrey police earlier on Friday said a large police operation involving a significant number of officers had taken place overnight to trace the van and establish the identity of the child. â€œReports of this nature involving children are extremely rare, which is why we are treating it so seriously,â€� the statement said. Supt Bex Smith, of Surrey police, said: â€œThis is an incident we are taking extremely seriously and are asking for anyone with any information regarding the child, the van or what happened to come forward. â€œIf you were in the area, perhaps commuting to or from Redhill train station at the time, please get in touch with us if you saw anything suspicious. At this stage, we are not ruling out a number of options, including whether the child and the person in the van know each other.â€�
Anyone with any information should contact Surrey police by calling 999 in an emergency or 101. The independent charity Crimestoppers can also be called anonymously on 0800 555 111."
2016-08-26T16:24:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Three Britons named among victims of Amatrice earthquake,"Three Britons including a 14-year-old boy were among the 281 people killed in the earthquake in Italy, their families have said. Maria and Will Henniker-Gotley, 51 and 55, and Marcos Burnett, 14, were killed when a 6.2-magnitude quake struck the town of Amatrice on Wednesday.
A statement issued on behalf of their families by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said: “[The] families have paid tribute to the tireless work of the Italian rescue workers and hospital staff and expressed their gratitude for the love and support they have received from the Italian people. Their thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by the earthquake.” A Foreign Office spokesman said: “We are providing support to the families of Marcos Burnett and Will and Maria Henniker-Gotley following their tragic deaths in the earthquake in Italy. Our thoughts are with them at this incredibly difficult time. “British embassy staff will continue working with local authorities regarding any further British nationals that may require our assistance.” Italy’s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, has authorised a preliminary €50m (£43m) in emergency funding for the stricken zone, which on Friday was hit by a 4.7-magnitude aftershock while rescuers continued their search for survivors."
2016-08-26T17:44:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Lack of UK law requiring lifeguards on all beaches means 'varied presence',"Soaking up the sun amid the thousands thronging Brighton beachfront on Friday, Adrian Abel and his wife, Nicola, couldn’t help but wonder whether the lifeguards were keeping a closer eye than usual on bathers in the wake of the Camber Sands tragedy. “It’s bound to send a shiver up their spines, and it would with anyone coming down to the beach after what happened this week,” he said as two lifeguards nearby silently scanned a seascape dotted with swimmers and the occasional canoe.
Brighton’s beach is regarded as an example of best practice when it comes to preventing tragedies of the type that took place about 50 miles away on the Sussex coast this week. But even before the shadow cast by Camber Sands, safety experts had been harbouring real concerns about the “patchy” provision of lifeguarding along the UK’s 7,723-mile coastline. “When we speak to some beach managers they are very, very pressured,” said David Walker, leisure safety manager at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. There was no law compelling local authorities or managers of land to place lifeguards on beaches, he said, and the decision was often made on the basis of whether there was a trade-off to the cost. The result? A varied presence of lifeguards beach to beach. In other cases, the role of local beach manager remains an undefined one. “It can range from area to area. Safety can come to be embedded in the culture of tourism or parkland recreation teams, for example,” said Walker, “But in other areas it might just be a bolt on to another job, and as a result you get people who are either so pushed that they have two other things to do or they don’t fully understand what they are doing. “In big areas like Devon and Cornwall you see the specialists, for example, but in some other areas there has been an erosion of knowledge.”
For water sports enthusiasts and beach day-trippers alike, the Maritime & Coastguard Agency statistics for deaths along Britain’s coastline make for grim reading. In 2010, 32 people ranging from anglers to swimmers lost their lives. Both in 2013 and in 2014 more than 100 people died, and last year the figure was 67. This year’s toll will include not just the five Camber Sands deaths but those of a two-year-old girl and her father who were swept into the sea in Cornwall last week. The count rises sharply when water-related fatalities that have taken place inland are added. Last year 321 people lost their lives in accidental drownings in the UK, according to the National Water Safety Forum (NWSF). Much more can still be done to save lives, according to the forum, an umbrella organisation including the RNLI and other groups, which published an anti-drowning strategy this year with the aim of halving the number of fatalities by 2026. Recommendations include ensuring that every child has the opportunity to learn to swim and receive water safety education at primary school, as well as putting risk assessments and water safety plans in place in every community with water risks.
While members of the forum are eager to avoid accusations of encouraging a nanny state approach, experts associated with it envisage an ideal in future where beach users could easily make an informed choice before their visit by accessing information from an app, the radio or another resource. “The absolute best thing that people can do is to think and do a little bit of research about what they want to do before they go to the coast or use a stretch of water,” said George Rawlinson, the RNLI’s operations director and the NWSF’s chair. “Unfortunately I don’t think enough people are doing that. It’s certainly not their intention to do something silly. With the best will in the world, if they are not regular users of the beach and the coast then the risks may not be recognised by them.” Back under the sunshine on Brighton beach, the Abels agreed that more information was key. “There’s no reason why an assessment of each beach shouldn’t be posted on noticeboards for everyone to see for example,” said Adrian. “It could include details of where it’s safe for swimming, or where the tides are.”"
2016-08-27T14:39:37Z,uk-news,UK news,How to create London's new 'village' communities,"Descriptions of London as a city of villages can be off-putting. When estate agents start selling an area as a “village”, be it Crouch End in the mid-nineties or, say, Blackhorse in Waltham Forest today, they are speaking to a specific middle-class aesthetic. This can be attractive - not least to Guardian types - but also rather superior and twee. Think “nice” coffee and “artisan” cheese: nothing wrong with either, but you know what I mean. It is also contradicts the version of the city that draws to it people who have grown up in small communities and see London as a place of escape into perpetual change and welcome anonymity. They didn’t move to the big, bad smoke to pretend they live in the Cotswolds and be known to everybody in their street. The urban village as a planning concept can also trigger unease if and when it is a recipe for resented redevelopment. Yet, as Kath Scanlon of LSE London writes: “Observers over the centuries have remarked that London is quintessentially a city of villages. Neighbourhoods like Dulwich, Hampstead and Richmond were historic settlements engulfed by the capital as it expanded.” She adds: “Now the name is applied to everything from Edwardian speculative estates (Furzedown Village) and 19th century railway suburbs (Hither Green Village) to the growing number of new developments that call themselves villages.” There’s no denying that big city neighbourhoods with some of the qualities associated with villages - intimacy, character, a self-contained functionality and so on - are attractive to lots of people. In the film below, Scanlon talks about the brand new Kidbrooke Village, developed by Berkley Homes where part of the 1960s Ferrier Estate used to be. Is it measuring up to its name? The film is seven minutes long.
Scanlon says her research on Kidbrooke Village has lessons for the rest of London: “The scale of housing demand in the capital means that we need to build big to have any hope of meeting it, especially if using green belt land is ruled out. On past experience these new developments will be housing Londoners for at least 50 years, if not 150. They need to work as communities, not just as collections of homes.” Now read on."
2016-08-27T20:45:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Camber Sands given high-risk status in national plan after five die,"The popular Sussex beach where five men drowned last week has been prioritised for inclusion in a national strategy aimed at making “high-risk” stretches of UK coastline safer.
As the inquest continues into the cause of the deaths on Camber Sands last week, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) told the Observer it had already held talks with local councillors, businesses and police. As a result, Camber Sands is now to be included in its “community life-saving plan”, a national programme the service is rolling out to improve safety along the most hazardous stretches of UK coastline. Five Sri Lankans in their teens and 20s drowned during a day trip from London to Camber Sands last Wednesday. A few weeks earlier, a 19-year-old Brazilian, Gustavo Silva Da Cruz, died swimming in the same stretch of sea, prompting Sri Lankan relatives of the latest tragedy to criticise the lack of safety measures on the stretch of Sussex coastline. A temporary RNLI lifeguard service was introduced to the beach for the remainder of the summer, but a longer-term solution is already being prepared for what was, until recently, classified as a “benign” stretch of coast. So far, the RNLI has identified 227 locations where its community lifesaving plan will be introduced. Volunteer safety officers will be recruited to organise community involvement and education. This year the organisation also introduced a drowning prevention strategy for Britain, a 10-year blueprint running from 2016 to 2026. The strategy identified men as most at risk of drowning, accounting for eight in 10 of all the deaths. Fatalities rise markedly for males aged in their mid-to-late teens, peaking among the 20 to 29-year-old age group. The RNLI hopes to halve the number of drowning fatalities in the sea – over the past five years, close to 200 a year have been killed. The service recorded 15,000 incidents on beaches last year, with 18,000 people needing to be rescued. Brian Robson, community safety manager for the RNLI, said that Camber Sands, which can attract crowds of 25,000 to its seven-mile stretch of sands and dunes, was now among locations it had evaluated as high-risk.
He said: “Camber Sands has been fairly unique for us; obviously it came upon our horizon because of the previous fatality. Some colleagues who work along the south coast were talking to the council about whether we are doing enough, is everything in the right place? “The horrible circumstances of last week has raised it on our risk scale. Until now, Camber Sands has been fairly benign, not a difficult area for us to work, but now it has been placed in a much higher-risk category.” The other locations where community life-saving plans have been introduced include Three Cliffs Bay on the Gower peninsula, one of south Wales’ most popular beaches. Following the drowning of two people last year, the RNLI launched a programme working with local businesses, landowners and the National Trust. Lifeguards are now introduced during busy periods and new high-profile safety signs warn of dangerous current and rip tides in the area. In the north Yorkshire resort of Scarborough, funds raised by the community, following the drowning last year of Andrew McGeown, 32, have seen the introduction of an initiative to teach local youngsters the perils of swimming offshore. This summer 400 local schoolchildren from the resort were educated on the dangers of swimming in open water compared with in a pool. The RNLI is also studying the possibility of deploying drones that can carry an inflatable life ring to a swimmer in distress. Designers in the US have tested rings that automatically inflate as soon as they hit the water, helping swimmers to stay afloat until rescuers arrive. One complicating factor is the constantly evolving nature of the UK coastline, with stretches becoming less or more dangerous. “The coastline around the UK is continually changing. One location might be high risk one year but not the next; the sea is dangerously unpredictable. We don’t know where the next event will strike, or what will happen this weekend,” said Robson. He said another complicating issue was that one in 10 drownings involved individuals who had not meant to be in the water in the first place, such as a hiker who may have fallen into the sea."
2016-08-27T21:00:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Londoners back limit on skyscrapers as fears for capitalâ€™s skyline grow,"Londoners want curbs placed on the number of new high-rise buildings in the capital, amid concerns that a wave of monolithic skyscrapers is transforming the skyline.
Six out of 10 support a limit on the height of new skyscrapers, with the same proportion backing restrictions on the number of buildings with more than 50 floors. The unprecedented survey, by Ipsos Mori, found that many Londoners, particularly those who live in the most affected areas, think the trend towards ever taller, bolder skyscrapers has gone too far. More than 400 buildings of more than 20 floors are in the pipeline in London, according to a recent report by New London Architecture and property consultant GL Hearn, which is twice as many as two years ago. The volume of projects in the offing has led to flashpoints as developers meet opposition from local communities. Architect Renzo Piano was forced to withdraw plans for a 72-storey tower in west London, dubbed the Paddington Pole, following outrage from campaigners. The heritage group Historic England recently lodged an objection to a proposed 25-storey tower of luxury flats in Somers Town, north London, citing its effect on views from Regent’s Park. Barbara Weiss, architect and co-founder of the pressure group Skyline Campaign, said the glut of skyscrapers was down to a combination of borough councils trying to raise money and the desire by former mayor Boris Johnson to boost London’s international profile.
“It’s partly austerity because boroughs are strapped for cash and can’t run normal services. They need money; developers provide money,” said Weiss. “On the other side was Boris with crazy ideas about London needing to be put on the map. He was encouraging these excesses and Londoners didn’t know they were happening.” The survey found that those who live in the city centre feel more strongly about the pace of development. Around half of those who live in inner London said too many high-rises were being built, with the figure falling to 34% among people outside the centre. That geographical divide was also reflected in views about the overall effect large buildings have on the city. Fears that tall buildings are “damaging what makes London special” are shared by 43% of people in inner London but just 34% further away from the city centre. Nearly half of people in outer London said new skyscrapers were improving the capital’s skyline, falling to 34% among central Londoners who are likely to live in their shadow. Differences in opinion between suburbanites and inner-city dwellers extend to views about what should be done to protect the skyline. Some 60% of inner Londoners would like new tall buildings limited to areas such as Canary Wharf and the City, while 53% from the suburbs support such a measure.
However, the poll found that Londoners largely agree that tall buildings are not the best way to solve the housing crisis. Terraced houses, low-rise blocks and converted flats were all regarded as better ways to meet the capital’s housing needs. “In the right places tall buildings can make exciting contributions to city life,” said a spokesperson for Historic England. “But denser, well-designed and lower developments which reflect the architectural traditions of London’s different neighbourhoods could deliver even greater capacity for housing and workplaces.” The character of London’s skyline is also a political issue, with 31% of the 504 people surveyed saying they would be less likely to vote for a mayor who supported more tall buildings. Johnson has drawn criticism for approving a slew of high-rises, despite promising during his election campaign to stop London turning into “Dubai-on-Thames”. Johnson’s successor, Sadiq Khan, has spoken out against residential skyscrapers where flats stand empty because they are being used as “gold bricks for investment” by wealthy foreign investors. Khan and his housing team are still finalising details of the mayor’s housing plans and are set to release more information in a housing policy paper due to be published in the autumn.
Weiss said allowing too many skyscrapers puts London “at risk of losing its unique character … People who oppose these towers are saying they’re not part of London’s DNA. You can have a few in the right locations but if you have a lot of these ones that are badly designed and badly built, you’ll end up with a generic city that could be absolutely anywhere. That’s a real crime.” Some developments have attracted particular opprobrium for their lack of affordable housing, such as One Blackfriars, known colloquially as the Boomerang. The building, to the south of Blackfriars bridge, includes a luxury apartment with a £23m price tag, but has no “affordable housing”. The developer, St George, paid the council £29m instead towards housing schemes elsewhere. “London is on the cusp of profound change,” said Historic England. “We are particularly concerned that over-development along the Thames could cut off Londoners and visitors from the river, which is the city’s most ancient and important public space. It is time for a pan-London approach to tall buildings, with Londoners being better informed and involved in the changes that are gathering pace. While you can put a price on each individual tower, our skyline, streetscapes and public spaces are treasured and priceless.”"
2016-08-27T23:05:16Z,uk-news,UK news,Scotland enjoys the rebirth of its idyllic island life,"In those far-flung outposts of Britain’s influence where diplomats circle the Chesterfields of an evening and gossip over brandy, an old story is never far away. It is the story of a meeting – never recorded – that took place between officials of Britain and Norway to discuss the matter of how one might go about depopulating one’s islands. It is whispered that the government of Norway, restored once more following the Nazi occupation of the second world war, approached the UK seeking advice on a robust strategy towards its islands. Happily for future generations of Norwegians, their postwar government ignored what Britain told them, which was to evacuate the islands on the grounds of cost and security and gradually cause them to run down. Norway’s island communities thrived and became a powerhouse, while Britain’s suffered from a policy that has since been described as one of “benign neglect”. In Scotland, which has 99 populated islands – two-thirds of the UK’s total – it wasn’t until the creation of the Highlands and Islands Development Board in 1965 that its islands began to thrive once more. Still, the cost of public services in these areas, per head of population, is higher than anywhere else in the UK. Islands are an economic and administrative nightmare for those countries who were bequeathed them in the Earth’s infant years. So much toil and trouble for so few people: why can’t folk just be sensible and live on the mainland where they can be reached much more cheaply? Don’t they realise how difficult it is to defend these places? Earlier this month, the tiny Hebridean island of Muck (population: 30) sent out a global appeal via social media for a primary teacher for its seven children. The school’s popular teacher had quit and none of the initial six candidates followed up on their initial interest, as the reality of life on an island without a shop and cut off from the mainland for several months in the year began to dawn on them. Yet following the Facebook appeal, Highland Council has been swamped with applications from all over the globe for the £35,000 a year post, which brings with it a three-bedroom flat and, in the opinion of the last teacher, Julie Baker, “a short commute and stunning views over the sea to Ardnamurchan Point”. These places might be remote and require small triumphs of human endurance, but people will always want to live in them.
The hi-tech accoutrements of modern life and the instant gratification that they bestow might once have been considered a threat to an island existence, rendering it all but obsolete; instead it has brought a renaissance in remoteness. The internet and social media have made life on an island that little bit less remote and made the task of running a business on it a lot less costly. In the last census the overwhelming majority of Scotland’s islands saw their populations increase. Mike Russell, Scotland’s new Brexit minister, is the MSP representing Argyll and Bute in the Scottish parliament. He might also reasonably be called the UK’s minister for islands, as 23 of them lie within the boundaries of his constituency. “The economy and business of the islands is not just important to the people who live and work there,” he said, “but they are also of crucial importance to the economy of Scotland and the UK. Around two per cent of Scotland’s population lives on our islands and we, as a government, have a moral duty to ensure that they are treated equally and that our public services, which the rest of us take for granted, are accessible to them too.” Russell is married to an islander and lived in the Western Isles for several years. He is acutely aware of the lazy assumptions and mocking antipathy that sometimes characterises mainland attitudes towards islanders. “In all my years living among islanders and dealing with them I have found them not to be any different than anyone else. The myth of curious and strange island ‘ways’ is just that – a myth. Certainly, you need to be possessed of a degree of endurance to prevail in climatic extremes, but there are great rewards too.” Mainland UK, it seems, has never been more attuned to the economic importance of the islands. Last week the Scottish government announced that legislation for its long-awaited islands bill would be brought forward within the next 12 months and that a wide-ranging public consultation would help shape it. Scotland’s island constituency numbers around 250,000 people and they are beginning to make their views known. Like many others during the referendum on Scottish independence, they were engaged and enfranchised by the debate. A common theme running through the hundreds of responses to the legislation was that a “one-size-fits-all” approach to legislation, policy and services does not pay heed to the unique requirements of life on Scotland’s islands. Residents want government legislation affecting public services to be “island-proof”, meaning that it must exhibit greater understanding of island issues. This, according to the Scottish government, would bring “more sustainability; greater accountability of authorities; empowerment of communities; consistency with European provision; more efficient use of resources; and wider benefits to the Scottish and UK economies”. On Arran, the seventh-largest Scottish island, there is optimism that some recent depressing trends can be reversed. This gorgeous island is bounded by the Ayrshire coast on one side and the Argyll peninsula on the other. It has been described as “Scotland in miniature” and a one-hour drive over its sinewy roads tells you why. Mountains, lochs, fields and oceans are gathered in and around an island of breathtaking beauty.
Laura Helliwell, born and bred in Arran, had, like many others in her Arran High School class, moved away from the island, but recently returned to manage the Ormidale Hotel, which has been run by three generations of her family since the 1930s. “It wasn’t just the hotel that brought me back, it was the opportunity to bring my children up in this environment. The schools on the island are great and there is a real community spirit conveying values that I want my children to be exposed to. “Even if they move away from here I want their values to be shaped by having spent their childhoods here. The vast majority of my classmates growing up have all moved from here but, in recent years, some of them have begun to return, probably for the same reasons as I did.” Like other islands around the UK, Arran has become a haven for retired people. When you add some very tasty house prices on the island into the mix, it doesn’t look like the population will be getting any younger any time soon. The island’s population stands at around 4,600 and the trend is pointing towards further depopulation as the elderly diminish in number and its young people leave. Yet local businessman Derek Shand, who is also a contractor for Business Gateway Services in Arran and Cumbrae, is optimistic about Arran’s future. “Last year we had 41 business startups and 39 are still with us and reporting good outlooks. We have 165 employers employing 1,645 employees. Their biggest challenge is sourcing staff and securing affordable accommodation. The island can also employ almost 500 seasonal staff, and recent tourism trends tell us that the season is growing and the shoulder months are reducing.” In last week’s Arran Banner, the weekly newspaper that has served the island since 1974 and which is bought by more than 90% of the island population, the latest excellent academic achievements of Arran High School are recorded and celebrated and there are signs that, though many will pursue careers on the mainland, some will return with children and try to build a life here. Shand says: “The current trend shows returning children of islanders buying or leasing their own businesses or taking over from their parents. For the first time in many years we have a very strong young farmers’ club with sons and daughters returning from mainland colleges. There are still 63 registered farms or smallholdings on Arran.” The introduction of the road equivalent tariff, which caps ferry fares at the same rate as bus travel, has been a boon to the Scottish islands. As the ferry fares have reduced, so the footfall has increased. Some businesses, such as the renowned Arran Aromatics and the Arran Brewery, have seen an increase in customers. An island development officer has been appointed and there is a recognition, at last, that a traditional island community can thrive and be fit to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Laura Helliwell is pleased with the bookings she has taken for the season so far. “I think people are now beginning to recognise that new technology and the internet have the potential to be good for remote island communities. It has brought our places to the doorsteps of people living continents away. “They can see us on their laptop screens and then make a booking without worrying about the language barrier. Prestwick airport is nearby, bringing cheap Ryanair flights, so that helps too.” On a pier surrounded by fields and mountains and where you first encounter Arran, a new ferry terminal is beginning to take shape. Further up the road, land for a new island helipad is being developed. There are four hotels for sale and three restaurants. There are “for sale” signs on handsome dwellings perched on their own little Edens all over the island. There are opportunities in these places to detach yourself from the world, but to remain in touch all year round.

2016-08-28T11:42:37Z,uk-news,UK news,Camber Sands search called off as swimmer is found safe,"A major search and rescue mission launched on Sunday on Camber Sands, where five friends drowned last week, has been called off after a swimmer was found safe and well. The RNLI, police and coastguard had been involved in the search, days after five men died at the East Sussex beach. The search on Sunday, which included a coastguard helicopter, began after a pair of flip-flops was found on the beach, near where a woman had been seen diving into the sea. A spokeswoman for the coastguard service told the Guardian the individual had been tracked down, having left the beach, and was safe and well. The spokeswoman said: “There was major reason for concern as this is a dangerous beach and lifeguards were not on yet duty at the time the swimmer was missed. It’s a great relief that this person has been found safe and well.” Sussex police released a statement saying they had been called at about 9.40am with concerns about a woman who had been seen getting into the sea at about 8am. “It was believed the woman, who was described as white with dark hair and wearing a black swimming costume, had left a pair of sandals on the beach which had still not been retrieved,” the statement said. “A woman matching the description of the swimmer called the RNLI at around 11.45am to identify herself,” the police said. On Wednesday, five friends, all aged in their teens or 20s, died at the beach near the town of Rye, prompting authorities to deploy lifeguards on the normally unguarded seafront for the busy bank holiday weekend. Up to six RNLI lifeguards were due to be on duty at Camber Sands over the weekend, plus a team giving safety information to visitors between Saturday and Monday. Yesterday the RNLI announced it would be extending this service until Sunday 4 September, to provide coverage for the rest of the school holidays. Last Wednesday, Kenugen Saththiyanathan, 18, known as Ken, his brother Kobikanthan, 22, known as Kobi, both of Erith, south-east London, and their friends Nitharsan Ravi, 22, of Plumstead, south-east London, Inthushan Sriskantharasa, 23, of Grays, Essex, and Kurushanth Srithavarajah, 27, of Welling, south-east London, died after visiting the beach. It is believed they were playing football on a sandbar. One theory is that they became stranded as the tide came in. Another suggestion is that two of the men were trapped in quicksand or mud. Relatives of some of the men criticised the lack of lifeguards at Camber and suggested they might have stood a chance of survival if the beach had been guarded. The father of Kenugen and Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, Arumukam, told the Sun: “I brought my children from Sri Lanka because it is not safe back there. But there were no lifeguards on the beach where they died. If there had been, my sons would have at least had a fighting chance of survival.” Ravi’s family said they felt “very angry” at the lack of response from the authorities following the death of another man, the Brazilian Gustavo Silva Da Cruz, 19, at Camber last month. A spokesman for Rother district council said that, despite there being no lifeguards, there were summer patrols to advise people of potential dangers. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, who is also MP for the area, issued a statement last week offering condolences to the family and said she was working to address the situation. “Local leadership are very aware that this is something they need to come together to address and so we are going to be convening a group of local leaders to work out what additional actions can be taken to stop such awful incidents from happening. Camber Sands has strong riptides and we need to find ways to put additional protection in place,” she said."
2016-08-28T12:18:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Hinkley Point: EDF boss calls on government to look at 'bigger picture',"The head of the energy company behind the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactors has called on the government to authorise the project after its approval was unexpectedly delayed last month. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF Energy, said critics of the planned Somerset reactors risked “losing sight of bigger picture by overlooking the positive impact and importance of this investment for Britain”. The nuclear power plant was approved by the EDF board in late July, but in a surprise move shortly after becoming prime minister, Theresa May postponed a decision to proceed with the plant and ordered a review of the £18bn project. The delay was a shock to investors and after it was announced De Rivaz wrote to employees to reassure them that the project was still on track, saying: “Our journey is a long one and there is a further stage. Our job now is to maintain the courage, patience and dedication that have served us so well.” After May announced a further investigation into Hinkley Point C, the former business secretary Vince Cable claimed that, as home secretary, May had raised objections to the nuclear power deal during coalition government and had been unhappy about George Osborne’s “gung-ho” attitude to Chinese investment.
On Sunday, De Rivaz addressed criticism of the involvement of the state-owned Chinese nuclear company China General Nuclear Power (CGN), the joint investor with EDF in the project, saying: “We know and trust our Chinese partners.” He said there were “enormous benefits for the UK” from the project being jointly run by China, which has the largest civil nuclear programme in the world. On the issue of cost, he said that instead of comparing the value of electricity produced by the £18bn plant with “today’s depressed wholesale prices” they should be compared with future prices, against which he said electricity generated at Hinkley Point was competitive. The Hinkley Point development has been heavily criticised over the large cost of building it and setting it up.
De Rivaz discussed other forms of power, including renewable options such as wind and solar, which some critics have claimed are better alternatives to nuclear, saying that wind energy presented problems of space, intermittency and cost, and that solar was problematic because peak electricity demand in Britain falls in the winter “when there is almost no solar electricity generated”. “There is no single technology which offers a panacea for our future needs. We need them all, including new nuclear,” wrote De Rivaz. “We can’t afford to cross our fingers and muddle through in the hope that a new technology will meet all our needs at the right price.” De Rivaz also pointed to the jobs and apprenticeships likely to be created, saying that “billions of pounds will be invested into the economy of the south-west of England”. The building of the power plant has the support of the GMB union, with Justin Bowden, its national secretary for energy, previously urging the government to stop searching for “get-out clauses”. “The government must get on with building Hinkley Point C as the only carbon-free show in town to keep the lights on during the one in six days when there is no wind or sun,” said Bowden."
2016-08-28T13:59:58Z,uk-news,UK news,"Britain's biggest shooting lobby riven by infighting, leak reveals","Britain’s biggest and richest shooting organisation appears to be in meltdown, with senior staff suspended, members of its governing council resigning and an external investigation being conducted by an international law firm into vicious internal conflict. According to documents sent to the League Against Cruel Sports and the Guardian, the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, whose patron is the Duke of Edinburgh, has been riven for months by internal dissent, “accusations of institutional bullying” and “a culture of fear and intimidation”. Anonymous letters are said to have been sent to staff, and police have been called in to the organisation’s head office near Chester to defuse a possible breach of the peace when things “threatened to get out of hand”.
A 65-page grievance investigation report prepared by the London law firm Hill Dickinson at the request of Alan Jarrett, the BASC chair until he resigned in June, includes allegations that directors and trustees gave each other two verbal barrels. One senior BASC man is alleged to have said to another: “You will live to regret this,” another is accused of saying of a colleague that “the only thing that cunt wants is a bullet between the eyes”, and a third is said to have said: “I swear I will kill you, you cunt.” All statements were denied, according to the Hill Dickinson report. BASC, headquartered on the site of an 11th-century mill recorded in the Domesday Book at Rossett, outside Wrexham, has a membership of 140,000 shooters and 110 staff. As Britain’s most powerful shooting lobby group, it boasts that it is the largest and best-resourced country sports organisation in the UK, with David Douglas-Home, the present Earl of Home and son of former the Tory prime minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home, its president. There is no suggestion he was involved in any of the grievances. BASC, which states its primary aim is to foster a “strong and unified voice for shooting”, declined to respond to questions about what precisely triggered the almighty bust-up and who exactly had resigned or been suspended. But according to the conclusions of the independent investigation, four people at BASC “clearly breached fiduciary duty” by not cooperating with the investigation. Others “have not been acting in the best interests of BASC”, says the report. One man was found to have damaged the organisation by spreading rumours. “Exactly who has resigned and who has been suspended is not altogether clear,” said one member of staff who asked not to be named. “It’s toxic. As a BASC employee I can tell you that people are too scared to speak out. They keep sending threatening letters to anyone who dares question them.” The investigators admit astonishment at the goings-on in the charity. “We have however never had a situation ... where the respondents have declined to respond to the substance of the complaints and given their version of events. There has been clearly a culture of gossip, spreading rumours, and relying on hearsay,” said Hill Dickinson, which puts the cost of the debacle to BASC at between £140,000 and £175,000. In a published statement in June, the chair of the BASC governing council, Alan Jarrett, said he had resigned because “it is obvious to me that council remains dysfunctional and unable or unwilling to take action against those ... named in the Hill Dickinson investigation into complaints”. Christopher Graffius, director of communications at BASC, said: “We are trying to sort it out. We are going through the proper procedures. BASC is following due process on internal issues and is unable to comment further, to protect employment rights and all involved.” In an earlier statement, BASC said: “Certain internal employment issues are currently being investigated at BASC and, to protect people’s employment rights and ensure confidentiality, we are unable to say more at this time.” • This article was amended on 30 August 2016 to remove a disputed quote from Christopher Graffius."
2016-08-28T15:50:47Z,uk-news,UK news,"Virgin broke own rules by releasing Corbyn CCTV, document shows","The decision by Virgin Trains to release CCTV images of Jeremy Corbyn on one of its services after he complained on video about the journey being “completely ram-packed” was in breach of the company’s own policies, the Guardian can reveal. The company handed images, which appeared to show the Labour leader walking past empty seats before sitting on the train’s floor, to the media earlier this week in a move that embarrassed Corbyn.
A leaked internal document warns that CCTV images will only be made available to the media in two situations: where it is “necessary to seek assistance from the public in connection with a criminal investigation” or where it might improve the “safety of the railway or prevent railway accidents of incidents”. The Virgin policy, written by the company’s emergency planning, fire and security manager, Jim Rawcliffe, adds: “Any such decision to release footage for these purposes will be approved by the head of safety and environment and, where appropriate, following consultation with the relevant police authority.” The revelation raises questions about why Virgin and its chief executive and founder, Sir Richard Branson, released CCTV images leading to a political row with the Labour leader. The company published pictures of Corbyn walking past seats that appeared available in order to hit back after he was filmed sitting on the floor saying that his experience was a good argument in favour of public ownership. The party leader’s claim was derided, with accusations that he had lied about how busy the train really was. However, leaked emails reveal that the managing director of Virgin Trains East Coast told staff that the controversy had highlighted how crowded services can be, and that finding seats could make customers anxious and stressed.
David Horne also admitted having to stand by a customer toilet for a journey of approximately 130 miles, from Newark to London. He said that was during Virgin’s “ hot seat week”, when directors and managers are banned from travelling in first class in order to “take a hard look at our standard class offer”. On Friday, he wrote: “Putting politics aside, this incident demonstrates just how busy many of our services are, those in the middle of the day as well as at peak times.”
Horne also said the controversy highlighted the “great job” that Virgin guards did in helping to find seats for customers on busy services, after a family were upgraded to first class so that Corbyn and his team were able to sit down later in the journey. “We know from our ‘ideal customer experience’ research that boarding a train and finding a seat can be one of the most anxious, stressful times for our customers, particularly if they do not travel by train frequently,” he said. “Endless rows of seats with reservation labels inevitably can increase the tension. So top marks to our guards who, day in day out, help customers to find empty seats on busy services – on this occasion it was Newcastle guard Ian Mitchell who is due the credit.” It followed an email in May, when Horne wrote: “This week it has been another hot seat week, a week when directors and managers are banned from travelling in first class and we take a hard look at our standard class offer – to help us look at what we need to do to make it not so standard! “Myself I’ve stood up with other customers next to toilets from Newark to London, I’ve seen fellow passengers get stressed out over seat reservations and I’ve realised that it is impossible to juggle a coffee cup and a laptop on one of our airline seatback tables!” The revelations come as the row between Branson and Corbyn intensified after the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, told the Sunday Mirror that he thought Branson should be stripped of his knighthood because he was a “tax exile who thinks he can try to intervene and undermine our democracy”. But Virgin sought to defuse the row. A spokesperson did not address the documents obtained by the Guardian, but instead repeated a statement thanking Corbyn for highlighting how helpful Virgin staff had been during his video. “He’s also right to point out the need to introduce more trains on our route – that’s why we’re introducing a brand new fleet of 65 Azuma trains from 2018, which will increase seating capacity out of King’s Cross by 28% at peak times,” they said. They admitted it could be hard to find a seat, particularly during sporting events or at certain times. “Unfortunately we can’t do anything about cup finals or fares regulation, which could spread demand much more effectively if it was less of a blunt instrument. We have discussed regulation with the government at various points over the last two decades and we would be delighted to work with ministers if they were interested in reviewing the fares structure for long distance services, with the aim of reducing the overcrowding that can sometimes occur.” Virgin Trains is facing an investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office over the controversy, amid concerns that the publication of images may have broken the rules of the Data Protection Act. This article was amended on 29th August. It originally stated that the CCTV footage was release in order to “make a political point”."

The 78-year-old leaned into the vehicle outside a bungalow in Hayle, west Cornwall, on Saturday afternoon. The car is then thought to have lurched forwards, trapping her arm and ripping it off. She was airlifted to Derriford hospital in Plymouth. Police said the woman had suffered “life-changing injuries”, but it was hoped that surgeons would be able to reattach the arm and she would make a good recovery. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said: “What appears to have happened is that she leaned into the car to close the electric windows. “She turned on the ignition to get the power for the electric windows, but unfortunately the car was in gear and lurched forward, trapping her hand or arm. In the process of doing that, it has taken her arm off.”"

Mia Ayliffe-Chung, 21, was stabbed to death at a hostel by an attacker allegedly shouting “Allahu Akbar” in Queensland on Tuesday. A Frenchman, Smail Ayad, 29, who had allegedly become obsessed with her, has been charged with murder. Rosie Ayliffe, from Wirksworth in Derbyshire, said she understood that some of her daughter’s friends wanted her body flown home and were “struggling” with the decision. “Hence the plan to create a place of remembrance here, but also to give various people vials of Mia’s ashes to scatter in places dear to her or to them,” she wrote on The Independent website. “That way she can visit places she hasn’t visited yet. Canada, New Zealand, Singapore.” She said that the only way she could cope with her loss was to think that “Mia’s time had come”. Tom Jackson, 30, from Congleton in Cheshire, who was stabbed trying to save Ayliffe-Chung, remains on life support. His father, Les Jackson, said he was “immensely proud” of his son’s actions. Queensland police said there was no evidence that Ayad – who has also been charged with the attempted murder of Jackson – was even a practising Muslim. In her column, Ayliffe said “much nonsense” had been spoken in the media about her daughter’s alleged killer. “Smail Ayad – the French man being held on suspicion of my daughter’s murder – is not an Islamic fundamentalist, he has never set foot in a mosque. “It appears he wasn’t allowed to appear in court this week because of safety concerns, so I’m unlikely to get near enough to have a conversation, and only if I were suicidal would I want to (I’m not).” Detectives are investigating whether “mental health or drug misuse issues” were a factor alongside any “indication of an extremist slant or he was radicalised”. Ayliffe added: “At the moment the only way I can really cope with our loss is to think, Mia’s time had come, and what happened in that hostel on Tuesday was her fate. “It was always going to happen like that. She was lent to us for a period of time and now, in Ben Johnson’s words, she’s been ‘exacted by the Lord on the just day’. (I always struggled to teach that poem without welling up!) “But I also think that wise little girl was here for a reason, and part of my journey will be to find out what that reason was.”"
2016-08-29T10:28:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Surrey man arrested on suspicion of fabricating child abduction report,"A man has been arrested on suspicion of fabricating a child abduction report that sparked a major police operation and national media coverage. Surrey police received a report on Thursday that a boy, aged about six or seven and wearing a red T-shirt and navy jeans, was taken into the side of a black Volkswagen Transporter van in Redhill. The force initially described the witness account as “credible”. But detectives have arrested the witness, a 26-year-old from Redhill, on suspicion of perverting the course of justice after carrying out an extensive investigation and finding no evidence to corroborate the account. Police officers reviewed hours of CCTV, conducted house to house inquiries, interviewed commuters at a railway station near the alleged abduction, checked potential vehicles matching the description and searched databases of missing children, the force said. Det Supt Pete Fulton said: “The risk to life and safeguarding children are our first priorities when presented with a report like this, which is why we took the course of action we did. Time was of the essence, which is why we asked for help from the public and media to find out what happened as soon as we could. “Reports of this nature are extremely rare and we are sure the public understand that when information such as this is received we treat it extremely seriously and must do all we can to find out investigate what’s happened. “It is understandable this has caused a considerable amount of concern and confusion in the area which will last beyond just these few days. “We will continue to work with the community and realise that this has been disruptive and had a large impact. However, I hope that you are reassured that we take your safety extremely seriously. “The witness has been re-interviewed at length about their account and at this stage and as a result of our inquiries no further information has come to light to corroborate the report. “There has been no report of any missing child in connection with the case and we have carried out extensive inquiries.” The suspect was released on bail."
2016-08-29T12:29:30Z,uk-news,UK news,UK government could approve Hinkley Point but delay Essex project,"The government is considering a proposal to detach development of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant from an agreement allowing China to build a reactor in Essex. The plan is one of the options under consideration after Theresa May delayed approving the £18bn Hinkley Point project last month, according to a report in the Times (£). The prime minister is concerned about China’s involvement in the project to build Britain’s first nuclear power plant for a generation in Somerset and a further agreement for China to build reactors in Bradwell, Essex, and Sizewell, Suffolk. The government enlisted China last September to fund a third of Hinkley Point in a deal meant to ease financial pressure on EDF, the French builder of the plant, and forge closer links with China. But May, who raised objections to the deal when she was home secretary, called a surprise review soon after becoming prime minister. An option under consideration in Whitehall is to approve Hinkley Point but delay a decision on the Bradwell reactor to allow a discussion about its effect on British security, the Times said. Any attempt to split Hinkley Point from the agreement to let China build reactors in Britain would endanger the whole deal because the Bradwell plant was meant to be a showcase for China’s nuclear technology in Europe.
Tension over Hinkley Point means May risks an awkward first G20 meeting of world leaders as prime minister. The meeting, on 4 and 5 September, takes place in the Hangzhou, China, and will be hosted by Xi Jinping, China’s president, who signed the Hinkley Point agreement last year. EDF, the French state-owned energy group, approved the building of Hinkley Point in July after months of doubts about whether it was financially strong enough to take on the giant project. On Sunday, Vincent de Rivaz, EDF’s UK chief executive, called on the UK to set aside concerns about Chinese involvement in the project. “We know and trust our Chinese partners,” he wrote in the Sunday Telegraph. De Rivaz said there were “enormous benefits for the UK” from the involvement of China, which has the largest civil nuclear programme in the world. China has made clear its frustration over May’s decision to delay a decision on Hinkley Point. The Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, wrote that relations with Britain were at a “crucial historical juncture”. May then wrote to Xi and China’s premier, Li Keqiang, promising closer business and trade ties between Britain and the world’s second-biggest economy. May’s chief of staff, Nick Timothy, last year raised concerns that Chinese state-owned companies were investing in sensitive infrastructure. Timothy wrote on the ConservativeHome website: “Rational concerns about national security are being swept to one side because of the desperate desire for Chinese trade and investment.”"
2016-08-29T14:00:12Z,uk-news,UK news,'Someone punched him and that was it': man dies after assault in south London,"The mother of a London banker who died after being assaulted on a night out with friends has said her “perfect” son had “so much more life to live”. Detectives have launched a murder investigation after Oliver Dearlove, 30, died in hospital on Sunday night, less than 24 hours after he was assaulted in south-east London. Dearlove, who worked as a relationship manager for the private bank Duncan Lawrie, and had previously worked for Coutts and Barclays, had been out in the Blackheath area of London with former university friends when he was reportedly punched by an unknown assailant. No arrests have been made. Dearlove, who lived with his girlfriend in Eltham, was a keen football fan and played as a forward for his local team Lord Hood FC. He was set to go on holiday with friends to Las Vegas next week for a collective 30th birthday celebration. His mother, Joy Wright, from Chislehurst, south-east London, told the Guardian she last saw her son on Thursday. “He was very easygoing, lots and lots of friends, played lots of football,” she said. “He studied hard at school. He worked for a private bank in Belgravia. He had been travelling for a year. He did what most nice people do.” Dearlove came from a big family, Wright said, with six siblings and stepsiblings: younger twin brothers, a third brother, two stepbrothers and a stepsister. Describing what she believed to have happened in the early hours of Sunday morning, she said: “He and his friends all met up, had lunch, dinner, drinks. He texted his girlfriend that he loved her around 10pm. Someone picked a fight, punched him and [he] fell backwards and that was it. “I don’t think there was an altercation. I think someone said to him and his friends ‘what are you looking at’ and that was it. I think he stopped breathing when he hit the floor. His friends gave him CPR.” She added: “He was just perfect. I’m in a state of shock. We have friends and family here and we’re all pulling together. Sometimes I’m alright, sometimes I’m not. I’m absolutely devastated for him. [He had] so much more life to live.” Claire Wheatley, Dearlove’s girlfriend of nearly four years, said they had recently discussed having a baby together. “We were trying to get some money together so we could buy a house together,” she said. “We had big plans. We were planning on having a baby as well. “He was the kindest person. He was the most amazing person I’ve ever met and ever known. I’m so lucky to have known him.” Wheatley, who met Dearlove at a New Year’s Eve party, said she received a message from him at around 10pm on Saturday simply saying “love you”. “He and his friends aren’t the kind of guys who look for trouble. They like having a good time and a bit of banter. But he’s just the kindest person and would normally cower away from things like that, from any altercation.” Metropolitan police were called at around 12.45am on Sunday morning to reports of a man assaulted in Tranquil Vale, near Blackheath station. Police officers, London ambulance and the air ambulance all attended the scene. Dearlove was taken to an east London hospital where he died at 10.22pm on Sunday night. A postmortem will be held on Tuesday at Greenwich mortuary. DCI Lee Watling, of the homicide and major crime command, said: “We are retaining an open mind at this stage of the investigation with regards to a motive and our primary aim is to establish how Mr Dearlove came to receive the injuries which led to his death. “We are appealing for anyone who was at Tranquil Vale who witnessed the incident, in particular a group of up to four white females who Mr Dearlove and his friends were speaking to around the time the offence occurred.”"
2016-08-29T16:24:55Z,uk-news,UK news,UK police forces under pressure to stop using spit hoods,"Provincial police forces are under pressure to stop hooding detainees after it emerged that the practice has been used hundreds of times despite being banned by Britain’s biggest police forces. Official figures obtained by the Guardian show that spit hoods have been used 513 times since last year by a handful of provincial police forces. The practice of placing a tightly meshed hood over a suspect’s head has been criticised as breaching human rights law and investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission in at least two high-profile cases this year.
Figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that eight rural forces continue to use the practice – including on children as young as 13 – despite it not being sanctioned by police chiefs at the biggest forces, including the Metropolitan police, West Midlands police and Greater Manchester police. A 13-year-old schoolboy and a 14-year-old schoolgirl were among detainees hooded by police officers in Northamptonshire last year, the figures show, while a 70-year-old man was placed in a spit hood by North Wales police. The solicitor of a disabled 11-year-old girl who was hooded, handcuffed and detained by Sussex police officers said the practice arguably breached the UK’s domestic and international legal obligations, “particularly in the case of children, those suffering from mental ill health and the disabled”. Gus Silverman, a solicitor at the law firm Irwin Mitchell, said: “The fact that large police forces such as Greater Manchester and West Midlands have decided there are better ways of managing vulnerable individuals should cause serious questions to be asked of those forces who continue to use spit hoods.” The girl, known as Child H, was twice placed in a spit hood while being detained by officers for minor offences. The Independent Police Complaints Commission, which strongly criticised Sussex police’s handling of the case, refused to condemn its use of the spit hood in that case because it complied with the force’s policy that any spitting would always justify it. Child H’s mother said: “It is appalling that some police forces consider it appropriate to hood children, when other forces don’t allow their officers to use these devices at all. “If some forces can keep the public and officers safe without using spit hoods then why can’t all police forces? I have been calling on Sussex police to stop using spit hoods on children after my daughter was hooded in Sussex, but there isn’t any excuse for children to be hooded anywhere in the country. It was a truly horrible experience for my daughter to be hooded and no child should be treated that way.” There is no national police policy on the use of spit hoods. Chief constables at each of the 43 police forces in England and Wales decide whether to sanction the use of force, often used alongside handcuffs and other forms of restraint. The practice is not used by 20 of the 35 forces that responded to the Guardian’s Freedom of Information (FoI) request. Only nine forces said they used spit hoods. They include police in Northamptonshire, north Wales, Cheshire, West Mercia, Bedfordshire, Suffolk, Norfolk and Hertfordshire. These provincial forces have used spit hoods a total of 231 times so far this year, compared to 282 times last year, according to the FoI figures. Of the 119 people spit-hooded by Hertfordshire police, 15% were black, mixed race or Asian, the figures show. In Bedfordshire, 13.7% of the 51 people spit-hooded were non-white. That figure dropped to 10.3% of the 202 in Northamptonshire and 6.7% of the 89 in Norfolk. Essex police said spit hoods had not been authorised for use by its senior officers and that it provided safety glasses for officers’ protection. British Transport police have hooded detainees in 151 cases since June 2014, when the force authorised the practice.
The force is under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission after it used a spit hood on a young black man who was pinned to the floor by four officers at London Bridge station in July. Footage filmed by witnesses showed officers holding IK Aihie, 20, to the floor with his hands behind his back and a spit hood over his head. His girlfriend, Jessica McConkey, can be seen in distress in the clip while others plead with the officers: “What the hell are you doing?” and “Stop that.” IPCC investigators met Aihie this month to confirm they had launched an investigation into his arrest on 21 July. Aihie said: “I hope there will now be a thorough investigation and I would ask any witnesses to my arrest to please contact the IPCC.” Aihie’s solicitor Shamik Dutta, of the law firm Bhatt Murphy, said: “It is imperative that all relevant evidence in this case is preserved without delay to ensure a robust inquiry into the officers’ conduct.”"
2016-08-29T17:45:13Z,uk-news,UK news,No porridge on offer at former Crumlin Road jail in Belfast,"When the ex-IRA prisoners Gerard Hodgins and Richard O’Rawe last passed through the gates of Belfast’s Crumlin Road jail their city was in a state of war and their one thought on entering the Victorian prison was to escape. They entered a regime of beatings at the hands of some prison staff, cockroach-infested cells, frequent clashes with their Ulster loyalist enemies and having to “slop out” in the morning if they went to the toilet during the nightly lock-up.
Decades later, with the peace process entrenched and the prison now a tourist attraction, Hodgins, a former hunger striker, and O’Rawe, the IRA prisoners’ press officer during the 1981 death fast, have returned to Crumlin Road to sample the gourmet food on offer in the jail’s newly opened restaurant, Cuffs. As they tucked into chicken liver pâté and smoked salmon starters in what was once the main kitchen for feeding the prison, Hodgins and O’Rawe both used the same word to sum up their journey back to the jail: surreal. “It’s the first time I’ve been back here and to be truthful I hoped I’d never be back … at least if it was still a real jail,” O’Rawe said as he sipped a glass of Chilean red at a table beside a cell door. Crumlin Road jail casts a long shadow over O’Rawe’s family. His father and his uncle Albert were both incarcerated there in the 1940s for IRA activities. His uncle was sentenced to be flogged 12 times with a cat-o’-nine-tails at the age of 17. “I remember my father telling me that after Albert was flogged he asked him how hard the screws [prison officers] had beaten him,” he said. “Albert called back from cell, ‘Sure my dad has given me worse beatings.’ I arrived here in 1974 during the early Troubles and so I kept up the family tradition of resistance and republican struggle, and ended up here in the Crum as well.”
Hodgins, who like O’Rawe was a friend and prison comrade of Bobby Sands, the first IRA hunger striker to die in the 1981 fast, said he had a flashback to the first time he walked through the gates of Crumlin Road in 1976. “When I first went through, that gateway was bristling with barbed wire and aggressive screws calling you a ‘Fenian bastard’, slapping you about – stuff you took for normal back in the 70s and even the 90s,” he said. “But coming through there again for the first time today it was totally different, it was the same architecture but it’s brightened up a bit and you get a pleasant welcome at the door.” The Cuffs menu is a far cry from what used to come out of the prison kitchen. “They always gave us fish on Fridays, probably because they thought we were all good Catholic boys and had to abstain from meat on that day. Actually the fish they served up was huge and I always looked forward to it,” said O’Rawe. “In fact the food in general in this jail was far better than the cold slop they often gave you in the H-Blocks [Maze prison], which sometimes would be adulterated – especially during the blanket [and] dirty protest when we refused to wear prison clothes and smeared our cells with our excrement in our campaign for political status. But in fairness the food was far better in here inside the Crum.” The tea was not good, said Hodgins. “You got it in big urns and it really was rotten,” he said.
O’Rawe said: “Maybe because of the bromide they put in the tea – that was to stop sexual urges, Gerard! They did that during Victorian times and I don’t think their mentality about controlling prisoners had changed even by the 70s.” As both men recalled, food could also be the trigger for clashes between IRA inmates and their loyalist rivals. “Political status for all prisoners was withdrawn in March 1976 and afterwards there was an uneasy truce in the jail until July of that year, the 12th of July [Orangemen’s Day] to be precise,” Hodgins said. “We were in the canteen and the loyalists were watching a news programme that included a local musician, Bobbie Hanvey, playing an Orange song for the 12th of July and a loyalist got up and did this swaggering show-off John Wayne-style walk. For a laugh an IRA comrade of mine hit him on the head with a bun and that was the spark which kicked off trouble with the loyalists, with everybody lifting chairs, smashing them over each other. A bun fight became a real fight.” Even the music that greeted Hodgins and O’Rawe as they ordered pre-lunch drinks – including Irish whiskey (the jail will soon be home to a new Belfast distillery of its own) – seemed weirdly appropriate. It was the Eagles’ song Hotel California, the last verse of which contains the lines: “You can check out any time you like / But you can never leave” O’Rawe and Hodgson, however, were eventually able to leave and gave the thumbs up for Cuffs’ new “prison food”, which will cater for the thousands of visitors, including some other former inmates of the jail, on “terror tours” around Belfast. • Cuffs Bar & Grill opens seven days a week and takes bookings from 12pm to 10pm"
2016-08-29T19:17:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Crowds enjoy 'amazing energy' of sun-drenched Notting Hill carnival,"More than 400 arrests and four stabbings marred an otherwise good-natured and sun-drenched Notting Hill carnival. According to the Metropolitan police, who had 7,000 officers on the streets of west London, there were a total of 156 arrests on Sunday and a further 284 by midnight on Monday. The crime figures were comparable with last year’s celebration, during which police also made around 400 arrests. According to the Met, who had covered the entire event with a section 60 order, allowing officers to conduct random searches, the majority of the offences were drug-related, but dozens were held on charges relating to the possession of offensive weapons. Five people were wounded in four separate knife attacks over the two days of the carnival. One of them, a 15-year-old boy stabbed in Ladbroke Grove on Sunday afternoon, was taken to hospital in a critical condition, but was later said to be out of danger. London’s ambulance service was also kept busy, with revellers suffering from dehydration and problems related to alcohol consumption.
The second and final day of the annual street party in west London marked the grand finale of the event’s 50th anniversary, which hosted 60 bands and 38 sound systems this year. Hundreds of thousands of people attended the carnival, which regulars spoke of as a “vintage event”. Lina Caicedo, 30, from south-east London, who was partying near the Aba Shanti-I sound system, said she was on her second day of carnival. She had been coming for the past 23 years. “It’s such an important thing to support and celebrate,” she said. “The West Indian community is such an important community to London.” Theo Taylor, 27, from Walthamstow, north-east London, said: “The most important thing about carnival is we come together and remind ourselves that we own the streets.” Dan Glass, 32, from Barnet, said he felt it was clear that people needed to party: “Carnival doesn’t happen in a vacuum, and with everything that’s going on just now, people need it.”
Lindsay Walker, 32, from Brixton, said her grandfather had come over on the Empire Windrush passenger ship and had been to every carnival for the past 50 years. “He came from Grenada and he used to dance with the Grenadian floats. Nowadays he stands on Grenada Corner. “I’ve been to carnival for about the last 26 or 27 years. It’s a link to heritage, but also it’s a really, really fun party. You never see London like this – it’s usually so constrained. You normally wouldn’t have people from all different paths of life together, it’s such an amazing energy.”
As ever, the partying was accompanied by complaints from local politicians and residents about the impact the carnival has on the area. Many locals board up homes and businesses for the bank holiday weekend and Kensington’s MP, Victoria Borwick, has raised questions over whether the event is worth the cost. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea said it spends approximately £500,000 each year on clean-up, licensing, toilets, enforcement of street trading regulations, food hygiene and other regulatory functions. However, some locals have accused the authorities of strangling the carnival in red tape. Jay Hirano, owner of the Mau Mau Bar, which had its own sound system entertaining crowds on Portobello Road, said: “It’s a benefit for us. Every year, it’s getting more and more strict; the police and council are killing our businesses. This year between 7pm and 9pm, none can come to any businesses – we have to stop people coming in at 7 and can only start letting them in at nine. “Rent is so expensive at Portobello, so many businesses are depending on carnival for survival, and police and council are just killing it.” The sound systems were wound down at about 7pm on Monday, although the revelry continued in the street for some time. According to reports on Twitter, police in riot gear were seen moving towards the People’s Sound System stand on All Saints Road late on Monday night. A 60-year-old man standing nearby, who gave his name only as the Dread, denied claims that the music was shut down by police. However, he accused officers of intimidation. “They came about 6.15 and surrounded the sound [system], you know.” Asked why he thought the People’s Sound had been singled out, he replied: “For some reason, they have their targets. This sound here is the peaceful sound that’s been going on for the past 30 years. All the vibes are good and still we get this intimidation.”"
2016-08-30T11:14:56Z,uk-news,UK news,Dover MP warns against 'tit-for-tat' battles with France over border security,"The Conservative MP for Dover has urged the government to avoid any “tit-for-tat” battles with France over border security before talks in Paris between Amber Rudd, the home secretary, and her French counterpart.
Rudd is expected to tell Bernard Cazeneuve on Tuesday that the UK government would not accept changes to the Le Touquet agreement – a reciprocal arrangement that allows British border officials to check the documents of migrants seeking to enter Britain from the camps in Calais, and French officials to do the same in Dover. The president of the region around Calais, Xavier Bertrand, called on Monday for the Le Touquet agreement to end, telling the BBC: “It’s not possible to keep people here without a new agreement between the two governments.” Amid reports that Britain could respond to such a move by reviewing other elements of security cooperation with France, Charlie Elphicke, the MP for Dover and Deal, urged caution. “France, clearly, has suffered some serious terrorist atrocities, and we need to stand with France,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday. “Threatening a tit-for-tat is not the right thing to do. “What we need to do is work more closely together. Next year it’s likely there will be a change of [French] government and we need to understand what it is that they want to achieve. I think what they want to achieve is, as we in Dover want, is to see a lasting solution to a problem that has gone on too long.”
Rudd and Cazeneuve had been due to discuss cooperation on terrorism and security after a series of deadly attacks in France, including in Nice, at what will be their first face-to-face meeting. But she was expected to stress to Cazeneuve that Britain was opposed to any change to the Le Touquet deal. A Home Office source said: “This is a complete non-starter. The home secretary is crystal clear that people in need of protection should seek asylum in the first safe country they enter. That’s the long-held norm, and we are going to stick to it.” Elphicke said lorry drivers passing through Calais faced increasing peril from people seeking to get on to their trucks using desperate measures, and that France and Britain need to cooperate to remove the so-called Jungle camp near the French port, a base for thousands of people seeking to reach the UK. “I spoke to lorry drivers who have been attacked with chainsaws, they’ve been petrol bombed, they’ve been attacked with machetes, their lorries have been stopped by trees. It’s a really serious situation. That’s why we need to have a new treaty between Britain and France to deal with these problems once and for all,” Elphicke said. “We need to dismantle the Calais Jungle, to set up a repatriation centre to help the vulnerable people there back to their home nations, but most of all we need to target the people traffickers, who are busy attacking lorries in international transit, and are also exploiting the vulnerable people in the Jungle.” Those who work with the migrants and refugees in Calais believe that simply dismantling the camp will make very little difference.
Efforts by local authorities earlier this year to clear a section of the makeshift camp led to a similar number of residents cramming into more cramped and insanitary conditions, while other, even worse, encampments sprang up along the coast. There is estimated to be a record high of nearly 10,000 people living in squalid surroundings at the Calais camp, including hundreds of unaccompanied minors, with French charities warning of the worst sanitary conditions ever.
The French right has jumped on the issue in the run-up to next year’s presidential election. Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president, who is seeking his party’s nomination to run in 2017, used a speech at the weekend to call for the main Calais camp to be relocated to the UK. Sarkozy said: “I’m demanding the opening of a centre in Britain to deal with asylum seekers in Britain, so that Britain can do the work that concerns them. The Jungle should not be in Calais or anywhere else, because this is a republic and those with no rights to be here should return to their country.” Sarkozy, who is running a hardline rightwing primary campaign, in effect called for a renegotiation of the Le Touquet agreement. Yet it was Sarkozy, when he was interior minister, who signed the agreement with Britain in 2003. Alain Juppé, the mayor of Bordeaux who is favourite to become the right’s candidate for the presidency next year, has also questioned the agreement, saying over the summer that “logic dictates” that border controls should happen on UK soil. Marine Le Pen, of the far-right Front National, who has strong support in Calais in northern France, is also campaigning on scrapping the current immigration deal. But at government level, the issue is complex as France battles to sort out its own asylum system issues. After the UK voted for Brexit in June, the Socialist government said there would be no renegotiation of the British-French immigration deal because it would not be in French interests. Cazeneuve warned that a change to the deal would send a signal to traffickers and smugglers that they could legitimately leave people at the French border to cross to England and would lead to tens of thousands more migrants in northern France. President François Hollande said there would be “no sense” in changing the deal. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, declined to comment directly on the fate of the Le Touquet agreement when asked after a campaign event in London, instead saying the burden of taking refugees should be better spread across the EU. “The point I always make about the refugee crisis across Europe is it has to be shared across the whole of the European union,” he said. “At the moment Germany takes by far the largest proportion of Syrian asylum seekers and others. Some countries take none, and some take a very small number. The whole of Europe must recognise that we do have a moral duty to take a far greater number of asylum seekers all across Europe.” He said the UK should particularly be more ready to process asylum claims for people with family links to the country, adding: “Where there are family connections of people in the camps with family in Britain then clearly they can apply, and often do.” Corbyn condemned conditions in the main Calais camp, and similar ones along the coast in Dunkirk, both of which he has visited. “I’ve seldom seen anything so disgusting as those fetid camps in a land of plenty. It’s not necessary,” he said. Sir Peter Ricketts, a former British ambassador to France, warned on Monday that if a rightwing candidate won the presidential election next year, Britain “is going to have to deal with a pretty serious conversation with France about the Le Touquet agreement”. He said the UK was unlikely to accept the hotspot idea – adopted by the EU to tackle the crisis of mass migration from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to Greece and Italy – warning that it would attract many more people to Calais. “As soon as you suggest that, it becomes a huge magnet,” added Ricketts."
2016-08-30T12:25:00Z,uk-news,UK news,'Indescribably proud': Tom Jackson's family pay tribute after he dies,"The “indescribably proud” relatives of British backpacker Thomas Jackson have paid tribute to a “wonderful big brother” and a “darling” son after his death in an Australian hospital. The 30-year-old was fatally stabbed trying to save fellow Briton Mia Ayliffe-Chung in the attack at a backpackers hostel in north Queensland last Tuesday. Jackson’s sister, Liv, said she was heartbroken as she paid tribute to her brother on Facebook. She wrote: “There is nothing in this world that can prepare you for the pain and heartbreak of losing a sibling and a friend, but there is great comfort in knowing that he was mine. “To everyone back home and to everyone here in Australia, there are literally not enough words to thank you for your support and beautifully kind words to my family at this time.”
She urged people not to remember him as a victim but as a friend and to cherish his memory, adding: “Indescribably proud of everything you accomplished and the lives you touched. I will love you always and forever TJ, your little sister, Lou.” Tom Jackson, from Congleton in Cheshire, died from multiple stab injuries in a hospital in Townsville, in north-east Queensland, on Tuesday. A French national, Smail Ayad, 29, now faces a second count of murder after he was charged over the death of Ayliffe-Chung last Friday. Ayad is also accused of killing a dog and injuring a dozen police officers after his arrest following the attack at the hostel in Home Hill, which is about 60 miles (100km) south of Townsville. Jackson, a freelance journalist, had been on life support since the attack. His father, Les Jackson, had flown from the UK to be by his son’s bedside. In a tribute posted on a fundraising page on Tuesday, he wrote: “We are bereft. Our darling Tom has left us and the world is a poorer place. Thanks again to everyone for the love and support you have given us over the last few days, we will be forever grateful. “There is dark and evil in this world perpetrated by a few, but so much more love and light emanates from so many more. That thought will sustain us over the coming days.”
DSI Ray Rohweder of Queensland police earlier praised Jackson’s “selfless” courage during the attack. The fundraising page, set up by Jackson’s friend Shoshana Palatnik, has raised more than £5,000 of its £10,000 target. After his death was confirmed, the page said all funds would go to his parents. Rachel Edwards, a college friend, said the 30-year-old would “light people’s lives up with his kind words and inspiration, always pointing out the best in you and trying to make you see that”.Edwards, from Crewe in Cheshire, told the Press Association: “He had a genuine care for everyone he met and always had a smile on his face, even when he didn’t feel like it inside. “I loved him so much, there will literally never be another one like him and I’m so glad we got to tell each other how much our friendship meant to one another before he went on his travels on one of our moments.” Jackson studied sports science at South Cheshire College until 2005. He had worked for 18 months as a freelance journalist before travelling to Australia. In 2014 he took an internship at an English language newspaper in Cambodia where he earlier taught English. On his LinedIn profile page he wrote: “To say that I’ve had a lifelong ambition to be a journalist would be at best an understatement.” The principal of South Cheshire College, Jasbir Dhesi, said on Tuesday: “This is very sad news following Thomas’s heroic intervention where he was trying to protect somebody else. “Our hearts go out to Thomas’s family and friends following this tragic incident.”"
2016-08-30T14:23:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Jazzie Watson jailed for life for killing younger brother,"A 20-year-old man who stabbed his younger half-brother to death during an argument over how the teenager was speaking to their mother has been jailed for life. Jazzie Watson knifed 17-year-old student Shamus McNama 10 times in the face, leg, chest and back at the family home in Bristol. Watson, who admitted murder, was told he would serve at least 11 years and three months in prison before he could be considered for parole. Bristol crown court heard Watson took exception to the way Shamus spoke to their mother, Paula McNama, when she told him off for taking her car. Adam Vaitilingam QC, prosecuting, described how the pair argued in an upstairs bedroom of the family home in Lockleaze, Bristol, in the early hours of 28 February. They exchanged punches and held each other in headlocks before they were pulled apart by their mother and a friend. The fight resumed downstairs and Shamus was fatally stabbed with a small potato knife.
The teenager died in Southmead hospital, Bristol. A postmortem examination found he had suffered 10 wounds. Shamus, who was studying bricklaying at college, was due to become a father this summer with his partner Donna-Marie Hudson. Watson, who fled the house after the attack, walked into a police station later that morning and gave himself up. Richard Smith QC, defending, said there was an “utterly disproportionate explosion in temper” by Watson after the “red mist” descended. Smith said: “He was incensed at the manner in which his half-brother was talking to their mother … He has to deal with the consequences of what happened for the rest of his life. It was a spontaneous outpouring in a moment that he bitterly regretted instantaneously. “His mother finds herself in a dreadful situation and she understands what he is going through. She remains supportive of him. He simply cannot bring himself to see her.” Jailing Watson, Judge Neil Ford QC, the recorder of Bristol, said: “It is plain that what you did was to act in an extremely violent way with a knife in an explosion of temper. “In the circumstances where life is lost the impact is always enormous. You have taken the life of your half-brother, who you loved. You have deprived your mother of a son and your siblings of a brother. You have also added to your own mother’s grief by ruining your own life. The anguish which you have caused is immeasurable.” The investigating officer, DS Leon Swaby, said: “Shamus’ tragic death demonstrates the devastating impact knives can have. In the wrong hands knives can be extremely dangerous weapons which have very real and in this case catastrophic consequences. “Jazzie Watson made a fatal decision when he armed himself with a knife that morning and he will have to live with the fact he killed his brother for the rest of his life. “Not only has a family had to mourn the death of Shamus, a much-loved son, but they now also have to suffer the loss of another for a very significant time. I hope the sentence today sends out a very clear signal that any crime involving a knife could result in a lengthy prison sentence.”"
2016-08-30T15:07:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Police officers call for Notting Hill carnival review after record arrests,"The Metropolitan police federation has called for a full review of the Notting Hill carnival after saying 43 officers were injured and eight taken to hospital, and a record number of people were arrested. Ken Marsh, the chair of the MPF, which represents rank and file officers, said police “dread” having to work at the carnival, the world’s second-biggest street party, where an “unacceptable” number of officers were being attacked. “This is not a peaceful and fun-loving event that our members look forward to policing. They dread it,” he said. “A seemingly growing number of people appear intent on hijacking this carnival and turning it into a bank holiday battleground, and an excuse for using our members as professional punchbags. “Last year, we had an officer stabbed. This year, colleagues were assaulted, abused and spat at. Forty-three were injured, with eight needing hospital treatment. It’s completely and utterly unacceptable.” Police made more than 450 arrests at the carnival, held in west London over the bank holiday weekend. However on Tuesday afternoon Dave Musker, the commander in charge of policing carnival, said that the number of arrests had been inflated by the new Psychoactive Substances Act, and that a revised method of recording injuries to police had resulted in closer attention being paid to officer welfare. The policing operation also came in for criticism from witnesses who reported seeing stop and search powers being disproportionately used against young black men. Ash Sarkar, 24, a senior editor with Novara Media, said she witnessed searches on both days of carnival, including one on Sunday when the suspect was kept handcuffed long after police had determined he was not carrying anything illegal. “They kept this guy in cuffs for about 45 minutes,” she said. “There were other black men who came over to observe, and they got searched as well. It was being used in a punitive way. Me and my friend didn’t get searched: I’m south Asian and he’s white.” Ishmahil Blagrove, 48, author of Carnival, a history of the Notting Hill carnival, said he believed there was a concerted effort by the police and local council to defame the carnival. He said a comparison of crime rates between the carnival and Glastonbury or other music festivals showed them to be comparable. He said that he had also been left on edge by the appearance of riot police at the carnival. “I thought there must be something happening in the area … but there wasn’t. The tactic is almost to agitate and provoke certain responses, I saw that myself yesterday. I can bear witness to that. This is what happens,” Blagrove said. “So when they talk about 400 arrests, there is nothing scientific about it. Those arrests are determined by what senior commanders say; whether they are going to go heavy, or whether they are going to go soft on certain things. When they see casual weed smoking, if they turn a blind eye or not; that determines the figures. They can doctor those figures as much as they like.“When we talk about five stabbings, they want to go to Rio, where they wake up and find five or six bodies in the gutter. Notting Hill Carnival, compared to Trinidad or Brazil, is one of the safest in the world – not just the second largest – it’s one of the safest.” A section 60 order covering the entire carnival area allowed officers to carry out random searches. The policing operation, which seemed initially to take a light touch, changed as the day progressed, with officers taking to the streets in riot gear after nightfall. Ninety arrests were made for alleged possession of points and blades, and 169 for drugs.
Officers also made 38 arrests under the 2016 Psychoactive Substances Act, which came into force in May, relating to nitrous oxide. Possession of the substance, a popular party drug sold in gas form by the balloon, is legal, but it is illegal to distribute it. A further 40 arrests were made for alleged public order offences and 25 arrests were made on suspicion of assaulting a police officer. Last year, there were 407 arrests, a big increase on the 2014 figure of 252. Five people were hurt in four separate knife attacks on Sunday, according to the Metropolitan police. Among those arrested was a 14-year-old boy held on suspicion of grievous bodily harm after a 15-year-old was stabbed. The Met had a huge presence in Notting Hill and Ladbroke Grove, with 6,000 officers deployed on Sunday and 7,000 on Monday. Most sound systems, particularly those playing dub reggae, dancehall or grime, had a significant police presence. There was friction at People’s Sound on All Saints Road when police in riot gear moved in just before shutdown at 7pm.
One bystander, who asked to be named only as the Dread, accused officers of intimidation. Asked why he thought People’s Sound had been singled out, he said: “For some reason, they have their targets. This sound here is the peaceful sound that’s been going on for the past 30 years. All the vibes are good and still we get this intimidation.” Dennis “Mekka” Stephenson, 47, an events promoter, said that the actions of police at People’s Sound was a particular provocation, because of the history of that sound system and its link to All Saints Road. “Just remember you are talking about the original All Saints Road frontline, that’s where the original (1976) riot started. That’s the heart of black civil rights in London,” he said. “The police have certain targets. They know what the line is all about: human rights. If they are going to push someone and they know someone is going to push them back that is where it will happen.” Other arrests included 17 for common assault or actual bodily harm; 13 for sexual offences; 10 for theft from the person, eight for going equipped for theft; six for grievous bodily harm; three for drink or drug driving; two for criminal damage; one for robbery and 32 others that the Met did not specify."
2016-08-30T16:10:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Londoners and skyscrapers: a mixed picture of acceptance and concern,"Given the fury so often directed at tall buildings in London, the most striking finding of the recently-published Ipsos-MORI poll of Londoners’ attitudes to them is how relaxed most of them seem with the clusters of skyscrapers currently sprouting in the capital. True, there were large majorities favouring “more limits” on the height of new tall buildings and on the number rising to an exceptional 50 storeys or more. Just under 20% of those surveyed felt strongly about these things and 41% and 40% respectively said they “tend to agree” that the limits suggested should be imposed. They far outnumbered those who took the opposite views. And yet opinions about the tall buildings - defined as being more than 20-storeys high - that currently exist or are under construction in the capital were, on the whole, more positive than negative. Asked if they are worried that too many new tall buildings are going up in London, 40% either strongly disagreed (8%) or tended to disagree (32%) compared with 36% who strongly (9%) or tended to (27%) agree that they are worried. Those surveyed were also asked if they think new tall buildings are making London’s skyline look better. A substantial 44% agreed (8% strongly, 36% tended to) compared with only 30% who disagreed (9% and 21%). There was an absolute dead heat between those who agree that “new tall buildings are damaging what makes London special” and those who don’t, but a clear majority agreeing with the proposition that “new tall buildings are making a valuable contribution to the vibrancy of London” - 40% in all compared with only 27% who disagreed. Moreover, 47% thought the number of tall building in the pipeline earlier this year, when the question was asked - 270, including 25 of more than 50 storeys - was “about right” compared with 39% who thought this was too many and 11%, too few. What conclusions can be drawn from these findings and how should they influence Sadiq Khan’s approach to using his planning powers and, in the longer term, his drawing up of a new London Plan? It’s tempting to suggest that the influential anti-tall building lobby, with its mixture of aesthetic, heritage and developer-bashing arguments, should be required to make its case more persuasively. Londoners may be wary of skyscraper development getting out of hand and, as another part of Ipsos-MORI survey indicates, would like tall buildings contained within specific areas. But, in general, they seem relatively content with how things are now (though note that the very latest figures say that the number of tall buildings planned has risen to 400). It’s a reminder that London buildings that have broken height barriers in the past, from St Pauls to the BT Tower (originally the Post Office Tower), have faced initial, high-profile opposition only to be later embraced by popular affection. The same thing seems to be happening with the Shard. At the same time, the pollsters found an exceptionally high level of agreement that Londoners should be consulted more over the number of tall buildings going up. And, significantly, negative feelings about them were more marked among Inner Londoners, who are more likely to have a tall building near where they live, than among Outer Londoners, for many of whom the edifices sprouting along the Thames and elsewhere are distant additions to the skyline rather than looming giants casting long, local shadows. For example, the percentage of Inner Londoners worried about the number of tall buildings was slightly larger at 43% than the 40% who said they aren’t worried. Another question in the survey suggests that Londoners are more accepting of tall buildings if convinced of their utility: good design, looking “right” in relation to their surroundings and respecting the feelings of local people came high on the list of factors they thought should be given the greatest priority by those making decisions about whether tall buildings should be allowed, but the top two on the list were whether the building would produce affordable housing and new job opportunities. However, when asked which types of housing are most suited to the needs of Londoners, terraced dwellings came top, closely followed by purpose-built flats of five storeys or less. High-rise flats lagged well behind. The overall picture painted by the survey is, then, a nuanced one. The mayor might be wise to tentatively conclude that Londoners will accept more tall buildings on condition that they will serve a useful purpose and if their scale and proliferation is regulated in keeping with their wishes. The findings also raise issues for further research. For example, Hackney Labour councillor Rita Krishna, a strong advocate of cycling, walking and public transport, has wondered on Twitter whether the preference for terraces partly reflects an assumption that they provide on-street car parking. Another thought that comes to mind is whether Londoners have been well enough informed about what modern, high density housing that isn’t also high-rise can look and feel like - a point that is not lost on Khan’s deputy for housing, James Murray. The mayor has said he will publish supplementary planning guidance in the autumn. That should start to tell us what his direction of travel on tall buildings is, along with a great deal else. Read the detailed findings of the Ipsos MORI survey by way of here."
2016-08-30T17:11:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Jeremy Vine posts video of alleged road rage incident,"The BBC presenter Jeremy Vine has published video footage showing a driver threatening to knock him out and allegedly assaulting him while he was on his bicycle. Vine said the incident took place while he was commuting through Kensington, west London, on Friday. The Metropolitan police said it had no record of an incident being reported. The footage, posted on Facebook on Tuesday, shows Vine coming to a stop as a black car drives close to his bike. He explains to her that he is trying to stay a car’s width away from the parked cars on both sides of the narrow street. But the woman gets out of the car and starts hurling abuse at him. She says: “Why the fuck would you stop in front of a car. You don’t respect your fucking life. Move your bike, move your bike. I could have hit you and I’d be done for a murder. Get the fuck out of the road. Fucking idiot, now fuck off. You lot piss me off.” Vine said she began “kicking out” during the tirade, although this cannot be seen on the footage. After shouting at him she gets back in her car and begins tailing him again, at one point nearly hitting a parked vehicle. The pair clash again in an incident that Vine said took place 30 seconds later. The woman, in front of him at this point, stops her car at a red traffic light at a junction and approaches him again. As Vine implores her not to hit him – warning her “You’ve already assaulted me” – she says: “If you take a picture of my car I’m going to knock you out because that’s my personal belonging, don’t fucking take a picture.” She then goes to her vehicle and Vine claims that as he drew up beside her she formed her hand into the shape of a gun which she then pretended to aim and fire at him, although, again, this can not be seen in the footage. Vine wrote on Facebook: “I hate to overload our hard-working London police with footage from my commute, but I feel the person you see on the tape will at some point hurt someone very badly – either with her car or in a direct personal assault. See what you think.”"
2016-08-30T18:10:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Southern to reinstate one-third of cancelled train services,"The train operator Southern will restore more than 100 cancelled services next Monday, bringing some relief after a summer of misery for passengers. The operator, which is owned by Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), said 119 services – more than a third of the 341 cancelled on 11 July – would be reinstated. It blamed “unprecedented levels of train crew sickness” for the cancellations. Charles Horton, GTR’s chief executive, said: “We know how difficult life has been for our passengers recently and we are sincerely sorry. Our aim has been to bring back as much of the timetable as quickly as we could. “We’re pleased that we can restore a large chunk of our train timetable for our passengers but we will not be satisfied until the full timetable is running, and running in a punctual way people can rely on.”
But the good news for passengers was overshadowed by the prospect of more strikes next week. GTR has been at loggerheads with the RMT union as well as the drivers’ union Aslef. The Liberal Democrat transport spokeswoman, Jenny Randerson, expressed disappointment at GTR’s announcement. She said: “This is a small step in the right direction but will not provide a quick fix. One hundred and nineteen services have been restored but 222 still hang in the balance. Strikes are still planned for the 7th and 8th of September and both passengers and staff are still dissatisfied. “Today’s announcement doesn’t go far enough and Southern still need to address the mess that surrounds them and allows their customers’ daily misery to continue.” The company is due to hold new talks with the RMT on Wednesday to avert a 24-hour strike by hundreds of station staff over its station modernisation programme. A 48-hour walkout by conductors from the RMT next Wednesday and Thursday is still expected to go ahead. Unions oppose GTR’s plans to increase the use of driver-only-operated trains and change the role of conductors, arguing some of the changes will impact on safety. An Aslef ballot for strike action by more than 1,000 train drivers working for Southern and Gatwick Express, which could have coincided with the RMT walkout, has been suspended by the union.
A GTR spokesman said: “We welcome the decision by Aslef to suspend their ballot notice over a ‘breakdown in industrial relations’ and that it will not take any further action in relation to the ballot notice, or the ballot. We are continuing to work with Aslef to address their concerns that led to the dispute.” Horton said: “While we’ll do all we can to restore the services, we are faced with an unparalleled wave of strikes, unjustified industrial disputes and abnormal levels of train crew sickness.” He blamed “an intransigent RMT leadership” for the strike called next week, which he said would “cause maximum disruption, damage and delay in the very week when many people go back to work and back to school after the summer break”. Southern is the UK’s largest rail franchise, covering routes from Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and Kent into London. It also runs Gatwick Express services between London Victoria and Gatwick stations, and to Brighton in the morning and evening peak periods. GTR operates the Thameslink, Great Northern and Gatwick Express rail companies, and its parent company, Govia, runs London Midland and South Eastern train companies."
2016-08-30T19:13:02Z,uk-news,UK news,MPs receive identical death threats over the weekend,"More than two dozen MPs have been sent an identical message threatening to kill them and their family, along with a picture of a severed head. Chris Bryant, a former shadow cabinet minister, said police were investigating the threats against at least 25 MPs made at the weekend, which come two months after the murder of his Labour colleague Jo Cox. Bryant said threats against politicians were on the rise and those who are women, gay or from a minority ethnic background appeared to receive the worst treatment. “I don’t want to give too much detail because obviously there is a police investigation going on now,” he said. “But the truth is that this is a regular part of what we are dealing with at the moment, and I don’t want police to waste time and I don’t want politicians to be treated differently, but the truth of the matter is that we are in the public eye and somehow or other, this world of the internet has fostered an anger and a bitterness which a lot of us are still bearing the emotional scars of losing one of our colleagues earlier on this year. And the sad thing is that is not the only time that has happened.” The identical death threats are understood to have been sent to MPs from across the parties and contain a same message: “Warning I am going to kill you and all of your family.” A spokesman for the Metropolitan police said the force was investigating a linked series of threatening emails that had been received by a number of MPs since Friday. “All of these emails have been received via MPs’ parliamentary email accounts. No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing. This is not being treated as a terrorist incident,” he added. People have been prosecuted in recent months for making death threats to Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Ben Bradshaw. Labour MP Jess Phillips revealed this month that she was having a “panic room” fitted in her constituency officeafter a series of threats to her safety. A number of other parliamentarians are in the process of updating security measures at their homes and constituency offices. Bryant has been one of the most vocal in calling for threats against MPs to be taken more seriously. “What is particularly disturbing is that a lot of these threats are to women. I think women MPs, gay MPs, ethnic minority MPs get the brunt of it,” he said. “Or at least that is what I have heard from people on an anecdotal basis. “One of the things that I have been very keen to try and achieve is that we should have in parliament a proper body which I think is now being set up, which will look at all of this in the round so that it is not just Greater Manchester police and then Merseyside and so on, dealing individually with MPs. But you can see whether, for instance, the same person is targeting all of these people or not.”"
2016-08-30T21:03:02Z,uk-news,UK news,British backpacker's funeral to include passage from the Qur'an,"A British backpacker murdered in Australia will have a reading from the Qur’an at her funeral to counter the “misrepresentation” of her killing as an act of terrorism, her mother has said. Mia Ayliffe-Chung was stabbed to death at a hostel in Queensland last Tuesday. Thomas Jackson, 30, died in hospital overnight on Monday from injuries he sustained trying to save her. Smail Ayad, 29, from France, has been charged with the pair’s murder. Detectives have played down terrorism as a motive for the killing, despite reports that the attacker shouted “Allahu Akbar” during the stabbing, and suggested that “mental health or drug misuse issues” may have played a part. On Tuesday Rosie Ayliffe complained about the “misrepresentation” of her daughter’s death “as an act of terrorism on the part of an Islamic fundamentalist”. She said Mia’s funeral would be a multi-faith ceremony, with a reading from the Qur’an, along with a Jewish text or song, a Sikh reading and a Buddhist performance. “After talking about the misrepresentation of Mia’s death in the media as an act of terrorism on the part of an Islamic fundamentalist, the minister delivering the service suggested we include a Qur’anic reading, and he will find something suitable with a friend who is an Islamic scholar,” Ayliffe wrote in her Independent column. She said her daughter was “essentially Buddhist in outlook” and believed in reincarnation and other tenets of the faith. “We have therefore decided on a prolonged, reverberating note from a Buddhist singing bowl to signify the beginning and end of a meditation on life and death,” she added. Ayliffe, from Wirksworth in Derbyshire, previously said her daughter’s ashes would be scattered around the world so she could continue her travels. Police allege Jackson was set upon by Ayad in the bathroom of Shelley’s Backpackers in Home Hill, north Queensland, where he and another man were tending to the fatally wounded Ayliffe-Chung. His father, Les Jackson, said on Tuesday: “Our darling Tom has left us and the world is a poorer place. Thanks again to everyone for the love and support you have given us over the last few days, we will be forever grateful. “There is dark and evil in this world perpetrated by a few, but so much more love and light emanates from so many more. That thought will sustain us over the coming days.”"

An air ambulance and coastguard helicopter were scrambled to the hamlet of East Portholland near St Austell on the south coast on Tuesday but the man and girl were pulled from the sea by members of the public. The man was declared dead at the scene while the girl was taken to Derriford hospital in Plymouth. Her condition was not thought to be serious. Devon and Cornwall police are investigating the accident and have not yet named the two people, who are members of the same family. Supt Ian Drummond Smith said: “The family involved were from outside the area and are believed to have been holidaying in Cornwall. This appears to be a tragic scuba diving accident, and our thoughts are with the man’s relatives and friends at this time.” The tragedy is the latest in a series of seaside deaths this summer. Five young men died at Camber Sands in East Sussex last week, while Londoners Rudy Bruynius and his two-year-old daughter Mckayla Bruynius were killed after being swept off rocks and into the sea at Newquay in north Cornwall this month. In a statement on the latest Cornish death, the force said: “Police were notified at 5.12pm on Tuesday 30 August that a 45-year-old man had been retrieved from the sea by members of the public at East Portholland along with a 12-year-old girl.”"
2016-08-31T09:33:37Z,uk-news,UK news,"Nurse forged doctor's signature to get £3,300 of Botox prescriptions","A nurse forged a doctor’s signature to obtain prescriptions for Botox worth thousands of pounds for her private beauty business. Kate Matthew, a registered nurse and health visitor, admitted six counts of fraud by false representation. Cardiff crown court heard that 34-year-old Matthew, from Cwmbran in south Wales, met a qualified doctor while attending a course on Botox. Prosecutors said the pair developed a working relationship whereby the doctor would prescribe Botox for Matthew’s clients.
The court was told the business relationship came to an end and Matthew forged the doctor’s signature to obtain more Botox. An investigation took place after a pharmacy raised concerns. When the fraud emerged, Matthew said to a member of the staff at the pharmacy: “Please don’t report this. I’m a single mum. I didn’t know what I was doing was wrong.” Matthew submitted six false prescriptions between September 2014 and June 2015 to obtain drugs worth £3,300. She paid for the Botox by credit card, but in bypassing the doctor she avoided paying a “signature fee” for each prescription. The court was told that Matthew was qualified to administer the treatment herself and that no one was harmed by her actions. She spent four years training to be a nurse, then two years completing a masters in public health while raising two children. Judge Geraint Walters said Matthew had abused a position of responsibility. He added: “It was a shortcut you took that has led to life-changing consequences for you.” Matthew was sentenced to 32 weeks in prison, suspended for 18 months, and was ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work over the next 12 months."
2016-08-31T09:53:07Z,uk-news,UK news,"Eight out of 10 people happy with policing, watchdog finds","Almost eight in 10 people are satisfied with policing, according to a report published by the police watchdog. The survey of 26,000 people also found that the majority of the population felt that crime and antisocial behaviour was not much of a problem (62%), while a further one in 10 did not consider it a problem at all (10%). The study, conducted last summer but published for the first time on Wednesday, was carried out by Ipsos Mori on behalf of Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary to monitor public views of policing. It is the first time the study has been done. The findings reveal that 76% of people are happy with policing in their area despite 36% not having seen a police officer on patrol over a period of 12 months. Another 23% said they had seen police on foot only once or twice over a year. Those living in the most deprived neighbourhoods, however, are more likely to report having seen a uniformed police presence on foot. But the survey also found a quarter of respondents believed that crime and antisocial behaviour was a big problem in their local area (25%). Age appears to have an impact on feelings of safety with 33% of 16 to 24-year-olds feeling unsafe, compared with 21% of those aged 65 and over. The study questioned people aged over 16 across the 43 police forces in England and Wales, between 15 July and 6 August 2015. Last October, the chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, Sara Thornton, and Craig Mackey, deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan police, said the era of routine patrols by “bobbies on the beat” had come to an end. They also said funding cuts would lead to a transformation in investigating crime, but the Home Office said at the time police reform was working and crime was falling. Police budgets in England and Wales were protected in real terms in the former chancellor George Osborne’s spending review last November. People’s overall contentment with policing appears to reflect the national picture of falling crime rates, as recorded by the latest Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW). The CSEW shows overall crime has been falling since a peak in 1995, with some fluctuations from year to year. The latest survey ending March 2016 showed a 6% fall in the number of incidents against adults aged 16 to 59. There were 6.3m incidents, compared with 6.8m in the previous survey year. Improved crime rates, however, do not reliably result in people feeling safer. The same ONS survey showed that around 6 out of 10 adults (61%) perceived crime in the country as a whole to have risen over the past few years. Fewer people, however, perceived that crime had risen in their local area (32%). Instead, when asked about the level of crime in their local area, compared with the level nationally, only a small proportion (9%) thought crime in their local area was above average and 55% felt it was below average. News programmes on TV and radio are most often cited as the main source of information influencing people’s perceptions of national crime levels (cited by 67% of people). The 2013-14 survey found 12% of adults classified as having a high level of worry about violent crime. Almost one in five adults (19%) thought it was either “very” or “fairly likely” that they would be a victim of crime within the next 12 months. All of these measures were at a similar level to the previous year and the general trend has been flat for a number of years."
2016-08-31T13:13:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Dorset man jailed for life over Philippines child sex abuse,"A pub landlord from Dorset who travelled to south-east Asia and filmed himself sexually abusing children as young as eight has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 14 years. David Shepherd, 60, from Bridport, flew to the Philippines and recorded himself committing serious sexual offences, including rape, against children. He also paid for and directed live “shows” over the internet in which children as young as 17 months were sexually abused. He was found with a large collection of films he had produced and tens of thousands of indecent images and videos of children that he had downloaded to his computer and hard drives. Such was the extent of his offending that the case was split into a series of hearings at Dorchester crown court. He was convicted by a jury of 22 counts of sexual offences against children including rape, attempted rape, producing indecent movies of children and paying for sexual services of a child. He admitted 10 counts of arranging and facilitating a child sex offence and possessing 20,207 indecent images and videos. He will have to serve at least 14 years behind bars before being considered for parole. The judge, Peter Johnson, told Shepherd on Wednesday: “You have no moral boundaries. You have shown no remorse. Your acts will haunt your victims for the rest of their days. Their innocence has been taken from them. “You have a deeply engraved sexual interest in young children. You are unquestionably a danger. This life sentence reflects the public abhorrence for your shocking crimes.” Shepherd was arrested in November 2015 at the Loders Arms pub near Bridport where he had been landlord for six months. Police found that his offending went back to 2007. They discovered that he had abused four girls under 13 in person while in the Philippines. Back in the UK he had contacted other paedophiles in the Philippines and directed at least 76 live “sex shows” involving Filipino children.
During police interviews Shepherd denied visiting and meeting the children in the Philippines, despite evidence including videos of him abusing children, travel tickets and financial records indicating otherwise. DC David Baker, of Dorset police’s paedophile online investigation team, said: “This is the most horrific case of child abuse I have had any dealings with. David Shepherd is an individual who presents a serious risk and danger to young children. For many years he has used the internet to commission live sexual abuse which he recorded. “Such was Shepherd’s arrogance of his offending, he pleaded not guilty despite the overwhelming visual evidence against him. This evidence showed harrowing images of very young children being abused and degraded in the most vile manner.” An NSPCC spokesperson for south-west England said: “The youngsters in these pictures and films are the victims of unspeakable abuse and the harrowing experiences they endured for the sexual gratification of Shepherd and other offenders should not be underestimated.”"
2016-08-31T14:11:39Z,uk-news,UK news,Polish envoy voices concerns about Brexit xenophobia after Harlow killing,"Poland’s ambassador to the UK has visited the scene of the killing of a 40-year-old Polish man in Harlow to express his shock at the death and alarm about the rise in xenophobic attacks after Britain’s vote to leave the EU. Six teenage boys have been arrested in the Essex town after Arkadiusz Jóźwik, 40, was killed on Saturday night. His brother said he had been heard speaking Polish. Essex police said that Jóźwik and a second Polish man who survived were apparently the victims of an unprovoked attack. The motive is unknown, but one line of inquiry was the possibility of it being a hate crime.
The killing has sparked widespread alarm after an upsurge in hate crime targeted at eastern Europeans followed Britain’s EU referendum. The Polish ambassador, Arkady Rzegocki, visited the scene of the crime in the Stow area of Harlow, together with the local MP, Robert Halfon. Rzegocki expressed his shock and urged witnesses to help police investigate the killing. He said he would take part in a “march of silence” on Saturday that is being organised by Polish community in Harlow. Asked about xenophobic attacks after the Brexit vote, Rzegocki said: “Unfortunately there is much more after Brexit. We have found about 15 or 16 such situations. “It is a very important tragedy and we have to work together on this issue. We will meet together on Saturday on this march of silence. I really hope it will help.” Speaking alongside Rzegocki, Halfon delivered a strongly worded statement.
Halfon said: “I’m very proud of our Polish community in Harlow. The Polish people work incredibly hard and have opened up some lovely shops and helped regenerate parts of our town and employed more people. “What has happened is an incredible tragedy. We need to find out the truth … This is not just a tragedy for the family or for Poland, it is a tragedy for Harlow and Britain as well.” Asked about racist attacks on eastern Europeans since the referendum, Halfon added: “I believe that the vast majority of people who voted to leave the EU, did so for noble reasons. They believed they wanted to take control and believed Britain would be better off … These kind of awful things are done by a minority who come from the sewers who want to exploit division and have their own racist agenda.”
Halfon, who backed remain, added: “All of us need to stand up for tolerance and kindness and against any kind of division.” Police in Harlow have been given the power to order anyone involved in crime or harassment to leave The Stow. The dispersal order came into effect at 7pm on Tuesday and will remain in place for 48 hours. Eric Hind, organiser of Saturday’s protest march, said that the Polish community had remained quiet for too long about abuse. Speaking to the Guardian, he said: “Brexit kind of gave the British people a kind of green light to be racist. My family and friends have all been abused. It happens on a daily basis. “We have kept our mouths closed too long. This is the reason why I’m keen to organise this. Lots of people say they plan to travel here from all over the place. Everyone is welcome. This time it is the Polish people, but it could be Muslims, it could be any different group. We need to fight racism everywhere, every day.” The second man who survived the incident suffered suspected fractures to his hands and bruising to his stomach. He was discharged from hospital. Five boys aged 15 and one aged 16 were arrested on suspicion of murder but were released on on bail until 7 October pending further inquiries."

Clyde, a 20cm mud turtle, was taken from his tank at the Blue Planet aquarium in Ellesmere Port on Tuesday afternoon, Cheshire police said. He was returned home on Wednesday after detectives circulated CCTV images of a woman accompanying a young boy who had apparently dived into Clyde’s tank. The boy was seen carrying something suspiciously turtle-like under a jumper. Clyde’s keepers had warned that without proper care he could die. Police said Clyde was returned to the aquarium by a group of people. No one had been arrested. “We are continuing with our inquiries,” a spokeswoman said. “Clyde seems to be safe and well.”
How and why Clyde was taken remains unclear. Before the turtle was returned, DS Rob Grantham said: “Our investigation has so far established that a young boy managed to get into the tank and remove the turtle. The boy was completely soaked and had no top on, which may have attracted your attention if you had been there yesterday. “The boy appeared to be carrying something under a jumper, which we believe was the turtle known as Clyde. We’re keeping an open mind as to why Clyde was taken but we need to stress that without specialist care Clyde may die.” Clyde’s captors may have regretted their actions: mud turtles can release a foul-smelling liquid from their anal scent glands as a defence mechanism against predators."
2016-08-31T15:21:02Z,uk-news,UK news,EDF representatives file legal challenge in France over Hinkley Point,"Tensions over Britain’s proposed nuclear power station at Hinkley Point have flared again in France as five worker representatives on the board of the French power company EDF filed a challenge to overturn the company’s controversial decision to build the nuclear reactors. The employee representatives believe EDF’s chief executive “did not communicate crucial information about a major project” he was aware of before the 28 July meeting at which the board of directors approved the £18bn project to build Britain’s first new nuclear reactors in decades, their law firm told Agence France-Presse.
The five union board members have filed a complaint with the Paris commercial court seeking to annul the decision because the Jean-Bernard Levy had not shared essential information with all board members. The complaint also protests against the participation of several directors “with conflicts of interests”, according to the law firm Alain Levy. The challenge claims that some of the EDF board members who voted in favour of Hinkley Point represent companies that are EDF customers and could benefit from the UK contract. French firms Bouygues and Vallourec have denied that members of their boards who are also on the board of EDF had a conflict of interest in their Hinkley Point vote. Laurent Langlard, spokesman for the national mines and energy branch of the powerful CGT union which is supporting the court action brought by the five board members, said: “We’re worried. We have never been against the Hinkley Point project in itself. Our concern is the timing. This project can’t be charged into too fast. EDF’s economic situation is serious. More time has to be taken for full feedback and lessons to be learnt. So we want the board decision annulled and we want a full debate at board level.” He said ensuring that EDF could financially stay on its feet was paramount and the company should take two more years to study and prepare the project. The complaint is the latest in several objections to Hinkley Point by workers at EDF. It follows previous legal efforts by several of EDF’s unions to block and then overturn the approval of the project, which they consider a huge financial risk to the heavily indebted company. The unions argue that Levy and representatives of the French state should have informed the board that they knew the British government wanted to take more time to review the contract. Hours after EDF’s board approved the project last month, the UK government postponed its decision until early autumn. Days later, in an email to top EDF executives, Levy admitted that the night before the board meeting he had been told the new prime minister Theresa May wanted a bit more time. He said he had learned that May “was asking for a little more time, without reassessing the project, without giving the date when it could be signed”. However, the unions said that at the board meeting “the British desire to proceed very quickly was again presented as a reason to quickly sign” the deal. Levy has denied lying to board members, saying he was not aware that the British government would in fact announce hours later a review of the project. The nuclear reactors carry huge risks for both France and Britain. EDF will assume the upfront costs, which unions say could jeopardise the firm’s survival, while Britain has committed to pay a price twice current market levels for the power generated by the plant. “Some board members discovered they did not benefit from the same level of information as the CEO and government representative,” the CGT, CFE-CGC and FO unions said. The moderate CFDT union did not sign the statement. The unions added there was no justification to push the board to vote on the project in a hurry. The unions warned earlier this month that this amounted to a “governance scandal”. The French government has been keen to get Hinkley Point approved as it sees the project as crucial for the long-term viability of France’s nuclear industry, which employs 220,000 people. Previous British governments have also been in favour because the reactors would cover up to 7% of Britain’s electricity needs while helping the government meet its CO2 emissions targets. But British support is not unanimous, and criticism focuses on the growing difference between an electricity price guarantee for EDF, subsidised by the British taxpayer, and current falling energy prices. There have also been national security concerns about Chinese involvement in the project – Beijing has a one-third stake in the plan. A date for a Paris court hearing should be set on 5 September. EDF is also being sued by its Works Council, which also wants to annul the vote because it argues it had not received the necessary documents from management to give non-binding preliminary advice to the company."
2016-08-31T15:34:57Z,uk-news,UK news,Police failing to use new law against coercive domestic abuse,"A law protecting victims of domestic violence from controlling and coercive behaviour has been used just 62 times in the first six months since it was introduced. Eight out of 22 police forces in England and Wales have not charged a single person with the offence, according to a Freedom of Information request. Nine forces have made two or fewer charges since the new law came into effect in December 2015, including Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Warwickshire and Wiltshire. Emma Pearmaine, head of family services at the law firm Simpson Millar, which made the FoI request, called for increased awareness and understanding of the new laws and said more specialist training for police officers could be necessary. “Coercive control can be many things but essentially it comes down to people exerting control via a pattern of behaviours, and these can sometimes be difficult to spot from the outside if you don’t know where to look or which questions to ask,” she said. “More dedicated training on the new legislation and how coercion can impact on a victim’s life might help push up the number of people who are identified as offenders and prosecuted. “One of the biggest concerns when it comes to coercive control is that victims are not aware that being isolated from friends or family, having access to money and bank accounts restricted, or even having personal medical conditions revealed, is domestic abuse and, now, a criminal offence. “With less than three coercive controls on average per police authority, more needs to be done so that people can involve the police at an early stage before coercion turns into physical abuse.” Three forces – Kent, Hertfordshire and Norfolk – all reported prosecutions of 10 or more, but most forces launched fewer than two coercive control actions between December 2015 and June 2016. Nine forces are yet to charge a single person under the law. On 29 December, under the Serious Crime Act 2015, controlling or coercive behaviour in intimate or familial relationships became a new offence, punishable with a maximum prison sentence of five years.
But although Citizens Advice stepped in to help 3,000 victims of emotional abuse and 900 victims of financial abuse in 2014, take-up of the new powers to prosecute offenders has so far been low. Lucy Hastings, a director at the independent charity Victim Support, said: “These findings demonstrate that there is still some way to go in improving the support provided to victims and witnesses, before they will be getting the information they need and the respect they deserve. “Our research tells us that proper communication between the police and victims of crime is vital. Without it, victims may feel isolated and come to believe that their case is being neglected or not taken seriously. This makes them less likely to report crime in the future and ultimately undermines public confidence in the wider justice system. “All police staff should be fully aware of their obligations under the Victims’ Code and measures put in place to ensure that those obligations are being met.” The FoI data reveals little improvement has been made since May when Theresa May, then home secretary, lambasted officers at the Police Federation’s annual conference for not protecting victims of domestic violence. She said new powers to tackle domestic abuse, including controlling or coercive behaviour, were effective but were “not being used anywhere near as systematically as they could be”.
At the time of her speech, the first conviction for coercive control had taken place and many more cases were pending. Since then, however, use of the new law seems to have stalled. In the same six-month period there were more than 20,000 prosecutions for domestic violence. The coercive or controlling behaviour offence aims to close a gap in the law around patterns of coercive and controlling behaviour during a relationship between intimate partners, former partners who still live together, or family members. It was intended to help victims experiencing the type of behaviour that stops short of serious physical violence but amounts to extreme psychological and emotional abuse. The law states that coercive or controlling behaviour does not relate to a single incident. Instead it is a “purposeful pattern of incidents that occur over time enabling someone to exert power and control, or coerce another”. On the day the law was introduced, Karen Bradley, the minister for preventing abuse and exploitation, said: “Our new coercive or controlling behaviour offence will protect victims who would otherwise be subjected to sustained patterns of abuse that can lead to total control of their lives by the perpetrator. “Victims who would otherwise be subjected to sustained patterns of domestic abuse will be better protected under [this] new offence.”"
2016-08-31T15:48:57Z,uk-news,UK news,'My values no longer fit': senior police officer announces retirement on Twitter,"A senior Norfolk police officer announced her retirement from the force on Twitter, saying that she felt her “values no longer fit”. Asst Ch Con Sarah Hamlin, 48, announcing her departure after 30 years’ service, told her 3,600 Twitter followers she was “resigned to the fact that my values no longer fit the org. I can’t make a difference, support front-line.” Hamlin was appointed in June 2014 as the collaborative lead for protective services in Norfolk and Suffolk, overseeing the delivery of serious and organised crime, intelligence, major investigation, forensics and specialist operations along with with criminal justice and heading the force’s security operation for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at their home on the Queen’s Sandringham estate. She later tweeted: “And so I wish colleagues & friends all the best. Let’s hope policing can recover & the officers & staff welfare is prioritised.” “To clarify I am retiring! Looking forward to spending time with family and friends. Playing golf and kayaking.” She did not immediately respond to requests to clarify her comments in her tweets. In a statement released through the Norfolk constabulary, Hamlin said: “I’ve had a fantastic career and thoroughly enjoyed my 30 years with Norfolk constabulary and latterly in also working with the Suffolk constabulary. I have many fond memories and without doubt these are the best forces I could have wished to work with. I consider though that now is the right time for me to retire to spend more time with family and friends as I look to pursue my other dreams.” The Norfolk force has been forced to make a series of cuts in the last five years to trim its budget by £25m. One recent money-saving initiative has been to run some services jointly with neighbouring Suffolk police. Hamlin, a mother-of-two, joined the police in 1986 and served in uniform, and then as a detective, reaching the rank of chief inspector before being promoted to assistant chief constable in June 2014. She was praised in 2001 for starting up the SOS Bus Project, a multi-agency initiative to assist young people needing help in Norwich’s clubland. In a blog earlier this year, Hamlin wrote of the challenges of the job. “A lot has been written about the culture of policing. However, I believe the value of my contributions has been about continuing to stand by my personal values and beliefs. My tough “downhill ski” moments have been when I have been asked to work contrary to my personal beliefs. But when I’ve challenged views I feel less stressed. Even if other don’t agree, I can at least say that I discharged my personal responsibility by pointing out the alternative view.” The chief constables of both Norfolk and Suffolk police paid tribute to the “significant contributions” Hamlin had made across many different areas during her career."
2016-08-31T16:26:24Z,uk-news,UK news,Police given seven more days to question Royal Marine in terror inquiry,Detectives from the Metropolitan police have been given an extra seven days to question a Royal Marine over the discovery of two dissident republican arsenals in Northern Ireland. He will be held in custody for another week as searches continue in his native Larne in County Antrim in connection with the ongoing anti-terrorist operation. Ciaran Maxwell was arrested in Somerset last Wednesday in relation to the uncovering of two terrorist arsenals near Larne in March and May. The Police Service of Northern Ireland described the first find in May at Carnfunnock forest park as “a significant terrorist hide”. In May at nearby Capanagh forest park the PSNI along with army technical officers found homemade armour-piercing rockets and two military-grade anti-personnel mines. The Royal Marine is being held at a London police station on suspicion of preparation of acts of terrorism. It is understood the police investigation includes the possibility of terrorist attacks by anti-peace-process republican organisations on targets in England.
2016-08-31T16:56:37Z,uk-news,UK news,Teenager critical after being shot in the head in north London,"A teenager is in a critical condition after he was shot in the head on his doorstep following a row in north London. The 18-year-old was shot just before 3.30pm on Tuesday on Denmark Road, near Turnpike Lane in Haringey. Paramedics and an air ambulance crew treated him at the scene before he was taken to a central London hospital. A resident living near the scene, who did not want to be named, said she had called police after hearing shots and finding the youth, named locally as Jojo, lying injured in the street. “It was one of the boys who lives on the estate, 18, shot in the head,” she said. “His friend was holding a shirt to his head and he took it away at one point and my friend said put that back. “I know the boy so I was just kind of feeling for him, because he kept going in and out of consciousness … I can’t get the look on his face out of my head, to be honest with you. It was just that kind of shock-horror petrified look in his eyes, so scared.” The teenager was with his brother and a friend when he was shot, the neighbour said. Police and paramedics arrived within minutes and treated him at the scene before taking him away with his mother, in an ambulance, she added. There have been no arrests and the Metropolitan police is appealing for witnesses. The shooter has been described as a man of Mediterranean appearance, with olive skin, aged about 18. He was with another man, who was described as black and also about 18. The two men were thought to have came from the direction of Turnpike Lane tube station. Afterwards, it is thought they escaped on bicycles towards High Street. Detectives from the Trident and area crime command, which deals with gang-related crime and all non-fatal shootings, are investigating whether the incident was linked to an earlier one involving the victim and his brother. Police said that at about 1.30pm on Tuesday the brothers were driving along High Street, near the junction with New River Avenue, when one person in the car noticed a man he knew on a bike. The car stopped and the victim and his brother had a row with the man. DCI Dan Brown, who is leading the investigation for Trident, said: “The man involved in the altercation has been described as having olive skin. The row happened in the street, and I’m sure will have been witnessed by a number of people. “This was a bold attack in broad daylight on the victim’s doorstep and I want to hear from anyone that knows who the suspects are or who may have vital information for us.” Paul Tuffery, 61, who lives down the road from the shooting, said he heard “a couple of cracks” and shouting at about 3.30pm. “There was shouting, it sounded like kids screaming but round here there’s always kids screaming, and next minute helicopters came over, the air ambulance, and police closed off the road and they landed down the bottom,” he said. “They were there for quite some time because they were treating the one that got shot – he was on the ground.” Several neighbours spoke of gangs of youths hanging around the area, smoking cannabis and apparently dealing drugs. Two years ago the area had been affected by another shooting. “Most of the people who come to [hang around in] this area don’t even live here,” one neighbour, who preferred not to give her name, said. “I’ve called the police so many times about them. They smoke weed out there and I called the police so many times because the smoke goes up to my flat and I get lightheaded.” A London ambulance service spokesperson said paramedics were called at 3.35pm. “We sent an ambulance crew, a single responder in a car, an incident response officer and a hazardous area response team to the scene alongside London’s air ambulance,” the spokesperson said. “The first of our medics arrived at the scene in under five minutes. We treated a man at the scene and took him as a priority to a hospital in central London.”"
2016-08-31T17:35:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Man dies after speedboat spotted ‘out of control’ off Welsh coast,"A man has died after fishermen spotted an empty speedboat circling off the coast of west Wales. Lifeboat crews were called to Aberystwyth harbour at 9.40am on Wednesday after the five-metre-long vessel was spotted apparently out of control. Two men were pulled to safety and taken to hospital, but one of them later died. A spokeswoman for the RNLI’s Aberystwyth lifeboat station said: “The lifeboat crew launched the Atlantic-class lifeboat to reports of an empty boat circling in the bay with two persons in the water. The volunteer crew arrived on scene, approximately 500 metres offshore, and quickly pulled the men into the safety of the lifeboat. “The volunteers immediately started first aid treatment on one of the casualties as they made their way back to shore. First aid treatment was continued on dry land by more crew until the Welsh ambulance service teams arrived.” After the men were taken to the town’s Bronglais hospital, lifeboat crew gained control of the speedboat and brought it safely back to the marina."
2016-08-31T17:36:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Artists’ flames mark 350th anniversary of Great Fire of London,"With parks and trees tinder-dry after weeks of sweltering weather, Londoners may be horrified to see flames flickering in the heart of the city this weekend, reflected in the Thames and apparently licking at the dome of St Paul’s – but the flames are the creations of artists, celebrating the 350th anniversary of the most devastating fire in the capital’s history. The flames apparently devouring the cathedral – whose dome designed by Sir Christopher Wren rose above the scorched city after the Great Fire destroyed the medieval original – are projections by the artist Martin Firrell, and will be seen each night from Thursday to Sunday.
The Great Fire began in a baker’s shop in Pudding Lane – the baker fiercely denied any responsibility – in the small hours of 2 September 1666. The London’s Burning festival, commissioned by the arts charity Artichoke, will include an audacious amount of meticulously planned and scrupulously monitored real flames, including a fire garden created by the French company Carabosse that will light up the lawn outside Tate Modern from dusk each evening until Sunday. The most spectacular conflagration will be on Sunday night when a 120ft (37-metre) floating sculpture of a street of 17th-century wooden houses, designed by the US artist David Best and built on to barges by hundreds of schoolchildren and unemployed young people, will be torched.
The fire will be started at 8.30pm on Sunday on the Thames between Blackfriars and Waterloo bridges. Thousands of people are expected to gather to watch from the safety of the South Bank. Helen Marriage, the director of Artichoke, said the festival would not just commemorate the fire but explore contemporary challenges and issues in cities. A six-hour underwater performance piece by the US-based Early Morning Opera will offer a reminder that rising sea levels and flooding are now a greater threat than fire.
“The festival is an artistic response that addresses the impact of the Great Fire of London on the city, its inhabitants and buildings, and how it emerged from the ashes and evolved to the resilient world city it is today,” Marriage said. Daylight events include a giant version of a domino topple on Saturday, with 23,000 breeze blocks tracing the course of the fire through 3.5 miles of the city. Although fire was a common hazard in medieval cities, the Great Fire of 1666 did more damage than any since Boudicca torched the Roman city, and would not be rivalled until the Blitz. After an exceptionally dry spell of weather, it rampaged across the city for three days, leaping between the overhanging eaves of wooden houses. When the wind that had been fanning the flames finally dropped and rain fell, more than 13,000 houses had either been burnt or pulled down as firebreaks, 86 of the city’s 108 churches and scores of the beautiful medieval guildhalls were in ashes or tottering ruins, and up to 80,000 people were homeless. Many of the poor would still be homeless years later.
Only a handful of people are known to have died in the fire – perhaps as few as six, including the unfortunate servant in the bakery who was too frightened to climb from an upstairs window. That toll and the tens of thousands made homeless, and tallies for other historical and contemporary events, will be measured out in grains of rice in an installation in Middle Temple. There will be special programmes on BBC Radio 4, and tours and events at sites including the Museum of London – which has an exhibition on the fire – many City pubs and the Monument, where the actor Simon Callow will read from Dryden’s poem lamenting the disaster. The Monument, designed to stand as tall as the distance between it and the ill-fated bakery, is one of the most visible reminders of how the fire changed the face of the city forever. • London’s burning festival runs from the 30 August to 4 September"
2016-08-31T19:03:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Harlow death exposes left-behind town where residents live in fear,"It was a scene the pizza store worker could not have possibly expected when he turned up to work the busy Saturday shift: the sight of two men out cold in the street, one of whom would later die of his injuries. Moments earlier, Arkadiusz Jóźwik, a Polish national, had allegedly been set upon by a number of youths, suffering head injuries that killed him two days later and left his family and the Essex town’s residents searching for answers. Five 15-year-old boys and a 16-year-old were arrested on suspicion of murder, and one line of enquiry being pursued by police is whether the attack was a hate crime. But the businesses and shoppers on The Stow – the street where Jóźwik was apparently attacked and which is lined with shops including a Bargain Booze off-licence, Cafe Delight and Joe Jennings bookmakers, as well as the Essex Skipper pub and a few boarded-up properties – were not quite so sure.
Some of the teenage boys and girls who gather on the street in groups of over 40 do not discriminate, according to business owners; they will harass and intimidate any passerby, regardless of race and nationality. Not one business owner would speak on the record for fear of repercussions from the gangs they say are besieging the pedestrianised street. The picture portrayed by the residents recalls the “broken Britain” climate of the mid-2000s seized on by David Cameron before he became prime minister. Deaths like that of Garry Newlove, who was kicked to death by youths moments after he had admonished them for vandalising his car, raised fears that the country’s disillusioned youths were descending into moral apathy. Among the workers on The Stow is the manager of TGF Pizza who witnessed the buildup and aftermath of the incident and tended to the unconscious Jóźwik. Jóźwik and two men had been in the store shortly before the attack at 11.35pm on Saturday and ordered an 18” pizza for £9.99. Jóźwik could not speak English, the TGF manager said, and was assisted by one of his companions. The trio took the pizza outside to eat it on a brick wall. The manager returned to the rear of the store to bake pizzas when he suddenly heard a chaotic banging and saw the English-speaking man burst through the door, dragging a teenager with him and shouting for someone to call the police. “I pulled the Polish guy in and pushed the teenager out,” he said. “He was really scared, I was really shocked too. I looked out and could see two men lying in the street.”
The manager called the police and ran over to the two men. He held Jóźwik’s hand. Jóźwik was still and did not react. “His face was fine, no bruising, no bleeding. His clothes were fine too. But there was blood coming from his ear on to the street.” Jóźwik died in hospital on Monday. A 43-year-old man, one of his companions, was discharged from hospital after being treated for suspected hand fractures and bruising to the stomach. The manager said he did not hear any racial slurs or xenophobic names being called out, but he was in the back of the store at the time of the incident. Shopkeepers in The Stow said this was the third similar incident in the past few months, the first involving an attack on an English man and the second against a Polish victim. The revelation that Essex police are considering hate crime as a motive for the attack has not gone unnoticed by the Polish community. During an emotional visit to the scene on Tuesday, Jóźwik’s brother, Radek, said there had been a surge in hatred towards eastern Europeans after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. He had been told his brother was assaulted after he was overheard speaking Polish. Dariusz Mróz, 27, a Polish national who works as a waiter in Harlow, said he was threatened as he walked down The Stow two weeks ago. “I was walking along and these teenage boys kept coming up to me and thrusting their hands towards my face,” he said, making a slapping-like gesture. “I’m scared, especially since the referendum. I came here to work, but I don’t feel safe. I feel safe in my own country so I will try to go back.”
Dariusz Kuzniak, 44, has only lived in Harlow for two days, after moving from Ashford, in Kent. “I am scared,” he said. “We are hardworking, we pay taxes. We are not terrorists, we are not trying to kill people.” A butcher on the street said there was a need for a more regular police presence. He said: “I’ve been here for a year and before today I have seen a police officer once, maybe twice. People are scared by the kids. They can gather in groups of up to 20. The benches are filled. They play music loudly out of Bluetooth speakers. The boys whistle at women as they walk by. It’s intimidating.” Asked why he thought the children hung out in the street, he said: “There is nothing to do. Nothing to do at all.” A customer, who has lived in Harlow for eight years, added: “There is a rundown park and nothing else.” The park, also called The Stow, some 500ft from the shops, has an infants’ playground and a solitary basketball hoop. A Bargain Booze staff member, who is of Sri Lankan origin, said he and his colleagues were constantly battling the boys in the street and received little support from the police. “On one occasion, one of the boys deliberately kicked a football through the open door at the wine bottles, smashing them. We reported them but were told there was nothing that could be done.” He has been subject to racial abuse, from both the boys in the street but also older men in the town. “We once offered CCTV to the police as evidence of racial abuse in the store, but they didn’t take it,” he claimed. “I have been here for 12 years, but it has definitely got worse.” The Rev Thurairajah Samuel, minister at St Andrew’s Methodist church on The Stow, said he believed many children in the area did not continue at school beyond 16. “This incident was a real shocker,” he said. “I don’t believe they intend to do these things. They do not realise that their actions could end in tragedy.” As the day continued, the police car remained in place at one end of The Stow. A dispersal order is to be enforced on Wednesday from 7pm, giving the police the power to order people to leave the area if they believe they are likely to be involved in crime and disorder. Meanwhile, the floral tributes on the bench at the scene build and build, and flowers are now being placed on the floor in front of it. In the middle of the display is a cushion embroidered with the word “love”."
2016-09-01T04:36:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Beijing tells Theresa May not to close door on China amid Hinkley Point tensions,"Beijing has urged Theresa May to make “wise” choices that help write “a new chapter” of UK-China relations when she flies into Hangzhou later this week for the G20 summit amid tensions over the controversial Hinkley Point C nuclear project. The so-called “golden era” of UK-China ties - sealed under her predecessor, David Cameron - has threatened to unravel since May took power in July. Shortly after taking office the British Prime Minister angered Beijing by announcing that approval of the £18bn ($23.5bn) nuclear plant, in which China was to hold a one-third stake, would be delayed, apparently as a result of security concerns over Chinese involvement.
The simmering Hinkley row will be hanging over May’s first trip to China for the two-day gathering of the world’s major economies, which begins on Sunday. In a prominent opinion piece published in the state-run China Daily newspaper on Thursday, ahead of her arrival, China’s ambassador to London urged the Prime Minister to make “wise strategic choices” over Britain’s future relationship with China. Liu Xiaoming made no direct reference to Hinkley but said “a number of steps need to be taken in order to maintain the momentum in the relationship” between London and Beijing. The diplomat said those steps included building “stronger political mutual trust” and increased cooperation. “In today’s world, no country can develop by itself behind closed doors,” Liu argued. Noting that the G20 would see May’s first “face-to-face communication with Chinese leaders”, Beijing’s ambassador added: “I hope both sides will seize this opportunity to forge stronger trust and closer friendship”. Whether the Prime Minister’s first encounter with Chinese President Xi Jinping will prove so friendly remains to be seen. Nick Timothy, May’s influential joint chief of staff, lambasted the “golden” relationship with China last year in an article for Conservative Home website. Timothy argued that Beijing had tried to buy British silence on its human rights abuses “with their gold”. “And [David Cameron’s] government has been only too happy to oblige.” Timothy also questioned the wisdom of allowing Chinese involvement in sensitive sectors such as nuclear power, arguing there was no justification for giving “a hostile state easy access to the country’s critical national infrastructure”. Reports emerged earlier this week that May was considering a proposal to detach the development of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station from an agreement allowing China to build a nuclear reactor in Bradwell, Essex. That decision would be likely to infuriate Beijing which saw the Bradwell plant as a means of showcasing its nuclear technology to the rest of the world. “[The] Chinese would never agree to it,” Paul Dorfman, a former government adviser on nuclear power, told the Times, which reported the proposal on Monday. Dorfman suggested Downing Street’s attempt to separate the projects could in fact be “a strategy to torpedo the whole thing”."
2016-09-01T08:20:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Woman and boy die as car chased by police in South London ploughs into family,"A woman and a boy have died after being hit by a car that was being chased by police and mounted the pavement in Penge, south-east London. Witnesses described the aftermath of the crash on Wednesday afternoon, in which the suspected stolen car hit a group of pedestrians. The woman, believed to be in her late 30s or early 40s, and a 10-year-old boy were declared dead at the scene and three girls were injured. The two people killed were named locally as Rosie Cooper, and her nephew Makayah McDermott.
Police arrested a 23-year-old man on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He remains in custody and police are appealing for witnesses. Venissa Vassell, 18, heard sirens and a car screeching as she walked from a nearby railway station and said she immediately ran to help. She said there were twin girls aged about seven trapped under the car, a black Ford Focus, and about 20 people came to lift the car up to free them.
The girls crawled out, but another girl, aged about 11, who was later taken away by ambulance, was screaming: “I can’t feel my legs.” Vassell said: “I did CPR on this lady. I blew in her mouth. It wasn’t working.” Vassell said the boy who died was fine one moment, but then “by the time I came back to speak to the little girl to say ‘Your brother is all right’, he was passed out.” She said the incident “all happened too quick” and she could not explain what she had seen. A man who lives near the crash site said a black car was being chased by two police BMWs when it tried to turn into Lennard Road.
“He lost control and ploughed into a family that was walking on the pavement down Lennard Road. People were trying to lift a car off a little girl. The police officers that were chasing were distraught,” the man said. “It was a horrific scene on a sunny afternoon in a sleepy place.” Ilya Baxter, 23, watched from a window in his flat as police chased a young white man across the road around the corner from the crashed car. He said: “I heard the cars and saw someone pointing to the police where he went. I knocked on the window and pointed.” He said the man was hiding in the bushes, and police caught him, handcuffed him, and then went to help the injured. Stephanie Page said she was shopping on Penge High Street and saw the car going through a red light shortly before the accident. “Another lady was crossing the road and a car sped down, nearly knocking this lady over. We were quite astonished how fast it was going.” Shortly afterwards, ambulances started arriving, she said. Friends from the area told her that the injured girls were twins. Cordons around the crash site had been removed on Thursday morning, although two police officers remained, allowing mourners to leave floral tributes at the base of a tree nearby. One note left by an unnamed passerby read: “There are some who bring a light so bright to the world that even after they have gone the light remains.” A man and woman left the home of the younger victim’s father at around 8am. A next door neighbour said the 10-year-old was a “lovely boy” but commented no further. Scotland Yard said in a statement on Wednesday: “At approximately 2.05pm on Wednesday 31 August a car was in collision with a number of members of the public in Lennard Road. “The car was being pursued by police at the time of the collision. London ambulance service and London’s air ambulance attended – two people have been pronounced dead at the scene.”
The Independent Police Complaints Commission has been informed and was sending investigators to the crash scene. Scotland Yard’s internal standards department has also been told. A spokeswoman for London ambulance service said: “We sent multiple resources to the scene including three ambulance crews, two incident response officers, an advanced paramedic and London’s air ambulance. “Sadly, a woman and a boy died at the scene. We treated a further three patients, all girls, at the scene for multiple injuries and they were all taken to hospital.” Lennard Road remained closed off on Wednesday evening as police technicians in white boiler suits carried out examinations of the scene where two blue tents had been erected. Residents looked on from outside their homes, breaking the news to neighbours who arrived home from work to Penge East station. “My husband was passing by on a bus and saw the bodies. He’s really shaken up by it,” said one woman. Another said that the occupants of a bus that stopped at the top of the street were among at least 20 people who helped to lift the car and free some of the trapped children. There were 498 crashes involving a pursuit by Metropolitan police officers in London in 2015-16, up from 434 in the previous year. There were 474 such collisions in 2013-14. In England and Wales there were 21 deaths in 20 police-related road traffic incidents in 2015-16, up from 14 the previous year. The IPCC said it was the fourth lowest figure since 2004-05."
2016-09-01T10:26:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan's review of London's fire service is in safe hands,"As London marks the 350th anniversary of its devastating Great Fire, Sadiq Khan has set up a review of the capital’s current fire-fighting capacity, focussing on the impact of cuts to the fire service made under Boris Johnson. In the face of fierce opposition from the fire brigades’ union and non-Conservative politicians, these saw the closure of ten fire stations, the loss of 14 fire engines and the cutting of 552 firefighters’ jobs in order to produce the statutory London safety plan within a reduced budget. That all happened in September 2013, amid assurances from the Tory chairman of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) that Londoners’ safety would not be compromised: after all, there would still be 102 fire stations and 155 fire engines (though a further 13 held in reserve have also since gone), despite the number of fires in the capital having fallen by half over the previous ten years. The brigade would still aim to have an engine at the scene of fires within six minutes and a second one within eight, if required. However, a year or so later Labour AM Fiona Twycross, then vice chair of LFEPA and now Khan’s appointee as it chair, produced figures showing that response times to incidents had increased in more than half of London’s 649 electoral wards, that average response times in 214 of them was in excess of six minutes and that in five of them - three in Newham, two in Southwark - the response times had risen by between two and three minutes since the cuts had taken effect. The London Fire Brigade countered that the London-wide response time remained below six minutes on average and that it was therefore meeting its target. But Khan’s election manifesto declared that response times had become “a danger to the safety of Londoners” and pledged to undertake the “full review” now set in train, saying this would not only consider the fitness of the service for dealing with fires “but also coping with major civil contingencies such as a terrorist attack or a flood”. Khan has made a good choice of leader of the review. Anthony Mayer, these days chairman of the One Housing Group, was the first chief executive of the Greater London Authority, setting up the brand new body and then serving Ken Livingstone throughout his eight years as mayor. Before all that, he’d been the top private secretary to three government ministers in Whitehall, including Michael Heseltine. He knows his onions. Mayer also knows a bit about Johnson. In her fine biography, Just Boris, Sonia Purnell describes him, then overseeing the transition from the Livingstone years prior to retiring, taking Johnson successor out to dinner at Joe Allen’s restaurant. Mayer, who considers Livingstone to have been a fine administrator, felt he needed to have a chat with the new mayor about the utter chaos into which City Hall had descended. This basically entailed pointing out to him that having been elected mayor he had to actually do the job. If anyone is equipped to help Khan put right any avoidable misjudgments in LFEPA under Johnson, it is he."
2016-09-01T11:13:01Z,uk-news,UK news,'Their light remains': tributes to boy and woman killed in south London car chase,"Tributes have been paid to a 10-year-old boy and his aunt who died after being hit by a car as it was chased by police in Penge, south-east London. Makayah McDermott and Rosie Cooper, 34, were part of a group of pedestrians who were hit by the suspected stolen vehicle when it mounted a pavement on Wednesday afternoon. They were both declared dead at the scene. Three girls, two believed to be Makayah’s older sisters and one thought to be Cooper’s daughter, were injured. They received treatment and were discharged from hospital on Thursday, police said. Makayah was reported to be a young actor and had an audition for a part in a television series set in the 1950s last week.
He was described as “an incredible child” by Lisa Pitman, of Virtue TaeKwon-Do, with whom he had trained for several years. Pitman said: “We are in shock and gutted, such an incredible child, we have been teaching him since the age of four. “This is the most tragic freak accident … the family are beautiful incredible caring people. They will be indescribably devastated, just as we are.” On Thursday, a single red rose and a card addressed to “Rose’s family” lay on Cooper’s doorstep. Cordons around the crash site have been removed, although two police officers remained, allowing mourners to leave floral tributes at the base of a tree nearby. One note read: “There are some who bring a light so bright to the world that even after they have gone the light remains.”
Cooper’s neighbour, Jackie Francis, paid tribute to her, saying she often saw her with her nieces and nephews. “We were neighbourly. She was a really nice girl. We would say hello as she came and went,” Francis said. “I just couldn’t believe it when I heard. She was a typical young mother, always with the children, she was very fond of her children. It’s just horrible. They were a close family, undoubtedly close.” On Wednesday, police arrested a 23-year-old man on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He remains in custody and police are appealing for witnesses. Venissa Vassell, 18, heard sirens and a car screeching as she walked from a nearby railway station and said she immediately ran to help. She said there were twin girls trapped under the car, a black Ford Focus, and about 20 people came to lift the car up to free them. The girls crawled out, but another girl, who was later taken away by ambulance, was shouting that she couldn’t feel her legs.
Vassell also said: “I did CPR on this lady. I blew in her mouth. It wasn’t working.” Vassell said Makayah was fine one moment, but “by the time I came back to speak to the little girl to say ‘Your brother is all right’, he was passed out.” She said the incident “all happened too quick” and she could not explain what she had seen. A man who lives near the crash site said a black car was being chased by two police BMWs when it tried to turn into Lennard Road. “He lost control and ploughed into a family that was walking on the pavement down Lennard Road. People were trying to lift a car off a little girl. The police officers that were chasing were distraught,” the man said. “It was a horrific scene on a sunny afternoon in a sleepy place.” The Metropolitan police said postmortem examinations were due to take place on Thursday at Princess Royal university hospital.
In a statement on Thursday, the force added: “LAS treated three other people – all girls – for injuries. The girls, two aged 13 and one aged eight, have received treatment and been discharged from hospital. “All those injured in the collision were related to each other. Of those who died, the woman was the boy’s aunt. “The driver of the car, a 23-year-old man, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and theft of a motor vehicle – he remains in custody at a south London police station. “At this stage of the investigation it is believed he was the sole occupant of the vehicle. “Inquiries into the collision continue by officers from the roads and transport policing command. Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.” The Directorate of Professional Standards has been informed of the incident, as has the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which will investigate the incident independently."
2016-09-01T11:57:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Oliver Dearlove: man arrested on suspicion of London banker's murder,"Detectives investigating the death of London banker Oliver Dearlove have arrested a man on suspicion of murder. Dearlove, who worked as a relationship manager for the private bank Duncan Lawrie, and had previously worked for Coutts and Barclays, had been out in the Blackheath area of south London with former university friends last weekend when he was reportedly punched by an unknown assailant. A postmortem held at Greenwich mortuary on Monday gave the provisional cause of death as intracranial haemorrhage – or bleeding on the brain. A 31-year-old man was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of the 30-year-old’s murder and on suspicion of ABH after he attended a south London police station by appointment, Scotland Yard said. He remains in police custody. Dearlove, who lived with his girlfriend in Eltham, was a keen football fan and played as a forward for his local team Lord Hood FC. He was set to go on holiday with friends to Las Vegas for a collective 30th birthday celebration. His mother, Joy Wright, from Chislehurst, south-east London, told the Guardian her “perfect” son had “so much more life to live”. “He was very easygoing, lots and lots of friends, played lots of football,” she said. “He studied hard at school. He worked for a private bank in Belgravia. He had been travelling for a year. He did what most nice people do.” Claire Wheatley, Dearlove’s girlfriend of nearly four years, said they had recently discussed having a baby together. “We were trying to get some money together so we could buy a house together,” she said. “We had big plans. We were planning on having a baby as well. He was the kindest person. He was the most amazing person I’ve ever met and ever known. I’m so lucky to have known him.” Standup comedian and Mock the Week panellist Rob Beckett said on Twitter that Dearlove was his childhood best friend and appealed for anyone with information to come forward.
Metropolitan police were called at around 12.45am on Sunday morning to reports of a man assaulted in Tranquil Vale, near Blackheath station. Dearlove, who studied business management at Portsmouth university, and his friends had left a bar and walked down Montpelier Vale, turning right into Tranquil Vale, where they were waiting for a pre-booked taxi. Dearlove was taken to an east London hospital where he died at 10.22pm on Sunday night. DCI Lee Watling, who is leading the investigation, said: “Our investigation is continuing and we’ve made huge progress in identifying key witnesses and recovering vital CCTV.”"
2016-09-01T12:25:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Man arrested over shooting of teenager in north London,"Police investigating the shooting of a teenager on his doorstep in north London have arrested a 20-year-old man on suspicion of attempted murder. The suspect was arrested in the early hours of Thursday and is being held in a north London police station. The arrest came less than 48 hours after the 18-year-old victim was shot outside his home on Denmark Road, near Turnpike Lane, just before 3.30pm on Tuesday. He remains in hospital in a critical condition after paramedics and an air ambulance crew fought to save his life. Detectives from the Metropolitan police’s Trident area crime command, which investigates gang crime and non-fatal shootings, have appealed for witnesses. They are also investigating whether the shooting is linked to a row that the victim and his brother had with a man on a bike about two hours earlier on nearby High Street. DCI Dan Brown, who is leading the investigation, said: “The row happened in the street, and I’m sure will have been witnessed by a number of people. If you were out in High Street and saw anything that may help then please pass that information to us. “This was a bold attack in broad daylight on the victim’s doorstep and I want to hear from anyone that knows who the suspects are or who may have vital information for us.”"
2016-09-01T13:39:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Brexit secretary: no return to 'hard' border in Ireland,"David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has promised there will be no return to any “hard” border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic when the UK leaves the European Union. On a visit to Belfast on Thursday, Davis vowed there will be “no return to the past” in terms of armed checkpoints and border checks along the UK’s only land frontier with an EU state. The secretary of state for exiting the European Union met Northern Ireland’s first minister, Arlene Foster, at Stormont. The Democratic Unionist party later described the meeting with Davis as “useful.” Davis was due to meet the Sinn Féin finance minister, Máirtín Ó’Muilleoir, later. Sinn Féin campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU during the referendum. Both Sinn Féin and their nationalist rivals in the Social Democratic and Labour party have said they do not want to be “dragged out of the EU” on the basis of the way the English electorate voted. Writing in the Belfast Telegraph, Davis made his vow about not returning to the past in terms of armed checkpoints and border checks. He wrote: “We had a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland many years before either country was a member of the European Union. “We are clear we do not want a hard border – no return to the past – and no unnecessary barriers to trade. What we will do is deliver a practical solution that will work in everyone’s interests, and I look forward to opening the conversation about how that should operate with my colleagues today.” The minister also tried to address fears in Northern Ireland about the economic impact of losing EU subsidies once the UK triggers article 50 and leaves Europe. There is particular concern in the region’s agricultural community about Brexit given that £8.50 of every £10 of Ulster farming income comes from the EU single farm payment. “Agriculture is a vital part of the Northern Ireland economy, and the government will match the current level of annual payments that the sector receives through the direct payment scheme until 2020, providing certainty,” Davis said. Denying Brexit would damage UK-Irish relations, Davis said: “We are already working with the Irish government and I firmly believe this process will take our relationship forwards not backwards.” Brexit would also not change the government’s policies on Northern Ireland and its continued support for the power-sharing settlement in the region, Davis said. “The result of the referendum does not change the government’s priorities. Along with all political parties in Northern Ireland and the Irish government, we will continue to work for peace, stability and prosperity for Northern Ireland. As the government’s manifesto set out last year, we are committed to a brighter, more secure future for the people who live here.”"
2016-09-01T13:52:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Ex-Guardian journalist still pursuing damages after 2010 police crash,"The family of 10-year-old Makayah McDermott and his aunt, Rosie Cooper, who were killed in a car crash involving a vehicle being chased by police, have paid tribute to their “incredibly caring” nature. It may be a long time before the full circumstances surrounding the deaths are known, but it could be even longer before they are considered for compensation for the tragedy.
The former Guardian journalist Donald MacLeod is still pursuing damages more than six years after being hit by a patrol car answering an emergency call in north London. MacLeod was cycling home in March 2010, wearing a helmet, high-visibility jacket and with his bike lights on when he was hit from behind by the police vehicle, which was carrying four officers responding to reports of a shooting in Hackney. The collision left him with brain injuries. MacLeod, 66, was in a coma for weeks. He still requires 24-hour care and has to use a wheelchair. He has regained a limited amount of speech. The Metropolitan police disputed liability for the collision, denying that the police driver had been negligent. The force initially lost in the high court but insisted on taking the case to the court of appeal. It was common ground, the appeal court said, that the police car was travelling at 55mph approaching the mini-roundabout at which the accident happened. Lawyers for the Metropolitan police disagreed on the direction in which MacLeod was travelling, saying he could have been entering the roundabout from a different road to the car, which had blue lights flashing and siren on. The court of appeal, however, dismissed the force’s claim that there had been a head-on crash between MacLeod and the police car. Having established liability, MacLeod’s family have still to reach agreement on the level of compensation. A further hearing to settle the case is not due until next June. MacLeod, who has three children, was an education journalist at the Guardian before becoming head of communications at the Russell Group of universities. The family have since moved to Scotland. His wife, Barbara, said: “He continues to make progress but it is achingly slow. There are still small gains. Physically he’s getting stronger. “His speech is very limited. Only now we are able to speak it’s become apparent how great the damage was. He has no short-term memory so we have to live in the present. Mercifully, his sense of humour is still intact. “The police finally gave in on liability but now we are putting together the claim. A series of experts have come to assess Donald and his future needs. By the time it reaches court next June it will be more than seven years since the accident.”"
2016-09-01T14:21:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Number of children in workless households hits record low,"The number of children living in UK households where no adult is working has fallen to its lowest level since recent records began two decades ago, according to official data. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that 11% of British children lived in a workless household in 2016 – a fall of 0.8 percentage points on the previous year. The latest drop continues a prolonged trend, with the percentage of children in workless households at its peak of 20% when modern records began in early 1996. ONS figures show that the improvements under Labour governments after 1997 came to a halt during the deep recession of 2008-09 but then resumed under the coalition headed by David Cameron from 2010 onwards.
The ONS said the number of children living in households where all members had never worked decreased by 18,000 to 193,000, or 1.6% of all children, the lowest number and percentage since April to June 1998. Children in lone parent families were more likely to be living in workless households (37.2%) than those in households with couples (4.3%) or other households (9.2%), the ONS said. However, it added that the percentage had decreased by 1.2 points between 2015 and 2016 to reach a new low. When the current records began in 1996, the percentage of children in lone parent families living in workless households stood at 58.6%. “The broad picture since 1996 is one of an overall increase in the share of working households and a declining share of workless households,” the ONS said."
2016-09-01T15:28:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May urged to end 'confusion' over northern powerhouse,"Theresa May has been urged to end a “summer of speculation and confusion” about the future of the northern powerhouse project. Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram, Labour’s mayoral candidates for Greater Manchester and Liverpool city region respectively, have written to the prime minister asking her to clarify her plans for further devolution in England and to make a clear commitment to the HS3 scheme to link the cities of the north. “Prime minister, you must honour your promises to the north of England,” said Burnham, shadow home secretary. “Last year at the general election you couldn’t move for Tory candidates wandering around these parts promising people the earth, and we are just over a year away from that and it seems they have changed their tune.” In early August, the Times reported [paywall] that May intended to “shift the focus to other rural and industrial areas” away from the north of England. It also reported that she was planning to impose greater cost controls on HS2 and could curtail HS3. Later that month, May wrote in the Yorkshire Post reaffirming her commitment to the former chancellor George Osborne’s northern powerhouse project and the plans for an east-to-west high speed rail route. The new minister for the northern powerhouse, Andrew Percy, has also said he is “100% committed” to promoting the region’s economy. “We’ve had newspaper briefing after newspaper briefing over the summer saying that the plug is about to be pulled on the northern powerhouse concept,” said Burnham. “I say to the prime minister that if you pull the plug on the northern powerhouse concept it will be as big a betrayal to the people of the north of England … as it was here in the 1980s when Margaret Thatcher pulled the plug on our industry.” Rotheram, the MP for Liverpool Walton, said: “The doubt and confusion was created in Downing Street, so it’s for the prime minister to provide some clarity and clarification of what it is she actually thinks should now happen with both high speed rail and the northern powerhouse.” He said that in the world of Westminster politics, rumours often had substance to them. “The government can close these things down very, very quickly, as it has done just recently on certain issues,” he said. “Theresa May can make that statement. It is in her gift to put to bed that speculation.” The creation of elected mayors is the most controversial condition of a series of devolution arrangements agreed by Osborne and a series of “metro” regions, including the West Midlands, Greater Manchester and the Liverpool city region. The regions will elect mayors in May 2017."
2016-09-01T16:35:27Z,uk-news,UK news,"Scotland welcomes 1,000th Syrian refugee","Scotland has welcomed its 1,000th Syrian refugee, almost exactly a year after the image of three-year-old Alan Kurdi’s drowned corpse washed up on a Turkish beach galvanised the global response to the humanitarian crisis. The milestone, which was reached after 120 refugees arrived in Scotland in the past week, means that Scotland has taken about a third of the total number of Syrian refugees who have come to the UK since last October. The government committed last September to resettle 20,000 people from refugee camps on the Syrian border in the next five years, while the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said at the time that Scotland should accept 1,000 refugees “as a starting point for a meaningful discussion”. The Scottish government’s equalities secretary, Angela Constance, described the milestone as significant, saying: “It is a great credit that 29 out of 32 local authorities in Scotland have now taken Syrian refugees, in marked contrast to what is happened south of the border.” Figures released by the Home Office in May exposed a wide disparity in the acceptance rates of councils across Britain. Scotland welcomed more Syrian refugees than any other part of the UK under the official resettlement scheme, accepting more than 600 people, compared with just 33 who were taken in by London local authorities, and none by Greater Manchester.
Asked whether the Scottish government would be setting further limits on numbers, Constance said: “It’s difficult to put a limit on what is our moral duty when responding to a humanitarian crisis. Given that refugee and asylum matters remain reserved, what we have always said is that we stand ready to take our fair and proportionate share.” Constance added: “It’s important that we remember the refugee crisis is not over. I am particularly concerned about unaccompanied children, and we will continue to urge the UK government to accept more refugees.”
The minister marked the milestone with a visit to The Welcoming, a drop-in project in Edinburgh that provides English language lessons to refugees, as well as assistance with CV writing and form-filling, and a “Scotland for Newcomers” course, which explains issues from Brexit to independence, to people of about 60 different nationalities each year. The director, Jon Busby, explained that members of the established Syrian community in Edinburgh had volunteered to help with particular cultural and social needs of those who had arrived in the city since the winter. “What we learned is that they need lots of support and security, and routine, having come from the camps in Lebanon,” said Busby. Kawthor Saloom, 48, who was taking an English lesson based on transport safety, arrived in Edinburgh with her three daughters from Homs, via Lebanon, last December. “People were so welcoming at the airport, but for the first few weeks it was difficult trying to understand the different systems,” she said. Perhaps inevitably, having arrived in Scotland mid-winter, one of her first impressions was of the dreadful weather. “At the very beginning, it was raining and foggy all the time, but then it got better.” She said that the language barrier had been her greatest obstacle so far, but that she has started to build friendships with local people at her daughters’ school. “One English teacher offered to come to the house to help me.” UK-wide figures on refugee resettlement released by the Home Office last week show that, between the start of October 2015 and the end of June 2016, 2,646 people have been resettled under the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme across 118 different local authorities, including 862 in Scotland and 1,784 across the rest of the UK."

2016-09-01T17:26:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Met confirms it has reviewed vehicle pursuit policy,"Scotland Yard had been reviewing its vehicle pursuit policy before the deaths this week of a child and his aunt hit by a car that was being chased by police, it has emerged. Makayah McDermott, 10, and Rosie Cooper, 34, were declared dead after being knocked down by a suspected stolen vehicle as the driver mounted a pavement in Penge, south-east London, on Wednesday afternoon.
The Metropolitan police pursuit policy was placed under review following an inquest into the death of Henry Hicks, a teenager who died when his moped crashed as he was chased by police in unmarked cars. In England and Wales there were 21 fatalities in 20 police-related road traffic incidents from 2015 to 2016, up from 14 the previous year. However, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said that was the fourth lowest figure since 2004-05. Within these figures, 13 deaths were pursuit-related in 2015-16, compared to seven the previous year. The Met’s directorate of professional standards has been informed of the incident on Wednesday, as has the IPCC, which will investigate independently. On Thursday the Met confirmed to the Guardian that its review of its vehicle pursuit policy had concluded but did not reveal its findings.
Henry Hicks, an 18-year-old carpenter from Islington, died on 19 December 2014 when he lost control of his vehicle in Wheelwright Street, north London, following a high-speed chase. In June, an inquest jury rejected the police claim that the teenager was not aware he was being pursued, and concluded he had died trying to get away from officers in unmarked cars. After the inquest, Catherine Roper, chief superintendent and the borough commander for Islington, said the verdict had prompted a further review of pursuit policy. “Our pursuit policy, which is based on national guidance, is kept under constant review. In light of today’s narrative delivered by the jury and any recommendations made by the coroner in her report, and the IPCC, we will once again review that policy,” she said. Tributes were paid to Makayah and Cooper on Thursday, as three girls, two believed to be Makayah’s older sisters and one thought to be Cooper’s daughter, were treated in hospital for injuries that were reported as being not life threatening. Makayah and his two siblings attended the Pop School and Stage Academy in Beckenham. Makayah starred in a Wizard of Oz spin-off called The Wiz last month, with his two sisters also taking part. He had reportedly auditioned last week for a part in a television series set in the 1950s. Makayah’s agent, Sam Brown, managing director of Brown and Mills Entertainment, said she had signed him up in June. She described his family as “a very, very talented bunch”, adding: “He was a real bright character, ever so outgoing, and he just picked up scripts and could just go with it, you know, a natural talent. It’s a hard industry but I really believed in him.”
Brown said Makayah had charisma and took everything in his stride. “Very happy, very smiley, helpful. He was a good lad.” She said he had been going to castings. “We’re all in shock.” He was described as “an incredible child” by Lisa Pitman, of Virtue TaeKwon-Do (a martial arts school), with whom he had trained for several years. Pitman said: “We are in shock and gutted, such an incredible child, we have been teaching him since the age of four. This is the most tragic freak accident … the family are beautiful, incredible caring, people. They will be indescribably devastated, just as we are.” On Thursday roses and a card addressed to “Rosie’s family” lay on Cooper’s doorstep in Beckenham. Her neighbour, Jackie Francis, paid tribute to Cooper, a hairdresser, saying she often saw her with her nieces and nephews. “We were neighbourly. She was a really nice girl. We would say hello as she came and went. I just couldn’t believe it when I heard. She was a typical young mother, always with the children, she was very fond of her children. It’s just horrible. They were a close family, undoubtedly close.” Cordons around the crash site were removed, although police officers remained yesterday, allowing mourners to leave floral tributes at the base of a tree nearby.

2016-09-01T18:16:26Z,uk-news,UK news,G20: China expected to press Theresa May on Hinkley nuclear plant,"Theresa May is expected to come under pressure from China at the G20 summit over her decision to review the proposed Hinkley nuclear plant, after the issue was raised by Beijing in a meeting with the British energy minister. The new British prime minister will have her first face-to-face meeting with Xi Jinping, the Chinese premier, at the summit on Sunday or Monday, amid continuing tensions over Hinkley Point in Somerset. May angered Beijing by deciding in July that approval of the French- and Chinese-backed £18bn nuclear plant would be delayed, apparently as a result of security concerns over Chinese involvement. The Chinese government has been publicly making its clear it wants the project to go ahead, but May and her ministers have stuck to the position that the government is “considering all the component parts of the project before making its decision in the early autumn”. It is understood Chinese officials raised the issue of Hinkley last week when Baroness Lucy Neville-Rolfe, the new energy and intellectual property minister, made a low-profile trip to China. The Chinese National Energy Administration said on its website that Neville-Rolfe met one of its top officials in Beijing to discuss Hinkley Point.
However, British government sources insisted that Neville-Rolfe had only made the trip to China to discuss intellectual property and would have rebuffed attempts to discuss the issue. With three days to go before the summit in Hangzhou, the Chinese ambassador to London also urged May to make “wise” choices that help write “a new chapter” of UK-China relations. In a comment piece for the state-run China Daily, Liu Xiaoming wrote: “In times of change, wise strategic choices and strong, far-sighted leadership are needed more than anything. “China always takes a strategic and long-term perspective toward its relationship with the UK. I hope the UK will do the same and our two countries will join hands to write a new chapter for China-UK relations.” He also urged Britain to “continue to be pragmatic and stay open to Chinese businesses” after the Brexit vote. Liu made no direct reference to Hinkley, but said “a number of steps need to be taken in order to maintain the momentum in the relationship” between London and Beijing. However, anti-nuclear groups urged the prime minister to stand firm against Chinese and French lobbying for the Hinkley Point power station to go ahead. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said May had a “delicate diplomatic job awaiting her at the G20, and she will no doubt come under renewed pressure to give Hinkley the go-ahead.” “But the prime minister has shown before that she won’t be bullied into signing up to a deal that doesn’t serve the interests of the British public,” he added. “This is a hugely controversial deal that will see families in the UK paying through the nose for a nuclear power station that, to date, despite three attempts, doesn’t yet work. Compared with alternative energy sources, such as offshore wind and solar, backed up by interconnectors and battery storage, Theresa May should see better ways to keep the lights on, prices fair and carbon emissions down.” The so-called “golden era” of UK-China ties – sealed under May’s predecessor, David Cameron – has threatened to unravel since she took power in July. A decision is expected in the autumn following speculation the prime minister is concerned about the involvement of Chinese state-owned CGN in the project and any further agreement for China to build reactors in Bradwell, Essex. Ahead of the summit, May said she would tell world leaders in Hangzhou that Britain was “open for business”. “This country has always been one of the greatest trading nations, and as we leave the European Union we will have the opportunity to embrace new markets and opportunities as we export British innovation and expertise to the world,” she said. “I am determined to make the most of the opportunities Brexit presents – delivering the change that people want and striking the right deal for British businesses at home and abroad.”"
2016-09-01T23:01:24Z,uk-news,UK news,Home secretary urged to act over refugee children stuck in Calais,"The home secretary has been urged to take immediate action over the 387 refugee children in Calais who have a right to come to Britain. The list of eligible children who are stuck in the camps in Calais has been drawn up by Citizens UK and given to Amber Rudd, and the demand for immediate action endorsed by Alf Dubs – the Labour peer and long-time refugee campaigner. It comes as a group of more than 100 faith leaders, council chiefs and celebrities, including Juliet Stevenson and Vanessa Redgrave, prepare to gather outside the Home Office on Friday at a memorial event marking the anniversary of the death of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy whose body was washed up on a beach in Turkey. The plea for urgent action on child refugees in Calais also comes as a freedom of information request has revealed that the government spent more than £100,000 earlier this year in legal fees to make it harder to reunite refugees in Calais with their families in Britain. The list of 387 refugee children eligible to come to Britain is made up of the names of 178 children who have a right to come to the UK because of their close family links in the country and a further 209 children who qualify under the terms of the “Dubs” amendment accepted by the government in March earlier this year. Lord Dubs said: “I am deeply saddened that despite repeated calls from me and others the government still seems to be dragging its feet on the commitments made when the amendment in my name was accepted. “Now that the new government has had some weeks to settle in after the EU referendum vote there really is no excuse for any further delay. Theresa May and Amber Rudd should be taking immediate action.” Citizens UK says that to date the only children transferred from France to Britain have been those with family in the UK, largely involving those supported by its Safe Passage partnership: “This process takes months and at the present rate it will take over a year to help the 178 children identified,” said a Citizens UK statement. “To date not one child has been transferred from France to Britain under the wider provisions of the Dubs amendment.” A Home Office spokesperson said that more than 30 under-18s have been accepted for transfer within Europe since the Immigration Act 2016, which includes the Dubs amendment, reached the statute book in May and the majority had already arrived. A total of 120 unaccompanied children had been “accepted for transfer” under the Dublin III regulations since the start of the year.
“Our priority is to protect the best interests of children who are in need of our help. Last year there were over 3,000 claims for asylum in the UK by unaccompanied children, in addition to those who were already being cared for in the UK,” said the Home Office spokesperson. “While these children have made it to the UK, they still need support and we still need local authorities to agree to care for them.” They added that they were in talks with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, other partner organisations and the Italian, Greek and French governments to speed up mechanisms to identify, assess and transfer unaccompanied refugee children to Britain. “We continue to work closely with the French government to ensure that children in Calais with family links in the UK are identified, receive sufficient support and can access the Dublin family reunification process without delay,” he added. But actor and campaigner Stevenson said the government had not shown the generosity to refugees it should. She said: “On this painful anniversary, when we remember a tiny Syrian boy lying drowned on a Turkish beach, a death which shook the world, it would be appropriate for the prime minister and home secretary to act to help stranded refugee children. We are only talking about fewer than 400 children. How can it be argued that Britain cannot cope in providing new homes for these children?” Bishop Peter Hill, the Bishop of Barking, who visited Calais last week, added: “I appeal to ministers to look into their hearts and take immediate action to bring these children to safety. It has been established that the UK has a legal obligation to these children, but more to the point, this country has a moral obligation.” The government legal department’s FoI response showed that more than £65,000 was spent on barristers’ fees and a further £39,000 on “internal costs” in successfully challenging an immigration tribunal ruling earlier this year that three Syrian teenagers and a 26-year-old man should immediately be brought to Britain and reunited with their families. But the information commissioner has had to step in and demand that the Home Office responds within 35 days to an FoI request asking for details of how many refugees have been transferred to the UK under the Dublin arrangements for family reunion in the past 12 months. Labour MPs will also press the home secretary on Monday for faster progress on child refugees and are expected to publish further legislation that would try to secure the removal of the children from the Calais camps before Christmas."
2016-09-02T07:09:18Z,uk-news,UK news,France vows to dismantle 'Jungle' refugee camp in Calais,"France is to gradually dismantle the “Jungle” refugee camp in Calais, the interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, has vowed. Cazeneuve told the regional newspaper the Nord Littoral he would press ahead with the closure of the camp “with the greatest determination”, dismantling the site in stages, clearing the former wasteland where record numbers of refugees and migrants are sleeping rough in dire sanitary conditions as many hope to reach Britain. He said France would create accommodation for thousands elsewhere in the country “to unblock Calais”. French authorities have made repeated efforts to shut down the camp, which the state was responsible for creating in April 2015 when authorities evicted migrants and refugees from squats and outdoor camps across the Calais area and concentrated them into one patch of wasteland without shelter. Less than six months ago, the authorities demolished a large area of the southern part of the camp, saying the aim was to radically reduce numbers. But this month the number of people in the camp reached an all-time high of almost 10,000 people, aid organisations estimate. The French authorities put the official number of people in the camp at almost 7,000. Authorities have said over the past year more than 5,000 asylum seekers have left the northern French town for 161 special centres set up around France. Cazeneuve said places for another 8,000 asylum seekers would be created this year and thousands more in 2017, saying efforts would be focused on getting peole in Calais to leave voluntarily. Currently a record 1,900 French police are operating in Calais, and Cazeneuve said another 200 would be added to their ranks “to reinforce the battle” against migrants smuggling themselves on to lorries bound for Britain. Daniel Barney, of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which opened a health centre in the camp, warned last week that the French and UK governments were turning a blind eye to the growing problems. He said the French authorities’ decision to demolish the southern part of the camp in March had made the situation worse. “Half the camp was dismantled. So now we have double the population living in half as much land, with access to the same amount of water points and toilets. There is an extreme problem of overcrowding. Conditions in the camp are getting progressively worse.” With overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, food shortages and a rise in the number of violent attacks on lorry drivers heading to the UK, there is growing tension in Calais and politicians from all parties are seizing on the seemingly intractable problem of how to deal with refugees and migrants trapped in France hoping to reach England. In the run-up to the French presidential election next year, the French right and far-right have increased their calls for hardline action on Calais. Cazeneuve will visit Calais on Friday afternoon, as French lorry drivers, shopkeepers and farmers plan to stage a blockade of the port on Monday to demand the camp is demolished. The Socialist president, François Hollande, who has until now avoided visiting Calais, is to visit the city later this month."
2016-09-02T10:42:41Z,uk-news,UK news,'The service is completely useless': commuters react to Southern rail profit hike - as it happened,"So, what did I learn this morning, apart from that it is quite difficult to get up at 4.30am and avoid waking up the rest of the household? 1) It was one of the easiest possible days I could have done this story. With schools back imminently, and this being the Friday after a bank holiday, it was nowhere near as busy as a typical commuter day. Alas, it was the day that Go-Ahead Group announced their results, so that rather dictated the timing of it. 2) The Southern employees I spoke to all seemed to genuinely care about the quality of the service, and the safety of the services they operate. They feel they have been misrepresented by management and the press, and their anger over that was palpable. One of them also said it was the same way that junior doctors were being treated, as if they were the problem, rather than being the people trying to take action to force the people in charge to fix problems. 3) Having said that, there were several people I spoke to who really couldn’t care less about how much profit the company was making - they were absolutely exasperated with the staff and the unions. 4) It’s a lot harder to talk to people on commuter trains than it was on the night tube - where people were up for a party - or on a long distance mid-morning train, where you can spot people idly sitting there looking wistfully out of the window and pounce on them. On commuter trains the focus was much more headphones on, face buried in smartphone screen. I got some odd looks from people for daring to try to start a conversation. And I have made my boss promise me I won’t get sent onto another train for at least a fortnight. 5) British people REALLY like talking about trains on social media and in the comments on articles. Although I sort of knew that already. I do enjoy going out on these type of live blogs - the rather random nature of who you run into and who you get to interview is great, and obviously, if you want to speak to railway users and railway staff, then on a train is clearly the best way to bump into them. Thanks for all your comments and contributions, both here in the thread, and via GuardianWitness and our call-out yesterday. I’m going to press the off-switch on the live blog in a minute, but I’d very much welcome you continuing to debate the state of the UK’s rail services below the line. Cheerio."
2016-09-02T10:48:37Z,uk-news,UK news,"Jail staff lacked compassion for prisoner who took his life, inquest finds","An inquest jury has said a prisoner who took his own life was not shown enough compassion by staff at the jail. The jury at Suffolk coroner’s court found that David Smith, 38, killed himself at Highpoint prison in Newmarket, Suffolk, in May 2014. He was serving three and a half years for drug offences. The jury heard that Smith was transferred from Chelmsford prison to Highpoint on 23 May 2014. On arrival, he asked to speak to a listener – prisoners trained by the Samaritans – but none were available. He asked to call the Samaritans helpline, but the phone in the induction unit was missing. Smith attempted to hang himself that evening and died in hospital the following day. He had a history of depression and self-harm. His was the third of four self-inflicted deaths at Highpoint in 18 months.
The jury was told that staff failed to activate the prison’s emergency code system, which would have triggered an automatic call for an ambulance. The driver of the ambulance that eventually responded said it took him 12 minutes to reach the cell after he arrived at the prison. He said the prison officer who guided him “ambled along” in front of his vehicle. The jury found Highpoint’s failings included: lack of compassion for prisoners, lack of training of officers, insufficient staff on duty, failure to check logbooks, failure to earlier open a suicide and self-harm procedure and then implement that procedure. Smith’s parents, Julie and Tony, said their son should still be alive: “David was calling for help, but no one helped him. If they had done their jobs properly he would still be here today.” Deborah Coles, director of Inquest, said the jury’s findings encapsulated the crisis within the prison system. “HMP Highpoint is not learning from its own failures, or improving the care and support provided to prisoners. The failures identified by this inquest must be responded to by the prisons minister, Sam Gyimah,” she said. Sara Lomri, of Bindmans solicitors, who represented the family, said this was the third of four linked inquests arising from the deaths of four young men at Highpoint. “It is vital that lessons are learned by the management of the prison and steps taken to ensure that the failings identified, by this and the other three inquests, are comprehensively addressed to ensure further deaths are avoided,” she said. A Prison Service spokesperson said: “Our sympathies are with David Smith’s family and friends. We have already taken action and accepted all the recommendations following the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman’s investigation. We will now carefully consider the inquest findings to help ensure such incidents are not repeated. “Safety in prisons is fundamental to the proper functioning of our justice system and a vital part of our reform plans.” • In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Hotlines in other countries can be found here."

2016-09-02T12:15:12Z,uk-news,UK news,"Girl, 12, raped in south Manchester park","A 12-year-old girl has been raped in a park in south Manchester, police have said. Greater Manchester police were called to Crowcroft park in the Levenshulme area in the south-east of the city, shortly before 11.30pm on Thursday. On arrival, officers found the girl who had been subjected to a serious sex attack. The park remained cordoned off, with officers still at the scene, until late on Friday afternoon. Two forensic tents could be seen in the park and a small team of crime scene investigators arrived at about 11.30am to search the area for evidence. A police spokeswoman said an investigation has been launched. Officers were still speaking to the victim on Friday afternoon. The park, off the city’s Stockport Road, borders Crowcroft park primary school and the Longsight cricket club. It has a children’s playground and a multi-use games area which is shared by the neighbouring school.
A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester police said they had initially been called to the park following reports of concern for a teenage girl. “On arrival, officers discovered that a 12-year-old girl had been raped,” she said on Friday. DI Ian Cottrell, of the force’s serious sexual offences unit, said people would understandably be concerned and added that police had increased patrols in the area. “We are offering the victim specialist support at what is a very difficult time,” he said. “If you have any concerns at all or want to speak to someone to pass on information or report a sexual assault, you can contact police on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.” Luthfur Rahman, a Labour councillor in the area, said the park was usually safe and popular with families. “It’s a very busy park and a very well used park, next to a school, and there are quite a lot of people there all the time,” he said. “Our thoughts are with this young girl and her family and I would urge anyone with any information about this crime to contact the police urgently.” Residents of East Road, the houses of which overlook the park, expressed horror at the attack and many said they tended to avoid walking through the park. Petr Crhak, working at a plumbing and heating supplier facing the park’s entrance, said he had known a lot of crime to go on in the park in the two years he had been living in the area. “I wouldn’t walk through there late at night,” he said. Cathy, who declined to give her surname , said the area was usually quiet and safe, but that she would always avoid the park after dark. Another local resident, who asked to remain anonymous, said he had always lived in the surrounding area. “The area used to be posh, but as you can see it’s gone to seed,” he said. “I used to walk through the park when I was a little boy, but I wouldn’t dream of it now.”"
2016-09-02T12:49:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Great Fire of London website to mark 350th anniversary,"The Museum of London has launched a Great Fire of London website to mark the 350th anniversary of the blaze, tracking the course of the fire that broke out in the small hours of 2 September 1666, and over four days tore the heart out of the medieval city.
The site is intended as a permanent resource for information on the fire, and brings together interactive maps as well as images and information from 11 partners, including the museum’s own collections, the Guildhall art gallery and the London Metropolitan Archives.
It includes key objects bearing witness to the intensity of the blaze, such as melted window glass found by archaeologists on a site only a few yards from where the fire started, in a bakery on Pudding Lane. A handful of people, perhaps as few as six, died in the fire, but the site reminds users of earlier disasters, including a devastating fire in Southwark in 1212 in which about 3,000 people are said to have burned to death or drowned by jumping into the Thames, after London Bridge caught fire and cut off their escape route.
Exhibitions and events marking the anniversary include a weekend of public art installations for the London’s Burning festival created by the arts charity Artichoke which will culminate in a 120-metre-long burning sculpture of 17th-century London on the Thames on Sunday night, and a major exhibition that continues at the Museum of London.
One of the most unusual exhibitions is at the Royal College of Physicians, showcasing recipes and remedies for burns and scalds used at the time of the fire.
The remedies incorporated ingredients including horse manure – from animals raised “at grasse” only, the prescription stressed – onions, chicken droppings, and a mixture of boiled mutton fat and butter. The physicians are now based in a modernist 1960s building in Regent’s Park, designed by Sir Denys Lasdun, but in 1666 had to be rehoused in a new building designed by Robert Hooke after their medieval headquarters in the shadow of St Paul’s Cathedral was burned to the ground. Some of their silver, books and paintings that were rescued, many scarred and scorched, will also be on display."
2016-09-02T15:46:39Z,uk-news,UK news,"A digital dilemma for Corbyn, and business as usual again for the Tories","Monday “My leadership campaign is leading the way in harnessing the advances of new technology to organise political campaigning like we’ve never seen before,” said Jeremy Corbyn at the launch of Labour’s digital democracy manifesto in east London. Judging by the IT skills on show at the event, the Labour leader’s own staff could do with a remedial class themselves. First, the Facebook live feed failed, meaning that no one got to see the event who wasn’t actually there. Nor did things improve much afterward, as no copy of the manifesto was available online. All that could be found on Corbyn’s own Facebook page was an advert trailing the event that had already happened. Worse still, the Facebook page advised users to go to www.jeremycorbyn.com/JeremyCorbynMP. Anyone who followed these instructions would have got through to a page owned by HugeDomains.com offering to sell you the web address www.jeremycorbyn.com for either a one-off payment of $2,615 or 12 monthly payments of $218. Truly leading the way in harnessing the advances of new technology.
Tuesday Having recently agreed to be both shadow leader of the Commons and shadow secretary of state for Wales – presumably Corbyn couldn’t find another Labour MP willing to do one of the two jobs – Paul Flynn is finding he has less free time on his hands than he would like. That’s why he wants to scrap the current tedious system obliging MPs to keep receipts for expenses and replace it with a generous allowance that MPs can spend on whatever they like. Flynn argues that the current system isn’t working as well as it should, so it’s time to go back to how it used to be when MPs were treated like upstanding members of society. Understandably, all Flynn’s senior colleagues have gone out of their way to distance themselves from his remarks. They feel – probably correctly – that the public aren’t yet quite ready to trust that every MP won’t spend some of their allowance on a duck house. Wednesday As the Premier League clubs are on average £40m better off this season than last thanks to the new TV deal, it was no great surprise that the transfer window closed with clubs spending a record amount of money on new players. The only mystery is why so many clubs leave it until the last day to do the deals. It can only be the fear of missing out on something, as most clubs are well aware by the middle of the summer where their squad weaknesses lie and doing a late deal invariably seems to incur a financial premium. My own club, Spurs, managed to acquire the Newcastle player Moussa Sissoko by coming in with a late bid just minutes before the transfer deadline.
Curiously, Spurs had put in a bid – thought to be worth about £12m – for Sissoko the week before, only for the offer to be rejected. Seven days later, with Everton seemingly on the point of signing the player for £30m, Spurs suddenly decided he was worth two and a half times more than their initial valuation. Much will depend on which Sissoko Spurs have bought. If it’s the Sissoko who starred for France in the Euros, he’s worth the money. If he’s the Sissoko who helped get Newcastle relegated last season, then Spurs have wasted their money. Thursday With the party conference season nearly on us, former politicians are lining up to publish their memoirs. The biggest seller – I use that term relatively, as political biographies seldom make the bestseller lists or earn out their advances – is likely to be Ed Balls’ Speaking Out, even though his forthcoming appearance on Strictly Come Dancing may well turn out to be the most interesting thing he has ever done.
One book that will probably slip under almost everyone’s radar is Malcolm Rifkind’s Power and Pragmatism. Partly because few people will remember him, but mainly because it’s rather dull. As you may gather from the title, Rifkind sees himself as a pragmatist, a trait he extends to his writing. He claims that “writing a novel must be easier than presenting one’s own life”, which isn’t entirely borne out by what follows. He also manages to omit the accusations of “cash for access” that were made against him by Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph last year – it was the one memorable event in his recent political career. Pragmatic indeed. Friday Living your principles. When Theresa May became prime minister in July she promised to run a country “for the many, not the few”. Now, it seems, it’s back to business as usual with the Tories selling access to ministers at their party conference in Birmingham later this month. For £3,150 you can buy your way into a business day at which Theresa May and other government ministers will be present, which could be money very well spent given the networking opportunities and the number of government Brexit-related contracts potentially on offer. It certainly looks a better deal than the ones that Jack Straw and Malcolm Rifkind appeared to be offering by using their contacts and experience to further the interests of a fictitious Chinese company. Both Rifkind and Straw, neither of whom were government ministers at the time, were asking at least £5,000 for a day’s not-so-hard graft. So perhaps Theresa May is a woman of her word after all and £3,150 is just an introductory offer to undercut the market and bring in the many. Digested week, digested: Brexit still means Brexit."

Tom Morris, the owner of Liverpool-based Home Bargains, is the richest person in the region, with a fortune of £2.5bn, according to Insider Media. Third on the list, after the property mogul John Whittaker (£2.06bn), are the brothers Simon, Bobby and Robin Arora, of the discount store chain B&M, who are worth an estimated £1.74bn. Fred and Peter Done, founders of the Betfred bookies’ chain, are at No 4 on the list with an estimated wealth of £1.3bn. Simon Nixon, the founder of the Chester-based moneysupermarket.com, ranks fifth with £1.03bn.
The list was compiled by valuing stakes in public companies at the end of July 2016, according to prevailing prices in the Financial Times. Private companies were valued according to their sector rating or latest profits. In 1976, aged 21, Tom Morris used a bank overdraft to start his business. Today TJ Morris Ltd, which runs Home Bargains, employs 17,000 staff across 400 stores and has plans to expand to 30,000 staff in 800 outlets. B&M Retail floated in 2014 with a valuation of £2.7bn and is now worth £2.58bn. The Arora brothers took over the then struggling business in December 2004 and it has since seen significant growth, acquiring a number of former Kwik Save, Woolworths and Au-Naturale stores. According to separate research by The Local Data Company, the discount sector – including Poundland, Poundworld and Poundstretcher – grew by 52% between 2010-15. The big four supermarkets – Tesco, Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury – grew by 33% in the same period."

Ciaran Maxwell, 30, of Exminster in Devon, is accused of stashing explosives and weapons in purpose-built caches in England and Northern Ireland. He also allegedly compiled a library of terrorism documents, including instructions on how to make explosives and tactics used by terrorist organisations. He appeared in custody at Westminster magistrates court on Friday. Maxwell, wearing a grey tracksuit and flanked by two plain-clothed officers in the dock, stood up to confirm his details. He has not yet entered any plea to the charges against him and was remanded in police custody. The case was adjourned until Monday to give the police more time to investigate. Under the terrorism charge, Maxwell is accused of “creating and maintaining hides” in England and Northern Ireland to store explosives. It is also alleged that between 1 January 2011 and 24 August 2016 he manufactured explosive substances and constructed explosive devices. He is further accused of carrying out research resulting in the creation of a library of documents likely to be useful to someone committing or preparing an act of terrorism – specifically information regarding “the manufacture of explosive substances, the construction of explosive devices and tactics used by terrorist organisations”. Maxwell is also accused of obtaining an image of an adapted Police Service of Northern Ireland pass card and items of PSNI uniform. He was arrested on 24 August. Searches have been carried out near his home town of Larne, County Antrim, and in Devon as part of an operation involving the Metropolitan police, the PSNI and MI5."

The jury at Nottingham crown court returned a not guilty verdict to murder after more than 13 hours of deliberations. They are continuing to deliberate over the manslaughter charge. Jogee was charged with murder and the alternative charge of manslaughter over the death of Fyfe, a father of three who was stabbed at his girlfriend’s home. During a two-week trial, the jury heard that Mohammed Hirsi, then 25, delivered the fatal blow to the heart of Fyfe, 47, in the early hours of 10 June. The prosecution alleges he “egged on” Hirsi while standing on the doorstep of the property in the Rowlatts Hill area. Jogee denies both counts. During the trial, William Harbage QC, prosecuting, told the jury it was accepted that Hirsi “wielded” the knife, but added: “This trial concerns the part played by this defendant and his criminal responsibility.” Felicity Gerry QC, representing Jogee, said Fyfe’s death was a “surprise” to him, adding: “He is not a murderer. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.” The jury will return to court on Monday to continue deliberations on the manslaughter charge."
2016-09-03T11:39:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Hinkley Point C: no easy solution to Theresa May's Chinese puzzle,"Theresa May will be dodging questions from the Chinese and French premiers at the G20 summit in Huangzhou about whether she will or will not be giving the go-ahead to the controversial Hinkley Point C nuclear project. One of the first decisions made by May’s new government was to review the £18.5bn flagship energy project that foreign companies – EDF of France and CGN of China – expected to build. Beijing is particularly incensed by suggestions that British ministers are questioning the national security implications of allowing a Chinese business access to the UK national energy infrastructure. In a prominent opinion piece published in the state-run China Daily newspaper on Thursday, ahead of her arrival, China’s ambassador to London urged May to make “wise strategic choices” over Britain’s future relationship with China. Liu Xiaoming made no direct reference to Hinkley but said “a number of steps need to be taken in order to maintain the momentum in the relationship” between London and Beijing. The newly formed Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has also confirmed the secretary of state, Greg Clark, met a delegation from EDF in London who were seeking reassurances that the Somerset scheme would proceed. But Hinkley remains under review with May only promising that a final decision for or against the new reactor scheme, which was championed by George Osborne, would be made in October. So why is a scheme that has been so long in the making still being reconsidered at this time, when EDF and CGN have promised to stump up the building costs and Britain is in dire need of new generating capacity? The case against Security Defence of the realm is indeed an issue. Senior military and intelligence figures have warned ministers that plans to give China a big stake in Britain’s nuclear power industry poses a threat to national security. May’s chief of staff, Nick Timothy, wrote a piece saying MI5 believed that the intelligence services of China continued to work against UK interests at home and abroad. Critics say countries such as the US would never allow the Chinese to work inside its national infrastructure where it could insert computer glitches that could turn the lights off. America scuppered a Chinese company from buying one of its oil companies, Unocal, on strategic grounds in 2005. The Hinkley deal is not self-standing, either. Beijing has only agreed to provide 30% funding on condition that it will be able to build its own Chinese-designed reactor at Bradwell in Essex. Cost While spy stories may be headline grabbing, there are other more mundane reasons why Hinkley may never go ahead: cost – and most notably the fact that UK energy consumers would ultimately pay the eye-watering bill. Osborne offered EDF and CGN a guaranteed price for its electricity of £92.50 per megawatt hour – more than twice the current cost of wholesale power – for a period of 35 years. Critics point out that EDF’s track record of delays and cost overruns at building a new reactor at Flamanville in Normandy is dismal, as is the experience of its reactor designer, Areva, with a new construction at Olkiluoto in Finland. Unnecessary power The biggest cloud over Hinkley, which has grown and grown over the years since the Somerset project was first muted, surrounds whether this kind of inflexible, on-all-the-time nuclear power is really needed now.
The rise of renewables such as wind and solar are threatening the whole argument for nuclear, which also has ongoing issues such as how to dispose of radioactive waste and whether they are a vulnerable terrorist target to contend with. Wind farms and solar arrays are fast coming down in price and while they may produce intermittent power, they are relatively quick and easy to construct. The idea that Britain could rely on these new low-carbon technologies was considered ridiculous even three years ago but less so now. They can be relatively easily backed up by gas-fired power stations while a research race for large scale and efficient batteries could eventually allow green power to run 24 hours a day in areas where renewables were located. A new realisation that Britain could reduce demand for power by a variety of energy saving measures has also raised questions about the need for a new generation of massive plants such as Hinkley. The case in favour Credibility Against all this is the sheer credibility of the UK as a home for foreign investment, especially post-Brexit. Telling the French and Chinese to keep their money could have serious consequences, as Beijing is clearly indicating. Alternatives difficult While many Conservative MPs have reservations about Hinkley there is little enthusiasm for a massive drive on wind and solar, whose subsidy levels have been hugely cut back since Ed Davey ran the show for the coalition government. Britain has carbon emission targets to meet and so any alternative strategy for keeping the lights on such as allowing coal-fired power stations to keep on polluting would mean a U-turn on climate change. The stakes are high whichever route is taken. May will be trying to dodge these thorny questions over the next couple of days."
2016-09-04T11:35:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Funeral held for five men who drowned at Camber Sands,"Hundreds of people gathered for the funerals of five young friends who died during a day trip to Camber Sands. Kenugen Saththiyanathan, 18, known as Ken, and his brother Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, 22, known as Kobi, both from south-east London, drowned at the popular East Sussex beach on 24 August, the hottest day of the year in the UK. Their friends Nitharsan Ravi, 22, Inthushan Sriskantharasa, 23, and Gurushanth Srithavarajah, 27, also died after getting into difficulties in the water. They were remembered at a Hindu ceremony on Sunday with petal-laying at Plumstead Common, south-east London, which began at dawn. Relatives and friends wept as the coffins were carried into marquee tents, before mourners walked around and paid their respects.
Councillor Krishna Suresh, former mayor of Harrow, said what happened was “a big tragedy for the Tamil community”. He said that in times like this the community came together, and praised the group of friends, saying they had done a lot of volunteer work. Suresh added that, as well as being well-educated, the young men enjoyed football and cricket, and had “lots of extra talents”. A number of people addressed the crowd on behalf of the grieving families. The men played with the Jaffna 11 cricket club, which competes in the British Tamil cricket league. Subash Vettivelu, who had known the victims for a long time through the club, said they were all “very, very friendly” and “very good players”. A crowdfunding page to help pay for the funerals raised more than £9,000.
The issue of the lack of lifeguards at Camber Sands, previously criticised by some relatives of the men, was highlighted at the funerals. Family members have suggested they might have stood a chance of survival if the beach had been manned.
Sai Yoghananthan, from the Camber Sands Boys’ Funeral Committee and a family friend, told Sky News: “The message we want to get out today is about beach safety. There was no lifeguard there. Our families can’t bear the thought of anyone else suffering like they have. We are a tight-knit community and our boys were at the heart of it. We will never forget them.” Clive Efford, MP for Eltham, said: “Questions need to be asked about how we arrange safety on our beaches.” A petition for the posting of lifeguards at Camber Sands during the summer has been signed by more than 8,000 people. RNLI lifeguards have been deployed at the beach since the tragedy."
2016-09-04T11:37:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Shami Chakrabarti does not rule out Corbyn shadow cabinet post,"Shami Chakrabarti, the former Liberty director, has not ruled out taking a post in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet when she takes a seat in parliament as a peer. Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, she also said she did not discuss with the Labour leader the possibility of going to the Lords before agreeing earlier this year to conduct a report for him on antisemitism in the party. There were “no inducements, no offers, no threats [and] no interference”, she said. Chakrabarti only joined the Labour party this year and she was the only person nominated by Corbyn for a peerage in David Cameron’s list of resignation peerages published in August. Her elevation triggered a controversy because it came only weeks after she published an antisemitism report regarded by critics as soft on Labour. In the Marr interview, Chakrabarti was repeatedly asked about allegations that there was a connection between her agreeing to conduct the antisemitism inquiry for the party and the offer of a peerage. When first asked if there had been a discussion about her becoming a peer before she agreed to produce the report, Chakrabarti sidestepped the question, saying: “Jeremy Corbyn is not a corrupt man and I am not a corrupt woman. I stand by the report. There was nothing remotely transactional about it.” She also said she knew “what it is like to be offered transactional favours by prime ministers” – suggesting that a previous government had tried to buy her off in the past with the offer of a peerage. But, when pressed, Chakrabarti said she had not discussed her peerage with Corbyn before agreeing to conduct the inquiry. “I joined the Labour party because I wanted to be part of its future, but I did my report into racism and antisemitism with no inducements, no offers, no threats, no interference … [Corbyn] offered it to me afterwards knowing that I am a Labour person and I want to help.” Chakrabarti said she wanted to continue contributing to Labour and, when asked if she would consider taking a post in Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, possibly as shadow justice secretary, she did not rule out the idea. “I think he has got a leadership election to win before anything like that,” she replied. Most members of the shadow cabinet are MPs but the shadow justice secretary’s post was taken by a peer, Charles Falconer, until he resigned in the summer to be replaced by Corbyn loyalist Richard Burgon. Getting Chakrabarti to take a frontbench post would be a coup for Corbyn, who has been accused of heading a threadbare and second-rate shadow ministerial team after dozens of shadow ministers resigned saying they had no confidence in his leadership. As Liberty director from 2003 until March this year Chakrabarti was seen as one of the UK’s most articulate and effective campaigners. At the time, she was not identified with Labour, not least because much of her time was spent criticising the civil rights record of the Blair/Brown governments. But Corbyn is much more libertarian than his predecessors. Asked whether the row about her peerage and the report had damaged her reputation, Chakrabarti replied: “When people sling mud at you, it is designed to damage your reputation. But I have not done anything in my working life for reputation. I’m doing my best to make a difference.”"
2016-09-04T12:02:06Z,uk-news,UK news,British woman held by French police over baby's death,"A British woman is being questioned by French police after her five-month old baby was found dead at their holiday home. The child’s father discovered the body in a bed on Saturday morning and called the emergency services to the gîte at Saint-Pée-sur-Nivelle near Bayonne in the Basque region. Paramedics were unable to revive the child. A doctor who was called to the scene declared it was not a “natural death”. The woman, who has not been named, and her partner had spent a week at the gîte with their two children, the eldest aged three, and were due to leave on Saturday afternoon. According to French reports, the father got up early on Saturday morning and left the bedroom where the family was sleeping together in the same bed. When the mother, who is in her 30s, rose at 9am, her partner discovered the baby was dead and called the police. Marc Mariée, the deputy public prosecutor at Bayonne, told journalists: “The suspicious death of a baby was confirmed at the scene.” He added that the police inquiry “very quickly moved towards the mother, who was taken into police custody in the morning. This custody has been extended.” A postmortem is to be carried out in the next few days."
2016-09-04T15:01:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Latest assault on Polish men in Harlow investigated as possible hate crime,"An attack on two Polish men hours after a remembrance march for one of their compatriots who was killed in the same town is being investigated as a potential hate crime. One of the men suffered a cut to his head and the other had his nose broken in an assault by a group of four of five men at about 3.30am in Harlow, Essex, on Sunday. Both men were treated at Princess Alexandra hospital before being discharged.
The attack came a week after Arkadiusz Jóźwik, 40, was knocked unconscious outside a row of takeaway shops on The Stow in Harlow. Jóźwik, whose brother said the assault began after the factory worker was heard speaking Polish, died later in hospital. The killing, which is also being investigated as a possible hate crime, raised fears about an upsurge in hate crime targeted at eastern Europeans following Britain’s EU referendum. As a result, the Polish community held a “march of silence” through the town on Saturday.
The attack in the early hours of Sunday morning, which took place outside the William Aylmer pub on Kitson Way, is likely to increase their concerns. Supt Trevor Roe, from Essex police, said of the latest incident: “This was a vicious and horrible attack. Although we are considering this matter as a potential hate crime, it is not being linked with the attack at The Stow last weekend. I want to reassure the public and the community in Harlow we are treating this very seriously and do not tolerate assaults of any kind. “Harlow is a strong and resilient community, but I understand the concerns that recent events will cause. There will be an increased number of visible policing patrols in Harlow to both reassure and protect the community.” He said the attack took place in a busy area in the town centre and appealed for witnesses to come forward. Five 15-year-old boys and one 16-year-old boy, all from Harlow, have been arrested on suspicion of murdering Jóźwik and bailed until 7 October pending further inquiries. At Saturday’s march, the Polish ambassador to the UK and the local MP, Robert Halfon, laid flowers at the site of the killing. Halfon has described it as “not just a tragedy for the family or for Poland [but] ... a tragedy for Harlow and Britain as well”. There was a rise in the number of hate crimes around the 23 June referendum. More than 3,000 allegations of hate crimes were made to UK police, mainly in the form of harassment and threats, in the week before and the week after the vote, a year-on-year increase of 42%."
2016-09-04T23:01:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May tells G20 she plans to tackle bad corporate behaviour,"Theresa May is to bring forward proposals to tackle bad corporate behaviour such as excessive executive pay and aggressive tax avoidance before Christmas, as she used the G20 summit to warn that some people feel left behind by globalisation. Addressing the conference in the city of Hangzhou in eastern China, she said world leaders needed to make sure more people felt the benefits of globalisation and free trade. Ahead of a session on economic growth, the prime minister said countries must “not ignore the fact that there is sentiment out there in a number of countries which is anti-globalisation”.
May highlighted her Conservative leadership speech that lambasted companies for bad behaviour, adding: “We’ll be bringing out some proposals later in the year in relation to this.” “I gave a very clear message in that speech that actually there is an issue in corporations paying taxes,” she said. “There is a responsibility in paying taxes. Because their employees … their children are at schools, they use the health service, the goods are transported by roads and trains and so forth. So it’s not that companies have no responsibility.” It is understood she believes it possible to spread the benefits of growth more fairly through a crackdown on corporate irresponsibility and a more robust industrial strategy that covers the whole of the UK. In the leadership contest, May proposed allowing employee and consumer representatives to sit on company boards, and making shareholder votes on executive pay legally binding. “It is not anti-business to suggest that big business needs to change,” she said at the time."
2016-09-05T05:00:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Birmingham pub bombings inquest: families to meet home secretary over funding,"Relatives of victims of the IRA’s 1974 Birmingham pub bombings are to meet the home secretary, Amber Rudd to request funding for legal representation at the resumed inquest. The private discussions on Monday come amid mounting concern over the way police, prison officers and local authority staff are invariably provided with lawyers at coroners’ courts whereas the families of those who died are repeatedly denied legal aid. In June, Louise Hunt, the senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, ruled that the inquest into the double pub bombing that killed 21 people and injured 222 others should be completed because there is a “wealth of evidence that still has not been heard” about the atrocities. The original inquest was adjourned in 1975 after six men were convicted of carrying out the attack. The so-called Birmingham Six – Paddy Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power, John Walker and Hugh Callaghan – all subsequently had their convictions quashed. The bombings were the bloodiest terrorist attack in Britain during the Troubles and resulted in one of the most ignominious miscarriages of British justice. Families of the victims have been left with numerous unanswered questions.
For the Hillsborough inquest, the Home Office did eventually provide discretionary payments for legal representation for families at the second inquest into the deaths of 96 men, women and children in the 1989 stadium disaster. That cost has not so far been disclosed. The Birmingham families hope to persuade Rudd that a similar funding approach should be taken by the Home Office for their resumed inquest, which is due to hold its next session in November. Concerns about the inequality of legal representation at inquests were raised by the outgoing chief coroner, Peter Thornton QC, in an interview with the Guardian this summer. He said that legal aid should be provided for families at inquests in which the government pays for lawyers to represent police officers or other state employees. “It’s partly a question of equality of arms, and also helps the coroner who might otherwise be bending over backwards to help the family and might give the appearance of going too far,” Thornton explained.
That call has been supported by Deborah Coles, director of the organisation Inquest, which supports relatives at coroners’ courts. She has commented: “We have to get away from the Ministry of Justice claim that inquests are inquisitorial processes and families can represent themselves.” The Birmingham families would prefer to have a similar arrangement to the Hillsborough inquest, since that would involve less bureaucracy, filling in legal aid forms and assessing eligibility. The substantial costs of the legal challenge that forced the reopening of the inquest have so far been borne by the Belfast law firm KRW Law, which represents most of the families of the Birmingham victims. Members of the firm, including the solicitor Kevin Winters, will be present at the meeting with the home secretary. Julie Hambleton, who lost her sister, Maxine, in the bombings, told the Birmingham Evening Mail: “We know nothing other than we have been invited to meet with Amber Rudd on that date, but are hopeful we will find out what has happened to our application. “We have been pressing for a decision for some time so that our legal team can prepare for the first pre-inquest review hearing, which the senior coroner has called for in the autumn.” The families’ request is supported by several local MPs including Jess Phillips and Khalid Mahmood. In a statement, KRW Law said: “Since the start of our relationship with the families of the victims, we and our counsel have acted pro bono. That is no longer practical given the scope and complexity of the resumed inquest process. “We have made applications for legal aid and for funding from the lord chancellor. Following the decision of the senior coroner earlier this year, we make an application to the home secretary for a funding scheme similar to that made available to the families of the victims of the Hillsborough disaster 1989.” It added: “Success is difficult to measure in such tragic cases, however with legal representation the bereaved families can have their questions and concerns considered. “We hope that by meeting the new home secretary she will have good news.The families we represent are now at historic point of truth recovery. This is the first time an independent investigation into the Birmingham Pub Bombings 1974 will take place – and the last.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “We are not commenting ahead of the meeting”."

2016-09-05T11:39:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Southern commuters in crowdfunding drive to pay for legal action,"Commuters on the troubled Southern rail network are raising money for legal action against the Department for Transport over its handling of the franchise. Passengers have faced months of delays, cancellations and strikes as the rail company has faced off against the RMT union in a dispute over the role of conductors, as well as handling disruption during the renovation of London Bridge station. On Monday the Association of British Commuters, a campaign group that has emerged in response to Southern’s performance, launched a crowdfunding initiative to raise £25,000. They say this would cover the legal costs of the initial stages of a judicial review into the government’s handling of the crisis. The organisers write that Southern’s performance has become a “daily catastrophe” and they are concerned about passenger safety because of overcrowding and delays. “It’s no longer a question of if someone gets hurt, it’s more a question of when,” they write.
Emily Yates, a writer from Brighton and one of the organisers, told the Guardian legal action was a last resort. “We feel like every single avenue of communication with the Department for Transport has been exhausted and ignored,” she said. “We’ve had no responses to any of our campaign.” She said commuters had faced “scandalous” levels of service. “The relationship between the Department for Transport and the franchise holder needs to be looked into … You can’t imagine a situation where a franchise is failing this badly and being propped up,” said Yates. Legal action would force the government to release information that was “currently concealed from us”, she said, such as the contract between the Department for Transport and Govia Thameslink, which operates Southern. “They will not consent to any transparency and accountability, and won’t engage,” Yates said. “This is the only avenue open to us.” The appeal had raised £825 by Monday lunchtime, with an initial target of £10,000 to scope out the most promising approaches. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said it would be inappropriate to comment on potential legal action and declined to discuss the issue further. This week more than 100 Southern train services resumed after they had been cancelled since July as part of an emergency timetable, the transport minister, Paul Maynard, told parliament. But most of the 341 cancelled services have not yet been reinstated. More disruption lies ahead for commuters this week as RMT members plan a fresh 48-hour strike starting on Wednesday over proposals by Govia Thameslink to change the role of conductors.
A spokesman for Southern said: “We have every sympathy for passengers who are being very patient in the face of this unwarranted and futile disruption caused by the RMT union. We share their frustration and all our efforts are focused on returning a normal service, which is why today we have restored over a third of the trains removed temporarily in July. “Over the coming months we will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to restore the Southern railway. We urge the RMT to join us in that mission, and put passengers first.” Last week the government announced a £20m fund and a new review board to tackle problems with the service, a day before Go-Ahead, the company that owns Govia Thameslink, announced profits of £100m, a rise of 27% on the year before. Go-Ahead’s chief executive, Dave Brown, said he had waived his bonus and apologised to customers for the disruption they had faced. James MacColl, the head of campaigns at the Campaign for Better Transport, which has supported the crowdfunding, said: “Passengers are coming together to hold the government to account for its failure to get a grip on its failing franchise. “The recent announcement of a £20m fund and a project board to consider how to improve Southern services was welcome, though long overdue, but will not solve all the problems. We want to see a similar fund for passengers to compensate them for the disruptions they have suffered so far, and season ticket fares must be frozen so commuters won’t be charged yet more for a beleaguered service.” Stephen Trigg, chair of the Reigate and Redhill and District Rail Users Association, a longstanding commuter action group, said the problems stemmed from “incompetence” at the Department for Transport rather than failings by Southern. He said: “We feel it is important for government to be held to account for these problems and this suggestion by Association of British Commuters is a worthwhile attempt to do this. We have managed to secure two parliamentary debates and two formal meetings with ministers but they only return empty promises and no action to resolve the issues. It seems we must take the action into our own hands.” The ‎RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “The guards action this week on Southern goes ahead as planned. RMT remains available for serious talks but GTR clearly have no interest in resolving the dispute and it is also clear that the government are propping them up financially and politically. “Just a fraction of the £100m the GTR parent company is hoarding in profits would be enough to keep a guard on the Southern trains, keep the trains safe and resolve the dispute. It is absolutely right to call for the government to intervene and to hold those responsible for this continuing shambles to account.”"
2016-09-05T12:44:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Northern Ireland's top judge wants Troubles inquests fast-tracked,"Northern Ireland’s most senior judge has demanded the creation of a special unit to deal with a backlog of inquests into some of the most controversial killings of the Troubles. Sir Declan Morgan, the region’s lord chief justice, said the power-sharing executive at Stormont should fund the new unit. No inquests have yet been held into dozens of killings, including the shootings of republican terror suspects and civilians by the police and British army. There are also cases in which allegations have been made of collusion by security forces in loyalist murders, and of British agents operating within the republican movement. Speaking at the start of the new legal term in Northern Ireland, Morgan described the slow pace of inquests into these deaths as “hugely disappointing” and said a dedicated unit operating over five years was needed to cope with the backlog. “I therefore call again on the local executive and legislature, and on the UK government, to play their part as a matter of urgency. We cannot move on while we remain under the shadow of the past. Nor should we. But time is not on our side,” he said. Morgan said if the inquests could not be scheduled within five years then it could be decades before they were held. “It is impossible to see how the issue of legacy can be moved forward politically without progress having been made on the new legislation and in the absence of a clear assessment of the costs involved in implementing all of the elements of a legacy package,” he said. Victims organisations say there are 57 legacy inquests that need to be held, relating to about 100 killings during the Northern Ireland Troubles."
2016-09-05T13:13:14Z,uk-news,UK news,UK immigration: what are the alternatives to a point-based system?,"The decision by leading leave campaigners such as Boris Johnson to endorse Nigel Farage’s policy of an Australian points-based system for a post-Brexit British approach to immigration was one of the bigger surprises of the referendum campaign. For, as experts such as the Migration Observatory have pointed out, points-based systems have been used by countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand with liberal migration policies looking to admit more people than come under company-sponsored work permits alone.
On one calculation, introducing a scaled-up Australian system in Britain could actually double annual immigration to the UK to 1.5 million or more. So it is no wonder that on Monday at her G20 press conference in Hangzhou, the prime minister decisively rejected a points-based immigration system. She argued that the “tick-box” approach of allowing in everyone who meets the criteria was a recipe for abuse, citing the example of “bogus overseas students”. She said that a new immigration policy would involve Britain “regaining an element of control” over EU migrants coming into the country. So what’s wrong with a points-based system? The Australians introduced theirs in 1979 with the aim of attracting skilled migrants from anywhere on the planet. It has certainly helped grow their population to the point where those born overseas now account for 28% of the population – double the British share. The idea of points-based system – under which migrants who score highest on qualifications, experience, youth, education and language fluency are offered permanent citizenship – sounds fair but even the Australians have moved away from that model. For it is a system that means the state, rather than employers, must decide whether childcare centre managers, electrical engineers or even ballerinas are in short supply and should be opened to migrants. Companies sometimes don’t share the state’s assessment of an individual’s overseas experience or qualifications, and in 2013 more than 13% of those who arrived under the points system were unemployed. In fact, the Australians have now introduced an employer-led system of temporary and permanent work visas that have left the points-based system covering only 15% of all migrants entering Australia. As Alp Mehmet of the anti-migration group Migration Watch UK has put it: “A points-based system might suit the Australians who are trying to increase their population but, in fact, it is extremely complex and would be a non-starter for the UK. Yet another rehash of such a system would be a disaster.” But Britain has a points-based system for non-EU migration so why not for EU migration? As the prime minister knows only too well, the points-based system for skilled non-EU jobs in Britain introduced in 2008 is already full of holes and exceptions. Its cap of 20,700 on tier-two skilled migrants has only recently been reached as exceptions have been repeatedly made in the face of business pressure, notably intra-company transfers and lately to recruit NHS nurses. This was also criticised by the Conservatives as a mechanical “tick-box” immigration system that fails to recognise the complexities of migration. So if not a points-based system to reduce Britain’s near record level of 327,00 net migration a year, then what? The main options being canvassed are: Work permits: As advocated by Lord Green, the chairman of MigrationWatch UK, who proved highly influential in shaping May’s immigration policies as home secretary. He has suggested a Brexit negotiating position that opens with an offer of free movement for European Union tourists, students, pensioners and other self-sufficient people on the basis that it is reciprocated. But that would be accompanied by a proposal that all entry to the UK to work for both EU and non-EU citizens should be subject to the present points-based system of work permits with the cap expanded as necessary. Cap to be decided not by business but by national need. Green claims this could cut net migration by 100,000. A further deep cut would be achieved by a much tougher regime against non-EU students who fail to leave at the end of their studies. Imposing work permits on EU citizens would, however, breach EU free movement rules and so likely lead to highly restricted access to Europe’s single market for goods and services. “The issue is confidence in the government’s intention to reduce immigration from the EU. This is what the public voted on, not on a particular system. In fact, the prime minister was right to indicate that the Australian points-based system is not appropriate for the UK. The way forward is to expand and adapt our present work permit system. In reality, this will be simpler and more effective,” said Green on Monday. Restricting free movement from the EU: May herself spelled out a year ago how she thought that Britain could close the door to unskilled labour from within the European Union without losing the UK’s access to the single market. “Reducing net EU migration need not mean undermining the principle of free movement,” she said in a Sunday Times article. “When it was first enshrined, free movement meant the freedom to move to a job, not the freedom to cross borders to look for work or claim benefits. Yet last year, four out of 10 EU migrants – 63,000 people – came here with no definite job offer whatsoever.” The latest figures show that the proportion of EU migrants to come to work in Britain in a specific job has risen to more than 70%, with 176,000 having a definite job offer in their pocket. The other 127,000 who came in the last 12 months were looking for work in Britain and most of them found one.
An outright ban on the 127,000 who came looking for work is highly likely to breach EU treaties on free movement. But a system in which labour migrants who arrive without a job have to register on a Home Office database, perhaps be issued with an identity card and be obliged to go home if unable to find a job within a few months, might fall within the kind of reform of the EU’s free-movement rules that Britain could put on the table in the Brexit negotiations. Emergency brake: This option has been backed by both ends of the political spectrum. The Institute of Public Policy Research has argued for Britain to negotiate to be able trigger a temporary halt in EU migration in particular occupations, sectors or locations where wages are being undercut. The Adam Smith Institute has argued for the UK to join the European Economic Area whose members have the power to exercise an emergency brake on any of the four “freedoms” including freedom of movement. The IPPR’s emergency brake will require constant sectoral and local analysis of labour market wage levels. It also raises questions about who takes the decision to operate the brake and for how long. A decision by Britain alone is likely to produce retaliatory action with countries across the EU closing their doors to British workers. David Cameron raised the question in his pre-Brexit vote tour of the EU and came back with a limited offer of an emergency brake on benefits – no payments for the first four years. But even that faced threats of legal challenges from other EU states."
2016-09-05T13:21:19Z,uk-news,UK news,No 10 rules out points-based immigration system for Britain,"Theresa May has ruled out a points-based immigration system supported by the official Brexit campaign, while promising a more effective way of bringing “some control” over the number of people coming to the UK. The prime minister was accused of backsliding on promises made by Vote Leave after she cast doubt on the effectiveness of a system admitting people on the basis of their skills and refused to commit an extra £100m to the NHS. Speaking at a press conference on Monday at the G20, May insisted that she opposed a points-based system because it did not give the government enough of a say over who comes to Britain. Shaking her head at the claim that she was going soft on controlling immigration, the prime minister said: “What the British people voted for on 23 June was to bring some control into the movement of people from the European Union to the UK. A points-based system does not give you that control.” In an attempt to illustrate her point, May said Heathrow staff had told her and David Cameron that immigrants were abusing student visa rules through a points-based system. “But because they met the criteria, they were automatically let in,” she said. “That’s the problem with a points-based system. I want a system where the government is able to decide who comes into the country. I think that’s what the British people want.”After the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage suggested that the prime minister was betraying leave voters, No 10 issued a statement on Monday saying the government would devise an immigration system that gave it more control than a points-based system. “One of the opportunities of Brexit is that we will be able to control the number of people coming to Britain from the EU. The precise way in which the government will control the movement of EU nationals to Britain after Brexit is yet to be determined. However, as the PM has said many times in the past, a points-based system will not work and is not an option,” a No 10 spokeswoman said. “When Labour introduced a points-based immigration system, the numbers went straight up. In Australia, they have a points-based system and they have higher immigration per capita than Britain. A points-based system would give foreign nationals the right to come to Britain if they meet certain criteria. An immigration system that works for Britain would ensure that the right to decide who comes to the country resides with the government.” A points-based system applying to migrants from across the world was first suggested by Ukip and quickly championed by the leave campaign, spearheaded by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. It would have allowed equal access to the UK based on certain criteria, such as skills and qualifications, without giving any special access to those from the EU. Farage said: “Theresa May’s track record on immigration as home secretary was appalling and her comments rejecting an Australian-style points system really worry me. “There is already huge anxiety out there in the country regarding Theresa May’s reluctance to trigger article 50. Her rejection of the type of migration system so many went out there and voted leave to see implemented indicates serious backsliding.” Remain campaigners also seized on May’s comments as a sign that people who voted for Brexit had been misled. Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP and chair of campaign group Vote Leave Watch, said: “Boris Johnson and his Vote Leave colleagues spent the whole referendum campaign making impossible promises they knew they couldn’t keep. It’s now clear that very few of their pledges were worth the paper they were written on. “Theresa May cannot be let off the hook either. After barely campaigning for remain, our unelected prime minister now contemptuously dismisses policies such as increasing spending on the NHS which people voted on in good faith and great numbers.” No 10 sources said May was still intending to honour the essence of what people voted for by bringing in a system that would be more effective at curbing immigration than the Vote Leave and Ukip idea. Theoretically, this could include a work permit or visa system, restrictions on entry to those with job offers, a quota system or an emergency brake. However, the prime minister has given no details about how this might be done and has not answered the crucial question of whether the government could give preferential access to EU citizens over those from the rest of the world. The dilemma for May is that a number of EU states have indicated that the UK will not get preferential terms for trading without accepting at least a degree of free movement for EU citizens. Carlo Calenda, the Italian economic development minister, told Bloomberg: “We cannot waste two years by negotiating with the UK how to maintain them inside without them wanting to be inside. We cannot afford this paradox … The more they are going to regulate and limit the presence of EU citizens in the UK, the more we are going to limit the presence of UK goods into Europe.” May also stressed that she had not yet set a date for the triggering of article 50, despite calls from prominent Brexit campaigners for an immediate start to talks with the EU about leaving. “What I’ve said on triggering article 50 is that I won’t be triggering it before the end of the year. I haven’t set a date for when it is going to be triggered,” she told the press conference."
2016-09-05T14:06:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Rambler sues Trump golf resort in Scotland for breach of privacy,"Donald Trump’s golf resort near Aberdeen is being sued for breach of privacy and damages by a rambler who was filmed without her consent on the course. A lawyer acting for Rohan Beyts, a retired social worker and environmental activist, has accused Trump’s staff of breaching the Data Protection Act by taking mobile phone footage of her in April as she allegedly urinated behind a dune on the course. Beyts’s lawyer, Mike Dailly, has accused Trump’s staff of illegally filming and retaining that footage, after the Guardian revealed last month that the resort had breached the UK’s strict laws on data protection and privacy. Trump International Golf Course Scotland, which is wholly owned by the Republican presidential candidate, admitted it had failed to register with the information commissioner’s office, the UK’s data protection regulator. This was despite operating at least nine CCTV cameras at the resort and holding records on thousands of guests, 95 employees and a large number of contractors and suppliers. The resort also breached official guidelines on using CCTV by failing to display prominent signs warning visitors and guests at the course and its 19-bedroom boutique hotel that they were being filmed. In a statement, TIGCS said the failure to register with the commissioner was a clerical error, and it had submitted its registration on 10 August. Under Scotland’s wide-ranging laws that uphold public access to open land, Beyts and a friend had used a public footpath across the Trump course to walk past the clubhouse to reach a thick band of sand dunes and beach bordering the course. As they came back from their walk, the pair say there were challenged by resort staff and then photographed by a local newspaper photographer. Three days later she was visited at home by two Police Scotland officers who formally charged her with public annoyance. A third officer in charge of the complaint told her that two members of Trump’s staff and a guest on the course had filmed her on their mobile phones as she ducked out of sight. Beyts, 62, has been a longstanding critic of Trump’s development, and her prosecution raised fresh accusations from Trump’s critics that his staff were deliberately persecuting his opponents and closely monitored their movements on the resort. Dailly, the principal solicitor at Govan Law Centre in Glasgow, said the resort’s admissions raised substantial doubts about the legality of its use and circulation of any video footage, whether taken by a CCTV camera or a smartphone. “This is a straightforward claim for invasion of privacy, on the basis that the golf course has admitted that they weren’t registered with the ICO,” he said. “That means they weren’t in a position to be processing people’s data [lawfully] because they weren’t doing it under the auspices of the legislation.” Dailly has written twice to TIGCS advising it that Betys is seeking £3,000 damages under the Data Protection Act for breach of privacy and for being “deeply distressed” by being filmed. He said Beyts would start court proceedings if the company rejected her damages demand. TIGCS told the Guardian that the complaint was without foundation. “Ms Beyts has no claim against us,” a spokeswoman said. “CCTV footage had no part in the police investigation. Her prosecution was based on three eyewitness accounts.” The company did not answer further questions. Trump’s Scottish spokeswoman, Sarah Malone, told the Sunday Herald in April that the complaint against Beyts was wholly justified. “This disgusting and shameful act took place in broad daylight in full view of our staff and guests by an individual who has been disruptive in the past,” she said. On 24 May, Beyts received an official warning letter from local prosecutors under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act that put the charges on record for two years, without involving a court hearing, which she has since refused to accept. Her refusal means local prosecutors have six months to take further action. Beyts said she was not pursuing the case for the money. A keen rambler and outdoors enthusiast, she said the experience in April had left her feeling vulnerable and insecure every time she went for a walk and needed to urinate outside. She now fears she could be filmed anywhere. “It is absolutely not about the money: it’s about the principle, making sure that people can feel free to walk on a place where they previously they could walk, unmolested, to stop people feeling intimidated.”"
2016-09-05T15:12:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Robbers make getaway in stolen car with 88-year-old woman in back,"An 88-year-old woman was dumped by the side of the road after being caught up in a carjacking by armed robbers in the Midlands. The woman and a 37-year-old female relative were sitting in the back of a parked Ford Mondeo while its driver used a cashpoint when masked men emerged from the One Stop convenience store on Hungary Hill, Stourbridge, just after 9pm on Sunday, West Midlands police said. The robbers’ waiting getaway vehicle stalled and they stole the Mondeo, apparently not realising there were passengers in the back. They travelled a short distance down the road before forcing the women out of the car. The same men had raided a Co-op in Glebe Lane, Norton, less than an hour before the Hungary Hill heist, police said. On both occasions they threatened staff with hammers and stole cash and cigarettes. Sgt Rich Narrowmore, of West Midlands police, said: “The younger woman was slightly injured and both of them were terribly shaken by their ordeal, so we are keen to trace these men as soon as possible. “These were violent attacks with little thought for their victims and they need to be brought to justice quickly. I would urge anyone with information to contact police on 101 as soon as possible.” The Mondeo was recovered in Bromley Street, Lye, and is being forensically examined along with the stalled car, a silver Volkswagen Golf. Officers are trawling through CCTV footage in an attempt to identify the men. Anyone with information on the incident can speak anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
2016-09-05T15:28:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Imam's alleged killer tells court Isis ideology is 'absolutely wrong',"The alleged killer of a respected former imam has denied he was inspired by Islamic State, describing the jihadi group’s ideology as “absolutely wrong”. Mohammed Hussain Syeedy, 21, denies helping to murder Jalal Uddin, 71, because the elderly community leader believed in a form of Islamic healing called taweez. The prosecution alleges Syeedy and his co-accused, Mohammed Abdul Kadir, 24, were Isis supporters who killed Uddin out of “hatred and intolerance”. Giving evidence on Monday, Syeedy told jurors at Manchester crown court: “I certainly do not sympathise with Isis and I don’t support any of their ideologies or their ways or actions. “I think what they’re doing is absolutely wrong. I don’t believe [in] innocent people dying. I don’t agree with what Isis are doing around the world and I certainly don’t sympathise with them.” Syeedy, a former part-time Manchester United steward from Rochdale, knew Uddin as the “Qari Saab” – a respected member of the Muslim community – and would “give him the Islamic hello”.
He said he did not agree with Uddin’s use of taweez – a form of Islamic healing using amulets that contain a verse from the Qur’an – because it was “dangerous” to meddle with the “supernatural world”. But Syeedy said he was shocked when he found out Uddin was murdered, telling jurors it was “nothing to do with me”. The takeaway worker said he wanted to get Uddin deported to Bangladesh and hold a seminar to warn Rochdale’s Muslim community about the dangers of taweez and “black magic”. In August last year, the jury heard, Syeedy’s younger brother found a book on taweez belonging to Uddin in the Jalalia Jameh mosque where they prayed. Syeedy, who dropped out of an electrical engineering course at Huddersfield University, said he watched as his friends “ripped up” Uddin’s book and put it in a bowl of water and threw it in a nearby stream. He told jurors that the book was “quite dangerous because when people are involved in taweez they’re involved in the supernatural world and it’s easy to cause harm. “By ripping it up and putting it in water it would basically destroy what’s in there, kind of spells,” he said. Syeedy said he saw pictures inside the book that included a woman with “mad hair … like she had been electrocuted” and explicit pictures of genitalia. “I’m sorry to put it this way,” he told the jury. “It was a picture of a penis with eyes and hands with one leg. It’s a bit weird.” Another picture, Syeedy said, showed “a vagina with the same sort of features, eyes and hands and stuff”. Asked by his defence barrister, Icah Peart QC, whether he believed Uddin should be subject to violence for his beliefs, Syeedy said: “Absolutely not.” He added: “Throughout my community work I’ve never used aggression, never used violence, never spoken to any member of the public in a bad manner. Never in a situation have I used violence or aggression.” Syeedy said he had previously known people who practised taweez but never been aggressive or violent towards them: “I’ve never approached them, never been aggressive with them, never debated with them. I’m not in a position to debate with them let alone take the law into my own hands.” He added that Britain had given him the opportunity to practise and study Islam, he added: “This is my country, I abide by the laws.” The jury has been told that Kadir, from Oldham, used a hammer-like object to bludgeon Uddin to death in a children’s playground in Rochdale after following the former imam in Syeedy’s car. Recounting the aftermath of the killing, Syeedy said there was nothing strange about Kadir when he picked him up seconds after the killing: “I asked him ‘What happened? Did you get anything?’ and he said to me there was a few guys in the park, ‘I just gave him salaams – just said hello – and walked off, but I know where he comes now so we can get him, we can approach him, another time.’” Kadir then told Syeedy he had a “family emergency” and had to go back to Oldham, jurors heard. Syeedy said he was shocked when he found out within hours that Uddin had died. “I was shocked. I didn’t know what to say. My initial thought was Kadir has gone into the park to ask for the taweez and he’s said there’s a few guys so maybe it’s the guys that were there but I didn’t think nothing of it.” Asked by Peart whether he thought Kadir had anything to do with it, Syeedy replied: “Absolutely not. Not even a single thought came into my mind that it could’ve been Kadir. He’s just gone into the park, he’s come out, he’s acting normal. There’s nothing strange about what he was doing.” Kadir is being hunted by police after he fled to Istanbul, via Copenhagen, two days after the fatal attack on 18 February, jurors have heard. Syeedy said he had been told that Kadir had “wacky ideologies” and that he “sympathised with Isis and he had weird videos and images on his Facebook page”. The trial continues."
2016-09-05T16:17:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Emily Maitlis's alleged stalker defends breaking restraining order,"A man accused of stalking Emily Maitlis, the BBC Newsnight presenter, said he broke a restraining order because he felt she owed him an explanation about the breakdown of their friendship after he declared his love for her. Edward Vines, 46, who met Maitlis while they were students at Cambridge University, said he had exhausted all legal avenues before allegedly breaching the order by sending two letters to Maitlis and her mother, Marion, between 10 May and 26 June last year. Giving evidence at Oxford crown court, where he was flanked by nurses from the psychiatric hospital where he is a patient, Vines said he had a reasonable excuse after his requests for an explanation were ignored by the “cruel and unkind” television newsreader. He denies two charges of breaching the order, which was imposed in January 2009 to prevent him from contacting Maitlis or her family. Vines met Maitlis in October 1989, during their first term at Queens’ College. “By Christmas I had fallen in love and I felt compelled to tell her that almost as soon as we got back to college,” he told the court. “We remained friends throughout the whole of the Easter term. She wrote to me over the Easter holidays - letters which I still have. But in April it changed dramatically, in my eyes. She appeared not to want to see me. She occasionally put me down in small ways, but nonetheless hurtful ways.” Vines said the rejection triggered mental health problems, including manic depression. “Some days I would sink into a slump of despondency in relation to the scorn and belittling attitude I believe she has shown me,” he told the court. Defence counsel Greg Foxsmith asked Vines if he accepted he was subject to a restraining order, which he said he did, but the defendant said: “I believe I have a reasonable excuse, in the circumstances, to breach the restraining order.” After his arrest, Vines told police that he felt he had a right to contact Maitlis to resolve what he referred to as a mystery, because he had exhausted all legal means, including seeking to overturn a conviction for harassment in 2002 for which he was jailed for four months. “Emily is a very complicated person herself and she was not forthcoming at all regarding the reasons behind her unkind behaviour towards me at Cambridge,” Vines told the court. “Her ambivalent attitude to me meant we didn’t resolve it. Emily and I have not sat down with other people to sort it out. I believe she is being unreasonable. I feel it’s reasonable to seek justice in this way and reasonable to ask Emily if she would undertake sensible discussions. It’s a mystery to me. Why would Emily, so warm and friendly to me, suddenly go cold on me solely because I was in love with her? If that was the case she would have done so in January.” Prosecutor Julian Lynch had previously described the letters the case centred on as “long and rambling”. In one, read out in court on Friday, Vines wrote that he believed her treatment of him was due to the fact she was attracted to him and was dismayed he had not made the romantic overtures she had expected because he was too frigid. Vines’ previous convictions also include breaches of restraining orders in 2008, 2010, 2013, 2014 and also earlier this year, for which he awaits sentence, jurors have been told. The hearing continues."
2016-09-05T17:21:16Z,uk-news,UK news,National Media Museum visitor numbers plunge,"The number of visitors to Bradford’s National Media Museum has plummeted by 40% since the recession, raising concerns over its future. The museum had 441,000 visitors in the year to July, compared with 737,681 in the same period in 2008, according to analysis of government statistics by the Yorkshire Post. The MP for Bradford South, Judith Cummins, said the museum, which came close to closure in 2013, was a “northern cultural treasure” and she had sought assurances about its future from the new culture secretary, Karen Bradley, last month. “Encouragingly, she offered her written assurances that the future of the National Media Museum remained bright under her watch,” Cummins said. “I and others believe it will continue to deliver outstanding cultural experiences for the people of Yorkshire, provided central government continues to invest in its future.” In February it emerged that a world-famous photography collection was being moved from the Bradford museum to the V&A in London. The move was condemned by local politicians as “an appalling act of cultural vandalism”. The museum’s board opposed the move but was overruled by the museum’s London-based owner, Science Museum Group. SMG receives about £40m a year in funding from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. A spokesman for the National Media Museum said its most recent annual figures showed an 11% increase in visitors year on year. Visit England recently described it as the sixth most-visited attraction in Yorkshire and the Humber, the spokesman said. He added: “In February we had one of our most successful half-terms in recent years when we partnered with Horrible Science. In 2017 we will be unveiling a new brand for the museum along with our £1.8m Wonderlab gallery, which we’re very confident will be a major draw for us and increase visits.” Susan Hinchcliffe, the leader of Bradford city council, said: “In 2016 visitor numbers increased for the first time in years but from speaking to the museum they still have plans to do more. The new gallery opening early next year will boost visitor numbers further. People need to see constant investment and new activities and exhibitions to keep coming back for more.” The headline on this article was amended on 6 September 2016 to better reflect the article."
2016-09-05T18:21:00Z,uk-news,UK news,‘It is a disgrace to Europe’: former child refugee Lord Dubs on the Calais camp,"After two hours walking through the camp in Calais, meeting refugee children who have crossed Europe alone, Alf Dubs is exhausted and feeling uncharacteristically despondent. “It is awful. I will have nightmares, and this is just the tip of the iceberg,” he says. Lord Dubs, the Labour peer who earlier this year masterminded a political coup forcing the government to promise to give sanctuary to some unaccompanied child refugees, usually comes across as an upbeat figure, not inclined to wallow in despair. Today he seems momentarily overwhelmed by the horrific situation facing about 860 children living here in second-hand camping tents and flimsy wooden shacks. Given the amount of energy he has dedicated to trying to help them, and the complete absence of any progress to date, he has every reason to feel depressed. “It is a disgrace. A piece of legislation was passed with enormous public support, and the government has done nothing discernible about it,” he says. As a former child refugee himself, brought to Britain from Czechoslovakia on one of the Kindertransport trains in 1939, his sense of anger at the political inaction is particularly acute. After his intervention shamed Cameron’s government into a U-turn, securing a commitment that Britain would give homes to some of the estimated 88,000 child refugees believed to be travelling through Europe, his amendment to the Immigration Act was widely celebrated as a rare sign of the government’s humanity. Four months later, none of the qualifying children have arrived in the UK. Worse still, Dubs is dismayed to find, during a meeting with French officials, that there is no system in place for identifying and registering the children in order to see who might be eligible.
His feelings of disappointment are nothing compared with those felt by the hundreds of children, some as young as eight, living here without parents or close relatives, many of whom have been stranded here, just a few hundred metres from Calais town centre and only 30 miles from England, since the end of last year. Ahead of his visit, volunteers ask some of the youngest children, potentially eligible for help under the “Dubs” amendment, to meet him to help explain the urgency of the situation. Two cousins from Afghanistan, aged nine and 10, who left home more than a year ago and who have been in Calais for 10 months, were due to meet him. After months of trying to survive alone, attempting nightly to smuggle themselves into lorries to try to join an uncle in Britain, they are entirely crushed by their experiences and now mainly speak in reluctant monosyllables, occasionally offering a full sentence. The younger boy says (through a translator) that he had recently been hit on the knee with a rubber bullet fired by French police. His older cousin says they have tried more than 20 times in the past month to climb on to trucks. They look more unwell and more fragile than a month ago when I met them, their clothes grimier, and new scabs visible on the face of the younger boy. “I lost my mind here. I don’t remember anything I’ve been doing,” the older boy says. Pushed by the translator to say something else, he adds: “We ran away from war, and no one here has helped us ... Now the weather is getting colder.” But he is not inclined to say much and tells the translator: “They ask too many questions, and they aren’t doing anything.” Another eight-year-old boy from Afghanistan, also left to fend for himself after the older relative he was travelling with succeeded in getting to England, is close to tears, and crouches on the sandy path, playing with stones and poking at the dirt with a stick. One of the volunteers who has worked with him says he feels suicidal.
“They need to leave the site now. They are on their own; they have been here through the winter and they are falling apart in front of us. There is no one here to put them to bed and sort their clothes. They are not functioning properly now. I can’t believe that nobody in authority is here sorting this out. The British government has promised to help; the French aren’t coping,” says Liz Clegg, a volunteer from Devon who has spent much of the past year living on the camp, trying to make up for the absence of support from mainstream international agencies. She and other volunteers have devoted a lot of energy to trying to persuade children to apply for asylum in the France, and hundreds already have, but sometimes children are resistant to logic persuasion when they know their parents have gone heavily into debt, trying to get them to the UK; often they are trying to reach relatives. Visits from groups of politicians are always emotionally fraught because the children expect help to be forthcoming immediately, and find it hard to understand why nothing is done, Clegg says. She decides that these children are not up to speaking to Dubs, who is visiting alongside Vanessa Redgrave and her daughter Joely Richardson, and the Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy. Instead, Dubs has a private meeting in a wooden hut with three boys from Eritrea, aged between 13 and 16, who Citizens UK, the campaign group which has been lobbying for Britain to help unaccompanied children, believe have a good case for being transferred to safety in Britain. Their names, along with those of the cousins from Afghanistan, were on a list of 387 refugee children believed to be eligible under the amendment presented by Dubs to the Home Office on Friday. He leaves the meeting aware they need help urgently. “I felt a terrible sense of hopeless despair on their behalf. They are clearly frightened of violence from older people; they don’t feel safe,” he says. Outside the hut, crowds of people gather to find out what help is on offer. “This boy is 14, what about him?” one older camp residents shouts. “Can you meet my friend who is 12?” another asks. The problem facing campaigners such as Dubs is immense, and he acknowledges that it is a struggle not to feel overcome by the weight of responsibility. Fleetingly in May, it appeared that, regardless of political sensitivities around immigration, there was a consensus that something needed to done for the lone child refugees. With Save The Children estimating that there were 85,000 across Europe, politicians acknowledged that Britain had a responsibility to take its share of stranded children. Originally, the government rejected Dubs’s amendment on the grounds that France, Greece and Italy are safe countries, until Dubs argued that there was a responsibility to share the burden between countries. The then immigration minister, James Brokenshire, acknowledged: “We have a moral duty to help.” Even the Daily Mail launched a campaign to help the children.
The impetus got lost in the Brexit referendum, amid a hardening of attitudes on immigration. Local authorities with stretched budgets have yet to offer enough spaces to accommodate more asylum-seeking children. The situation in Calais is volatile and complex, and there is no simple solution. With the camp population now more than 9,000 and rising – higher than it has ever been – alarm among local people is mounting. The roads around the town this week are being blockaded by French farmers, truck drivers and residents, demanding that the government set a firm date for the camp to be cleared. The French government has said it will be gone by Christmas, but plans for the refugees are not clear. Attempts by some migrants to block the road at night and storm on to lorries have become more violent and more frequent, making the area dangerous for lorry drivers.
Even if the “Dubs” amendment were being actively implemented, children need to have arrived in Europe before 31 March to be eligible, a clause inserted to prevent more parents from sending their children on a perilous journey to come to Britain. But somehow the numbers are rising. Volunteers attempting to register the new unaccompanied children arriving in Calais note that numbers have jumped by about 100 in the past month, with more children coming from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Iraq, and greater numbers of unaccompanied girls. New reports documenting the dangers of the camp are published every week; on Monday Unicef research suggested that the Calais refugee children were risking their lives 2,000 times a week to reach Britain, trying to stow away in lorries or jump on trains. The Home Office says it is in “active discussions” with the UNHCR and Italian, Greek and French governments to “speed up mechanisms to identify, assess and transfer refugee children to the UK where this is in their best interests.” But no children have come as a result of the Dubs commitment. “I was shocked that nothing had happened despite the amendment. There are more people than ever, and the conditions are as awful as ever – children living in shacks, in tents very makeshift, with just one meal a day, often not enough to eat, with no support system except for the volunteers, left to their own devices,” Dubs says. “Visually, it is pretty awful, hemmed in, with barbed wire along the motorway; what it will be like in the cold and winter, I shudder to think. Human beings can’t survive indefinitely like this. No wonder there is violence in the camp, no wonder they are so desperate to escape. It is not surprising they are doing everything they can to get across the Channel. In their position, I would be doing the same.” He is reluctant to overstate the similarities between his own experience as a child fleeing war and the ordeal confronting many of these children, but he recognises that his campaign has been given moral weight by his timely reminder of how much Britain had helped Jewish children fleeing the Nazis.
“It was important, politically, to remember that Britain had set a strong humanitarian example in 1938, which undoubtedly saved the lives of many people who would otherwise have ended up in the gas chambers,” he says. “I wanted the argument to stand on its own merits, not just because I was putting it. However, it clearly informed me and made me perhaps more emotionally committed, because I thought about my own background. Britain has given me fantastic opportunities and I would like to think that others who flee could have similar opportunities.”
Dubs came to Europe on a train organised by Nicholas Winton when he was six, in the summer of 1939, a few months after the Germans had invaded Czechoslovakia. Like the children in Calais, he had very little with him, a few clothes and a knapsack of food, (which he forgot to open on the journey – a sign, he thinks, of how traumatised he was). He only remembers the journey hazily. “My mother saw me off. I can see my mother with a friend at the station and a soldier with a swastika on the platform. When we got to the Dutch border, the older ones cheered. I had no idea, but they knew it meant something.” Later, he remembers waiting at Liverpool Street station with a name tag around his neck, until his father (who had fled Prague a few months earlier) was allowed to take him back to a bed and breakfast where his father was staying in Belsize Park, north London. “There is a temptation to make up what you thought at the age of six; actually you don’t remember much. I didn’t know what was happening; I couldn’t understand. I don’t want to pretend I had a sensitivity or wisdom that I didn’t have,” he says. Nevertheless, he believes his experience has given him some understanding of how the unaccompanied children in Calais are feeling. “Some of them were helped to flee by their parents or by traffickers, because they feared death, war, bombings – not totally different motivations from mine. I see them, and I see think there but for the grace of God ...” He takes some inspiration from Winton’s campaign. “It was a matter of luck that he was persuaded to give up a skiing holiday to go to Prague and he saw for himself what was happening. He set about working extremely hard to overcome the resistance of the British government and the suspicion of the Germans.”
In some ways, it might have been easier for Winton, because “immigration wasn’t the political issue on which the administration had staked its reputation”, Dubs says. “But he took on the British authorities almost single-handedly and got them to agree. He was an exceptional individual who made things happen when a lesser person would not have bothered.” Winton’s MP was Theresa May, and Dubs met her first at his 103rd birthday party. While May was home secretary, he met her twice to talk about his amendment; the second time, under considerable political pressure, she agreed to include it in the immigration bill. He is uncertain about the strength of her ongoing commitment to the issue. In a wooden hut, set up by volunteers as a safe meeting space for the children travelling alone, a couple of dozen boys, mostly in their early teens, are waiting for food, half-watching a Bollywood film involving a flying taxi; some are curious about the visit from British politicians. Among them is 13-year-old Jawaad (not his real name) from Afghanistan, who learned English from his father, a Nato translator who has been pursued by the Taliban for working with western forces, and who has separately fled the country. “Is it true that the government will pick up the right boys and take them legally?” he asks, in careful, grammatically correct English. He says he his too tired and frightened to continue attempting to travel to the UK illegally. “Every second you are scared that something dangerous will happen to you. The French police, they are familiar with beating. When the police started beating dangerously, a lot of the underage boys stopped trying to go illegally. They don’t care if you are a child or a grownup. They send dogs after us. The dog’s mouth is covered but they can get you with their nails.” He is clear about why Calais is not a suitable place for children travelling alone. “From the time I arrived in Calais, I don’t have a happy moment. Every day I spend in sorrow, thinking about my family and how to reach the UK.” Intelligent, and very motivated, he is particularly frustrated at not being to able to study; eventually he hopes to become a doctor.
Asked what message he would give to the British government, he thinks for a while before offering a clear summary of the problem, fluently articulated. “If I could directly speak to the British government, my suggestion is that the government should help the underage boys because they have no father, mother or brothers to help them here. Calais is full of dangers and difficulties. When we want to take a shower, we cannot. We have no money for anything. When we want to call our parents, we are not able to. We have no relatives here. “This is not a place for living. The human is not created to live like this. In my room in Afghanistan, I had electricity, I could study night and day. I had a beautiful bed, I slept comfortably. Here I have a tent. I have only a blanket, and the clothes I am sleeping in. When it is raining heavily sometimes the water comes inside the tent. Sometimes when you are late for the food, you will be hungry. At home, I never lived like this. It is too strange.” Returning home would be extremely dangerous. “I don’t want to go to back to Afghanistan. I couldn’t be alive for a moment back there. The Taliban forced my father to leave his job. I don’t know where he is now.” Volunteers who have been trying to help the children, struggling without the support of international aid agencies, are jaundiced by the lack of progress on the “Dubs” amendment. “I’d love to say I was surprised,” says Karen Moynihan, who works with children in a youth centre on the camp. “There have been lots of politicians with good intentions, but, on the ground, very little has changed.” Volunteers are becoming used to seeing children with cuts to their heads from falling off lorries, or complaining of having been sprayed in the face with pepper spray, she says. “Now we just say: ‘Are you OK?’ It has become normalised. These are, without doubt, the most appalling conditions for young children to be living in.” Dubs leaves the camp determined to keep fighting to ensure that at least some of the children are helped. “These kids are having a terrible time.

2016-09-05T19:09:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Crowdfunding campaign to buy Lake District mountain admits defeat,"A group of Lake District ramblers have failed to buy one of the national park’s most beloved mountains after a two-year campaign, leaving those who donated to the cause unsure whether their money will be returned. Blencathra, also known as Saddleback, was put on sale by its aristocratic owner in 2014 for £1.75m, ostensibly to pay an inheritance tax bill. The unusual real estate offer prompted interest from around the world, with many locals fearing – unreasonably, the estate agent insisted – that the 868-metre (2,850ft) peak could be bought by a foreign oligarch who would either attempt to develop it or try to prevent walkers from accessing the land.
Friends of Blencathra was born after one local mused in a nearby pub: “If we all chipped in a tenner ...” The group raised more than £250,000 in a crowdfunding campaign, but it was not nearly enough to buy the mountain, described by Alfred Wainwright, the author of the seven-volume pictorial guide to the Lakeland Fells, as “one of the grandest objects in Lakeland”. The campaign was launched in 2014 after the owner, Hugh Lowther, the eighth Earl of Lonsdale said he was hoping “some daft Russian” would buy it “to show off”. He threw in the ancient feudal title of Lordship of the Manor of Threlkeld with the deal, but failed to attract a serious buyer. This year Lowther settled his inheritance tax bill by selling a Turner painting for £2m to the Tate, among other family heirlooms. He took the fell off the market, saying he wanted it to remain in the Lowther clan for generations. Undeterred, Friends of Blencathra vowed to continue their fight to buy it, but many donors believed the battle was lost and demanded their money back. Some people had chipped in £10; others had given £1,000 or more. But the group said it was not yet in a position to return the cash, prompting its honorary chair, the mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington, to express concern. After Bonington spoke out, a an Oxford man, Martin Knowles, set up a breakaway “action” group on Facebook called Friends of Blencathra Please Say No, formed in order to “highlight the terrible way the charity is behaving”. “Many donors, of which there are thousands, have contacted me stating that they wish their donations to be refunded but have been refused,” Knowles said in July. He claimed he had received a call from “a little old lady who has donated £1,000 and is distraught that she will never see her money again”. Lowther’s solicitors, acting for Lonsdale Settled Estates, delivered a bad-tempered ultimatum to the original group in August, giving them 21 days to make an offer. “Our client has no wish to be associated with what appears to be turning into a public dispute between your client and a number of the donors to its appeal,” the lawyers wrote. That offer expired at 5pm on Monday. Less than an hour beforehand, the group’s chair, Dave Wheeler, finally admitted defeat. In a statement he said: “Last month we received an ultimatum to make a final offer for Blencathra within 21 days, from the solicitors acting for Lonsdale Settled Estates. It was made clear that the offer would have to be substantially above the valuations we have received for the mountain to be acceptable and that the other proposals we had offered would not be considered. The property was vested in the name of the eighth Earl of Lonsdale last week. “The trustees of Friends of Blencathra Ltd have declined to make an offer on the terms indicated and, with the change of ownership, now see no prospects of a successful purchase by the charity. The trustees will meet shortly to discuss the implications of that decision and prepare a public consultation on the future of the charity.” The Guardian asked how and when the group planned to refund the money, but Wheeler did not respond."
2016-09-05T20:30:39Z,uk-news,UK news,How Storm Desmond left its mark on the Lake District,"When Storm Desmond broke the UK’s 24-hour rainfall record with 341.4mm (13.4in) of rain in 24 hours in the Honister Pass in Cumbria on 5 December last year, it did extraordinary damage to the Lake District. The headlines were about homes and businesses flooded, roads collapsed and bridges washed away. But across this beautiful landscape, one fifth owned by the National Trust, there were many problems. Rivers moved their courses, paths, fences and historic gardens were swept away, and wildlife havens destroyed. It has taken a whole summer of hard work to repair just some of the havoc caused, with each of the 14 historic bridges on Trust property that needed repair costing more than £10,000 to fix.
Because most of the damage caused in this way is uninsurable, the Trust launched an appeal for funds to help with the repair work, and so far, £330,000 has been donated. Since much of the labour is done by volunteers this goes a long way, but according to the Trust, is still nowhere near enough to make the Lake District resilient to future storms. With the rain now falling in ever-heavier downpours, adaptations are being made with large pieces of stone being used that will not be washed away, but culverts are also needed to divert flash flood from vulnerable areas. Sections of path are being rebuilt over pipes to create mini-bridges. With continuing climate change the Trust predicts an ongoing battle with the elements to keep the Lake District both safe for visitors and to conserve its natural beauty and wildlife."
2016-09-06T04:40:34Z,uk-news,UK news,China calls for deeper political trust with Britain amid Hinkley Point row,"Xi Jinping has called for a deepening of “political mutual trust” with the UK amid a simmering row over Chinese involvement in Britain’s nuclear sector. In a 30-minute bilateral meeting on Monday afternoon, China’s president met with the British prime minister and, according to Chinese state media, told May that London and Beijing needed to “communicate and cooperate in various fields to achieve more stable and better development of their ties”.
According to an account published by Xinhua, China’s official news agency, May “committed to actively deepening comprehensive strategic partnership and enhancing mutual understanding and trust”. Xinhua’s account of the meeting made no mention of the controversial £18bn ($23.5bn) Hinkley Point C project, which has threatened to derail the so-called “golden era” of UK-China ties since May delayed a final decision on its approval after taking office in July. According to the state-run news agency, Xi used the meeting, on the sidelines of the G20 summit, to inform May that China was willing to work with Britain to lift the partnership to “a higher level”. But the Chinese president also told the prime minister the two countries should “continue to promote pragmatic cooperation” in areas including energy, investment and infrastructure and “expand cooperation” in areas such as high technology and clean energy. During her visit to Hangzhou for the G20, May told reporters the “golden era” of UK-China relations – sealed by David Cameron and Xi during the Chinese leader’s state visit to Britain last year – was still alive. But the term was notably absent from comments made shortly before May’s meeting with Xi by a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry that China “always values its relationship with the UK”. Hua Chunying said ties between London and Beijing had been “developing with a sound momentum in recent years”. “We hope that the UK will continue to uphold a positive and open policy towards China.” A UK source described a “warm” meeting between May and Xi, and said the Communist party chief had not protested about the prime minister’s decision to review Chinese investment in the UK’s nuclear sector. UK sources said there was only an oblique reference to Hinkley Point C, the Chinese-backed nuclear project under review, and that Xi had told May he was willing to be patient about the government’s decisions in major projects. May’s decision to delay the project’s approval has been widely attributed to security concerns over Chinese involvement in sensitive sectors such as nuclear power. In 2015 Nick Timothy, May’s influential joint chief of staff, attacked the “golden” relationship with China. In an article last year for Conservative Home website, Timothy questioned the wisdom of giving Beijing access to such sectors, arguing there was no justification for giving “a hostile state easy access to the country’s critical national infrastructure”."
2016-09-06T05:00:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Met police to start using spit hoods on suspects within weeks,"Britain’s biggest police force is to allow its officers to use spit hoods on suspects within weeks, the Guardian has learned. The Metropolitan police say the restraint devices are necessary to protect officers from prisoners who try to spit at or bite them, exposing them to the risk of serious infection. The Met will start using them in 32 police station detention areas across London in a pilot scheme beginning in October. Initially they will not be used on the streets, where their deployment could be photographed or inflame the public. But their use may be expanded and they could be issued to officers on street patrol if the pilot scheme is deemed by Met bosses to be a success. The mesh hoods have proved controversial, and there have been claims that they breach a suspect’s rights. The Met had previously opposed their use, and some police chiefs have privately expressed concerns that they are reminiscent of hoods used at Guantánamo Bay. The Met’s decision was condemned by the human rights group Amnesty International, the civil rights group Liberty and the campaign group Inquest, which helps those who claim to have suffered at police hands. The Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, has called for the use of the hoods to protect police. The Met calls the devices spit guards and says their deployment will be classed as a use of force by an officer. Martha Spurrier, director of Liberty, said: “A spit hood is a primitive, cruel and degrading tool that inspires fear and anguish. We have seen many cases where the police use them unnecessarily and without justification, including on children and disabled people. “Police have the power to use force against citizens when they have to – using handcuffs, arm restraints, leg restraints, pepper spray, batons. The suggestion that officers need to be able to cover people’s faces and heads is as far-fetched as it is frightening. Spit hoods belong in horror stories, not on the streets of a civilised society. We urge the Met police to think again.” In a statement, the Metropolitan police service said: “The MPS does not currently use spit guards. A pilot scheme has been approved for the use of spit guards in all MPS custody units from October 2016. “These guards will only be used in a custody situation. They are considered a ‘use of force’ and so officers are being trained to ensure that their use is proportionate and necessary in the circumstances. The use of this protective equipment is necessary to meet the duty of care owed to officers when a detainee spits at or attempts to bite them.” The Met did not rule out a greater use of spit hoods after the pilot. Deborah Coles, of Inquest, said: “This is an alarming development with seemingly no debate or consultation and will do nothing to assist police and community relations. “The use of a hood as a piece of police equipment is frightening and raises real concerns about its potential for misuse against the most vulnerable and discriminated against sections of society.” Che Donald, the lead on health and safety for the Police Federation, said: “I’d rather take a punch to the face than be spat at.” Spitting at officers can expose them to risks of contracting hepatitis, and such incidents have led to police taking powerful anti-viral drugs, which last for three months and can cause nausea. Donald said: “We do not deal with the most savoury people. Hepatitis is prevalent within the the drug abuse community. I don’t see it as a use of force, it is a health and safety issue.” Donald said spit hoods should be deployed on the streets of London, saying: “If it is working in custody, why would they not take it out on the street?” Amnesty International said: “Spit hoods can restrict breathing, create disorientation and can be dangerous and extremely distressing … Serious questions must be asked as to whether these restraints which have been criticised for breaching human rights guidelines should actually have a role in modern British policing. “It beggars belief that the Met police would choose to introduce these restraints in their toolkit, particularly given that so many other major British police forces have chosen to outlaw them.” The use of spit hoods had until now be confined to smaller forces. British Transport police use them, and the force is under investigation by the police watchdog after a young black man was filmed being pinned to the floor and hooded by officers. The footage was posted on social media and led to the investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission."
2016-09-06T07:53:14Z,uk-news,UK news,"London fares, affordable homes and the conundrum of Harrow-on-the-Hill","Just before Christmas 2013, I was taken to Harrow-on-the-Hill station by very important people from Transport for London (TfL) who outlined a plan for redeveloping the adjacent bus station and staff car park and using the profit to improve the place, including by installing passenger lifts that would cost around £25m. The station has a faded charm, which includes a lot of steps, though those aren’t much use to you if you are disabled or pushing a child in a pram. Two-and-a-half years on, local MP Gareth Thomas has written to TfL with concerns about how the plans were taking shape. He had heard that half-a-dozen tower blocks were on the cards, each of them 20 storeys high, with only 10% of them “affordable” and no “first dibs” deal for Harrow residents. He asked for “early publication of the financial projections around these particular proposals”. That was in July. By then, of course, London had a new mayor with new ideas about how TfL should go about exploiting its substantial land assets and to what ends. Under Boris Johnson, TfL’s primary aim had been to make money from the land by entering into joint ventures with property developers and building mostly market-priced housing on the land. By contrast, Sadiq Khan, has said he wants 50% of the homes built on TfL and other public land to be “genuinely affordable” shared ownership dwellings for first-time buyers who’ve been renting for five years. And, sure enough, TfL’s director of commercial development Graeme Craig has told the Harrow Times that conversations have taken place with the new mayor’s team “about increasing the number of affordable homes that could be delivered on the site” along with maintaining the original focus on “delivering local station improvements, including step-free access [lifts]”. This may hearten Gareth Thomas. But what would an increased amount of affordable housing at Harrow-on-the-Hill at the expense of more profitable properties mean for TfL’s finances, both with regard to its plans for the station itself and overall? On the face of it, more “genuinely affordable” homes on the site would mean less income from the development for TfL at the very same time as the organisation is required by Khan to find the money to freeze its public transport fares throughout his four-year term and as the government is phasing out its operational grant, which helps fund the day-to-day running of its services. Khan’s manifesto lists putting TfL land to “better use” by “retaining ownership while building affordable and market homes, as well as commercial space” and thereby “generating a long-term and secure revenue scheme” as one of the ways of funding the freeze. But if insisting on 50% “genuinely affordable” homes at Harrow-on-the-Hill - or even anything substantially higher than the 10% Thomas understands TfL initially had in mind - makes it harder both to fund the local station improvements and to bridge the fares freeze funding gap, doesn’t something have to give? One solution would be to simply increase the total number of homes to be built at Harrow-on-the-Hill, meaning that the while the percentage of profitable market-price homes would fall, the number could still be maximised. But such an increase in the density of development might have to be achieved by increasing its height, and Thomas is already unhappy with its reaching 20 storeys. Local people might feel the same way. This is a very basic description of a conundrum which captures the tensions between two of Khan’s most attractive and important policies. There are other influential interested parties involved, including Labour-run Harrow Council and local Labour London Assembly member Navin Shah. No plans for Harrow-on-the-Hill had been set in stone and there are always creative options for doing the difficult sums and for increasing housing density without increasing building heights. No doubt such things are being looked into. It will be instructive to see what happens next."
2016-09-06T10:44:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Black Lives Matter protest stops flights at London City airport,"Flights have been cancelled at London’s City airport after nine protesters from Black Lives Matter UK got on to the runway and chained themselves together. The airport said all flights were disrupted and that police were at the scene.
The Metropolitan police said nine protesters erected a tripod on the runway and locked themselves together just before dawn. By 9.30am, seven of them had been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass, being unlawfully airside, and breaching the airport’s bylaws. Two people remained locked together on the runway as officers negotiated with them. There were chaotic scenes at the departure lounge as a large queue of passengers snaked through the adjacent DLR station with some expressing their anger at the protest. The campaign said it carried out the protest to highlight the environmental impact of air travel on the lives of black people locally and globally. It posted images of protesters lying on the runway after unfurling banners.
Protesters reportedly swam or got a dinghy across the dock to reach the runway. A spokeswoman for BLMUK said she could not confirm or deny this. However, she did confirm that all the protesters who had chained themselves together on the runway were white. The group issued a video that said the reason for the protest was that the climate crisis was a “racist crisis”.
Passengers in the crowded lounge were waiting at check-in counters and customer service desks to find out what was happening to their flights. Departure information screens were awash with red, showing a significant number of cancellations, while airline staff handed out water and chocolates to aggrieved passengers. Flights were cancelled to Geneva, Milan, Luxembourg, Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Zurich, Florence, Majorca and Malaga. Flights to Dublin and Frankfurt were showing “indefinite delays”. Sarah Antoniou, 31, from London, was set to fly to Malaga on holiday with her husband and two children, one aged two and one aged five months, but her 9am flight has been cancelled. The family were rebooked on to a flight from Gatwick, about 26 miles away, at 6.40pm. “It is difficult flying with children,” she said. “They’re going to spend the whole first day of their holiday travelling. I’m running out of bottle for their milk. I allowed for some delay.” Antoniou said she understood the protest was against the expansion of the airport but had little sympathy. “I understand the concerns, but there are other ways of making your point, which won’t impact on young families,” she said. A 49-year-old passenger, who asked not to be named, had his flight home to Nigeria cancelled and he and his two companions were facing a 13-hour wait for the next one. “I can only wait,” he said. “I’ve been given a voucher for some light refreshment. I’m angry.” Discussing the protest, he said: “It’s ridiculous. Life is life, black or whatever colour, I don’t see any difference.” Pam and Lee Menzies-Banton, a married couple living in Bow, east London, were supposed to fly to Palma at 10am and were awaiting information. “The holiday is long overdue, we’re very tired,” said Pam, who works for a drug and alcohol treatment charity. “Many issues always affect the poorest in society,” she said. “But it has stopped these two black lives from going on holiday.” An 86-year-old woman, who asked not to be named, was waiting in a designated area for wheelchair users. She had been set to fly to Nice at 9am, but the flight was cancelled. “I’ve given up hope that we’re flying there,” she said. “I have mobility difficulties and it’s very difficult to travel.” In a statement, BLMUK said the protest was aimed at highlighting the economic disparity between the users of the airport and the people who lived in east London where it is based. “The average salary of a London City airport user is €136,000 … It is an airport designed for the wealthy. At the same time, 40% of Newham’s population struggle to survive on £20,000 or less.” It added: “By 2020, there will be 200 million climate refugees globally. Whilst at London City airport a small elite is able to fly, in 2016 alone 3,176 migrants are known to have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean, fleeing conditions that they did not create because cheaper, easier and most importantly, safer avenues have been blocked by the UK and other European countries. Black people are the first to die, not the first to fly, in this racist climate crisis.” The group called for further protests on Tuesday over a deportation flight to Jamaica later this month. Its statement said: “We note that the UK is willing to charter special flights to remove black people from the country based on their immigration status. We call on our supporters to join the demonstration against this, today at the Jamaica high commission.” Black Lives Matter UK, was launched last month as an offshoot of the international movement was set up in the US following the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida four years ago."
2016-09-06T12:24:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Police investigate alleged racist attack on 10-year-old in Bristol,"Police are investigating allegations of a racially motivated assault on a 10-year-old boy in Bristol by two other children. The alleged attack, which was said to have left the victim with injuries to his face and body, took place at around 5.30pm in Fishponds, in the north-east of the city. He was allegedly approached by two boys on Station Avenue South who took him to a nearby building site, racially abused and assaulted him. Two boys aged 11 and 12 were to be interviewed about the incident. A member of the public found the victim, who is of Asian ethnicity, and took him back to her home. He later received treatment at Bristol Royal children’s hospital before being discharged. DI Steve Cartlidge, from Avon and Somerset police, said: “We’re treating this as a racially motivated crime due to words used by the offenders during the assault. “Two boys, aged 12 and 11, have been identified and spoken to by officers and we’re arranging for them to be formally interviewed. “The victim is due to be video interviewed to gain a full picture of what happened. “Any form of hate crime will be thoroughly investigated and we will be supporting the victim’s family and keeping them fully informed of our progress.” He thanked the woman who went to the boy’s aid after the assault and appealed for anyone who was in the area at the time to contact police. The South Western ambulance service said it took a boy who was the suspected victim of an assault to hospital with a possible head injury."
2016-09-06T15:05:45Z,uk-news,UK news,HMRC cleaners call off industrial action after hours are reinstated,"Cleaners in HMRC offices in Merseyside have suspended industrial action after the subcontractor that employs them agreed to reinstate hours it had cut from their shifts to counter pay rises introduced with the government’s new ”national living wage” (NLW). The dispute was triggered when ISS, the company that employs the cleaners in a complex subcontracting chain, told staff in April that it could not afford the mandatory rise. It informed them it intended to claw back the 50p-an-hour increase in pay introduced by then chancellor George Osborne by cutting each worker’s hours so that their overall wages stayed the same. The cut in hours had a disproportionate effect on female cleaners because it pushed them below the 30-hour-a-week threshold that entitles them to working tax credits, the government’s cash top-up to low wages. Some cleaners were left £40-50 a week worse off as a result and were advised by help centres that they would be better off not working and claiming full benefits.
Following an initial strike in July, members of the Public and Commercial Services union had planned a further walkout from Monday across six HMRC sites. However, ISS has now agreed to reinstate the hours and halt proposals to reduce hours in other HMRC sites to allow for talks on long-term pay and conditions. The move follows a Guardian report exposing the cleaners’ plight. HMRC is responsible both for enforcement of the NLW and for paying working tax credits. Local MP Maria Eagle described the action of the companies as “beyond parody” and has written to the prime minister, Theresa May, asking why the government cannot make sure people who clean its own offices benefit from its own policy to raise pay for those on low wages. The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: “We welcome the restoration of cleaners’ hours, although this would never have been achieved without our members taking action. “We hope the company is genuinely committed to meaningful talks on this and other issues. And we hope HMRC and other government departments have got the message that we will not allow them to simply pass the buck when low-paid staff are being treated unfairly in their workplaces.” ISS is a transnational corporation and one of the largest employers in the world, with its headquarters in Denmark. It specialises in facilities management and doubled its profits last year to £250m. The origins of the arrangement for HMRC buildings date back to 2001, when the department sold off its estate of more than 600 buildings to Mapeley, a Bermuda-based offshore company, as part of a private finance initiative. The deal was condemned later by MPs as bad value and as undermining HMRC’s position as a tax collector. HMRC leases back buildings from a subsidiary of Mapeley; a further subsidiary, Salisbury FM, is contracted by Mapeley to manage the day-to-day running of the offices. Salisbury, in turn, subcontracts the cleaning to ISS. ISS said it was “pleased that the threatened industrial action has been suspended, pending the outcome of the proposals put forward by the company, who remain committed to continuing dialogue with the trades union and a satisfactory outcome for all”. After the two-day strike in July, ISS said: “We have a duty of care towards our staff, as well as a contractual responsibility to the client. As such, we look forward to resuming discussions with our people, and to do so with their PCS trade union representatives and the other key parties involved.” An HMRC spokesperson said: “HMRC is absolutely committed to every worker receiving at least the national living wage and we come down hard on employers, including our own suppliers, who don’t share that commitment. All those who work for our third party suppliers can be assured of our vigilance and determination to secure for all workers their legal entitlement to a living wage.”"
2016-09-06T17:36:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Anjem Choudary jailed for five-and-a-half years for urging support of Isis,"Anjem Choudary, who preached hate over two decades with seeming impunity from legal punishment, has been jailed for five years and six months for his activities to support Islamic State. Choudary was sentenced at the Old Bailey in London after his conviction in July of urging Muslims to support Isis in a series of talks posted on YouTube. He was convicted alongside his acolyte Mohammed Rahman, 33, who was also sentenced to five years and six months in prison. Choudary’s supporters in the public gallery shouted “Allahu Akbar” (God is greatest) as the judge finished sentencing. The offence carried a maximum of ten years in jail and Choudary will serve two years behind bars, which he believes will be wholly or mostly spent in solitary confinement, to stop him turning vulnerable inmates towards terrorism. Choudary, 49, avoided serious criminal charges for years, but his conviction for terrorism was agreed unanimously by a jury. Sentencing the pair, the judge said they would remain a danger, even in prison, telling them: “I regard each of you as dangerous. You show no remorse at all for anything you have said or done and I have no doubt you will continue to communicate your message whenever you can.” The judge added: “The jury were sure that you knowingly crossed the line between the legitimate expression of your own views and the criminal act of inviting support for an organisation which was at the time engaged in appalling acts of terrorism.” The judge said both men justified Isis’s most appalling acts and expressed contempt for democracy. They had “encouraged your audience ... to believe that no one who failed to support the caliphate established by Isis could be a true Muslim,” the judge said. Choudary was a key figure for a succession of Islamic militant groups. He was dismissed as a clown by some, but helped motivate at least 100 young people to turn to terrorism in Britain and Europe.The judge imposed an order called a notification period, to last 15 years, meaning conditions could be placed on the pair when they are released.
The “hate preacher” and Rahman told their supporters to obey Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Isis leader, who is also known as a caliph, and travel to Syria to support “the caliphate”, the trial had heard. He was a key figure in al-Muhajiroun, which was banned under terrorism legislation and relaunched itself as al-Ghurabaa, only to be banned again. Successor groups were also banned, including Islam4UK and Muslims Against Crusades. Choudary’s barrister, Mark Summers QC, said his client regretted breaking the law. Summers urged the judge, Mr Justice Holroyde, not to sentence Choudary on the basis of his 20 years of notoriety, or over claims that he had indoctrinated “a generation of people to commit direct acts of terrorism”. He said: “Mr Choudary has done his best to stay within the law, acting on the boundaries of it maybe, but determined to stay within the law.” Summers painted a picture of a man touched by remorse, facing solitary confinement, and said Choudary would not offend in the future. “He has had time to reflect, and on reflection would have done things differently had he known the boundaries of the law. He is determined not to cross those boundaries in the future.” Summers said the extremist’s invitations of support for Isis were intellectual calls, not incitements to violence, and there was no evidence anyone acted on them. The conviction came after an investigation by Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command. Detectives assessed 20 years worth of material held on 333 electronic devices containing 12.1TB of data. Commander Dean Haydon, head of counter-terrorism at Scotland Yard, said: “We have watched Choudary developing a media career as spokesman for the extremists, saying the most distasteful of comments, but without crossing the criminal threshold. Their recent speeches and the oath of allegiance were a turning point for the police: at last we had the evidence that they had stepped over the line and we could prove they were actively encouraging support of Isis. “This has been a significant prosecution in our fight against terrorism and we will now be working with communities to ensure that they are not replaced by others spreading hate.”
Between August and September 2014, Choudary and Rahman posted speeches on YouTube encouraging support for Isis. An audio clip, lasting one hour and six minutes and uploaded to Choudary’s YouTube channel on 9 September 2014, was played to jurors. Titled How Muslims Assess the Legitimacy of the Caliphate, the speech was played over the image of a map of northern Africa, the Middle East, north-west Asia and southern Europe. Choudary starts by setting out his views about the requirements of a legitimate Islamic caliphate, then explains why he sees Islamic State as meeting the criteria. “The lesson from this narration is that obedience to the caliph is an obligation, if they rule by the sharia. And to obey them obviously means they must be established,” Choudary says in the clip. Choudary trained as a lawyer and described himself as a student of Omar Bakri Mohammed, an extremist who fled Britain in 2005."

The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) confirmed on Tuesday that it had found a “significant amount of terrorist material” during a search operation in the County Antrim port town. The PSNI said the find included explosive devices and bomb-making parts as well as chemicals, ammunition and a gun. The searches across the County Antrim port town were a joint operation between the PSNI and the Metropolitan police. Among the locations searched around Larne today was a disused quarry and a number of addresses in the town. The PSNI assistant chief constable in charge of anti-terrorist police operations in Northern Ireland said that the Larne and the entire province is “safer in general as a result” of these latest finds. Two major hauls of weapons were uncovered in March and May of this year at two wooded areas outside Larne. Last month a Royal Marine, Ciaran Maxwell, was arrested in connection with terrorism, fraud and drug offences. The 30-year-old solider, originally from Larne, pleaded not guilty on Monday to the drug and fraud charges, which will be tried in conjunction with the alleged terrorism offences at the Old Bailey on 19 September."
2016-09-06T18:00:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Nine Black Lives Matter protesters arrested after City airport travel chaos,"Nine activists who said they were from Black Lives Matter UK were arrested on Tuesday after storming the runway at London City airport and chaining themselves together in a six-hour protest that caused severe travel disruption. Dozens of flights were cancelled or rescheduled at the airport, in Newham, east London, as police struggled to remove the group, who erected a wooden tripod on the runway and secured themselves to the structure as well as each other.
The Black Lives Matter group said the demonstration aimed to highlight the disproportionate impact air pollution had on black people in a wide-ranging press release that also cited the deteriorating environment in Newham, the wealthy clientele at London City airport, the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean, the impact climate change has on sub-Saharan Africa and immigration deportations as motives behind the action. There were chaotic scenes at the departure lounge of the airport near Canary Wharf, as a queue of passengers snaked through an adjacent DLR railway station, with some expressing their anger and confusion over the motive behind the protest. Applause broke out in the departure lounge when the conclusion of the protest was announced over a loudspeaker. Prominent black rights activists accused the Black Lives Matter movement in the UK of “cultural appropriation” as it emerged all nine protesters on the runway were white, but it garnered support from environmental groups.
The Metropolitan police said all nine had been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass, being unlawfully airside and breaching the airport’s bylaws. In a statement, the Black Lives Matter group UK said: “The average salary of a London City airport user is €136,000 [£114,000] … It is an airport designed for the wealthy. At the same time, 40% of Newham’s population struggle to survive on £20,000 or less. “By 2020, there will be 200 million climate refugees globally. While at London City airport, a small elite is able to fly, in 2016 alone, 3,176 migrants are known to have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean, fleeing conditions that they did not create because cheaper, easier and most importantly, safer avenues have been blocked by the UK and other European countries. Black people are the first to die, not the first to fly, in this racist climate crisis.”
The activists reportedly swam or took a dinghy across a dock to reach the runway. The last protester on top of the tripod was removed when police used a mobile airline staircase to reach him. Black rights figures including Stafford Scott and Lee Jasper, a former equality adviser to Ken Livingstone, were publicly critical of the protest, accusing white, leftwing activists of hijacking the Black Lives Matter banner. “It’s cultural appropriation. Even our struggle no longer our own,” Jasper said on Twitter. But Friends of the Earth said the group was right to draw attention to the disproportionate impact air pollution has on ethnic minorities. Asad Rehman, a Friends of the Earth climate campaigner and Newham resident, said: “Air pollution disproportionately harms black and poorer communities, who are more likely to live in areas with poor air quality. Black Lives Matter UK are right to draw attention to this reality. The expansion of City airport is not compatible with our urgent need to reduce air pollution in London, nor our need to reduce global warming.” Departure information screens at City airport, which is popular with business travellers, showed a significant number of cancellations. Airline staff handed out water and chocolates to aggrieved passengers. Among the cancellations were flights to Geneva, Milan, Luxembourg, Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Zürich, Florence, Mallorca and Málaga. Flights to Dublin and Frankfurt were showing “indefinite delays”.
Sarah Antoniou, 31, from London, was due to fly to Málaga on holiday with her husband and two children, a two-year-old and a five-month-old baby, but her 9am flight was cancelled. The family were rebooked on to a flight from Gatwick, about 26 miles away, at 6.40pm. “It is difficult flying with children,” she said. “They’re going to spend the whole first day of their holiday travelling. I’m running out of bottles for their milk. I allowed for some delay.” Antoniou said she understood the protest was against the expansion of the airport, but had little sympathy. “I understand the concerns, but there are other ways of making your point, which won’t impact on young families,” she said.
A 49-year-old passenger, who asked not to be named, had his flight home to Nigeria cancelled, meaning he and his two companions faced a 13-hour wait for the next one. “I can only wait,” he said. “I’ve been given a voucher for some light refreshment. I’m angry.” Discussing the protest, he said: “It’s ridiculous. Life is life, black or whatever colour, I don’t see any difference.” Pam and Lee Menzies-Banton from Bow, east London, were due to fly to Palma at 10am and were awaiting information. “The holiday is long overdue, we’re very tired,” said Pam, who works for a drug and alcohol treatment charity. “Many issues always affect the poorest in society,” she said. “But it has stopped these two black lives from going on holiday.”
Frank and Margaretta Bell were waiting for information about their delayed flight to the Isle of Man, where they were hoping to spend four days as part of an annual trip with friends. Frank, 80, and Margaretta, 78, were unaware that the protest was organised by Black Lives Matter UK and understood it to be a demonstration against the treatment of refugees. “We all care and feel about that,” Frank said. “At our age, this is a bit frustrating.”
Margaretta said: “They were taking a long time [removing the protesters] and someone said something about how human rights are involved in how they will be removed. What about the human rights of the people forced to wait in the airport for their flights?”
Black Lives Matter set up in the US following the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida four years ago. Since then offshoot groups have emerged internationally."
2016-09-06T18:04:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Met police pause plan to introduce spit hoods,"The Metropolitan police have said they will pause plans to introduce spit hoods after a torrent of criticism from human rights groups. The Guardian understands that the Met failed to tell the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, about the controversial scheme that was due to start within weeks. A spokesperson for the mayor’s office for policing and crime – which supposedly oversees the Met – said: “The mayor has not been consulted about this decision, and we will be looking into the details of the scheme before the pilot starts.” On Monday the Guardian reported that the spit hoods, which the Met calls spit guards, would be introduced by Britain’s biggest force in October. The Met says the restraint devices are necessary to protect officers from prisoners who try to spit at or bite them, exposing them to the risk of serious infection. The Met was planning to start using them in 32 police station detention areas across London in a pilot scheme. On Tuesday, the Met announced a pause to the plans while it consulted further. It said it had taken the decision in February to pilot the spit hoods, and claimed to have held consultations. But in a statement the Met said: “However, with a new administration coming into City Hall since then, the MPS [Metropolitan police service] has listened to concerns and will consult further before starting any pilot.” The mesh hoods have proved controversial, and there have been claims that they breach suspects’ rights and could even be dangerous. Spitting at officers exposes them to risks of contracting hepatitis and such “attacks” by suspects have led to police taking powerful antiviral drugs as a precaution. The Met in its statement laid out its view of the background to the pilot, which could have gone on to clear the way for officers on the street to be issued with spit hoods. The Met said: “A pilot within the controlled environment of custody suites had been arranged for October. This was agreed by the MPS policy forum in February, which is made up of officers and staff from across the organisation. “A consultation process regarding their use has taken place and involved community advisers from Newham’s independent advisory group, in addition to local magistrates and judicial staff.” A spokesperson for the London mayor’s office for policing and crime said: “Any attack on officers carrying out their duties is completely unacceptable, and the use of protective equipment is sometimes necessary. The decision on whether to use intrusive tactics is a highly emotive one and should be informed by public engagement. We will be discussing the details with the Met and will consult closely with them, and see what further consultation may be appropriate, ahead of any pilot.” The Met had previously opposed the use of the restraint devices, and some police chiefs have privately expressed concerns that they are reminiscent of hoods used at Guantánamo Bay. The Met’s plan to introduce them was condemned by the human rights group Amnesty International, the civil rights group Liberty and the campaign group Inquest, which helps those who claim to have suffered at police hands. In response to the Met police’s suspension of the planned pilot, Amnesty International UK’s arms programme director, Oliver Sprague, said: “We’re relieved that the Met police has decided to put the brakes on what was a very controversial decision. “What’s urgently needed now is detailed national guidance on how these restraints can be used, the exact models which are used by all forces and assurances that this barbaric equipment will only be used when absolutely necessary.” The Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, has called for the use of the hoods to protect police. The Met says the deployment of the hoods will be classed as a use of force by an officer. Before the Met announced that it was not going ahead with the pilot, Martha Spurrier, the director of Liberty, said: “A spit hood is a primitive, cruel and degrading tool that inspires fear and anguish. We have seen many cases where the police use them unnecessarily and without justification, including on children and disabled people. “Police have the power to use force against citizens when they have to – using handcuffs, arm restraints, leg restraints, pepper spray, batons. The suggestion that officers need to be able to cover people’s faces and heads is as far-fetched as it is frightening. Spit hoods belong in horror stories, not on the streets of a civilised society.”"
2016-09-06T18:55:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Protest at Jamaican embassy in London against deportation flight,"Protesters have gathered outside the Jamaican high commission in south-west London to demonstrate against Jamaica’s cooperation with a deportation flight due to take off on Wednesday morning. Mothers, fathers and grandparents are among those due to be forcibly removed from the UK to Jamaica despite many of them having spent their entire adult lives in Britain. In some cases they are still fighting their immigration cases, activists said. Critics have raised questions about the tactics used by Home Office immigration enforcement, which has been accused of “strategically” detaining individuals to fill the flight, without consideration of their circumstances. The Unity Centre, a Glasgow-based migration support collective, said in a statement that it has spoken to more than 50 of the passengers booked on the flight, all of who came to the UK as children but have failed to regularise their immigration status. It says all but one of them have British children, one has been married to a British national for 12 years, and two are full-time carers to their partners. Many have never been convicted of a criminal offence. Hilary Brown, managing director of the law firm Virgo Consultancy Services, based in south London, said she had managed to get clients taken off the flight by filing judicial reviews of the actions taken by the Home Office. One of those clients is a woman in her 60s who was married to a British man but whose application for indefinite leave to remain was held up by so much bureaucracy that her husband died before it was completed, Brown said. After her husband’s death, she was told she no longer had a case to stay, despite having children and grandchildren in the UK. She was seized on Friday at her daughter’s house and taken into immigration detention. Another Jamaican on the flight is Twane Morgan, 33, from Birmingham, a veteran of the British army who suffers from post-traumatic stress and bipolar disorder after two tours of Afghanistan. His sister, Tenisha Morgan, said he was detained a fortnight ago after he went to sign on at an immigration centre. He was served with a deportation order three years ago after a conviction for GBH, she said. “He’s got kids here, he’s got a young baby here [of] four months old,” Tenisha Morgan said. “They are not taking those into consideration. He’s got family here, he’s got people to support him. When he goes to Jamaica he’s going to be a madman on the street. I don’t want to hear that my brother is dead. He’s got no one in Jamaica, totally no one.” She said her brother’s mental health problems began after his two tours of Afghanistan, during which he saw friends killed. She believed that the act that led to his conviction was related his mental ill-health. He is reliant on strong injections of sedatives to keep his mental health problems in check, medicines that would not be available to him in Jamaica, she said. Activists believe this is the first immigration removal flight to Jamaica since November 2014. Brown said it seemed that immigration enforcement was acting quickly in an effort to prevent those being removed from making legal challenges. “What you can do is go to the high court and challenge the fact that you are not being given an in-country appeal and that in itself is a breach of your human rights,” she said. “But what they are doing is they are trying to snatch these people away very quickly before the three months [time limit for lodging a judicial review] is up so the lawyers may be trying to gather all of the evidence to make sure the Home Office knows everything … before we’ve gathered that and before the three months is up they will try to put them on the plane.” Lee Jasper, the veteran black-rights activist and former equalities adviser to the mayor of London, wrote a plea to the Jamaican government on the Facebook page for the protest. “The people on that flight have lived in Britain for years. Some have committed criminal offences, most have not. We urge you not to accept this charter flight that constitutes a grave infringement of the human rights of [Jamaicans] living in the UK,” he said. The Home Office declined to comment on Tuesday evening."
2016-09-06T19:46:22Z,uk-news,UK news,Ireland confident EU will keep Northern Irish border open post-Brexit,"Ireland has said it is hopeful that the common travel area allowing freedom of movement between Northern Ireland and the Republic will survive Brexit talks. The country’s ambassador to the UK, Daniel Mulhall, told a House of Lords select committee on Tuesday that he was satisfied the country’s EU partners would “not want to create unnecessary problems for Ireland” because they recognise the “unique circumstances” involved in the region.
Irish and British citizens currently have special status in each other’s countries with full rights to live, work and vote without abandoning citizenship of their country of birth. But fears have been expressed that this arrangement would be at risk post-Brexit as the Northern Ireland border would automatically become an external EU border. Mulhall, a former ambassador to Germany and first secretary in Brussels, told the Lords’ select committee on the European Union: “I have experienced from EU colleagues over the years a considerable understanding of the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland; there will be willingness on the part of our EU partners to be sensitive to any concerns that arise in relation to Northern Ireland.” He also said he hoped that cross-border trade would remain customs-free. Britain is Ireland’s largest trading partner and two-way trade between the countries stands at about £1bn a week, with an equal trading balance in imports and exports. Mulhall said that economic ties to Northern Ireland had improved since the Good Friday agreement brought peace, but that there was still a long way to go. In normal circumstances, trading partners on one island would have an “intense” relationship, and while trade has improved between the Republic and Northern Ireland, “there was still a long way to go” he said. “I believe our EU partners … would be very slow to do anything that would in any way cut across or create difficulties for north/south relations as they develop as part of our peace process.”
Mulhall said that anything that got in the way of the potential economic development would be unwelcome. He hinted that Ireland would be lobbying for closest possible relationship between Britain and the EU in negotiations, but said it could not act as a “broker” as Ireland remained, and wished to remain, part of the EU. “Our interests are in the future evolution of the EU,” he said. Separately, legal experts called on the government to introduce new legislation that would ensure “stage by stage” scrutiny of Brexit talks by parliament. Derrick Wyatt QC, emeritus professor of law at Oxford University, told the committee that current rules under the Constitutional Reform and Government Act 2010, did not allow for scrutiny of the process as it took place. It was “just not right” for negotiations to be presented “as a fait accompli” to parliament after being negotiated behind closed doors, he said. Wyatt said scrutiny should be used to encourage the government to “think outside the box” and to “test their own internal advice”."
2016-09-07T09:30:27Z,uk-news,UK news,"Sadiq Khan's TfL board is impressively diverse. Now, how good are its maths?","The board of Transport for London (TfL) is, as Sadiq Khan promised, no longer dominated by white males. The new mayor’s appointees, announced on Tuesday, comprise seven women and five men who will join Khan himself, the board’s chair, and his deputy for transport Val Shawcross. They include business executives, an engineer, financial experts, transport campaigners and policy wonks and will be augmented by a union representative to be nominated by the TUC, a move that has prompted expressions of disquiet from London Assembly Tories, though Boris Johnson’s first TfL board actually included two union officials. Had such input been maintained, perhaps he’d have presided over fewer Tube strikes. Almost a third of the new board, whose role is to scrutinise and approve TfL spending and major policies, will come from ethnic minority groups - there was no BAME representation under Johnson - and there’s an increased representation of disabled people. In addition, the size of the board has been reduced by two - from 17 to 15 - and City Hall says payments to its members have been “restructured” to save £190,000 a year. Khan has hailed it as “slimmed down and representative”. Well done for all that. Now comes the hard part. When they meet for the first time on 22 September, board members who are earning their reduced but still quite tidy £16-£20,000 a year will have done some bracing homework on the financial challenges TfL faces under a mayor who needs to bridge a budget gap his own key policies have widened. Khan’s promised (and, so far, only partial) freeze of public transport fares, due to take effect at the start of the New Year, will lessen the revenue the transport body had based its financial plans on at the same time as the government is depriving it of grant. Meanwhile, Khan’s wish for 50% of homes built on TfL land to be “affordable” to middle-income first-time buyers points to a further reduction in income for funding the fares freeze than would have been the case, unless that part of the commercial development programme is adapted or intensified. Can these circles be squared? A novel aspect of the election campaign was the Labour candidate insisting that TfL, though good in many ways, could be a leaner and more entrepreneurial business machine, while his Conservative rival protested that any funding cut in the form of the fares freeze would wreck its finances - this following years of Tory complaints that TfL is inefficient, “bloated” and so on. It isn’t difficult to find impressive persons, most notably non-politicians, who’ve dealt with TfL’s culture and accounting practices who think Khan is absolutely right. But others firmly disagree. Responding on Twitter to my piece about TfL’s upgrade plans for Harrow-on-the-Hill station, a project in which some of the questions about how Khan will make TfL’s ends meet are distilled, the Conservative now former TfL board deputy chair and Johnson transport lieutenant Daniel Moylan predicted that the outcome of Khan’s approach will be that he “will force TfL to postpone yet further necessary capacity upgrades”. Another experienced hand, who shall remain nameless, believes the ultimate direction of travel will be to the Treasury for a chat with a man called Mr Hammond, cap in hand and armed with arguments about the crucial importance of London’s economy to post-Brexit Britain’s wellbeing. It is notable that one of the mere two members to survive from Johnson’s time, albeit on two-year contracts compared with the others’ four, is Conservative clean energy businessman Michael Liebreich (the other survivor is Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson). Liebreich seriously considered seeking to become the Tory mayoral candidate before deferring to Zac Goldsmith but was not a signatory to a letter sent in April to the Zac-backing Evening Standard from six fellow board members, including Moylan, arguing that a Khan fares freeze would “mean a cut in investment”. As its eclectic personnel show, the new board will quite rightly be concerned with far more than TfL’s balance sheet. But with a revised TfL business plan, the government autumn statement and his own transport strategy very much in mind, Khan will want all the number-crunching muscle on his side that he can get."
2016-09-07T11:11:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Nine people charged over Black Lives Matter protest at City airport,"Nine activists who said they were from Black Lives Matter UK have been charged with trespassing after a protest on the runway at London City airport. William Pettifer, 27, of Radford; Esme Waldron, 23, from Brighton; Natalie Fiennes, 25, of Wandsworth, south London; Deborah Francis-Grayson, 31, from Slough; Richard Collet-White, 23, of Kempston and Ben Tippet, 24, from Wandsworth, have been charged with aggravated trespass and being unlawfully airside within a restricted area of an aerodrome. Sama Baka, 27, Alex Etchart, 26, and Sam Lund-Harket, 32, who are listed as living on a houseboat on the river Stort, Roydon, face the same charges. They have been released on bail to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 14 September. Dozens of flights were cancelled or rescheduled at the airport in Newham, east London, on Tuesday as police dealt with a demonstration.
Black Lives Matter UK said it aimed to highlight the disproportionate impact air pollution had on black people. But the group confused some with its wide-ranging press release, which also listed the deteriorating environment in Newham, the wealthy clientele at London City airport, the migration crisis in the Mediterranean, the impact climate change has on sub-Saharan Africa and immigration deportations as motives behind the action. The protest also triggered a debate over the authenticity of Black Lives Matter UK when it emerged all nine protesters were white, with prominent black rights activists accusing the group of “cultural appropriation”. Stafford Scott and Lee Jasper, a former equality adviser to Ken Livingstone, were publicly critical of the protest, accusing white leftwing activists of hijacking the Black Lives Matter banner. “It’s cultural appropriation. Even our struggle [is] no longer our own,” Jasper said on Twitter. But environmental group Friends of the Earth said the group was right to draw attention to the disproportionate impact air pollution has on ethnic minorities. Flights were cancelled to Geneva, Milan, Luxembourg, Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Zürich, Florence, Mallorca and Málaga. Flights to Dublin and Frankfurt were showing “indefinite delays”.

2016-09-07T11:45:22Z,uk-news,UK news,Mother of boy allegedly beaten in racist attack releases images of injuries,"The mother of a 10-year-old boy who was allegedly the victim of a racist attack by two other children in Bristol has released images of the youngster’s injuries. Awais Ali was walking to a friend’s house to play video games when two slightly older boys allegedly called him “Paki” and demanded that he hand over his phone and money. He did not have any cash but the boys allegedly dragged him to a disused building in the Fishponds area of Bristol where they hit him with a stick – which snapped – before striking him with a rubber or plastic pipe. Ali suffered injuries to his head, ribs, shoulder blades, his left leg and arms and had a trainer mark imprinted on his back from where they allegedly stood on him. His mother, Anisa Iqbal, 33, whose family moved from Pakistan 50 years ago, claimed: “They said ‘Oi, Paki, stop, where are you going?’ And demanded money. My son said he didn’t have any. “They were holding his arms from the back so he wouldn’t run away. He tried to shout but nobody heard him. “While he was up there they started hitting him with a wooden stick. Then the wooden stick broke and they hit him with a pipe on his head and his back.” Awais managed to break free and was rescued by a woman driving home from work who saw him crawling along the fence of the building site, crying for help, covered in blood. She let him use her phone to call his mother, who was out at the time, before driving him home where his brother looked after him. Iqbal added: “When I arrived he was sat on the settee covered in blood and looked really shaken.” The family has agreed for photos of the injuries to be published to raise awareness of racism. Iqbal said her son has had trouble sleeping since the attack. The boy’s mother said: “He used to sleep in his own bed but he’s stopped since the incident. He now sleeps in my bed with me and even in the night when he’s turning he says ‘Ouch that hurts’. “I’ve had to wake up in the night to give him painkillers. He was too frightened to go to school the next day. He needed a lot of convincing from the schoolteacher and myself to come into school.” Iqbal, who has three other children, said: “I’ve lived in England my whole life and I’ve never experienced racist abuse. It was a very big shock. “I read the paper a lot and when I hear of incidents like this I think how can that happen? But obviously it can happen because it happened to my son.” Police have launched an investigation and have already spoken to two boys, aged 11 and 12, who are to be formally interviewed on Wednesday. Det Insp Steve Cartlidge said: “Any form of hate crime will be thoroughly investigated and we will be supporting the victim’s family and keeping them fully informed of our progress. “We’d like to thank the local community for the help they’ve already provided to us, as well as the woman who came to the victim’s aid following the assault. “If anyone has information about this incident, or if you were in the Station Avenue South area of Fishponds at the time it happened, please call us as soon as possible.” A police spokesman said on Wednesday: “Two boys are due to be formally interviewed by officers today. A video statement has now been taken from the victim. Our inquiries into this incident are continuing.”"
2016-09-07T13:21:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Man accused of Becky Godden murder 'was besotted with her',"A taxi driver serving a life sentence for the brutal killing of a young woman also murdered a sex worker several years earlier, after becoming besotted with her, a jury has been told. Christopher Halliwell, who was jailed for abducting and murdering office worker Sian O’Callaghan in 2011, was a regular customer of Becky Godden, who went missing eight years earlier, Bristol crown court heard. After O’Callaghan’s body was found, Halliwell took police to the remote rural spot where he allegedly buried Godden and said he strangled her after sex, the jury was told. Halliwell, 52, from Swindon, now denies murder. The first witness to give evidence in person at Halliwell’s trial was a former sex worker who can only be identified Miss X. She told the jury that Halliwell was “a bit besotted” with Godden, 20, and sometimes gave her money so she did not have to work.
Miss X claimed that Halliwell had been her own customer on two occasions. “I would obviously recognise him because I’ve been up close and personal with him,” she said. On the first occasion, Miss X and Halliwell went to an industrial estate in Swindon, and on the second they went to his flat, it was alleged. During the second liaison, Halliwell showed Miss X images of “Thai brides” on his desktop computer, she told the jury. Halliwell asked her not to mention to Godden that he had been with her, Miss X claimed. Halliwell, who is defending himself, cross-examined Miss X from the dock, where he was surrounded by security guards. He told Miss X he had never seen her before, adding: “I don’t have to tell you how serious this matter is. Please take a good, hard look at me and confirm the person you are thinking of is me.” Miss X stared at Halliwell and replied: “It definitely is you.” Halliwell later told the court: “I’ve never seen that woman before … it is a fairytale.” Miss X said: “I don’t understand how he can sit there and say he doesn’t know me. I’m a hundred, million percent sure.” The court has heard that Godden was last seen around January 2003 getting into a taxi outside a nightclub. Her death only came to light after Halliwell was arrested over the sexually motivated murder of 22-year-old Sian O’Callaghan, whom he abducted after she left a nightclub in Swindon in March 2011.
Police took Halliwell to the spot at the side of a country road in Oxfordshire where O’Callaghan’s body was found. While there, he allegedly told a police officer: “I’m a sick fucker.” He is said to have then led the police to a remote ploughed field in Gloucestershire, where he allegedly admitted he had buried the body of a woman he had picked up in Swindon town centre. The remains were eventually found and identified as those of Godden through DNA analysis. Nicholas Haggan QC, prosecuting, has told the court there were similarities between Godden and O’Callaghan. Both were slim, petite and attractive. They both vanished from Swindon town centre and were last seen leaving nightclubs. Their bodies were both disposed of in rural locations. The trial continues."
2016-09-07T14:50:35Z,uk-news,UK news,"Carbon monoxide killed boy at flooded home in Surrey, coroner rules","A seven-year-old boy found dead during severe flooding at his Surrey home died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a petrol-powered pump used to remove floodwater from his home and not from deadly hydrogen cyanide gas from a nearby former landfill site, a coroner has ruled. Zane Gbangbola was found lifeless in the early hours of 8 February 2014 at his home in Chertsey by his mother, Nicole Lawler, 39. His father, Kye Gbangbola, 50, was left paralysed from the waist down in the same incident. Recording a verdict of accidental death, the senior Surrey coroner Richard Travers said he was “satisfied on the balance of probabilities that carbon monoxide toxicity is established as cause of death”. He said evidence he had heard over the five-week hearing had led him to conclude on the balance of probabilities that “hydrogen cyanide toxicity played no part in Zane’s death”. Zane’s parents, who have claimed throughout that their son was killed by floodwater contaminated by hydrogen cyanide gas leaking into their home, left the inquest clearly upset as the coroner delivered his final conclusions. In an emotional statement on the steps of Woking coroner’s court, they rejected the verdict and said they would be seeking an independent review. The inquest heard that Lawler, a company director, had hired a petrol-driven pump from Surrey Hire and Sales, Addlestone, on 6 February 2014, which had been used inside the family’s semi-detached Edwardian home on the day of Zane’s death to pump water from the flood basement. The coroner had praised the “very real dignity” of Zane’s parents in the way they had conducted themselves, and offered his “sincere condolences on Zane’s tragic death” as he began his conclusions. But he said he was unable to accept all of their evidence. Though both insisted to him that the pump had been used for only a few minutes earlier that day to test it and set it up, and that they had purchased no petrol for it, the coroner said the accounts they had provided to him were not accurate and he could not accept them. He said: “On a human level I can sympathise with them and the difficulties they face,” but he added: “I must decide dispassionately where the truth lies.” He found the pump had been used as late as 6.30pm on the day Zane died, that there was sufficient petrol to run it for six hours, and that its use would have resulted in “significant levels of carbon monoxide within the house”. The downstairs area where it was positioned was “not sufficiently well ventilated” and the gas would have travelled up the stairwell to the first floor and into the bedrooms where Zane was sleeping in one and his father working in another, he said. The pump was found in the “on” position, indicating it had run until it was out of petrol, he said. Zane was found at 3.30am by his mother checking on him. His father was found collapsed. In three sweeps of the property by emergency services immediately after the incident, one alarm appeared to indicate the presence of hydrogen cyanide gas at 10 parts per million by the front door, the coroner said. But, he added, that alarm could also have been triggered by nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide, and the presence of hydrogen cyanide was not confirmed in further tests. Carbon monoxide was not detected in the house in any of the three sweeps, he said, but it would have dissipated when doors and windows were opened by emergency crews. Blood tests on all three members of the family showed them to have elevated levels of carboxyhaemoglobin. Though Zane’s blood reading of carboxyhaemoglobin was 8%, “lower than normally found in deaths caused by carbon monoxide”, he found it was “not incompatible with death”. Blood tests for hydrogen cyanide levels were found to be normal in all three, and he had seen no evidence from any clinician that Kye Gbangbola’s rhabdomyolysis – muscle paralysis – resulted from exposure to hydrogen cyanide. Tests carried out on land and water from the former landfill site, which is now a lake, did not reveal “any evidence of a source of hydrogen cyanide or indeed any other toxic gases”. The coroner criticised staff at Surrey Hire and Sales, saying he found they had advised Lawler that the pump could be used inside the home provided it was ventilated, which they had denied. He also found no safety instructions were provided with the pump. He said he had not found either of the two SHS staff to be “impressive or reliable witnesses” and he believed Lawler when she described them as treating her dismissively as “a silly woman”. He would be making recommendations over the tightening up of advice given by the Hire Association Europe over safety instructions issued with equipment. A statement from Zane’s parents, read outside the court by Lawler, said they were “profoundly concerned by the conduct, the content and the outcome of Zane’s inquest” and would be requesting an independent panel of inquiry, as in the Hillsborough inquest, to review all documentation. They criticised the fact that they had to crowdfund their legal representation after being denied legal aid, and were refused a jury inquest. There had been “clear deficiencies in the administration of evidence”, Lawler said, and “primary concerns were not addressed”. “Only when all the evidence is assessed by a panel with the collective expertise to provide a through and open examination of all the available material and to make informed recommendations will we consider that the state has acted in the best interests and therefore in the public interest,” said Lawler. Breaking down in tears, she added: “At the top of this was a deeply loved boy, a very special little boy. The world is a much poorer place without Zane. “Our love for Zane keeps us going and whilst we have breath in our bodies we will fight to expose the inconvenient truth.”"
2016-09-07T15:53:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Becky Godden murder trial: mother recalls last time she saw daughter,"The mother of a young woman missing for eight years until a taxi driver allegedly led police to the spot where he had buried her body has told a court she had always believed her daughter would one day return. Becky Godden’s remains lay in a Gloucestershire field until Christopher Halliwell allegedly took officers to her shallow grave after he was arrested on suspicion of the murder of another young woman, Sian O’Callaghan. Godden’s mother, Karen Edwards, described her as a “happy little soul” who became a sex worker to pay for a drug habit. She said: “I never thought she wouldn’t be coming back. Then we heard about remains at Eastleach [the field in Gloucestershire] on the news. I feared the worst but I never thought deep down that it was Becky. I ask myself where it all went wrong.” Bristol crown court has been told that Godden, 20, was last seen getting into a taxi outside a nightclub in Swindon in January 2003. In 2011 Halliwell was arrested over the sexually motivated murder of O’Callaghan, and the prosecution claims he told police he had strangled another woman some years earlier. He is said to have taken police to the field, where Godden’s remains were found. Halliwell, 52, from Swindon, denies murder. In a statement read out in court, Edwards said Godden fell into drug addiction and began running away from home aged 15. The family assumed she was working as a prostitute as she had money to buy drugs, but never “mentally accepted it”, she said. At 16, Godden managed to get clean from drugs and started working at Reader’s Digest. “I felt so relieved and thought the bad times were over,” Edwards said. “After about a year of being clean, Becky began socialising with her old circle of friends and got dragged back into the world of drugs.” Edwards said she last spoke to Godden on 16 December 2002 after picking her up from Swindon magistrates court. “She had conditions to stay at my house,” her statement said. “On the way home she said she wanted to see her boyfriend. She begged me and said she would just be half an hour. “After a while she came back out and told me she wanted to stay longer. I became firm with Becky as I knew the best place for her was at home. When she was begging me I told her she had two choices: get into the car with me and go home or take her bag and not come running back. “Becky took her bag and told me she would come home when she was clean. That was the last time I saw her.” Godden’s family reported her missing to police but she was not dealt with as a missing person, the court heard. “It was just a waiting game,” Edwards’ statement said. “We talked about her as though she would turn up one day.” The first witness to give evidence in person at Halliwell’s trial was a former sex worker who can only be identified Miss X. She told the jury that Halliwell was “a bit besotted” with Godden and gave her money so that she did not have to work. Miss X claimed Halliwell was her customer on two occasions. “I would obviously recognise him because I’ve been up close and personal with him,” she said. On the first occasion they went to an industrial estate in Swindon, and on the other they went to his flat, it was alleged. During the second liaison, Halliwell showed Miss X images of “Thai brides” on his desktop computer, she told the jury. Halliwell told her not to mention to Godden that he had seen her, Miss X claimed. Halliwell, who is defending himself, cross-examined Miss X from the dock, where he was surrounded by security guards. He told Miss X he had never seen her before, adding: “I don’t have to tell you how serious this matter is. Please take a good, hard look at me and confirm the person you are thinking of is me.” Miss X stared at Halliwell and replied: “It definitely is you.” Halliwell later told the court: “I’ve never seen that woman before … it is a fairytale.” Miss X said: “I don’t understand how he can sit there and say he doesn’t know me. I’m a hundred, million per cent sure.” The trial continues."
2016-09-07T16:58:56Z,uk-news,UK news,Father acquitted by jury of killing son held responsible by high court judge,"A father who was acquitted by a jury of killing his six-week-old son has been named as the person responsible for his death in a ruling by a high court judge. Craig Beattie, 35, was found not guilty of the manslaughter of his son, Kye Kerr, following a trial at Liverpool crown court in November last year. The baby died after being found unconscious by his mother in his basket at the family home in Carlisle in 2011. It was later found that he had sustained a fractured skull prior to his death. It has now been revealed that a ruling on the case by a leading high court judge, which was withheld from the jury in order not to prejudice the trial, concluded that the father was responsible for the injuries which ultimately resulted in his son’s death. The case has clear parallels with that of 13-month-old Poppi Worthington, who died from serious injuries in December 2012. A family court judgment by the same judge, Mr Justice Jackson, found that “on the civil standard of the balance of probabilities” Poppi had been sexually assaulted by her father Paul before her death. Paul Worthington was arrested and questioned on suspicion of sexual assault at the time of his daughter’s death, but was never charged with any offence. He denies any wrongdoing in relation to his daughter. John Woodcock, MP for Barrow and Furness, where Worthington was from, said: “Poor baby Kye has been failed by authorities and the justice system just as Poppi was failed. “This chilling tragedy is another clear example of the often dysfunctional relationship between the people who are supposed to work together to protect children from harm. “The most striking similarity is of another father suspected of killing his child trying to suppress damning findings from a family court; I will be writing to the new justice secretary asking her to review urgently the status of family court findings in criminal trials.” In his report into the death of Kye Kerr, which was revealed by the Sun newspaper, Jackson writes: “Having considered all the available information, I have reached the clear conclusion that the father was responsible for both occasions of injury to K, and that the injuries on the second occasion caused K’s death. “On the first occasion, the father shook K in a manner clearly inappropriate for such a young baby. On the second, the father struck K’s head against a hard surface with enough violence to fracture his skull and cause fatal brain injuries. “He realised that K had been hurt, but instead of seeking help, put him in his Moses basket in the bedroom, hoping all would be well and determined to conceal what he had done.” In Jackson’s ruling on the death of Poppi Worthington he criticised the police for carrying out “no real investigation” into the death of the toddler for nine months, and highlighted a list of basic errors in evidence-gathering, including not securing the scene, failing to take vital items for forensic analysis, and a senior detective not visiting the family home. In July, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that Poppi’s father would not face any criminal charges. Poppi was buried in February 2013, precluding a further postmortem, after her body was released by the local coroner. There is now said to be an absence of evidence to definitively prove if or how she was injured, or how she died. In June, a serious case review criticised authorities for having had “insufficient professional curiosity” about the family of Kye Kerr. The review found that earlier assessments of the family had been inadequate and the information was not shared properly with other agencies."
2016-09-07T17:08:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Air China magazine condemned over 'racist' guide to London,"MPs have urged China’s UK ambassador to intervene in a row over racist comments reportedly issued by a Chinese airline about ethnic minority areas of London. An image of text from an inflight Air China magazine posted on social media prompted outrage after it warned passengers that “precautions are needed when entering areas mainly populated by Indians, Pakistanis and black people”. The text, tweeted by Beijing-based producer Haze Fan of US news channel CNBC, added: “We advise tourists not to go out alone at night, and females always to be accompanied by another person when travelling.”
Two MPs have urged Liu Xiaoming, China’s ambassador to the UK, to secure an apology to their London constituents. Virendra Sharma, Labour MP for Ealing Southall where 39% of the population is Asian, wrote to Liu to complain about “blatant racism” from the airline. He said: “I am shocked and appalled that even today some people would see it as acceptable to write such blatantly untrue and racist statements. “I have raised this issue with the Chinese ambassador, and requested that he ensures an apology is swiftly forthcoming from Air China, and the magazine is removed from circulation immediately. “I have invited representatives of Air China to visit my constituency of Ealing Southall to see that a very multicultural area is safe, and would be of great value for those visiting London to see. “I will await their response, and if an appropriate one is not forthcoming I shall feel forced to question whether Air China is a fit company to operate in the UK.” Rosena Allin-Khan, Labour MP for Tooting, which has one of the largest south Asian populations in London, said: “I think it is offensive to all Londoners, not just the ethnic minorities mentioned.” Speaking to the Evening Standard she said: “I am going to be writing to the Chinese ambassador to invite him to visit Tooting in London, where all races live side by side. Then they can see how we live and our wonderfully diverse community.” In her tweet, Fan asked what London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, thought about the comments. A spokesman for Khan said the mayor’s office was drafting a statement. Lambeth and Southwark London assembly member Florence Eshalomi also invited Liu to her constituency. She said this would show him “what an international city London is”. She told the Guardian: “London is a safe city with a lot to offer visitors from across the world. Air China is doing a disservice to its passengers.” The article was published in Air China’s monthly Wings of China magazine. Air China has not commented. The airline is the country’s flag carrier and has two flights a day from Beijing to Heathrow. It operates a total of 98 international routes. Figures from VisitBritain show the number of trips to the UK from China rose by 46% last year to 270,000. Total expenditure from these visits was estimated at £586m and the average length of stay was 15 nights."
2016-09-07T18:31:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Climate campaigners among arrested London City airport protesters,"A group of Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists charged with trespassing after a demonstration on the runway at London City airport included a number of protesters who have previously campaigned against airport expansion and for climate change causes.
The demonstration on Tuesday triggered a debate over the authenticity of Black Lives Matter UK when the movement confirmed all nine protesters were white. Prominent black rights activists accused the group of “cultural appropriation” and using the BLM banner for an environmental protest. Among those charged are Natalie Fiennes, 25, from south-west London, a cousin of Harry Potter actor Ralph Fiennes. She previously took part in the LSE Occupy protest and has attended the Climate Camp. William Pettifer, 27, of Radford, Somerset and Esme Waldron, 23, from Brighton are both involved with the Plane Stupid movement against aviation expansion.
Sam Lund-Harket, 32, who lives on a houseboat on the river Stort, in Roydon, Essex, is an activism and events assistant at social justice group Global Justice Now and a supporter of climate justice group Reclaim the Power, while Alex Etchart, who also lives on the houseboat, describes himself as a pan-American songwriter for social movements who has been involved with Occupy London and anti-fracking campaigns.
All five have been charged along with Deborah Francis-Grayson, 31, from Slough, Richard Collett-White, 23, from Kempston, Ben Tippett, 24, from south-west London, and Sama Baka, 27, who lives on the Essex houseboat, with aggravated trespass and entering a security restricted area of an aerodrome. They have been released on bail to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 14 September.
Asked about the action, Etchart said: “Black lives still matter.” He offered no further comment. Stafford Scott and Lee Jasper, a former equality adviser to Ken Livingstone, were publicly critical of the protest, accusing white leftwing activists of hijacking the Black Lives Matter banner. “It’s cultural appropriation. Even our struggle [is] no longer our own,” Jasper said on Twitter. Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, Lund-Harket’s employer, said: “Climate change isn’t primarily about saving English meadows or polar bears; it’s an issue of social justice and racial justice. Climate change has been fuelled by the rich world, mostly white, but it’s the poorer world, mostly black, that will pay the heaviest price – through extreme weather and through the fact that it’s not able to develop in the same high-carbon way. That’s one reason more serious action has not been taken to date on this issue. “It’s a good thing that some people are using their free time to take direct action on this issue which highlights the extreme urgency and significance of what climate change means for billions of people on this planet. “Future generations will look back on this sort of activity in the same way we now look back on direct action against slavery, or for votes for women or against apartheid. Climate change is a terrible injustice being perpetrated on the marginalised.” Dozens of flights were cancelled or rescheduled at the airport in Newham, east London, as police dealt with the demonstration. Black Lives Matter UK said it aimed to highlight the disproportionate impact air pollution had on black people. But the group confused some with its wide-ranging press release, which also listed the deteriorating environment in Newham, the wealthy clientele of London City airport, the migration crisis in the Mediterranean, the impact climate change has on sub-Saharan Africa and immigration deportations as motives behind the action. Flights were cancelled to Geneva, Milan, Luxembourg, Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Zürich, Florence, Mallorca and Málaga. Flights to Dublin and Frankfurt were delayed."
2016-09-07T23:01:05Z,uk-news,UK news,UK to send more troops to South Sudan,"The UK is to expand its contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping force in South Sudan, raising the planned total from 300 to 400. Although still small, the troop number marks a significant change on the part of the British. While contributing financially to UN peacekeeping operations, the UK has until recently limited its troop commitments to the 250 personnel in Cyprus. The British troops heading to the world’s newest country will join a 12,000-strong UN force from 50 nations. The UK is also deploying about 40 troops to the UN force in Somalia combating the jihadi fighters of the al-Shabaab group.
The UK deployment will be formally announced by the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, in London on Thursday, at an international conference aimed at improving UN peacekeeping efforts. South Sudan, which came into being in 2011, has for the last three years collapsed into a conflict which has left thousands dead and displaced an estimated 1.7 million people. The British commitment comes against a background of tentative peace talks involving UN and African diplomats. A small number of British troops arrived in the country over the summer, with the rest to be deployed later this year and next. They will mainly be engaged in engineering projects, while the extra 100 troops are due to help set up a field hospital. Others are attached to the UN peacekeeping headquarters in South Sudan. Although the UK defence force has shrunk dramatically over the last decade and has scaled back on overseas deployment, ministers frequently talk up the involvement of British forces abroad. Fallon will say on Thursday: “This large-scale deployment underlines how we are stepping up our global commitments. Backed by a rising defence budget, it’s part of our effort to tackle the instability that leads to mass migration and terrorism. It will help keep Britain safe while improving lives abroad.”"
2016-09-07T23:01:05Z,uk-news,UK news,"Zero-hours contracts used far beyond short-term work, research says","More than two-thirds of zero-hours workers aged over 25 have been with the same employer for more than a year, highlighting concerns that the insecure arrangements have become a permanent feature of working life for thousands of people. The Resolution Foundation found 400,000 over-25s on zero-hours contracts, 70% of the age group, had had the same employer for more than 12 months. Ahead of official figures expected to document the rise of zero-hours contracts, the independent thinktank said the research indicated that the use of the contracts “stretches well beyond those seeking short-term flexible work”.
The foundation, which has backed the use of flexible contracts for students and young people getting their first taste of work, said the widespread use of zero-hours contracts – which offer no guaranteed hours – will be a key challenge in Theresa May’s attempts to tackle job insecurity. The prime minister put the issue at the heart of her government programme, saying in her opening speech outside 10 Downing Street: “If you’re from an ordinary working-class family, life is much harder than many people in Westminster realise. You have a job, but you don’t always have job security.”
Conor D’Arcy, policy analyst at the foundation, said: “The fact that the use of zero-hours contracts has grown – and the prime minister has chosen to highlight the issue of job insecurity in her maiden speech – mean that they need far closer, and more measured, scrutiny. “Many workers who are on a zero-hours contract want more stability, reliable hours and greater protection. Helping them get this should be a priority of this government.” The report follows a row over the use of zero-hours contracts at Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct retail empire. Ashley said this week that he would offer retail staff 12-hour contracts and consider shifting 4,000 agency workers in his distribution centre in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, to full-time contracts, though only at a rate of 10 a month. On that basis, the transfer could take 33 years. Earlier this year, the Office for National Statistics said the number of workers on zero-hours contracts had increased by more than 100,000 over the previous 12 months to exceed 800,000 for the first time. The data showed there were about 1.7m such contracts last November, indicating that many workers have more than one zero-hours contract. The ONS said workers were more likely to be contracted to large employers than smaller firms, and to work in the hotel and leisure industries. The health and education sectors followed closely behind, suggesting that more employers in the NHS, the care industry and universities have come to rely on zero-hours contracts. The foundation argued that for many of these workers, “fixed-hour employer contracts, which offer a guarantee of paid work and paid holiday and sick leave, would be more appropriate”. Unions and the Labour party have long criticised zero-hours contracts, which usually involve workers being offered hours at short notice on a weekly or monthly rota. In June, Jeremy Corbyn attacked Sports Direct in parliament, saying that Ashley “would make Scrooge look like a good employer”."
2016-09-08T05:00:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Britainâ€™s secret wars | Ian Cobain,"In the months after the surrender of Japan on 14 August 1945, the British people were ready to believe that war was behind them. The newspapers were full of stories about possible home rule for India, and dockers going on strike in London, Liverpool and Hull. It is questionable how many readers of the Manchester Guardian on 6 December 1945 saw, let alone read, a short item that was tucked away at the foot of page six, nestled between a reader’s letter about the Nuremberg war crimes trials and a leading article about the foundation of the United Nations. Under the headline “British in Indo-China” appeared a copy of a letter that had also been sent to Ernest Bevin, the foreign secretary. “It appears that we are collaborating with Japanese and French forces against the nationalist forces of Viêt Minh,” the letter read. “For what purpose is this collaboration? Why are we not disarming the Japanese? We desire the definition of government policy regarding the presence of British troops in Indo-China.” The letter was signed by the “British other ranks” of the signal section of an infantry brigade based in Saigon. It was highly unusual – notwithstanding the egalitarian spirit of those postwar days – to see a group of low-ranking British troops so publicly demanding that the foreign secretary explain his government’s policies. But what was truly extraordinary was the disclosure that British troops were fighting in the former French colony against the local population, and that they were doing so alongside their former enemies: the Japanese army and the Vichy French. Few members of the public were aware that the British government had been so anxious to see the French recover control of their prewar colonial possession that the entire 20th Infantry Division of the British Indian Army had been airlifted into the country the previous August, with orders to suppress the Vietnamese people’s attempts to form their own government. There were almost 26,000 men with 2,500 vehicles, including armoured cars. Three British artillery regiments had also been dispatched, the RAF had flown in with 14 Spitfires and 34 Mosquito fighter-bombers, and there was a 140-strong contingent from the Royal Navy. On landing, the British had rearmed the Vichy troops with new .303 British rifles. Shortly afterwards, surrendered Japanese troops had also been rearmed and compelled to fight the Vietnamese – some under the command of British officers. The British were operating in accordance with an order that they should show a ruthless disregard for civilians, who, consequently, were killed and maimed in large numbers. “There is no front in these operations,” the order said. “We may find it difficult to distinguish friend from foe. Always use the maximum force available to ensure wiping out any hostilities we may meet. If one uses too much force, no harm is done. If one uses too small a force, and it has to be extricated, we will suffer casualties and encourage the enemy.” Many of the troops who were expected to act on such orders were appalled. One of the signatories to the letter to Bevin was Dick Hartmann, a 31-year-old soldier from Manchester. Hartmann later recalled: “We saw homes being burned and hundreds of the local population being kept in compounds. We saw many ambulances, open at the back, carrying mainly – actually, totally – women and children, who were in bandages. I remember it very vividly. All the women and children who lived there would stand outside their homes, all dressed in black, and just grimly stare at us, really with … hatred.” Back in the UK, parliament and the public knew next to nothing about this war, the manner in which it was being waged, or Britain’s role in it. And it appears that the cabinet and the War Office wished their state of ignorance be preserved. At the Allies’ south-east Asia headquarters in Ceylon, however, and at the War Office in London, British commanders and senior defence officials were enraged by the letter. Hartmann and his comrades were warned that a brigadier was coming to see them.
“He just came in one morning and gave us a haranguing about the evils of our ways. He said a few years before we would have been shot, but unfortunately he couldn’t do that now.” Hartmann was worried. But some of his comrades had many years of jungle combat behind them and were unimpressed by the brigadier and his bluster. They told him, bluntly, that they believed Britain’s cause in the country to be unjust, and that he should make himself scarce. The brigadier turned on his heel, and did just that. But there were no more letters from Saigon, there was little press attention, and almost no comments were made in the Commons. Despite the size of its military commitment to Indochina, this was to be a British military operation that would be kept out of sight, and largely out of mind. And it would not be the last such campaign. * * * Almost 70 years later, in September 2014, David Cameron, the British prime minister, gave a statement in which he prepared the country for the resumption of military action in Iraq, this time against Islamic State forces. “We are a peaceful people,” Cameron said, standing in front of two union jack flags. “We do not seek out confrontation, but we need to understand we cannot ignore this threat to our security … we cannot just walk on by if we are to keep this country safe. We have to confront this menace.” Nobody doubted that the prime minister was under pressure to act after Islamic State had filmed the brutal murder of a British aid worker and threatened the slaughter of a second. Moreover, nobody disputed his assertion that the British are “a peaceful people” who do not seek confrontation. In fact, between 1918 and 1939, British forces were fighting in Iraq, Sudan, Ireland, Palestine and Aden. In the years after the second world war, British servicemen were fighting in Eritrea, Palestine, French Indochina, Dutch East Indies, Malaya, Egypt, China and Oman. Between 1949 and 1970, the British initiated 34 foreign military interventions. Later came the Falklands, Iraq – four times – Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Libya and, of course, Operation Banner, the British army’s 38-year deployment to Northern Ireland. For more than a hundred years, not a single year has passed when Britain’s armed forces have not been engaged in military operations somewhere in the world. The British are unique in this respect: the same could not be said of the Americans, the Russians, the French or any other nation. Only the British are perpetually at war. One reason that this is rarely acknowledged could be that in the years following the second world war, and before the period of national self-doubt that was provoked in 1956 by the Suez crisis, Britain engaged in so many end-of-empire scraps that military activity came to be regarded by the British public as the norm, and therefore unremarkable. Another is that since 1945, British forces have engaged in a series of small wars that were under-reported and now all but forgotten, or which were obscured, even as they were being fought, by more dramatic events elsewhere. A great deal is known about some conflicts, such as the 1982 Falklands war and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and Britain’s role in the two world wars has become in many ways central to the national narrative. But other conflicts are remembered only dimly or have always remained largely hidden. * * * One strategically vital war, waged by Britain for more than a decade, was fought for most of that time in complete secrecy. In January 1972, readers of the Observer opened their newspaper to see a report headlined “UK fighting secret Gulf war?” On the same day, the Sunday Times ran a very similar article, asking: “Is Dhofar Britain’s hush-hush war?” British troops, the newspapers revealed, were engaged in the war that the sultan of Oman was fighting against guerrillas in the mountains of Dhofar in the south of the country. Four years earlier, the devaluation crisis had forced Harold Wilson’s government to pledge that British forces would be withdrawn from all points east of Suez by December 1971 – the only exemption being a small force that was to remain in Hong Kong. Now the Observer article was demanding to know: “Has Britain really withdrawn all her forces from the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula? Or is the British government, like the Americans in Laos, waging a secret war without the full knowledge of parliament and public?” The Observer located one of the insurgency’s leaders, who told its reporter that the war had begun with an “explosion” in the country on 9 June 1965, triggered by what he described as poor local governance and “the oppression of the British”. By the time the Observer and Sunday Times were publishing their first, tentative reports, Britain had been at war in Oman for six-and-a-half years.
Situated on the south-west corner of the Arabian peninsula, the Sultanate of Oman is bordered by the United Arab Emirates to the north, and by Saudi Arabia and Yemen to the west and south-west. The country also sits alongside the Strait of Hormuz, the 33-mile wide waterway through which oil from the Persian Gulf makes its way to market. In the 1960s, more than 60% of the western world’s crude oil came from the Gulf, a giant tanker passing through the Hormuz bottleneck every 10 minutes. As the oil flowed, local economies flourished and became important markets for exported British goods: London became even more anxious to protect its interests in the region and the local rulers who supported them. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Britain maintained control of successive sultans of Oman to prevent any other colonial power gaining a foothold in the region. It achieved this through a simple means: money. In the mid-1960s, the country’s tyrannical ruler, Sultan Said bin Taimur received more than half his income directly from London. Only from 1967, when Omani oil was pumped from the ground for the first time, did the country begin to generate most of its own income. Even then, Britain exercised enormous control over the sultan. His defence secretary and chief of intelligence were British army officers, his chief adviser was a former British diplomat, and all but one of his government ministers were British. The British commander of the Sultan of Oman’s armed forces met daily with the British defence attache, and weekly with the British ambassador. The sultan had no formal relationship with any government other than that of the UK.
The official British position was that the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman was a fully sovereign and independent state. In truth, it was a de facto British colony. As such, successive British governments were responsible for the woeful political, social and economic conditions that the sultan’s subjects endured, and which both created and fuelled the popular revolt. In the mid-1960s, Oman had one hospital. Its infant mortality rate was 75% and life expectancy was around 55 years. There were just three primary schools – which the sultan frequently threatened to close – and no secondary schools. The result of this was that just 5% of the population could read and write. There were no telephones or any other infrastructure, other than a series of ancient water channels. The sultan banned any object that he considered decadent, which meant that Omanis were prevented from possessing radios, from riding bicycles, from playing football, from wearing sunglasses, shoes or trousers, and from using electric pumps in their wells. Those who offended against the sultan’s laws could expect savage punishment. There were public executions. Conditions in his prisons – where Pakistani guards received their orders from British warders – were said to be horrendous, with large numbers of inmates shackled together in darkened cells, without proper food or medical attention. The people of Oman despised and feared both their sultan and the British who kept him in place and colluded with his policy of non-development. Unsurprisingly, the sultan often had to call upon the British to provide the military force required to protect him from his own people. During the 1950s there were a number of uprisings in the north of the country, which were put down by British forces. Both the SAS and the RAF were critical to the success of these counter-insurgency operations. Between July and December 1958, for example, the RAF flew 1,635 sorties, dropping 1,094 tons of bombs and firing 900 rockets at the insurgents, their mountain-top villages and irrigation works. This was more than twice the weight of bombs that the Luftwaffe dropped on Coventry in November 1940.
* * * In 1966, a new rebellion broke out in the south of the country, among the people of Dhofar province. The following year, after surviving an assassination attempt, the sultan and his Dhofari wife retired to his palace on the coast at Salalah. He was so rarely sighted that many of his subjects became convinced that he must have died, and that the British were concealing that from them. For the new Labour government, the close relationship with the client sultanate presented an ideological problem. The Labour party had been elected in 1964 on a manifesto that included a pledge to wage a new “war on want” in the developing world, and to fight for “freedom and racial equality” at the United Nations general assembly. It would cause the most excruciating humiliation were it to become known more widely, at home and abroad, that Oman was the last country on earth where slavery remained legal. The sultan owned around 500 slaves. An estimated 150 of them were women, whom he kept at his palace at Salalah; a number of his male slaves were said to have been physically deformed by the cruelties they had suffered. After the rebellions of the 1950s, the Sultan of Oman’s armed forces were reorganised, with British advice, training, equipment and funds. More Omanis were recruited into the ranks, but all of the officers were British. Some were “seconded officers” while others were so-called contract officers, or mercenaries – men who had previously served in Oman with the British Army and who had chosen to return to earn handsome rewards. Initially, the rebels they faced in Dhofar were Arab nationalists. However, to the west of Dhofar lay Aden, from which the British were forced to withdraw at the end of 1967, in the face of increasingly violent rebellions. British rule had been replaced by a Marxist state, the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen, which received aid from both China and Russia. By early 1968, a Dhofari nationalist insurgency was developing into a Chinese-backed revolutionary movement with pan-Arabian ambitions. To the British officers, however, the foe was always simply the adoo – Arabic for enemy. By the end of 1969, the adoo had captured the coastal town of Raysut, and by early the following year they controlled most of the high plains and were within mortaring distance of the RAF base at Salalah.
The new oil fields on the desert between Dhofar and the capital, Muscat, were beginning to look vulnerable. Some in London were developing a fearful Middle Eastern domino theory, in which they envisaged the Strait of Hormuz falling under communist control. The British response was merciless. “We burnt down rebel villages and shot their goats and cows,” one officer wrote. “Any enemy corpses we recovered were propped up in the Salalah souk as a salutary lesson to any would-be freedom fighters.” Another officer explained that unlike in Northern Ireland, where soldiers were anxious to avoid killing or wounding non-combatants, he believed that in Dhofar there were no innocents, only adoo: “The only people in this area – there are no civilians – are all enemy. Therefore you can get on with doing the job, mortaring the area and returning small arms fire without worrying about hurting innocent people.” In their determination to put down a popular rebellion against the cruelty and neglect of a despot who was propped up and financed by Britain, British-led forces poisoned wells, torched villages, destroyed crops and shot livestock. During the interrogation of rebels they developed their torture techniques, experimenting with noise. Areas populated by civilians were turned into free-fire zones. Little wonder that Britain wanted to fight this war in total secrecy. There was no need to resort to the Official Secrets Acts or the D-notice system in order to conceal the Dhofar war, and the ruthless manner in which it was being fought, from the outside world. Two simple expedients were employed: no journalists were permitted into the country, and nobody in government mentioned the war. When Wilson published his account of the Labour government of 1964-70, for example, he mentioned the war that the US was fighting in Vietnam almost 250 times. His own government’s war in Oman was not mentioned once. While the Wilson government had every reason to be sensitive about the military support it was providing to a slave-owning despot, whose rule might charitably be described as medieval, there were additional reasons for the all-embracing secrecy. This was an era in which the developing world and the United Nations had rejected colonialism, and Arab nationalism had been growing in strength for decades. It was vital, therefore, for the credibility of the UK in the Middle East, that its hand in Oman should remain largely hidden.
John Akehurst, the commander of the Sultan’s Armed Forces from 1972, suggests a further reason for the British government not wishing to draw attention to its war in Dhofar: “They were perhaps nervous that we were going to lose it.” Certainly, by the summer of 1970, Britain’s secret war was going so badly that desperate measures were called for. On 26 July, the Foreign Office in London announced that Sultan Said bin Taimur had been deposed by his 29-year-old son, Qaboos bin Said, in a palace coup. In fact, the coup was a very British affair. It had been planned in London by MI6 and by civil servants at the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office, and given the go-ahead after the election that brought Edward Heath into Downing Street. The new sultan immediately abolished slavery, improved the country’s irrigation infrastructure and began to spend his oil revenues on his armed forces. Troops from the SAS arrived, first as the sultan’s bodyguards, and then in squadron strength to fight the adoo. Eventually, the tide turned, journalists were permitted into the country, and by the summer of 1976 the war was won. Strategically, the Dhofar war was one of the most important conflicts of the 20th century, as the victors could expect to control the Strait of Hormuz and the flow of oil. Thousands died, the British won and the west’s lights stayed on. Today, the war is still studied at the Joint Services Command and Staff College in Britain. But because of the way in which information about the long campaign was so successfully suppressed at the time that it was being waged, it has been all but blanked out of the nation’s memory. Like the British wars in Eritrea, Indochina, the Dutch East Indies and Borneo, it is remembered in Britain only by those men who fought it, and their families. Some aspects of Britain’s role in the coup and the war remain among the deep secrets of the British state. Wilson’s correspondence on Oman, for example, and that of his successor Heath, are to remain closed to historians and the public until 2021. In 2005, a Foreign Office memo was briefly made public that describes the way in which the old sultan’s own defence secretary, Colonel Hugh Oldman, had taken the lead role in planning the coup that deposed Oman’s ruler, in order to safeguard British access to the country’s oil and military bases. The document was then hurriedly withdrawn – its release, the Foreign Office said, had been an unfortunate error.
* * * Judging from the last decade and a half, there is little sign that the British state is about to lose its appetite for war. The first conflict of the new century in which the UK became involved was the post-9/11 assault against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. This war enjoyed early success, but stuttered and soured after the UK’s mission expanded to Helmand in the south of the country. The war dragged on, costing an estimated 95,000 lives over 13 years, including those of 453 British servicemen and women, and brought little discernible benefit to the people of Afghanistan. The 21st century’s second war – the 2003 invasion of Iraq – was possibly the UK’s greatest foreign policy disaster since Suez. Casualty estimates vary widely, from 150,000 dead to more than a million. What cannot be disputed is that 179 of the dead were British. More than a decade later, Iraq remains in chaos. The post-9/11 conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq were fought in the full glare of the media and came to haunt the politicians who had initiated them. Despite this, Britain continued to invest in war – politically, technically and financially – as a means of projecting power and securing influence among key allies, and also, it seemed at times, in an attempt to impose order and a degree of familiarity upon a chaotic and unpredictable world. But could this be done in secret? Surely, in the age of global media, 24-hour rolling news, social media, and the troops’ own ability to record and instantly share images of conflict, it would be impossible for a British government to go to war and conceal its actions, in the way that Britain’s war in Dhofar was hidden from the public for six-and-a-half years? Tony Jeapes, who commanded the first SAS squadron that was covertly deployed to Oman, considered this question, and concluded that while such secrecy was “an ideal state of affairs”, it would probably be impossible to repeat. In the years since the Dhofar war, the UK’s special forces have been gradually expanded, and since 1996, all its members have been obliged to sign a confidentiality agreement. This has reinforced the discretion with which members of elite units within the military traditionally perform their duties, and it has rarely been broken. Meanwhile, the evolution of successive generations of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, has presented military planners with greater opportunities to mount operations that could remain unknown, other than to those who are ordering, planning and executing them, and to those on the receiving end. The reliance of modern societies on the internet and the increasing frequency with which states probe and attack each other’s cyber defences have led some analysts to talk of a hybrid warfare, much of which is shrouded in deniability. The result is that the line between war and peace is increasingly blurred.
* * * In the years after 9/11, hints began to emerge, in the footnotes of the budget statements of the Ministry of Defence, and from scraps of evidence salvaged from the coastal villages of Somalia, the mountains of Yemen and the cities of Libya, that the British were once again waging war in secret. It appeared that a lethal trinity of special forces, drones and local proxies was being brought to bear in a way that would spare the British public the disagreeable details of the nature of modern war, and relieve parliament of the need to debate the wisdom of waging it. In July 2007, less than a week after succeeding Tony Blair as prime minister, Gordon Brown had announced a series of sweeping constitutional changes that he said would make the British government “a better servant of the people”. One measure – clearly a response to the deeply unpopular war in Iraq and the calamitous and costly expedition into Helmand – was to give members of parliament the final say on declarations of war. Six years later, in August 2013, parliament exercised its new right when MPs rejected a government motion that would have authorised military intervention in Syria’s bloody civil war. Ministers of the coalition government were appalled by the vote – it was said to be the first against a British prime minister’s foreign policy since 1782 – and argued that it not only blocked the deployment of British troops, it also prevented the UK from providing any military assistance whatsoever. “It is clear to me,” Prime Minister David Cameron told the Commons, “that the British parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action. I get that and the government will act accordingly.” But those words – “act accordingly” – were not quite what they seemed. In July 2015, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, gave MPs an update on the renewed military operations in Iraq – the campaign that Cameron had announced while standing before two union jack flags and declaring the British to be “a peaceful people”. The RAF, he said, had carried out 300 air strikes in Iraq, there were 900 UK personnel engaged, and the operation had cost £45m in the previous 12 months. He reassured his audience that “our position remains that we would return to the House for approval before conducting air strikes in Syria”. Before making this statement, Fallon was said to have been unsettled by talk in Washington political circles that the UK’s refusal to act in Syria could be seen only as a sign of British decrepitude. His statement was deeply misleading: for at least 18 months, RAF pilots who were said to have been “embedded” with the US and Canadian military had been carrying out airstrikes against targets in Syria. Others had been flying combat missions with the French military over Mali. They were said to be under the command of these foreign forces, but they were clearly a British contribution to a war that MPs had decided the country should avoid. Two weeks later the truth was out, and Fallon was back on his feet in the Commons, explaining himself to angry MPs. “Embedded” service personnel were nothing new, he declared; they comply with UK law, but “have to comply with the rules of engagement of the host nation”. He had not publicised what had been happening because these pilots had been assisting with other countries’ operations. Moreover, he made clear that the failure to publicise what was happening should be regarded as “standard practice”.
In December 2015, MPs voted that overt military action against Islamic State forces should finally proceed. The government was given parliamentary approval for military operations that had already been covertly under way for two years. In the Gulf, meanwhile, it was disclosed that British military personnel were sitting in the control rooms from which the Saudi Arabian air force was guiding its bombers on to targets across Yemen. The British were helping their Saudi counterparts key in the codes that would help them select and attack their targets. The Saudis were not only flying British-built aircraft and dropping British-made bombs, they were dropping vast numbers of them. Over a three-month period in 2015, the value of exports of British-made bombs and missiles had increased by 11,000%, from £9m to £1bn. This bombing campaign has been heavily criticised by rights groups for causing thousands of civilian deaths. In parliament, the British government has had little to say about this, other than to insist that it “obeys the norms of humanitarian law”. Once again, the government appeared to be quietly pulling the country into a Middle Eastern conflict without any parliamentary oversight or approval. And covert, undeclared and unreported warfare could be seen to be not merely a possibility, but the reality of many of the UK’s military operations.

2016-09-08T07:25:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Argentina promises 'respectful' cooperation over Falklands,"Argentina is willing to consider resuming direct flights to and from the Falklands Islands and a joint UK-Argentinian exploration of hydrocarbons around the islands, the Argentinian foreign minister, Susana Malcorra, has said. Alan Duncan, the UK Foreign Office minister, is due in Buenos Aires next week for bilateral talks along with a UK business delegation, and the offer suggests Britain’s soured relations with Argentina are set for a more positive turn after years of diplomatic conflict following Argentina’s invasion of the Falklands in 1982. Duncan will also appear at the inaugural Argentina Business and Investment Forum, due to be attended by more than 40 UK-based business leaders.
Stressing that Argentina’s claim to the Falklands is implanted in its constitution, Malcorra, one of the leading candidates to become the first female secretary general of the UN in the organisation’s history, told the Guardian she wanted to end the era of confrontation. She also expressed confidence that the UK would not regard her nationality as a reason to veto her bid to succeed the current UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. One of five women still in the 10-strong race, Malcorra received warm support from the Chinese at the G20 in China earlier this week, and is now back in the running in a highly unpredictable race, after having fallen from third to fifth place in the latest straw poll of security council members.
Two further straw polls are expected shortly, before a further poll in October, which will reveal whether any permanent security council member will veto a specific candidate. Malcorra said she was looking for confidence-building measures between the UK and Argentina, and heralded a change in rhetoric. “The previous administration was very confrontational, and we do not want that. We both recognise that solving this problem will take time. Our claim to the Malvinas will be sustained, but as part of the approach of a good neighbour. “We think over the long term a solution can be found but in the meantime we can and should be respectful, and find ways to open up the opportunities for confidence-building measures. There has been a zero-sum approach, but we think if we sit at the table, and are positive and creative there are alternatives.” She added that 80% of Anglo-Argentinian relations were cooperative, and the task was to work on the remaining 20%. At present only Chile currently has an approved air route to the Falklands after the government of Néstor Kirchner banned charter flights from passing through Argentinian air space. Under the previous administration the Argentinian congress also approved a law that penalises companies that explore and exploit hydrocarbons without authorisation from Buenos Aires.
Malcorra said joint ventures between the two countries on hydrocarbons was “a sensible thing to discuss and could make sense”. She argued her country might be willing to lift restrictions on air flights from Latin America if some of the flights went direct to Buenos Aires. She also pointed out that an International Red Cross delegation had visited the Falklands to start the process of identifying the bodies of Argentinian soldiers buried on the islands. Malcorra is in London for a major conference on UN peacekeeping, and proposed reforms to make the performance of the peacekeepers much more accountable after successive stories of UN forces sexually exploiting or abusing the population they have been sent to protect. She insisted that most UN peacekeepers behaved, but she proposed national governments be required to sign a compact making them clearly accountable for the actions of their soldiers and police. In addition, she called for an ombudsman answerable to the UN general assembly and responsible for an annual public report on the performance of peacekeepers. “It is a name and shame approach. At present each set of troops are reporting to their own commander in chiefs, and the UN can only report about a problem. This needs to change.” With the Chinese warming to her candidacy and the US supportive, the biggest stumbling block to Malcorra’s candidature may be the attitude of the Russians and her status as former chief of staff to Ban Ki-moon. The Russians in principle back a candidate from eastern Europe, on the basis that it is the region’s turn to run the world body, but she is drawing support with her appeal to rein in the mushrooming UN bureaucracy, focus on results and bring a remote bureaucracy closer to the people. With her experience in the private sector as well as 10 years at the UN, Malcorra has experience of breaking glass ceilings and added: “I have an insider-outsider perspective. I have the advantage of knowing enough about what needs to change without being so deeply ingrained in the bureaucracy as to be run by it.” The prospect of another man being selected for the post – the current frontrunner is the former Portuguese prime minister António Guterres – leaves her exasperated. “Looking at the female candidates, it would be a surprise to me if the UN decides that none of them merits appointment. It has been 70 years that men have been at the helm.”"
2016-09-08T12:37:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Two held on suspicion of child cruelty plot in anti-FGM operation,"A man and a woman have been detained at Heathrow airport during a Metropolitan police operation targeting female genital mutilation. The 33-year-old woman from Milton Keynes and 26-year-old man from south-east London were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit child cruelty. An 11-year-old girl travelling with them was taken into police protection. The couple were held following a flight from Freetown, Sierra Leone via Casablanca. They were released on Thursday and bailed until October pending further inquiries. On Tuesday Met officers working on Operation Limelight, supported by Hillingdon children’s services and the children’s charity Barnardo’s, targeted three flights – one from Sierra Leone and two from Nigeria – to raise awareness of the crimes of FGM and “breast ironing”. While FGM is illegal in the UK, it is seen as a rite of passage in many countries in Africa, and up to 140 million women globally are believed to have been affected. Some families who have moved to Britain from countries where it is prevalent face pressure to have their girls “cut” when they return to those countries during summer or Christmas holidays. The Met said officers approached and spoke with 49 families from the three flights from Freetown, Abuja and Lagos, totalling 138 people, as part of the operation. Of the 49 families, 22 were aware that FGM is illegal. The remaining 27 families were supplied with literature and information relating to the illegal status of the practice in the UK. FGM was made illegal in Nigeria in 2015 but campaigners recognise that it remains a challenge to stamp out the practice, which usually happens in secret. Sierra Leone has one of the highest rates of FGM in the world, and campaigners’ attempts to outlaw the practice have run up against political opposition.
FGM has been illegal in England and Wales for the past 30 years, and the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 made it a crime to be involved in any arrangement for FGM to be performed on another person either inside or outside the UK. Five arrests have been made as a result of Operation Limelight since it began in August 2013. Last year a hospital doctor was acquitted of carrying out FGM, in the first court case of its kind.
The Met said three more cases were currently being considered by the Crown Prosecution Service. DCS Ivan Balhatchet, of the Met’s sexual offences, exploitation and child abuse command, said the practice was “horrific” and there remained much work to be done to raise awareness that it was a crime to take someone abroad to be cut. “We are not complacent and more still needs to be done,” he said.

2016-09-08T12:52:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Police failure to investigate Milly Dowler phone hacking 'unacceptable',"The failure by police to investigate the hacking of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s phone was unacceptable and is “a matter of deep regret”, an internal investigation has concluded. Surrey police officers may not have pursued the News of the World about information gleaned from a message left on her voicemail “because of the potential consequences”, the inquiry report says. But it is more likely the matter was not recognised as illegal because phone hacking was not a widely used term at the time of her disappearance in 2002, and the scale of the tabloid’s use of the practice was unknown at the time, it adds. The internal investigation, Operation Baronet, found there was “no evidence to suggest that there was any collusion between Surrey police and the NoW” other than some uncorroborated evidence that concern had been raised within the Milly investigation team that nothing was being done about the hacking by the tabloid. Investigators concluded that hacking was not recognised as an illegal act by those leading the missing persons inquiry at the time, and it was not considered a priority as all effort and energy was “rightly focused on finding Milly”. Nevertheless, the report says: “The failure to investigate remains a matter of deep regret to Surrey police primarily because it added to the pain and anguish felt by the Dowler family.” Glenn Mulcaire, an investigator paid around £100,000 a year by the now defunct paper, admitted hacking Milly’s phone after a criminal investigation was launched in 2011. He told a judge during sentencing that he believed he had the “blessing” of the police because it would assist their hunt for the missing schoolgirl. “He was not aware that any story would be published in relation to the interception of Milly Dowler,” his barrister told the judge at the Old Bailey. “He thought the information would be given to the police. There could be circumstances in which a story could have resulted, that could be secondary to the finding of Milly Dowler.” Mulcaire told news executives at the paper that one of the voicemails he had hacked was from a recruitment agency in Telford inviting the schoolgirl for an interview at a computer printer factory. The paper scrambled a team of reporters and photographers in the hope of a world exclusive revealing Milly’s whereabouts, only to learn later that the recruiter had phoned the wrong number. Milly, 13, was snatched from the street while on her way from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. The serial killer Levi Bellfield is serving a whole-life tariff after being found guilty of abducting and killing her. The internal inquiry report notes that the Dowler investigation remains the largest the force has ever undertaken. It says the initial senior investigating officer, DCI Stuart Gibson, was dedicated but “inexperienced” and not trained for the role. Concerns were raised within the force and he was eventually replaced by the then head of CID, DCS Craig Denholm. During the course of the initial missing persons inquiry, it became apparent to some officers that Dowler’s phone had been hacked by the News of the World. One officer, DCI Maria Woodall, told investigators that she remembered a conversation with either Denholm or Gibson on 14 April or 15 April 2002, where she and a colleague raised concerns the apparent immunity NoW was enjoying over the hacking. “She says she was advised no action would be taken because there was a need to keep the media onside,” the report says. According to the report, there is no record of any decision about the News of the World hacking, and neither Denholm or Craig recall such a conversation. Denholm says he was not aware of the hacking until 2011 when it emerged in a report in the Guardian. However, documentation exists proving knowledge of the hacking within the force. A reference to “interception” of Milly’s phone was made in a briefing note prepared for the then deputy chief constable Peter Fahy – now Sir Peter Fahy and a former chief constable of Greater Manchester police – for a meeting with journalists in the Crime Reporters Association in July 2002. Fahy told investigators that he may have seen the note but did not recall it, and the possibility of a criminal offence did not occur to him at the time. Investigators found several versions of the briefing document, with certain versions referring to “press who illegally intercepted Milly’s phone”. Other versions of the document show the word “illegally” had been removed. The investigators did not establish who had edited and re-edited the document."
2016-09-08T13:17:16Z,uk-news,UK news,"Undercover officer infiltrated pro-Isis Britons heading for Syria, court told","An undercover officer infiltrated a group of Islamic State supporters attempting to smuggle themselves out of the UK to Syria in the back of a lorry, an Old Bailey jury has been told. Anas Abdalla, 26, from Acocks Green, Birmingham, was discovered in an empty space inside a cargo trailer at Dover port in April 2015 in the company of three other men. One of the others, Gabriel Rasmus, 29, from Lozells, Birmingham, has already pleaded guilty, the court heard, to preparing acts of terrorism, the same offence under section 5(1) of the 2006 Terrorism Act with which Abdalla is charged. Abdalla, who was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, and first came to the UK as an asylum seeker, denies the charge. He claims he was fleeing Britain because he was being “harassed and subject to oppressive treatment” by MI5. Outlining the evidence against him, Duncan Atkinson QC, for the prosecution, said that Abdalla held a valid UK passport when he was arrested and, like Rasmus, carried a rucksack containing an iPhone wrapped in foil, a second Nokia mobile, ID cards, £520 in cash, €250, waterproof clothing, walking boots and a G-Shock watch. Abdalla and Rasmus, Atkinson said, were planning to travel to Syria via Bulgaria and Turkey “to join forces with so-called Islamic State and to offer their services, with their lives if necessary, to engage in acts of terrorism”. Isis, the prosecutor reminded the jury, is a banned organisation and Abdalla, he said, was preparing to commit acts of terrorism in Syria. Rasmus had been under police investigation for some time, particularly through meetings conducted by an undercover officer known by the pseudonym “Muhamed” who was gathering information about alleged terrorist activity. The jury are due to hear recordings made by Muhamed of conversations in which Rasmus repeatedly refers to “there” or “going there” – references, it is said, to Syria. Muhamed also met Abdalla, who told him that “Europe held nothing for him” and that he loathed his work in IT because he had to associate with non-Muslims, the jury heard. “He said he had been called on to go to Syria to fight and wanted to do so,” Atkinson said. Abdalla, it is alleged, expressed support for Isis. One of the other men detained in the back of the lorry was Mahamuud Diini. He, the court was told, had also been trying to leave the country covertly. Diini, however, has been prosecuted previously for seeking to travel to Syria but was acquitted. The prosecution will challenge Abdalla’s claim that he was fleeing from security force harassment and attempt to demonstrate that difficulties in his life were due to other causes. The court was told that he did not answer interview questions after his arrest and developed his reason for leaving the country later. The undercover officer, the court was told, had been tasked with gathering information on alleged terrorist activity. “In cases involving allegations of serious or organised criminality, the use of undercover officers is a lawful and legitimate means of obtaining vital intelligence and evidence,” Atkinson explained. “The use and conduct of undercover officers is regulated by statute and there are strict rules which define the parameters of what an undercover officer can do or say in a particular situation. “For example, the rules permit the undercover officer to appear to support the beliefs and actions of those he is investigating and to show ‘necessary enthusiasm’. This means he can agree with them when they talk and help them by giving them a lift, for example, but not actually engage with them in committing a crime. Those rules were followed in this case.” The case continues."
2016-09-08T15:16:33Z,uk-news,UK news,"Dungavel immigration detention centre will close, says minister","The Home Office has announced plans to close the controversial Dungavel immigration removal centre in Scotland, in a move that has been quickly praised by campaigners. The Lanarkshire centre, which will shut down towards the end of 2017, has been the focus of numerous protests, some describing it as barbaric and inhumane. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons has criticised the detention facility, as has the recent independent report on welfare in detention by Stephen Shaw.
Robert Goodwill, the immigration minister, said that the existing centre, which opened in 2001, has capacity for up to 249 detainees, and is the only one of its kind in Scotland, would be replaced by a short-term holding facility close to Glasgow airport.He said the new facility (which needs planning approval from Renfrewshire council) would provide easy access to London airports, where most removals took place, and that the closure would mean “a significant saving for the public purse”. The proposed short-term facility would be used to accommodate people detained during immigration enforcement operations. It would have 51 beds and most stays would probably last fewer than seven days. Dungavel sparked widespread condemnation for holding young children, before deportation, for periods exceeding a year. Aamer Anwar, a human rights lawyer, said: “The closure of this institution, which has been described over the years as barbaric, inhumane and racist, is long overdue. However, today, there is no room for complacency if this institution is simply replaced with another at Glasgow airport controlled by the Home Office that cares more about deportation than human rights.”
Anwar, who had represented the Ay family – Kurdish asylum seekers with four children aged seven to 14 detained at Dungavel for more than a year in 2003 before they gained asylum in Germany – urged the Scottish government to demand Home Office guarantees of “rigorous and independent accountability” for the new facility. Those concerns were echoed by Jerome Phelps, director of the organisation Detention Action, who said that while the facility’s closure was an important step towards the UK government’s intention of reducing numbers of migrants in detention, there were serious questions about plans to transfer migrants from Glasgow airport to immigration removal centres in England after seven days. Phelps said: “People could be forced to abandon legal challenges in the Scottish courts, and start again with new solicitors in the English courts. The government should give a clear commitment not to detain, in England, migrants with pending asylum or immigration claims in Scotland, other than in exceptional circumstances.” Naomi McAuliffe, director of Amnesty International’s Scotland programme, said that while the closure was welcome news, all of the UK needed a more humane approach to detention. “Goodwill’s remarks focus on the fact that the new holding facility is near Glasgow airport and will save money. The reality is that indefinite detention is expensive, ineffective, and extremely harmful to many of the people held. Dungavel was cited in the Shaw report last year [for its] substandard accommodation and damaging use of indefinite detention. Any plans for a new facility must take into account the rights of the people who will be held there.”
Angela Constance, Scotland’s secretary for communities, social security and equalities, raised similar concerns to campaigners. She said the introduction of a rapid removal facility meant there was “a real risk that people who have been living in Scotland will either have their opportunities to challenge their deportation restricted or be taken to immigration removal centres far away from their families, friends and legal representation”. She said she would be seeking urgent clarification from the UK government on the proposals, and guarantees over the treatment of asylum seekers based in Scotland and facing deportation. Constance is to announce, in the Scottish parliament this Thursday, funding of £85,000 for a pilot peer education scheme for Syrian refugees that builds on the pledges of volunteer help offered by thousands of people in Scotland over the past year. The project will ask volunteers to introduce refugees to social activities and help them practise colloquial language skills."
2016-09-08T16:17:15Z,uk-news,UK news,Taxi driver accused of Becky Godden murder 'may have killed others',"A former senior police detective has suggested that a taxi driver convicted of the murder of one young woman and now on trial over a second may also have carried out other killings. During an extraordinary courtroom exchange, the former superintendent Stephen Fulcher said Chris Halliwell may have become confused about how one victim was buried because there were others. The defendant, who had the opportunity to cross-examine Fulcher because he is representing himself, replied by calling the ex-officer a “corrupt bastard”, and said the truth was yet to emerge. Halliwell is serving a life sentence for the murder of Sian O’Callaghan, 22, whom he abducted from a nightclub in Swindon, Wiltshire, in 2011. She was stabbed in the head and strangled and her partially clothed body left at the side of a country road in Oxfordshire.
After police arrested Halliwell, 52, over the disappearance of O’Callaghan, he allegedly told the senior investigating officer Fulcher he had killed a young woman some years before. He then accompanied Fulcher and other officers to another spot 17 miles away in Gloucestershire, where the body of Becky Godden, a sex worker who was last seen alive in 2003, was later found. Halliwell denies murdering Godden. Fulcher, who now works as a consultant in Somalia, described to a jury at Bristol crown court the conversation between him and Halliwell at the spot where O’Callaghan’s body was found. He said Halliwell had told him: “We need to have a chat.” Fulcher said Halliwell then told him: “I am a sick fucker,” and asked if was too late to get help. Fulcher replied: “It’s gone beyond that Chris.” The court heard there was a pause and then Halliwell allegedly said: “Another one.” Fulcher said: “I asked him when was that and he replied 2003, 2004 or 2005.” Halliwell allegedly told Fulcher he had taken a prostitute from the Manchester Road area of Swindon. Fulcher asked if Halliwell could take him to the “vicinity” of where he had left her. He allegedly replied: “Exact spot.” Fulcher told the court that Halliwell directed him to a ploughed filed at Eastleach in Gloucestershire where he allegedly said he had buried Godden’s body.
“He took a reference from a dip in the wall and paced to the exact spot where he indicated where he had buried another victim,” Fulcher told the court. Fulcher said Halliwell had told him he had dug a grave 150cm (5ft) deep but, cross-examining the former officer from the dock, Halliwell challenged him on the depth of the burial site. Fulcher accepted that in fact it was a shallow grave 15-20cm (6-8in) deep. Halliwell asked him: “It wasn’t 5ft deep, was it?” Fulcher replied: “No it wasn’t, but that’s what you told me at the time.” Halliwell told him: “You know from your inquiries that I spent most of my working life as a ground worker or building. So in that capacity I knew the difference between a 5ft hole and a 6in hole. Doesn’t it stand out?” Fulcher replied: “It does stand out. What I inferred from that Christopher … ” Halliwell interrupted: “Chris … ” Fulcher continued: “ … is that Becky is one of your victims, as is Sian, and you got confused about the nature of this deposition. You described very clearly a 5ft hole. That led me to conclude that there are other victims.” Halliwell said: “OK, if you say so. Or does it suggest that maybe I really didn’t know? By the end of this process you will know the truth. You won’t like it but you will know the truth … It is going to leave a hell of a lot more questions unanswered … The first time I was in that field was with you.” He added: “Oh and by the way, it was a pleasure ruining your career, you corrupt bastard.” Fulcher replied: “I’m sure.” A second officer who was with Halliwell and Fulcher at the field in Eastleach, Det Insp Benjamin Mant, said he was struck by how calm and controlled the defendant was. He told the court: “He was calm, he was controlled. He spoke softly but precisely.” The trial continues."
2016-09-08T17:24:43Z,uk-news,UK news,"More than 900,000 UK workers now on zero-hours contracts","The number of UK workers on zero-hours contracts has leapt 20% in a year to more than 900,000, indicating that insecure employment has become a permanent and growing feature of the jobs market. The Office for National Statistics said 903,000, or 2.9%, of the employed workforce were on zero-hours contracts – which do not offer guaranteed hours or sick pay – in their main job, up from 747,000 last year. Response to the data, the general secretary of trade union umbrella body the TUC, Frances O’Grady, said the government needed to give extra support to workers “living at the sharp end of the labour market”.
TUC analysis shows that the average worker earns 50% more an hour than those on zero-hours contracts . The median hourly rate for a zero-hours worker is £7.25 compared with £11.05 for all employees, the TUC said. Employment expert John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist, said the contracts undermine the spirit of statutory minimum wage regulations. He said: “People employed on zero-hours contracts are only entitled to the minimum wage for the hours they actually work and receive nothing when ‘on call’, which serves to intensify income insecurity.” Zero-hours contracts are widely used by retailers, restaurants, leisure companies and hotels. The care industry is estimated to employ 160,000 workers on zero-hours contracts while the public sector, especially the health service, has increasingly adopted the flexible contracts.
Britain’s largest sportswear retailer Sports Direct said this week it would offer shop staff the option of a minimum contract of 12 hours’ work per week, which is in line with other retailers such as Next. Sports Direct’s founder, Mike Ashley, said he would consider switching 4,000 agency staff at the company’s main distribution centre to being full time employees. On average, staff on a zero-hours contract work 25 hours a week, the ONS said. But 31% on the contracts said they wanted to work more hours compared with 10% of those in other forms of employment.
Nick Palmer, an ONS statistician, said it was likely that some of the increase related to greater public awareness of the term zero-hours contract. This leads to respondents to the ONS labour force survey – used to calculate the zero-hours numbers – flagging their new-found awareness of their employment status. O’Grady said the figures exposed a hidden part of the British economy. “Zero-hours contracts have become an easy way for bosses to employ staff on the cheap. There is no getting away from the fact that zero-hours workers earn less money and have fewer rights than people with permanent jobs,” she said. “It is very easy for politicians and employers to talk about the flexibility these contracts offer. But they are not the ones living at the sharp end of the labour market. If you don’t know how much work you will have from one day to the next, paying the bills and arranging things like childcare can be a nightmare.” Earlier this year, New Zealand banned the contracts after a campaign led by trade unions. The law, which took effect on 1 April, stipulates that employers must guarantee a minimum number of hours work each week and workers can refuse extra hours without repercussions.
The general secretary of the Unite trade union, Len McCluskey, said: “As New Zealand has shown, governments do not have to sit on the sidelines when it comes to tackling exploitation. They can outlaw zero-hours contracts. “Theresa May now needs to prove true to her word about supporting working people by setting out her plan to rid working people of the twin curses of insecurity and low paid work. “Let’s see the UK government follow the lead of their counterparts in New Zealand and ban the use of zero-hours contracts as part of a plan to halt the tide of insecure low paid work.” A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said: “As the prime minister has made clear, we want to do more to build an economy that works for everyone and to help working people who are struggling to get by. “Since May last year, the use of exclusivity clauses has been unlawful, meaning that individuals have more control over their lives and can work more hours with another employer if they wish.”"
2016-09-08T19:20:57Z,uk-news,UK news,Four men charged with terror offences after Birmingham raid,"Four men from the Midlands have been charged with planning terrorist acts after a major security operation saw the bomb squad called to examine suspect material in a central Birmingham property. The men were arrested on 26 August in a series of raids in Birmingham and Stoke and counter-terrorism officials believe they may have disrupted a plot to attack Britain which was possibly imminent. Each of the four charged men is accused of preparing terrorist acts between 26 May and 27 August 2016. The charges were authorised by the Crown Prosecution Service on Thursday and come amid a heightened fear of an attack on the UK. Police said one man aged 18 who was arrested in Birmingham had been released without charge. Also on Thursday, a separate inquiry unconnected to the Birmingham case resulted in London police arresting two men aged 19 and 20 allegedly involved in preparing an act of terrorism. Those charged are two Birmingham men, Naweed Ali, 28, and Khobaib Hussain, 24, both of Evelyn Road, Sparkhill. The others – Mohibur Rahman, 31, and Tahir Aziz, 37 – are both from Stoke. Police said the four men would appear at Westminster magistrates court on Friday charged with preparing for terrorist acts, contrary to Section 5 (a) of the Terrorism Act 2006. That section says “A person commits an offence if, with the intention of … committing acts of terrorism … he engages in any conduct in preparation for giving effect to his intention.” The arrests in the Midlands led to the examination of premises in Lee Bank, Birmingham, involving the Army bomb disposal team from the Royal Logistic Corps, who used a robot device. Police said the searches concluded four days after they started. In Thursday’s counter-terrorism operation, the two men were arrested at an address in west London as part of a joint operation by police and MI5. Scotland Yard said a 19-year-old was detained on suspicion of preparing an act of terrorism and a 20-year-old was held on suspicion of funding terrorism and failing to disclose information regarding a planned act of terrorism. The 20-year-old was also held on suspicion of preparing an act of terrorism under a separate investigation by the south-east counter-terrorism unit. He was bailed to a date in early November pending further enquiries. The 19-year-old remains in custody. A third man, 19, was detained in south-east London on suspicion of a religiously aggravated offence, which officials described as being “in relation to a separate matter”. He has been bailed to a date in mid-October pending further enquires. Police said searches of addresses and vehicles were being carried out in the Thames Valley as well as in west and south-east London. The government has previously claimed that seven plots linked to Islamist terrorists have been foiled in Britain since 2014, directly linked by officials to the rise of Islamic State. Since August 2014, Britain has been at its second highest level of terror alert – severe – meaning an attack is highly likely."
2016-09-09T00:20:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Baby among 10 people found in back of lorry,"A three-week-old baby was among a group of 10 people discovered in the back of a lorry at a motorway service station on Tuesday. The Sun reported that the group, mostly from Iraq, had travelled from Calais and spent 10 hours in the Spanish-registered lorry. The alarm was raised at Watford Gap services on the M1 in Northamptonshire after people could be heard banging from inside the vehicle and shouting “no air”. Police who opened the lorry’s doors found the group struggling to breathe in the stifling heat along with the infant. A toddler was also among the group. Richard Glover from Wellingborough told the Sun: “I could see no food or water in the lorry. It had been a muggy night and it was a warm day, so conditions would have been stifling. They could all have suffocated in there – including the baby.” A Home Office spokesperson said the incident was concerning and was being investigated: “Would-be migrants need to be aware that they are putting their lives, and those of their loved ones, at risk by attempting to reach the UK illegally. “That is why we have increased security and boosted technology used at border controls and are working with law enforcement at home and abroad to target the criminal gangs who are often behind such attempts.” The Home Office said Northamptonshire police had alerted immigration enforcement officers. Nine of the migrants said they were from Iraq, with another from Iran. They all had medical checks and the infant was said to be healthy. According to the Sun, the parents of the infant paid a people-smuggler to travel from Turkey to Greece before making their way to France. Their six-year-old son, who was not travelling with them, reportedly drowned when the boat he was in sank, killing a further 21 people. The baby was born last month in “the Jungle” refugee camp that is home to about 10,000 people. It sparked protests from Calais residents earlier this week who want it to be shut down. Immigration minister Robert Goodwill told MPs on Tuesday that work was about to begin on a four-metre high wall in Calais in the latest attempt to prevent refugees and migrants getting on to lorries heading for the Channel port. It will be part of a £17m package of joint Anglo-French security measures to tighten precautions at the port. Construction of the 1km-long wall along the ferry port’s main dual carriageway approach road, known as the Rocade, is due to start this month."
2016-09-09T09:15:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Belfast man dies after police use CS spray during altercation,"Northern Ireland’s police watchdog has launched a formal investigation into the death of a man who was sprayed with CS gas by police officers in Belfast. Gerard McMahon died in the early hours of Thursday after an altercation with officers in Great Victoria Street. He was arrested after what the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said was a “violent incident” between himself and a number of taxi drivers in the city centre thoroughfare at about 5am. The Police Ombudsman’s Office in Belfast, which is investigating McMahon’s death, said “it appeared that CS spray was used” during his arrest. It is investigating if McMahon, from the Short Strand area of east Belfast, had a heart attack after he was restrained and CS gas was sprayed on him by PSNI officers. Police officers administered first aid to McMahon but he died at the scene close to Belfast’s Opera House theatre. Ch Supt Chris Noble said: “Police wish to pass on our condolences to the family of the deceased. We will fully cooperate with the police ombudsman’s inquiry and at this stage it would not be appropriate for the police service to comment further.” The dead man worked buying and selling cars, and also part-time as a DJ. Tributes were paid to him on social media by family and friends. Emma McMahon wrote on Facebook: “Can’t believe my cousin … never know what’s round the corner.” Robert Fitzsimons wrote: “Shocking news to say the least. RIP Geraldo McMahon. One of the good guys. No one would ever deserve that!” Gerry Kelly, a Sinn Féin member of the Northern Ireland assembly and junior minister, said he was shocked to learn of the death. “My thoughts are with his family at this tragic time,” he added. “I have been in touch with senior police about the circumstances which led to Gerard being rushed to hospital,” he said. “The ombudsman has already launched an investigation into the detention of Gerard McMahon. That investigation must be thorough so that his grieving family get the full facts as quickly as possible.” Irritant spray, also called CS spray or Pava spray, is used on a fairly frequent basis by officers and is one of the items in the standard police toolkit. Exposure to CS spray causes a burning sensation and significant watering of the eyes to the extent that the subject cannot keep them open and is thus often incapacitated."
2016-09-09T10:41:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Salford's Lowry outlet mall to drop artist's name in rebranding exercise,"The owners of the Lowry shopping centre in Salford are under fire for proposals to drop the name of the city’s most famous artist in an effort to rebrand the site as a less “soulless” retail outlet. Peel bosses, who bought the Lowry Outlet shopping centre at MediaCityUK for £70m in 2012, have announced it will be now been known as Lifestyle Outlet Manchester – despite the fact it is in Salford. They say they want to “redefine” the shopping centre, opposite the theatre also named after the 20th century painter LS Lowry, and challenge its “soullessness”. The move has caused outrage among fans of the artist. It comes just months after the shopping centre added “Manchester” to its name, despite it being situated entirely in Salford.
Last year, art lovers and councillors criticised chiefs at the property development company, which also owns the Trafford Centre, for putting up a new sign reading: “Lowry Outlet MediaCityUK, MANCHESTER”. Salford councillor John Warmisham said he was sick and tired of people jumping on the back of the success of Salford Quays by describing it as being in Manchester. He said: “It’s an awful name for a shopping centre – plus it’s in Salford, not Manchester. How they can get rid of the Lowry name, I don’t know. The whole project, with the theatre, was about him from the start, as one of Salford’s favourite sons. “It’s sad they’ve made this decision. The centre doesn’t promote itself that well – they should be concentrating on that rather than a name change.” The council began development on the site in the 1980s as it approached the end of its life as a working dock. By 1996, funding for the £106m development was secured and the Lowry Trust was put in charge of the project, which comprised the Lowry Centre, a footbridge and the Digital World Centre. The mall was opened a year after the theatre and gallery complex, which contains more than 400 of Lowry’s works. A PR statement from Peel reads: “The philosophy behind Lifestyle Outlets is to create destinations with personality.” The managing director, Jason Pullen, said: “We want to change the face of outlet shopping and redefine perceptions of what an outlet can be, because we believe it needs to be done. “Shopping has become a major leisure activity and people expect more from a centre than just background music. They want an experience. That’s why great brands and entertainment are an integral part of our appeal.”"
2016-09-09T10:51:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Former undercover police spies have become hostile towards Scotland Yard,"Some of the undercover police officers who were sent to infiltrate political groups have become hostile towards Scotland Yard, according to police. In an official document, police chiefs say there is a “strained” relationship between the former undercover officers and what they call “the wider Metropolitan Police Service”. The former undercover officers had at one time worked in the Special Demonstration Squad, the Met’s controversial undercover unit that spied on at least 460 political groups between 1968 and 2008. (For background on the SDS, see this and this). Police say that there are a number of reasons why the relationship has become strained, but do not spell them out. However in another official document, the Met says that an unspecified number of the former SDS officers “assert that they have suffered psychiatric damage as a consequence of their deployments”. These officers have launched legal action against the Met or have retired from the police due to ill-health, according to the document.
“The majority of these officers have expressed considerable hostility to the Metropolitan Police Service and by extension to any other public body that was involved with the Special Demonstration Squad.” The documents (which can be read here and here) have been submitted by the Met to the public inquiry which is scrutinising the police’s use of undercover officers to monitor political groups since 1968. The inquiry - led by Lord Justice Pitchford - was established by Theresa May when she was home secretary following a series of revelations about the conduct of the undercover spies, including forming long-term intimate relationships with women and gathering information about grieving parents of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence. The documents were submitted by the Met as part of an attempt to keep secret the identities of two of their employees. The pair have been given the task of liaising with the large pool of former undercover officers who were employed to infiltrate political groups. According to the documents, the duo are responsible for assessing the likelihood of the former undercover officers being unmasked, and helping to provide welfare support for the ex-spies. (See this and this for the official remit of their work which is codenamed Operation Motion). Police say (here) there are more than 150 officers who - since 1968 - either worked undercover infiltrating political groups, or were employed supervising or managing these undercover officers. This includes those who worked in the National Public Order Intelligence Unit, the undercover squad set up in the late 1990s to spy on political activists.
For an analysis of the number of undercover officers who have been deployed in political groups, see this from the Campaign Opposing Police Surveillance. Lord Justice Pitchford is expected to start the substantive hearings of the inquiry next year. At the moment, he is looking at a number of issues that will help determine how much of the inquiry will be held in public. Police (see here) have argued that large parts of the inquiry should be held behind closed doors. Pitchford has yet to decide whether the two officers employed in Operation Motion should be granted anonymity.

2016-09-09T11:08:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Baby smuggled into Britain inside lorry,"Immigration officers are investigating after a 20-day-old baby was smuggled into Britain in the back of a lorry. Police discovered the baby girl with her parents and siblings at Watford Gap service station on the M1, after a road worker heard shouts for help coming from the vehicle, the Sun reported. Immigration officers are investigating after 10 people – including at least three children – were discovered inside the lorry by Northamptonshire police. A Home Office spokesman said nine of the group were from Iraq, with one person from Iran. They are believed to have entered the country via Calais. Road worker Richard Glover, 24, alerted police after hearing banging from inside the lorry, he told the Sun newspaper. “I could see no food or water in the lorry. It had been a muggy night and it was a warm day, so conditions would have been stifling,” he said. “They could all have suffocated in there – including the baby.” “We heard banging and shouting from the lorry. The driver was standing looking confused. We could hear a male voice shouting to be let out. He was saying ‘No air’ in a foreign accent and sounded desperate – but the driver made it clear he was not opening the cab without the police present.” Police arrived after 20 minutes, he said. The newborn was checked at a local hospital and was said to be healthy. Glover said the child’s father explained they had travelled 2,500 miles, and their six-year-old son had died during the journey. He said: “They shouldn’t be here but you’d need a heart of stone not to feel sorry for them. It just brought it home how desperate they are to get to the UK.” A Home Office spokesman said: “This incident is of concern and is under investigation. Would-be migrants need to be aware that they are putting their lives, and those of their loved ones, at risk by attempting to reach the UK illegally. “That is why we have increased security and boosted technology used at border controls and are working with law enforcement at home and abroad to target the criminal gangs who are often behind such attempts.”"
2016-09-09T14:19:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Camden blocks Christian Candy's plan to turn road into private garden,"Billionaire property developer Christian Candy’s hopes of annexing a strip of road to create a private garden for his Regent’s Park mansion in central London have been thrown out by Camden council. The rejection is a surprise setback for the controversial tycoon, who said he would appeal against the decision. Officers at the council had recommended the proposals be approved by the planning committee, which met on Wednesday night. Candy’s plans would have removed an entire road lane and scrapped up to nine parking spaces to make way for a 400 sq metre garden and private entrance to his home. The work involved transplanting railings and lampposts in one of London’s most important conservation areas. The plans were fiercely opposed by local residents, pitting the developer best known for creating the super-luxe One Hyde Park apartment complex in Knightsbridge against a group of influential neighbours, including doctors, surgeons, entrepreneurs, university professors and the psychiatrist and broadcaster Raj Persaud. Neighbour Michael Weber praised the result, saying residents were “absolutely delighted”. The 12-member panel, led by councillor Heather Johnson, rejected the scheme by 10 votes. One member abstained and one voted in favour. Candy holds a 150-year lease on Chester Gate, a private road that borders seven listed houses designed by the regency architect John Nash, which he bought in 2014. He has planning permission to knock them together into a family home and two other residences in a development said to be worth £200m. His firm CPC London, which is developing the site, had claimed the new design would “reinstate a historic garden” in keeping with the original design. The ordinance survey map of 1875 shows a green space where Candy hoped to build one, but planning officers found it had not been designed by Nash or created during his lifetime. Camden received 45 letters of objection. Residents dug up pictures from the 1800s that showed during Nash’s time the land in question was occupied by pavement and a narrow strip of railings. They commissioned a report from the Oxford university professor Geoffrey Tyack, a world expert on Nash. He concluded: “What is being proposed now is not a reinstatement of a garden designed by John Nash, or even of the Victorian garden indicated in the 1875 Ordnance Survey map – which was significantly narrower than the garden now proposed – but the creation of a new private garden through the appropriation of space that has been within the public domain for all but a few of the past 190 years.” Tyack condemned the design as “imposing a spurious version of a garden that never existed on a historic and much-valued urban landscape that has been preserved and maintained over many generations”. Neighbours also claimed reducing the road from two lanes to one could lead to traffic gridlock and create an enclave for drug dealers and antisocial behaviour. A spokesman for the objectors described the garden proposals as about “personal gain” and benefiting only one person “at the expense and inconvenience of thousands”. The battle with Camden council is the latest legal complication for Candy. Earlier this summer, Christian and his brother Nick Candy were accused of tax evasion and blackmail in a bruising £130m high court battle with a former business associate. They deny the claims. The case exposed their financial affairs to unprecedented scrutiny. After years of living as a tax exile in Monaco, Christian Candy’s barrister told the court his client was now tax resident in Britain. It was revealed that the Chester Gate properties were in fact held in his wife’s name. Candy is married to Emily Crompton, a former girlfriend of Prince Charles’s stepson Tom Parker Bowles. CPC London responded to Camden’s verdict saying: “We are extremely disappointed with this decision. Camden council’s rejection of the proposal, which seeks to bring additional green space to London, defies logic. The proposal had been fully supported by the council’s own planning officers. Camden council have not yet provided reasons for their decision, which we will appeal through the inspectorate.”"
2016-09-09T15:44:25Z,uk-news,UK news,"Parts of Becky Godden's body may have been removed, court hears","The buried remains of a woman allegedly murdered by a taxi driver may have been revisited and partially removed, a court has heard. Christopher Halliwell, 52, is alleged to have strangled Becky Godden, 20, and buried her in a remote field in Eastleach, Gloucestershire, in 2003. He is currently serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 25 years after admitting stabbing and strangling Sian O’Callaghan, 22, in 2011. Bristol crown court has been told that Halliwell initially confessed to strangling Godden and led police to the “exact spot” of her remains. Halliwell, formerly of Swindon, Wiltshire, has since pleaded not guilty to murder and is representing himself at his trial. The jury heard that Godden’s skeletal remains were missing bones including her skull and arms when they were excavated by police in 2011. John Hunter, a forensic archaeologist, said the grave had been dug between 35cm and 40cm from the surface of the soil. He said: “I identified four possibilities to explain the absence of the upper arms and head. There were no trauma marks to suggest that the head and arms had been removed before burial. “In terms of scavenging by animals, it is unusual that the degree of scavenging should be selective to just the head and arms. “The third possibility was that the head and arms had been removed by ploughing. I would have expected to find missing components within the immediate vicinity given the way the field had been ploughed. There was no evidence of that. “Finally, that the body was revisited and the head and arms removed.” In a statement read to the court, Nicholas Marquez-Grant, a consultant pathologist, said that between 50% and 75% of Godden’s skeleton had been recovered. The jury has been told that Halliwell took DS Steve Fulcher to the field in Eastleach after Halliwell was arrested over the disappearance of O’Callaghan. Giving evidence on Thursday, Fulcher claimed Halliwell told him he had last visited the field three years before. Describing the alleged conversation, Fulcher said: “I asked him for clarifying details of who he had buried at that location. He told me he had picked up a prostitute in Broad Street or Manchester Road in Swindon. “He told me he had had sex with her and had killed her by strangling her. He said he had left the body in bushes by the wall by the edge of the field. He had returned the following night and spent the night digging a 5ft [1.5-metre] deep grave and burying the body. He told me that he had last visited the site about three years ago.” In angry courtroom exchanges, Halliwell claimed he had never been in the field until he accompanied Fulcher there, and called the officer a “corrupt bastard”. The trial continues."
2016-09-09T16:16:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Can UK emulate New Zealand and ban zero-hours contracts?,"When Sports Direct caved into pressure earlier this week and announced it would offer its 18,250 shop staff currently on zero-hours contracts the option of a guaranteed 12-hour week, the move was widely welcomed. But the move will hardly dent the vast, and fast-growing, army of workers across the country who now have to live on insecure employment terms with no holiday or sick pay – and who Theresa May has pledged to help. New data on Thursday showed the number of UK workers on zero-hours contracts has leapt 20% in a year to more than 900,000 – or 2.9% of the working population. Employers’ groups insist they are welcomed by students and part-time workers and an essential tool for modern management. But six months ago, on the other side of the world, a rather tougher line was adopted that May might just be studying. The New Zealand government abolished zero-hours contracts – and the business world is having to find new ways of working. “Since the legislation was brought in banning zero-hours contracts, corporates realise they can’t defend worker exploitation any more,” said Gerard Hehir, national secretary of the Unite union in New Zealand. “The employees’ welfare has become a priority, not an afterthought. They are not just arguing with a puny little union any more – we have the law on our side now.” It was on 11 March that the New Zealand government unanimously passed legislation banning zero-hours contracts across the nation of 4.5 million people. “This is an incredible victory and I am still shocked by it to be honest,” said Unite’s0 national director, Mike Treen, when the law was passed. “The fact that the ban was unanimously supported in parliament is pretty unbelievable.”
Treen estimates hundreds of thousands of Kiwis were employed on zero-hours contracts, which demanded availability for seven days a week with no guaranteed hours. As in the UK, the contracts were especially insidious in the fast-food, cinema, hotel and casino industries. They included big names such as McDonald’s, Pizza Hut and the hamburger chain Wendy’s. From 1 April it became illegal for any new workers employed to be offered zero-hours contracts and any current workers must be offered compliant employment terms by 1 April 2017. Unite members have since been run busy negotiating new employment contracts for their members – and travelling internationally to share their success story with other unions. The new legislation stipulates that workers must be offered a fixed, minimum number of hours each week, and will not be penalised for refusing any extra work they are offered at short notice. “We have been pretty in demand, everyone wants the nitty-gritty details of how we pulled it off,” said Joe Carolan, a senior organiser for Unite. “Internationally, activists think the speed of the victory was startling. But we’ve been campaigning since 2005. We’ve had long drawn-out scraps. Endless fights.” This week the union has been celebrating the conclusion of a significant and lengthy negotiation with Restaurant Brands New Zealand (which includes the KFC, Starbucks and Pizza Hut franchises) agreeing to move its 4,000 zero-hours employees on to fixed-hour contracts. The company will now guarantee workers a minimum number of hours each week, and “reasonable compensation” for any time they are expected to be available. Intense negotiations are also continuing with Burger King and Wendy’s, said Carolan. But one fast-food chain is continuing to dig its heels in: “McDonald’s are tough,” said Carolan. Hehir said the zero-hours contracts demanding 24/7 availability from employees were evidence of poor management – and using modern technology most companies had been able to accurately pinpoint the busiest times, when extra workers may be needed, to a 10-hour window each week. The introduction of minimum fixed hours had also taken away any tools some managers use to discriminate against workers on a personal basis – and reward or punish them with more or less hours arbitrarily. “If you forget to smile at your boss on their birthday, that’s no longer something they can punish you for by withholding shifts,” said Hehir. “Workers have more stability, more confidence they will not be punished for personal slights – real or imagined.” Shirley Wang, who is employed at Sky City Casino in Auckland on a fixed-hour contract and is an active Unite member, says the next hurdle is to move workers to banded employment contracts – in which the average hours they work are measured over a year, and the employee is then offered that many hours on a regular basis. Unite is also making moves towards unionising and defending migrant workers in New Zealand. “The legislation was a massive win,” said Wang. “But that doesn’t mean there aren’t still huge challenges ahead of us. Before, no-one wanted to talk to us, we were dismissed. Now, businesses are finally realising that a lot of what we’re saying is actually common sense. That a more insecure, higher turnover of staff was actually costing them money. A loyal workforce is something every employer should strive for, because in the end it is always good for business. And that is our strongest argument.” Carolan says what pushed the New Zealand ban on zero-hours contracts over the line was the swift, bipartisan support that became united by a common outrage: that Kiwi workers could not be guaranteed earning a living. “What really ignited the campaign was when it became single-issue, and when we called it ‘zero hours’. The terms before that – underemployed, flexible hours – nothing resonated, But zero hours hit home. It’s not just about persuading and mobilising the workers – you’ve got to get everyone to see common sense. When we did, we were unstoppable.”"

Built at a cost of £10m a mile, the 35-mile line from Edinburgh Waverley to Tweedbank near Galashiels has one of the worst performance records of any on the Scottish network after a spate of breakdowns and delays. Campaigners say that across the first four days of this week only 36 of the 132 scheduled trains from Edinburgh arrived at Tweedbank on time. Since October last year it has never had a week where more than 70% of services were on time, and in some weeks the figure has been as low as 30%. ScotRail Abellio, the line’s Dutch-owned operator, has admitted that the second-hand Class 158 diesel trains used on the line are unable to deal with the steep gradient they have to climb at Falahill, where the line rises 880ft above sea level. The radiators overheat as the trains struggle uphill, causing engines to cut out. Engineers are now testing more effective cooling systems but ScotRail said it had no date by which they would be fitted. At the same time, devices called axle counters, which monitor each train’s journey along the 25 miles of single-track line, have suffered repeated faults, causing trains to stop, campaigners say. Humza Yousaf, the Scottish transport minister, said the line had “breathed new life into the region” but he had ordered a full operational review to investigate the problems. “The reliability of the service has not been to the standard I expect,” Yousaf said. “I have therefore asked ScotRail to present me with an improvement plan for the line, which will reassure passengers with enhanced reliability as quickly as possible.” ScotRail and the Scottish government said the line had been far more popular than expected, attracting 1 million passengers this year – well above the original projections. That itself caused delays. Visitor numbers at attractions including Sir Walter Scott’s home at Abbotsford have grown by up to 12%. ScotRail insisted the line had been an “extraordinary success”. David Spaven, a rail consultant and Borders railway campaigner, said that optimism was undermined by the data. “The reality has been a mixture of very good and very bad outcomes. Until now the political establishment has been unwilling to confront that. But finally, now they’re admitting there has been a big problem.”"
2016-09-09T23:01:15Z,uk-news,UK news,Thrill-seekers blamed for rise in cliff rescues,"There has been a sharp increase in the number of walkers who need rescuing after tumbling down cliffs, firefighters and local government safety officials have said. The rise is thought to be down to more people seeking excitement by climbing or scrambling on cliff faces, taking walks too close to dangerous edges, and getting close to dangerous drops in an attempt to take spectacular selfies. Rescuers are also having to come to the aid of beach lovers caught in rockfalls and dog owners who get into trouble after pursuing their dogs on to cliffs. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) undertook 166 launches to people on cliffs in 2015, compared with 118 in 2014 – a rise of 41% – while firefighters are rescuing people stranded on cliffs and beaches due to rising tide at an average rate of once a month. Statistics from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show 121 people were admitted to hospital with injuries sustained due to falling from cliffs in 2014-15, compared with 112 in 2013-14 – an 8% increase.
The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents more than 370 councils and all 48 fire and rescue authorities, is calling on government to launch a national campaign to highlight the risks of climbing, walking along or bathing near cliffs, and is urging people to assess the risks and use their judgment. Simon Blackburn, chair of the LGA’s safer and stronger communities board, said: “At this time of year a walk along the cliffs can be lovely, but while the views may be picturesque, they come with their own perils. “It is irresponsible and negligent for any inexperienced climber to scale cliffs because not only are they jeopardising their own safety, they are also endangering the lives of firefighters and fellow rescue workers who are expected to come to their aid when they get stuck or fall.” He added: “Young people may see cliffs as an opportunity to explore and climb, but doing so isn’t worth the risk. Cliff rescues are difficult, dangerous and time-consuming operations which often involve coordination with the coastguard and other emergency services. They put a demand on resources and can lead to fire and rescue services elsewhere being called to provide backup or cover. “Some of these can easily be avoided if people take sensible precautions when either walking across clifftops or visiting beaches.”
Among the cases highlighted by the LGA was that of a 13-year-old boy airlifted to hospital and put into a coma after sustaining a fractured skull, a collapsed lung, a broken leg, collarbone and pelvis and five broken ribs after falling down a cliff while playing on rocks near Cullercoats, North Tyneside. It also drew attention to the rescue of a teenage boy who got stuck while climbing a cliff at Durdle Door, in Dorset, in front of hundreds of sunbathers. One of the most striking seaside images of the summer was of teenagers sitting atop crumbling white cliffs in East Sussex, a popular spot for selfie enthusiasts, with legs dangling over the edge. Last month the National Trust urged people to keep away from drops after a news helicopter took footage of men with phones leaping up and down on top of a cliff at Dover. It is not just a British phenomenon. Five tourists were injured in Goa apparently after taking selfies at a cliff edge, and Croatian police issued a warning after a Canadian man was almost killed after falling down a cliff. The Croatian police tweeted:"
2016-09-10T06:00:24Z,uk-news,UK news,South Yorkshire HS2 decision based on incomplete data,"The new HS2 rail route through South Yorkshire was proposed without full consideration of noise pollution or mass housing demolition, the company behind the high-speed link has admitted. HS2 Ltd, which is responsible for the development and delivery of the UK’s HS2 network, altered its planned route through the region in July. Following lobbying from Sheffield politicians, HS2 Ltd recommended that the service be run through the city’s main railway station instead of the Meadowhall shopping centre, resulting in the demolition of a £30m estate of 212 family homes in Mexborough, between Rotherham and Doncaster. The company said the decision had been made to achieve reductions in costs, the number of homes it would need to demolish and the noise impact, but information obtained through a freedom of information request show the company is yet to complete its assessment of how many demolitions the new line will require and the levels of noise pollution it will produce. In a response to the request by the Yorkshire Against HS2 campaign group, the company said the information was a “work in progress” and that it would be released only after the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, had decided whether or not to give the go-ahead to the plans. Grayling’s decision is expected this autumn. Jonathan Pile, a spokesman for the campaign group, whose family home in Crofton, Wakefield, is 265 metres from the proposed high-speed train line, said the secretary of state was being misled and had not been given all the information he needed to make his decision. “This new proposal is not worth the paper it’s written on,” said Pile. “It’s not been researched. [HS2 Ltd] shouldn’t have recommended this route before making a detailed study of the impact.” In June, a spokeswoman for HS2 Ltd described the Sheffield Meadowhall station as providing “significantly better connections to more people and places across the region and at a lower cost, and provides the quickest onward journey times to Leeds, Newcastle and Scotland”. But in a report, published on 7 July, the company’s chairman, Sir David Higgins, recommended that bringing the line through Sheffield would result in “less overall expected noise impact, and be less expensive to build ... [and] it is expected fewer properties would need to be demolished”. Freedom of information requests have shown that Sheffield council spent £190,000 lobbying for the line to be brought through the city, claiming that it would create 6,500 more jobs and bring in hundreds of millions of pounds in business rates.
Politicians in Wakefield, Doncaster and Rotherham have been opposed to the line going through Sheffield and argue that bringing it through the Meadowhall shopping centre, which lies three miles north-east of Sheffield city centre and two miles from the centre of Rotherham, would provide more benefits to the wider region. Pile said: “If Sheffield council was allowed to object to the Meadowhall station location and obtain a new route recommendation, surely natural justice says Wakefield, Doncaster and Rotherham have the similar right to object and that a consensus route needs to be devised that gains agreement from all councils in the region.” An HS2 Ltd spokesperson said: “We believe our proposals for a new South Yorkshire route are the best solution for the region. HS2 is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to invest in our infrastructure. It will improve connectivity, capacity and journey times right across the country. As a result of the changes we have put forward, we expect there to be fewer properties affected. “The secretary of state is expected to make a decision on the whole of the high-speed rail route between Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds later this year. In order to aid that decision, HS2 will continue to develop all of our plans to ensure that the secretary of state will be able to make an informed decision on the route. “Following the decision, all of this information will be released as part of a consultation that will enable affected communities to have their say, including information on noise and demolitions.” The new proposed HS2 route will use existing railway lines to get into and out of Sheffield via Chesterfield to the south and Rotherham to the north. The main north-south HS2 line to Leeds will be repositioned to the east from Rotherham to follow the M1 and M18, travelling straight through Conisbrough, Mexborough in Doncaster and Grimethorpe in Barnsley. HS2 claims the new plans will save £1bn and a detailed breakdown of the costings released in response to FOI requests by Yorkshire Against HS2 show that the majority of those savings come from not building the station at Meadowhall. The figures also show that the company has factored in an additional £32m for environmental mitigation, despite saying the new route would have a lower environmental impact. Colin Elliff, a railway civil engineer from the campaign High Speed UK, which has developed an alternative “different, better and cheaper” plan for a high-speed rail network, said the cost of the second route would probably be very similar to the old route. “The demolitions have got to be more because there’s no equivalent of the Shimmer housing estate on the old route,” said Elliff. The new Shimmer estate in Mexborough, which has about 400 residents, faces demolition if the plans go ahead. The £30m estate of 212 family homes has been under construction since 2011 and is expected to be finished next June."
2016-09-10T16:08:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Activists surround Yarl's Wood detention centre with wall of noise,"Activists campaigning to close the Yarl’s Wood detention centre surrounded the building and created a wall of noise around the controversial site. Women detained inside, who are held there before deportation, waved from the windows on Saturday afternoon as hundreds of protesters kicked the 20ft fence, banged pans and chanted through mobile PA systems.
The detainees showed their support through narrow, mirrored glass windows that can only be cracked opened by two or three inches. The protest was organised by the Movement for Justice who are calling for the Bedfordshire centre to be shut down with immediate effect. The protesters claim that the centre is emblematic of the “scapegoating of migrants” which they claim has been prevalent since the UK voted to leave the EU in June. They are also calling for an end to mass deportations through the use of charter flights. Crowds fell silent at 2.20pm to hear women speaking through mobile phones from inside the centre.
One woman said how Serco, the private contractors who manage Yarl’s Wood on behalf of the Home Office, had for the first time blocked the corridors between wings to stop detainees from the other side of the centre from coming to see the demonstration. Another woman added: “We are locked in, officers standing by the door.” In other rooms detention officers were stopping detainees from standing by the windows, she said. “We wanted to put a cloth out [of the window]. They told us to take it off,” the detainee added.
Karen Doyle, Movement for Justice national organiser, said the demonstration aimed to strengthen and empower the women inside. “It has been the women’s determination to speak the truth about sexual abuse and harassment that has seen the secretive world of abuse behind the walls of Yarl’s Wood exposed,” she said. “It has been the women’s continued defence of each other, gathering together in rooms, that has stopped unjust deportations and it has been the women’s insistence on never giving up, on always exposing the truth of their experience that has meant Yarl’s Wood is now recognised as a ‘national concern’, a blot on the UK’s stated commitment to women’s rights,” she said. “This is an issue for anyone who care’s about women’s rights, human rights, justice and equality. The UK’s commitment to human rights is a lie as long as places like Yarl’s Wood exist.”
Former detainees at Yarl’s Wood were among the activists who joined the demonstration. They preferred not to be named in case their activities harmed their immigration cases. One, a woman in her early 30s now living in Barnsley, said guards had treated her and fellow detainees like criminals during her time there. “There we have no life, they call us all sorts of names,” she said. “They don’t call you by your name, they call you by your room number. They say: ‘Avocet 123, come to your unit.’ That’s how they know you. “There is no freedom and if you don’t have anybody to support you outside, you will die.” Penalties for any perceived rule infractions are harsh. The women inside Yarl’s Wood who shouted and waved at protesters faced punishment, she added. A second former detainee said that despite the punishments women faced for cooperating with demonstrations, it was important that they continue. “It gives you courage to stand up for yourself,” she said. “When I was in there I was doing so many protests that they rejected me from returning to Yarl’s Wood. “We can hear [the demonstrations] but what officers do, because this block [in front of the demonstration] is not all of it, there’s another block – they block them from coming here. When I was there, if I knew [protesters] were coming I would make sure everyone came to this side. After that, they didn’t want me there anymore. “Immigration, they are criminal, they are breaching human rights.” The centre in Bedfordshire holds 410 people, mostly women and adult families, who are due to be deported from the UK. Since opening in 2001, it has been mired in scandal and been the subject of scrutiny by human rights campaigners. A report by the National Audit Office published in July revealed that cost-cutting measures imposed on the privately run facility will see staff axed and replaced with self-service kiosks. The NAO report stated: “While the move to self-service in the residential services contract reduced demands on staff time, Serco’s reduction of staff meant there were insufficient operational and management staff. The contract envisaged freeing up staff time by moving to a ‘self-service’ model where, for example, residents send their own faxes and book their own visits.” It also emerged earlier this year that women detained in the centre reported six allegations of sexual assault against staff over a three-year period. The attacks were alleged to have taken place between 2013 and 2015. The Home Office minister at the time, James Brokenshire, said that all allegations had been investigated but the Home Office and Bedfordshire police said they could not provide details of the outcome of the investigations. Both the Home Office and Bedfordshire police said they could not provide details of the outcome of the investigations, but Brokenshire said all allegations were investigated."
2016-09-10T16:24:52Z,uk-news,UK news,HS2 boss quits before key decision on high-speed rail project,"The boss of HS2, the company behind the UK’s planned £55bn high-speed rail network, has announced he is leaving just weeks before the transport secretary is expected to make a key decision on the controversial project’s future. Simon Kirby, who reportedly earns £750,000 a year as chief executive at Europe’s largest infrastructure project, is to become chief operating officer at the engineering firm Rolls-Royce. Anti-HS2 campaigners accused Kirby of “getting out before the true scale of the mess he has presided over is realised”. Chris Grayling, who was recently appointed as transport secretary by Theresa May, is expected to make a decision on phase two of the route, from the West Midlands to Leeds and Manchester, this autumn. In June, the National Audit Office said HS2 could be delayed by a year, with the 2026 target date for opening phase one between London and the West Midlands being “at risk”.
The Stop HS2 campaign manager, Joe Rukin, said the project was beset by major problems and Kirby could not justify his salary. “The departure of Simon Kirby will be a serious blow to those who champion HS2, though many of us are at a complete loss to see just exactly what it is he has done to justify his three-quarters of a million pay packet.” Kirby, who joined HS2 in May 2014 from the board of Network Rail, said his experience delivering a major project “on time and to budget” would be applied at Rolls-Royce. “The ability to deliver major programmes on time and to budget is essential, and I am looking forward to bringing my experience to bear on these complex challenges and to leading the current programme of industrial transformation,” he said in a statement on the Rolls-Royce website. In May, it emerged Britain’s most senior civil servant, Sir Jeremy Heywood, was reviewing HS2 as fears grew that the high-speed railway could not be built within budget in its current form. HS2 is supposed to alleviate the capacity crisis on the railways, which are struggling to cope with the highest number of passengers since the 1920s. The economic benefits of getting business travellers between major cities quickly have been estimated at more than £40bn. The boost would come in the form of new jobs, homes and businesses, according to the accountancy firm EY. But the project has been plagued by cost problems since it was first mooted under the last Labour government. There was an increase of nearly £10bn in 2013 and recently a £5bn rise to reflect inflation. The HS2 chairman, Sir David Higgins, said the company would miss Kirby. “Whilst naturally we will miss his experience and leadership, I also recognise that he is joining a truly great, global company in an industry in which he has previously worked.” The Rolls-Royce chief executive, Warren East, said: “His exceptional track record in delivering complex major programmes is highly relevant to Rolls-Royce and will strengthen management capability ahead of a period of significant expansion.”"
2016-09-10T16:29:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Transport for London's financial numbers crunch,"Put at its simplest, Transport for London (TfL) needs more money but is getting less of it. A year or so ago, it said its annual income was £11.5bn, but the figure in its 2016/17 budget and business plan, published in March, was £10.4bn (see page 60) - and that was before Sadiq Khan was elected mayor. Government cuts were already reducing the amount of cash coming in, and Khan’s fares freeze and requirement that more of the housing to be built on TfL land is “genuinely affordable” look set to reduce it more. Meanwhile, London’s population is projected to rise from its current 8.6 million-plus to 10 million by 2030. TfL has a large programme of investment in new and improved transport capacity to enable all those extra people and all the others who work in or visit London each day to get around the place as comfortably and efficiently as possible. If that programme is not to be reduced, as Khan promised it won’t be, TfL has to find ways to increase its income and reduce its costs, as Khan promised it will. A new report from the London Assembly’s cross-party budget and performance committee sizes up the financial challenge facing TfL and reaches some measured but fairly stern conclusions. The committee’s membership of three Labour AMs, two Conservatives (including its chair), one Liberal Democrat and one Green paints a picture of uncertain revenue streams, rising costs and risks - which TfL and Boris Johnson had recognised prior to the election - to several projects, including new stations planned for the huge Old Oak Common regeneration scheme, cycling infrastructure, the Sutton tram extension, air quality measures and road safety. The report confirms that the scale and recently increased speed of the government’s phasing out of what is called TfL’s general grant, which contributes to the capital’s transport systems’ day-to-day operating costs by supporting its revenues, are “the most significant elements of TfL’s current financial difficulties”. Nearly £600m built into the 2015/16 business plan is to be reduced to nothing by 2018/19 - nearly 9% of of its total operating income for that year. The report adds that TfL has become accustomed to using some of this grant income to support its capital investment programme - the one that pays for the sorts of new transport stuff now under review - and had been disappointed that the government hadn’t recognised this by compensating for it in its separate capital investment grant. TfL chief finance officer Ian Nunn told the committee in January that he anticipates there being about £300m a year less to spend on capital projects. The current TfL business plan puts the total capital investment figure for 2016/17 at £2.4bn. So big lumps of loot have indeed been removed by the government’s cuts. On top of these, TfL must now factor in the implications of Khan’s fares freeze. The projection TfL released during the election campaign of £1.9bn has since been thoroughly unpicked and the committee concludes it was “unrealistically high”. Even so, the revised number remains a substantial £640m over four years. Khan’s new Hopper bus ticket, which comes into effect from Monday, will also have an effect - it will make some bus passengers better off, but, all else being equal, will have the opposite effect on TfL. The committee lists other factors that could have adverse effects, notably the possible costs of Brexit: a fall in economic activity would lead to less demand for services and cause a drop in fares income; borrowing could become more difficult; EU grants to TfL, whilst not huge, will disappear. TfL has already noted a fall in property values post-Brexit, which could be bad for its property development plans. Can the funding gap be bridged? As the report explains, TfL has become more dependent on receiving a portion of the business rates the mayor retains but warns that “business rates income can be volatile” and that Khan might choose to allocate more of it elsewhere. TfL has made upbeat post-election noises about savings, but the numbers aren’t yet big enough and the committee describes some of them as “arbitrary and unsupported by evidence”, including Khan’s plan to save £25m by merging TfL’s surface and Underground engineering functions and £60m over two years from “better procurement”. Senior staff have already been sounded out about voluntary redundancy. Income should increase, notably from fares, which presently account for 46% of TfL’s income total - about £4.8bn a year, which was expecting to rise to £6.6bn by 2020/21, boosted by the opening of Crossrail. But the report says the fares freeze could restrict that to £6.4bn and that it is “crucial” to tackle the recent, congestion-related, decline in bus use - bus fares contribute one third of TfL’s fares income. The worry is that fares income might not increase by enough. Khan’s idea that TfL could sell its expertise to other cities is described in the report as potential distraction at a time of mounting pressure on what it already does. There is a, possibly ominous, section on the need for TfL to keep its array of concessionary fares for young and older people under review. The report makes seven recommendations, most of them asking TfL to clearly set out all its figures on fares, investment and progress towards meeting the mayor’s various objectives (this is not out of line with a different committee’s report on transparency, published in February). Another urges TfL to publish in advance of the next mayoral election “a set of highly transparent, basic fare income data and assumptions on which candidates can base manifesto commitments and inform the public’s understanding of any proposed changes”. Given the fractious opacity of the fares freeze row during this year’s mayoral fight, that can’t be a bad thing. Whether this valuable committee report is too gloomy and Khan will be vindicated in the long run remains to be seen. Certainly, it should help concentrate minds. Read the whole thing here."

Ailish Sheehan won the podium place with her three teammates in the British women’s four crew in Poznan last Sunday. While celebrating the win with teammates she fell, suffering catastrophic injuries. Sheehan slipped into a coma and on Friday afternoon died in hospital in Poznan with her parents, John and Catherine, and sisters, Niamh and Aine, by her bedside. Her family had held a vigil by her bed throughout her six-day stay in the Polish hospital. The 23-year-old post-graduate student was a member of the University of London boat club and had recently been elected its vice-captain. The club’s chief coach, Phil Gray, said the rising star had a “significant future” in the the sport. In a statement he said: “The whole club is devastated by this news. Not only was Ailish a top oarswoman with a significant future in the international side of the sport, but she also lit up the club with her humour and laughter. “She was a great example to younger members and starting next year without her is hard to imagine at the moment, especially as she had been elected vice-captain. “But our main thoughts are with Ailish’s family, who obviously meant so much to her.” Tributes also poured in from from British Universities & College Sport (BUCS) – the governing body for higher education sport in the UK. A spokesman said: “Ailish was involved in an accident after the culmination of the 2016 FISU World University Championships for rowing in Poznan on Sunday evening. “BUCS, British Rowing and Rowing Ireland are providing support to her family during this difficult time and ask for their privacy to be respected. “On behalf of everyone at BUCS, I wish to extend our condolences to the family and friends of Ailish and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.” The Limerick-born rower won an athletic scholarship to the prestigious University of Notre Dame in Indiana in 2011. By the time she graduated four years later she was a member of their first varsity eight team. While studying for a masters in design and environment at Goldsmiths, University of London, in the last academic year she won a slew of titles including a gold medal at the British Universities Championships in the women’s coxed four. A spokesman from Goldsmiths said: “We are shocked and saddened at this tragic news. Our condolences and thoughts are with Ailish’s family and friends at this very difficult time.” Lee Boucher, the British team manager in Poznan, said: “It is with great sadness that I have to report that our teammate Ailish has passed away in hospital in Poznan surrounded by her family. “Our thoughts at this time are with all of her family and friends.” He added: “Like her performances on the water, Ailish gave everything right until the very end, but unfortunately she was unable to win this battle. “Ailish’s family take comfort in knowing that she didn’t suffer and that she was happy in her final moments.”"
2016-09-10T23:05:44Z,uk-news,UK news,"It is immigration, above all else, that has united the right and divided the left","The main finding from our poll, carried out in the middle of last month, is that immigration is uniting the right but dividing the left. Based on the answers given on a range of issues, we were able to separate people into eight political tribes. The two largest we identified were on the right of British politics, and make up half of the electorate. While they disagree about some economic issues, they are broadly united in favour of leaving the EU and reducing immigration sharply. One (we call it Common Sense, 26% of those polled) is made up overwhelmingly of Conservative voters, mainly older people from the south of England who are advanced in their careers or retired. The other (Our Britain, 24%) mostly comprises older working-class people from the north of England and the Midlands, and is split between Tory and Ukip voters. Both would prioritise reducing immigration over remaining in the EU single market. Interestingly in the light of last week’s announcement, both would also favour more grammar schools. They represent a solid core of rightwing votes. Closer to the centre but still on the right of it sit two smaller pro-business tribes (Free Liberals, 7%) and New Britain (6%). These two groups agree with the Common Sense group about the need for low taxes and restricting benefits but are much more pro-immigration, voted Remain in the referendum and want Brexit to mean staying in the single market. But both are overwhelmingly pro-Conservative in their political outlook and there isn’t really any other party that is a natural fit so they are unlikely to drift away. Theresa May has a large pool to fish in and plenty of options. By comparison, and looking at the tribes further on the left, the situation faced by whoever wins the Labour leadership will be far harder because the centre and the left are split into more tribes with bigger divisions. The ones Labour will target are split over immigration, business, and whether Britain should be an open multicultural society or a closed, ethnically homogenous one. They are also divided geographically between those in Scotland, the urban north (more anti-immigration) and the metropolitan, more multicultural south. The tribes on the left include one we call Democratic Socialists (8%) who are very open to immigration and the single market but also want higher taxes on the wealthy and businesses. They are mostly ABC1s, living in urban areas in Scotland and Wales. Then there is the Community tribe (5%) – mainly working-class voters in northern England and the Midlands – who agree on the need for income redistribution through the tax system but strongly disagree with the Democratic Socialists about immigration, wanting strict curbs. Another tribe, the Progressives (11%), are professionals from across the country, who share the Democratic Socialists’ openness to immigration and the single market but are much more pro-business. In the 1990s, it was possible to put together a coalition of these tribes on the left and centre-left and win over enough in the Swing Voter tribe (7%) to form an election-winning majority, as Tony Blair did. But we now live in a world in which views on immigration have polarised and many in the north feel left behind and threatened by multiculturalism and globalisation, while more in the south embrace both. The left is divided not just from the right, but among its composite parts. From our findings – 6% of the population did not fall easily into a “tribe” – it will be a lot easier to form a winning majority of centre-right and rightwing tribes than centre-left and leftwing ones. So, despite facing the most daunting inbox of any prime minister for decades, our poll is good news for Theresa May but far less promising for whoever takes Labour into the next general election.

2016-09-11T11:33:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Travellers face Â£5 charge to get through passport control faster,"Travellers are to be charged to get through passport checks quickly at British airports, with some paying as much as £17.50, the Home Office has confirmed. The charge is an attempt to cut queues, but unions called it a gimmick and accused the government of failing to properly fund border controls. Officials said they were working with some airport operators to introduce the scheme but denied reports in the People newspaper that it will be introduced in every UK airport with a charge of at least £5 per person. At Gatwick airport, passengers face having to pay £17.50 on top of the price of their airline ticket to use a fast lane through passport control on arrival and through security on departure. The scheme could mean that those who do not pay are forced to wait even longer if staff are diverted to running the premium system and not replaced. It was reported last month that Edinburgh airport was adopting the system and Gatwick’s service was advertised last year. A spokesman for the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union said: “This is a ridiculous idea that exposes just how understaffed our borders are. What happens if everyone opts to pay £5? We’re back to square one. “Instead of gimmicks like this, the government needs to properly invest in staff to work at ports and airports because the shortages are there for all to see.” Mark Gribbin, chairman of the ISU, which represents borders, immigration and customs workers, said staffing levels were inadequate. “There are simply not enough staff. Our members are working hours on end under oppressive, often hostile conditions,” he told members. “Managers are under severe pressure to contain queues, creating still more pressure for frontline staff. It’s only a matter of time before [there is] serious public disorder and, who knows, even mass breach of the border.” At Gatwick, the system provides those who have paid extra with an “exclusive lane through passport control”. In order to guarantee fast passage, it is limited to 50 people per hour. The expansion of the scheme follows a government consultation in 2013, in which the possibility of charging for quick passage through passport control was raised. The government had been running a similar system at some border crossing points, but was only charging travellers what it cost to run. In the consultation document, the government suggested increasing the price and using the money it raised to “help fund the immigration system, secure the border and invest in improving processes”. The Home Office said its Border Force was “working closely with several airport operators to introduce a fast track passport control service, which will provide passengers with another choice of a secure and convenient route through the UK border.

Mzee Mohammed, 18, died on the night of 13 July after being detained by Merseyside police at the Liverpool One shopping centre. Officers were called to the scene following unconfirmed reports that Mohammed had a knife and was behaving in an “aggressive and erratic manner”. Police said they called an ambulance once it became clear that Mohammed was suffering “a medical episode”, and he was pronounced dead about an hour and a half later at Royal Liverpool University hospital. The Independent Police Complaints Commission launched an investigation the day after Mohammed’s death, deploying investigators to oversee examination of the scene and the post-incident procedure. The cause of the teenager’s death has not yet been confirmed. A spokesman for the watchdog said: “The IPCC would like to speak to a woman who witnessed events inside the Chips A GoGo kiosk outside John Lewis at the Liverpool One shopping complex at approximately 6.30pm on the evening of Mzee Mohammed’s death on 13 July 2016. “She identified herself to security staff attending to Mr Mohammed as a medical professional although did not provide any direct assistance. She is not under suspicion of having committed any offence but may be able to provide valuable eyewitness testimony.” About 300 people attended Mohammed’s funeral on Friday, paying tribute to a “boisterous, colourful and imaginative” teenager. His death has prompted protests, organised by the campaign group Black Lives Matter, in Liverpool and London. Deborah Coles, the director of the charity Inquest, which focuses on deaths in custody and detention, backed the IPCC’s call for the witness to come forward. “What’s crucial about an investigation of this kind is that it’s an opportunity for independent and robust scrutiny of what happened and therefore any non-police witness is of course very, very important to the integrity of the investigation,” she said. “There has been a mistrust about how independent the IPCC has been in the past [and] I think some people are therefore reluctant to get involved, but if this witness has got any concerns then she could contact us or she could contact a lawyer so that she can be with somebody else when she’s giving her evidence,” said Coles. “For the family nothing can be more important than knowing the truth about what happened … they weren’t there, so they are dependent on other people coming forward.” In footage that has emerged since Mohammed’s death, he is seen lying face down, barefoot, surrounded by paramedics and a large number of police officers. He appears unconscious and has his hands cuffed behind his back. Speaking shortly after the incident, Marcia Rigg, whose brother Sean died following a cardiac arrest while in police custody on 21 August 2008, said seeing the video of Mohammed surrounded by police officers and paramedics brought back memories of her brother’s death. “I was alarmed that he [Mohammed] appears to be fully unconscious, but his handcuffs haven’t been removed,” she said. “How can you bring someone medical attention when they’re in handcuffs?” Rigg said the decision to keep his handcuffs on behind his back would have restricted his breathing and prevented him from being put in the recovery position."
2016-09-11T14:02:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Ex-soldier who fought Isis criticises 'harrowing' police investigation,"A former soldier who fought against Islamic State in Syria has described the 10 months he spent on police bail after returning to the UK as an “extremely harrowing ordeal”. Joe Robinson, 23, was arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences at Manchester airport in November last year after fighting alongside Kurdish rebels in Syria. The ex-soldier, from Accrington in Lancashire, was told on Friday that he is no longer on police bail but it is understood that detectives are continuing to investigate whether Robinson and other Britons who fought against Isis committed terrorism offences. Robinson told the Guardian: “I’m just happy that the restrictions placed on me have been dropped and that I can finally move on with my life. “Although the investigation for all UK citizens who volunteered with the YPG [Kurdish militia] in Syria is still ongoing, the fact that special branch have confirmed that, due to insufficient evidence, all restrictions and bail conditions placed on me have been dropped is definitely positive news.” The ex-soldier, who toured Afghanistan with the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment in 2012, described the past year as “extremely stressful” for him and his family. “I went to Syria to fight against terrorism and to protect the civilians caught up in the fighting who have had to endure the most horrendous experiences and living conditions imaginable,” he said. “I love my country, I am ex-military and served my country in the Afghanistan conflict, but to be accused of terrorism by the same country I fought for for simply trying to help those in need has been extremely harrowing and made me think twice about the morals of the government in the UK.” In January, Robinson described how he had struggled to adapt to civilian life in Blackburn after months fighting alongside the Kurdish militia group YPG, or People’s Protection Units. It was the day after the Tunisian beach terrorist attack in June last year that Robinson quit his job to go to fight in Syria, telling his boss only that he was going abroad. Over the previous 12 months, starting with the murder of the Salford aid worker Alan Henning, he had grown increasingly incensed by both Isis’s gory propaganda videos and what he saw as Britain’s inaction in Syria. Telling his mother he was going to France to try to join the French foreign legion, Robinson instead flew from Manchester to Germany and then on to Sulaymaniyah, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. In Sulaymaniyah, he met fighters with the Lions of Rojava, a Kurdish unit hosting a number of foreign militants, who then smuggled Robinson and other westerners over the border and into Syria. Another Briton who went to Syria to fight against Isis is due to answer police bail next month after being arrested under counter-terrorism legislation. Aiden Aslin, 22, from Newark in Nottinghamshire, spent 10 months fighting alongside the YPG. He was arrested at Heathrow airport in February and has been on police bail since. His mother Angela Wood told the Newark Advertiser earlier this year: “We still believe Aiden should never have been arrested in the first place. “Aiden should be being treated as a hero for doing what the UK government should be doing.”"
2016-09-11T14:09:54Z,uk-news,UK news,Woman who died in parachuting accident named as Pamela Gower,"A woman who died in a parachuting accident on Saturday lived life to the full and died doing what she loved, her cousin has said. Pamela Gower, who was from Hebburn in South Tyneside, described herself as a “crazy trainee skydiver” and had posted various pictures of herself taking part in the extreme sport on Facebook. “She certainly lived life to the full, that’s for sure,” her cousin, Anthony Cairns, wrote on the site. He added that he felt great sadness at the death of his “lovely cousin”. He said: “Just makes you aware that you have to make the most of life as you have no idea when it is likely to be taken away from you. She was doing exactly that I guess, doing what she loved. “RIP Pamela Gower, we will all always love you so much.” In her profile picture on the site, Gower is seen grinning and dressed in parachuting gear with the caption: “Nothing makes me more happy than skydiving, can’t wait for the next jump.” The 49-year-old had previously trained and jumped with the Skydive Academy, which also organised this weekend’s excursion, to raise money for charity. According to her Just Giving page, she managed to raise nearly £1,000 for Cancer Research by jumping from 15,000ft. Gower worked as an employment adviser for Remploy, an organisation that provides employment placements for disabled people. She died after her parachute failed to open during a jump on Saturday. She was rushed to hospital by air ambulance after landing in a housing estate in County Durham on Saturday afternoon, and taken into intensive care, but later died. The coroner has been informed and a postmortem will be carried out. Durham police said the death would be investigated by authorities, including the British Parachute Association. A Remploy spokesman said: “We are shocked and deeply saddened to hear of Pam’s tragic accident. Pam worked most recently as an employment adviser in our Newcastle branch, supporting disabled people into work. “She had worked for the company for many years and was a valued and respected member of the Remploy team. Our thoughts are with her family, friends and work colleagues past and present. We will be offering whatever support is required at this very difficult time.”"
2016-09-11T15:16:59Z,uk-news,UK news,Police arrest intruders who occupied Sikh temple in Leamington Spa,"Armed officers were called to a Sikh temple in Leamington Spa on Sunday morning after more than 50 men, some carrying blades, entered the building to stop an interfaith marriage service. For around eight hours, the group, described by a trustee of the Gurdwara temple as “fanatical extremists”, occupied the foyer, forcing the postponement of a wedding between a Sikh bride and a Hindu groom that had been scheduled for Sunday. By 4pm Warwickshire police had arrested 55 intruders on suspicion of aggravated trespass. “At this time we believe that it is an escalation of an ongoing local dispute,” a police spokesman said. “A significant number of bladed weapons were seized from the scene,” said Supt David Gardner. “As a result of reports that the men were in possession of these weapons we deployed armed officers as a precaution. Nobody was injured in the incident. Over the coming days we will be working with the local Sikh community to address some of the ongoing issues that have culminated in today’s events.” All but one of the weapons seized so far have been kirpans, ceremonial blades which it is often considered legal for Sikhs to carry in public, Warwickshire police said. Police are investigating initial reports about the involvement of other bladed weapons. It was the third or fourth time in recent months that a group of men had attempted to gain entry to the Gurdwara over the issue of mixed marriages. On previous occasions they were resisted by temple security staff, according a trustee of the Gurdwara. He told the Guardian the intruders were carrying ceremonial Sikh blades and other knives and occupied the temple reception area. At the time a routine early morning religious service was under way attended by several dozen worshippers. “They pushed around a couple of people, grabbed a tie, grabbed someone’s phone and they were trying to threaten people,” claimed the trustee, who asked not to be named. “People were scared. When a normal person goes to the Gurdwara they go to pray and be at peace. People are really, really annoyed with them.” Footage of a group of around 20 men clad in black, wearing hoods, hats and orange bandanas, sitting cross-legged and chanting a prayer appeared on Facebook and purported to show the intruders protesting inside the Gurdwara. One of the men held up a placard that read: “Stop violating Sikh principles for money!!” One supporter of the group on Facebook described it as a peaceful protest. The purpose-built £11m Gurdwara opened in 2009 to serve a local congregation of around 4,000 Sikhs. Warwickshire police said in a statement: “The report was received at 6.47am after a group of between 20 and 30 men entered the temple. We believe that some of the men are in possession of bladed items and as such armed officers have been deployed to the scene. “Officers are inside the temple to negotiate a peaceful resolution. There are also religious leaders in the temple working with officers to negotiate a peaceful resolution. There are police cordons in place around the temple and we would ask that people avoid the immediate area while the incident is resolved.” Jaswat Videe, another Gurdwara trustee, said the intruders were “absolutely wrong” to think that Sikhism prohibits interfaith marriage. “Scripture doesn’t discriminate between anyone,” he said. “The Guru says every citizen in the world is equal.” He also dismissed any suggestion that the temple authorities were allowing interfaith marriages to raise money, saying that the Gurdwara does not charge for weddings and relies on donations."
2016-09-11T17:32:47Z,uk-news,UK news,'There's no compassion': Hermes cut driver's work as wife was dying,"When online shoppers request home delivery, there’s a good chance that someone like Peter Jamieson will bring the package to their door. Jamieson, 33, a former lorry driver, delivered parcels around Edinburgh and West Lothian for retailers such as Next and John Lewis for three years while working for Hermes, which handles 250m packages a year and is the UK’s largest parcel delivery firm after Royal Mail. His patchwork earnings amounted to as little as £500 a month after expenses, but the money was essential to help support his wife, Tricia, and their young son, Brandon. But then Tricia was diagnosed with an inoperable cancer in her mid 20s. Jamieson began struggling with his rounds as his wife underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy to prolong her life, and he needed help. Instead, he said his request to swap delivery days on his rounds so he could attend her hospital appointments was denied. Hermes only gave him more work and then abruptly withdrew everything, Jamieson said. In common with Hermes’s other 10,500 couriers, he was classed as self-employed and therefore had no job security. The timing could hardly have been worse. Doctors had told Tricia that she had months to live. Jamieson said: “Tricia was really upset and panicking about the future for me and our son Brandon when she’s gone. “It was really uncalled for. It let us know what type of company Hermes is. I couldn’t even buy a bunch of flowers for Tricia. I was asking for help, but I was told the work was my responsibility. They told me everyone has problems at Hermes and I would never work for Hermes again ... there was no compassion.” He had to plead for his job back and wrote to Carole Woodhead, the chief executive of Hermes UK, which turned over £443m in 2014-15 and made a profit of £29m after tax. “We have an eight-year-old son called Brandon, who is finding his mum’s illness hard to deal with, and is upset about Tricia losing her hair and having little energy to do as much with him as she used to,” Jamieson told Woodhead. He said: “I tried to maintain my performance at work, but admittedly it was very hard and I felt a lot of strain trying to cope with it all. I had hoped that although I was self-employed, there would still be some support and assistance from my field manager, but that was not forthcoming.” He told Woodhead that Hermes “was aware I was struggling and going through a tough time personally”, but “instead of lessening the burden, [Hermes] increased the volume against my wishes, which was really the last thing I needed”. He pleaded with the company to restore even some of his work, saying he “would not let you down again”. Jamieson was not reinstated and Tricia died within two months. Hermes said someone from the company replied two weeks later on behalf of Woodhead, but Jamieson said he did not receive the letter. A spokeswoman for Hermes said: “This kind of behaviour has absolutely no place in Hermes and we are appalled by these claims. “While we dispute some of his allegations, we do acknowledge that overall our behaviour fell short of the ethical standards we have set ourselves. We have taken the necessary action to prevent this happening in the future.” Justin Clayton, the head of HR operations at Hermes, also said sorry in a letter to Jamieson last month, offering “sincere apologies for due process not being followed and the upset that this has caused you”. Jamieson’s story emerged after a Guardian investigation into Hermes revealed that some couriers were paid rates equivalent to less than the minimum wage and others felt forced to work through illness and bereavement. But according to a report into Hermes published on Monday by the Labour MP Frank Field, titled Wild West Workplace, elements of Jamieson’s experience appear not to be unique. Having reviewed testimonies from 78 current and former Hermes couriers, who came forward with complaints following the Guardian report, Field said it was appalling that in some of the accounts, couriers spoke of being hounded to return to work as they sat by their loved one’s bedside in hospital, while one unwell courier felt the need to have a bucket with them to avoid taking any time off sick. The MP said it was wrong that “fear has been instilled in people who know they could instantly lose their sole source of income at the drop of a hat and through no fault of their own”. “Likewise,” he added, “it is totally unacceptable that people are being paid poverty wages, which are subject to sudden cuts, in return for a full day’s work in which they incur hefty costs.” Hermes has said Field’s report does not reflect the way the organisation operates and it is “committed to ensuring that everyone at Hermes operates in a supportive and compassionate manner”. Since July, when the Guardian exposed concerns about some of its working practices, the company said it had “completely overhauled the processes that we have in place … to ensure that should any courier have a complaint, then it will be heard, investigated properly and responded to appropriately”. It has “voluntarily embedded the principles of the national living wage into our business as the minimum standard for any remuneration agreements with the self-employed couriers we use”, Hermes said. Field applauded the company for the “encouraging first steps”, but said he he wanted Hermes and other “gig economy” employers to do more. Field’s recommendations include courier companies guaranteeing a minimum daily or weekly rate of pay to self-employed drivers, allowing couriers to genuinely negotiate their pay and workload, and placing the duty to find cover for rounds in the hands of the company, rather than the courier. He is calling for workers to receive at least one month’s notice of big changes to their workload, a written contract detailing pay rates and bonus schemes, and a new government code clarifying when someone should be classed as self-employed, a worker or an employee. “The gig economy is transforming the way millions of us buy and sell goods,” Field said. “A further transformation is now required to ensure the sizeable rewards being generated are shared fairly with the armies of people helping to deliver this rising prosperity.”"
2016-09-11T17:46:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Son of Ulster loyalist Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair found dead in Scotland,"The son of the Ulster loyalist terrorist leader Johnny “Mad Dog” Adair has been found dead in Scotland. Johnny Adair Jr, 32, nicknamed “Mad Pup” by his father, was discovered at a property in Troon, South Ayrshire, on Saturday evening. Police Scotland said they were treating the death as unexplained and a postmortem would be carried out. They said a report would be submitted to Scotland’s procurator fiscal. Troon is where the dead man’s father has lived for more than a decade after Adair Sr was expelled from Northern Ireland by the Ulster Defence Association, the loyalist terror group he was a once a senior member of. After a failed bid to take over the entire UDA resulting in a murderous feud, “Mad Dog” was ordered to leave Belfast or face execution at the hands of his former comrades. Adair Sr had sanctioned his son being shot and wounded in 2002 after the then 18-year-old was accused of robberies and extortion in the loyalist Lower Shankill estate area in Belfast. Johnny Adair Jr had recently been freed from prison after serving a sentence for drug offences."
2016-09-11T23:01:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Rowan Williams and 200 faith leaders call for revised refugee policy,"More than 200 leaders of faith communities have signed an open letter to Theresa May calling for urgent changes to the government’s refugee policy, particularly to allow families to be reunited. The signatories are headed by Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, who will give a speech on Monday in front of an audience of faith leaders and refugees to reiterate the letter’s demands. Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, the former lord justice of appeal, has added her name to the letter, which is also signed by leaders and representatives of the Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist communities.
“As people of faith, we call on your government to urgently revise its policy towards refugees,” the letter says. “The best of this country is represented by the generosity, kindness, solidarity and decency that Britain has at many times shown those fleeing persecution, even at times of far greater deprivation and difficulty than the present day. We rejoice in the mosaic of different faiths and British communities that we now represent.” It adds: “In the face of the unfolding human catastrophe, there are immediate and viable steps that the government can take to offer sanctuary to more refugees. We call on you to create safe, legal routes of travel, for example by adopting fair and humane family reunion policies for refugees.” According to Williams, “the sheer scale of the refugee crisis has the capacity to paralyse us”. Allowing relatives of refugees already in Britain to join them would offer “a practical route for responding to the pressure of the human suffering we see”, he told the Guardian. “People admitted as family members are guaranteed a ready-made network, a human support system here – so that we are not talking about an influx of rootless or alienated individuals, vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation,” he said.
“One of the greatest tragedies of the current appalling situation is the shattering of family life as a result of displacement and insecurity.” Calls have been mounting for the government to do more to bring unaccompanied refugee children in Calais to Britain. Some 220 children have been identified as having the legal right to be reunited with families, yet only 50 have been allowed to enter the UK. A campaign by the beneficiaries of Kindertransport, the programme to rescue thousands of Jewish children from the Nazis, has raised more than £50,000 in a week to help pay legal costs and support children in Calais.
Last week, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, raised the issue of unaccompanied children in Calais in the House of Lords. Addressing the home office minister Susan Williams, he said: “Does the minister not agree that where children – particularly young ones – have families in this country there is no reason why they should not be brought across within the day?” One of the signatories of Monday’s interfaith letter, Rabbi Herschel Gluck, said: “Being the son of refugees from Hitler, who lost over 100 of their close family members because of the lack of compassion and vision with regard to family reunification by the authorities at that time, I feel especially obliged to help ensure that we don’t repeat those mistakes.” Qari Muhammad Asim, the chief imam of the Makkah mosque in Leeds, said: “Many refugees with close family members in the UK are risking their lives trying to escape deplorable conditions in camps and reunite with their families. Many lives could be saved if safe legal routes were secured by the government.” Present policies were failing unaccompanied refugee children in Calais, said Peter Hill, the bishop of Barking. “The system is broken ... At the current rate of reunification it will take a year before all the children in Calais are reunited with their families. This is forcing children to take matters into their own hands on rail tracks, stowing away in lorries and putting themselves into the hands of unscrupulous people traffickers. How can a civilised country allow this to continue?” The interfaith letter follows similar initiatives by 350 judges and lawyers, who wrote to the then prime minister, David Cameron, last October; 120 senior economists in January; and 27 humanitarian and refugee organisations, also in January."
2016-09-11T23:01:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Wales moves to replace stamp duty with new land transaction tax,"The first new Welsh tax for almost 800 years is to be outlined in a bill expected to be introduced on Monday. The land transaction tax would replace stamp duty land tax from April 2018 if the bill becomes law. Like stamp duty land tax, land transaction tax would be payable on the purchase or lease of a building or land in Wales over a certain price. An announcement about the rates and bands for the proposed land transaction tax will be made closer to spring 2018, taking into account economic conditions at the time. The bill will also include measures to tackle tax avoidance, based on lessons learned in Scotland, which has a different system to the UK. The finance secretary, Mark Drakeford, said: “This is an historic milestone in the devolution of tax powers to Wales. This bill marks another step towards the creation of taxes which are more suited to the needs of Wales and support Welsh public services. “This is a tax which affects so many of us. By replacing stamp duty land tax with a new made-in-Wales land transaction tax, public services in Wales will continue to benefit from the revenues raised by this important tax. “We have consulted widely about how this tax should work for Wales and listened to a range of views. This is why it will broadly mirror stamp duty land tax, providing the consistency and stability businesses tell us they need and providing a smooth transaction for home-buyers and the property market. We have also been able to learn from the devolution of the tax to Scotland.” In 2014-15, £170m was raised from stamp duty land tax in Wales, with 55,000 transactions taking place. This is expected to rise to £244m by 2018-19. Changes to landfill tax in Wales are also due to take place and it is possible that eventually a separate rate of income tax could be set in Wales. Wales has not had control of its tax system since the 13th century when Edward I invaded Wales."
2016-09-12T05:01:20Z,uk-news,UK news,JD Wetherspoon to offer staff chance to escape from zero-hours contracts,"JD Wetherspoon, the pub chain, has become the latest British company to offer staff on zero-hours contracts the opportunity to move to permanent hours.
Tim Martin, the founder and chairman of the company, told BuzzFeed on Sunday that a trial of offering staff guaranteed hours earlier in the year had proved so successful that it would be rolled out across the country. Wetherspoon joins Sport Direct and McDonald’s in offering staff on casual contracts the opportunity to become permanent employees. The pub chain employs 24,000 people on zero-hour contracts, which is more than the controversial sports retailer Sports Direct. Staff at Wethersoon will be offered guaranteed hours equivalent to about 70% of their typical working week. More than two-thirds of staff took up the offer during the trial. “We’ve already offered guaranteed hour contracts to a percentage of our workforce and they’ll all be offered one in the next three months,” Martin said. Meanwhile, Sport Direct employees who want to move to a permanent contract could be on zero-hours deals until the end of the year, according to an internal email.
The retailer has told workers that plans to move them to a contract with a guaranteed minimum of 12 hours a week “cannot be implemented for everyone overnight” due to the number of casual staff at the company. More than 18,000 workers in Sports Direct shops are on casual contracts. Mike Ashley, the founder of the retail chain, has pledged to offer them a contract with guaranteed hours after a report into the company’s working practices by the law firm RPC. The report was commissioned after the Guardian exposed how temporary staff at warehouses were in effect being paid less than the minimum wage. However, warehouse staff are not part of the initiative to move to contracts with a guaranteed 12 hours a week. In a speech on Monday, the general secretary of the TUC will criticise companies who treat workers “like animals” and praise the role of trade unions in forcing Sports Direct to change its employment practices. Frances O’Grady will say: “After months of Unite’s patient organising, winning public support and using trade union shareholder power, we got a result: an end to zero-hours contracts for retail staff, no more ‘six strikes and out’ and, at long last, the chance to get agency workers on to permanent contracts. A proper win for workers. “Of course, it’s not over yet. Sports Direct may be in the spotlight now, but they are not the only ones. There are other big companies that bring shame on our country. So let me give fair warning to any greedy business that treats its workers like animals – we will shine a light on you. “Run a big brand with a dirty little secret? A warehouse of people paid less than the minimum wage? A fleet of couriers who are slaves to an app? Let me put you on notice. There will be no hiding place. We will organise and we will win. Britain’s unions will not rest until every worker gets the fair treatment they deserve.” In an internal memo to staff, seen by the Guardian, Leon Turnbull, head of people at Sports Direct, said casual workers would be given the opportunity to decide whether to become a permanent employee by the end of the year. He said: “As you will appreciate, given the large number of casual staff engaged by the company, such a change cannot be implemented for everyone overnight. It is our intention that all members of the company’s casual workforce will be given the opportunity to elect to become an employee, or stay on their current terms, by the end of the year. “We will provide you with further more detailed information on this proposal at the earliest opportunity and, in the meantime, thank you for your patience and understanding.”"
2016-09-12T06:27:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Police appeal for owner of bag-strap found near Stephen Lawrence murder scene to come forward,"Police hunting for up to four attackers of Stephen Lawrence who are still at large have appealed for the owner of a bag strap found near the murder scene to come forward. The leather strap was found near to where Lawrence, 18, fell after being beaten and stabbed by a racist gang in Eltham, south-east London in 1993. The bag strap contains the DNA of a female who police wish to identify. Metropolitan police detectives believe it may be significant, but sources with close knowledge of the case say it may not be. The Guardian understands none of the major witnesses has ever said a female was part of the group of up to six people who attacked Lawrence. Two people have been convicted of the murder after forensics showed they were part of the group. Scotland Yard would not say how the bag strap and discovery of a female’s DNA on it may help the murder inquiry, but they hope the publicity of the appeal they are making will lead to new witnesses. Several people in the area on the night of the murder are believed to have not come forward in the decades since the attack. Police say the black, leather bag strap measures 66cm in length and 1.7cm in width. Detectives first identified it as being of potential interest some years ago when they went through stored exhibits in 2007. The strap was discarded on the road beside where Lawrence was attacked in Dickson Road, by its junction with Well Hall Road. It is consistent with coming from a woman’s handbag. None of the six prime suspects are believed to have been carrying a bag when the attack happened, shortly after 10.30pm on 22 April, 1993. One source said: “It could have been there a minute before the attack, a month, a year. It is an opportunity ... to regenerate impetus into the investigation.”
Success in catching the killers would help Scotland Yard ease the reputational damage caused by its racism in the case, which helped the black teenager’s killers escape justice for so long. Incompetence, prejudice among some investigators and possibly even corruption blighted the hunt for Lawrence’s murderers, who were named within hours by locals. DCI Chris Le Pere, the senior investigator in the case, said: “Since January 2016, officers have been carrying out screenings to eliminate witnesses from previous lines of enquiry. So far we have been unable to identify the owner of the bag strap. “While there is no evidence that a woman was at the scene of the attack, I need to establish who this bag belonged to, and why it was at the spot where Stephen was attacked.”
Police have spoken to more than 110 people to try to identify who the bag strap belonged to and asked them for DNA samples. Fifty people volunteered samples, 46 declined, 12 failed to respond to police requests and the rest were eliminated for medical reasons. It took more than 18 years before two of Lawrence’s killers – Gary Dobson and David Norris – were brought to justice. The pair were jailed for life in January 2012 for their role in the attack. The Metropolitan police said they would continue to pursue others involved. Police will use Monday night’s Crimewatch programme on BBC1 to appeal for a man seen wearing a jacket with a distinctive V emblem in an off licence two hours before the murder, and some 100 yards from where Stephen was attacked, to come forward. A man was seen wearing a similar jacket around the time of the attack. Le Pere said: “Detectives continue to pro-actively pursue all lines of enquiry in relation to Stephen’s death. I am hoping that tonight’s Crimewatch reconstruction, and the passing of time, will encourage people to come forward and assist us in determining the full circumstances of his death. “Tomorrow would have been Stephen’s 42nd birthday; as another year passes, the Met will continue to explore all avenues to seek justice for his tragic death.” Three other suspects remain free. Neil and Jamie Acourt and Luke Knight deny involvement in the murder. The 1998 Macpherson inquiry into the police handling of the original murder investigation found evidence of institutional racism within the Met. An independent review, led by Mark Ellison QC, who led the prosecution that resulted in the conviction of Dobson and Norris, was published in March 2014 and prompted the then home secretary Theresa May to appoint a senior judge to lead another public inquiry, this time to examine a wide range of allegations surrounding the conduct of undercover police officers since 1968. The latest inquiry, led by Lord Justice Pitchford, is to hold public hearings into the police’s covert infiltration of hundreds of political groups. This article was amended on 12 September 2016. An earlier version referred to “allegations of police racism” in the case. As stated later in the article, the Macpherson report found there was evidence of institutional racism in the Met police. The reference to allegations was introduced at the editing stage and has been removed."

2016-09-12T15:50:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Hottest September day since 1973 forecast for parts of UK,"It’s that time of year when Britons are used to unpacking their winter wardrobes. But don’t disturb the moths just yet: forecasters say Tuesday could be the warmest September day in more than 40 years. The UK’s Indian summer is set to continue, with the mercury predicted to climb to as high as 31C in south-east England. Even eastern Scotland could continue to enjoy unseasonably warm weather, with temperatures of up to 23C forecast in Aberdeen. However, the change of seasons will be more marked in western parts of the British Isles and Northern Ireland, with a band of cloud and rain stretching across the Irish Sea. And if that cloud cover extends further eastward, it could ruin the chance for a last blast of summer heat for everyone else, too. “If we see prolonged periods of bright skies in west London we could see up to 31C, and the last time those temperatures were recorded in September was back in 1973,” said Graham Madge, a spokesman for the Met Office. But the bad weather lurking to the west made it tough to be exact, Madge added.
The last time temperatures surpassed 30C in September was in 2006, when 30.5C was recorded at Kew Gardens on 11 September. The 31C in 1973 was recorded in Gillingham, Kent. On Tuesday East Anglia and the east Midlands are likely to see temperatures in the high 20s, Birmingham 27C and the central belt of Scotland 24C. Dr Thomas Waite, of the extreme events team at Public Health England, said: “Much of the advice on beating the heat is common sense and for most people there’s nothing to really worry about. But for some people, such as older people, those with underlying health conditions and those with young children, summer heat can bring real health risks. “To keep homes and sleeping areas cool at night, remember to close curtains on windows that face the sun during the day. Once the sun is off windows, open them up to get a breeze, and think about turning off electrical devices all over the home as they can generate unwanted heat too.” Rain over western Scotland could spread to south Wales and south-west England. Looking ahead to Wednesday, Madge forecast temperatures of around 28C in London and Norwich and 25-27C in Leeds."

Thousands of litres of diesel leaked underground for up to two days from a pump at one of the supermarket’s petrol stations, seeping into a tributary that feeds into the river Irwell in east Lancashire, in an area popular with anglers. By the time engineers at the firm’s Haslingden branch managed to shut off the leak, the spilled fuel is thought to have contaminated a stretch of the river as far as the town of Radcliffe near Manchester. At the time of the incident on 2 July 2014, anglers reported dead trout being found along various part of the river. Environment Agency officials later had to be dispatched to the site to give advice to Tesco staff about how to clean up the site without further harming local wildlife. At Burnley crown court on Monday, Tesco pleaded guilty to two charges: one under the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 and the other under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The maximum sentence it faces is unlimited fines and compensation. It now faces a three-day sentencing hearing in January next year during which an expert witness is expected to be called to explain the risk and likelihood of harm from the storage and use of “volatile chemicals’’ at the store. Details of the incident were not opened to the court. Defence counsel Mark Harris said: “The position is that the company has sought to behave quickly and efficiently.” After the case a Tesco spokesman said: “It would not be appropriate to comment on an ongoing inquiry.” But at the time of the incident, the firm insisted there was no immediate danger to the public, despite anglers sharing photos on Facebook of dead fish in Rawtenstall, Rossendale, Ramsbottom and Radcliffe. The river has been the subject of a major clean-up campaign due to years of pollution from former sewage plants, paper mills and other industries. In recent times the river has been slowly improved through fish stocking schemes."
2016-09-12T17:29:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Protest at Sikh temple was attempt by youth group to 'reclaim religion',"A protest at a Sikh temple at which police arrested more than 50 people was part of an attempt by younger members of the community to reclaim the religion in the UK, according to the group that organised it. Shamsher Singh, of the Sikh Youth UK group that organised the protest on Sunday against an interfaith marriage being carried out as a Sikh ceremony, said it was part of an increasingly active youth movement within the community. “More and more young people are becoming interested in the true interpretation of what it means to be Sikh,” said Singh. “The elder generation arrived [in the UK] and fitted their faith round the need to assimilate, survive and to get work. This led to a stripping back of the spiritual nature of what it means to be a Sikh to a series of symbols. “Now younger people want to reclaim Sikhism as a deeply spiritual, peaceful and encompassing religion and this is why we are seeing these protests.” Armed officers detained 55 men on suspicion of aggravated trespass after being called to the temple in Leamington Spa at about 6.45am on Sunday. On Monday police said all but one of the “bladed weapons” seized were ceremonial. The Sikh Federation UK, the largest political group representing Sikhs in the UK, called on the police to apologise for its “disproportionate” response. It said those arrested had walked into the temple, or gurdwara, to protest against an interfaith marriage being carried out as a Sikh religious ceremony. “We stand with those who peacefully protested against the actions of the management committee at Leamington gurdwara,” said a spokesman. “It now materialises the police were told masked men forced their way into the gurdwara carrying a range of bladed items other than kirpans, that are worn at all times by initiated Sikhs, and it may have been suggested they were holding hostages … This was a small group of young protesters who justifiably objected to an interfaith marriage that was to be carried out as a Sikh religious ceremony.” The group were described as “fanatical extremists” by one of the trustees of the temple, who said the wedding between a Sikh bride and Hindu groom had been postponed. Another trustee, Jaswant Virdee, said the intruders were “absolutely wrong” to think that Sikhism prohibited interfaith marriage. “Scripture doesn’t discriminate between anyone,” he said. “The Guru Granth [the Sikh holy book] says every citizen in the world is equal.” Sikh Youth UK said the protest was entirely peaceful and said those involved had no objection to interfaith marriages, but objected rather to a non-Sikh taking part in the specific religious ceremony at the gurdwara. “We welcome newly married people of other faiths with open arms at gurdwaras. They can be married elsewhere and we will celebrate with them and shower them with love and welcome them to our community. But the ceremony itself is reserved for Sikhs.” Shamit Saggar, a professor of politics at the University of Essex and a specialist in British Asian politics, said there was a generational element at work in the Sikh community, with some youth groups becoming increasingly frustrated with the elders. “We are seeing a rise in Sikh essentialism among some of the youth groups. Whether it is about marrying outside the religion or issues of the theological interpretation, there are growing tensions between the generations.” He said the problem was more pronounced in the Midlands than in other Sikh communities across the country. “It is partly explained by education. The more education someone has, the more they are likely to integrate. Conversely, the less educated they are, the greater is the attraction of Sikh essentialism – trying to prove they are more Sikh than others within the community.”"
2016-09-12T19:24:51Z,uk-news,UK news,World's first large-scale tidal energy farm launches in Scotland,"The launch of the world’s first large-scale tidal energy farm in Scotland has been hailed as a significant moment for the renewable energy sector. A turbine for the MeyGen tidal stream project in the Pentland Firth was unveiled outside Inverness in the Scottish Highlands. After the ceremony, attended by Nicola Sturgeon, the turbine, measuring about 15 metres tall (49ft), with blades 16 metres in diameter, and weighing in at almost 200 tonnes, will begin its journey to the project’s site in the waters off the north coast of Scotland between Caithness and Orkney. The turbine will be the first of four to be installed underwater, each with a capacity of 1.5 megawatts (MW), in the initial phase of the project. But the Edinburgh-based developer Atlantis Resources hopes the project which has received £23m in Scottish government funding will eventually have 269 turbines, bringing its capacity to 398MW, which is enough electricity to power 175,000 homes. Maf Smith, the deputy chief executive of the lobby group RenewableUK, said: “New technology like this will be powering our nation for decades to come.” The first minister called on the UK government to end the uncertainty around subsidies for similar schemes, warning that a failure to do so risks causing irreparable damage to the marine power industry. Sturgeon said: “I am incredibly proud of Scotland’s role in leading the way in tackling climate change and investment in marine renewables is a hugely important part of this. “MeyGen is set to invigorate the marine renewables industry in Scotland and provide vital jobs for a skilled workforce, retaining valuable offshore expertise here in Scotland that would otherwise be lost overseas.” Tim Cornelius, the chief executive of Atlantis Resources, said: “Today marks a historic milestone not just for Atlantis and our project partners, but for the entire global tidal power industry. “It gives me enormous pride to have reached this juncture after 10 years of tireless work, preparation and planning by everyone associated with this project. This is the day the tidal power industry announced itself as the most exciting new asset class of renewable, sustainable generation in the UK’s future energy mix. “This is an industry that is creating jobs and Scotland is the undisputed world leader of this high growth sector.” Smith said the MeyGen project is a “major step forward in terms of scale” and provides “a great boost in maintaining Britain’s pole position” in the renewables sector.
“The fact that the first turbine was assembled at what was an oil and gas fabrication yard illustrates the opportunities offered by renewables,” he said. “The official launch of the largest tidal stream energy project in the world marks a significant moment in the commercial development of marine power.” Jenny Hogan, the policy director for the trade body Scottish Renewables, also highlighted the “potential of tidal generation to make a significant contribution to the UK’s growing need for clean electricity, and to deliver further investment and jobs to the UK”. She added: “However, this is still an incredibly young technology, and future development is absolutely dependent on continued support from Holyrood, Westminster and Brussels, who have all played a vitally important part in the growth of the sector to date.” Meanwhile Fabrice Leveque, the climate and energy policy officer at the environmental body WWF Scotland, said: “It’s great that Scotland is now home to the world’s first large-scale tidal stream farm. It comes hot on the heels of Shetland tidal devices exporting power to the National Grid for the first time and the testing of the world’s most powerful tidal turbine off Orkney. “This underlines what we already know, that Scotland has 25% of the EU’s offshore wind and tidal power potential.”"
2016-09-12T20:45:56Z,uk-news,UK news,Getting to grips with London's road traffic congestion,"As the London Assembly transport committee investigates what Sadiq Khan and Transport for London (TfL) can do to reduce rising levels of road traffic congestion in London, bear in mind that the price of gridlock is not only paid in frustration and pollution. A TfL analysis (pdf) of vehicle delays on Greater London’s roads during 2014-15, published in May, estimated the financial cost of congestion by this measure to be an astonishing £5.5bn a year. Let’s wrap some context around that. London’s economic output is reckoned by the Office for National Statistics to be about £364bn a year. The Centre for Economics and Business Research thinktank has put the cost of recent London Underground strikes at £10m each. Others think it’s higher, but even the Federation of Small Businesses’ huge figure of £300m per 24-hour stoppage is dwarfed by the cost of congestion. In other words, congestion is doing major damage to the city’s economy. And the frustration and pollution are adding to that cost because they make London less agreeable to function in. Speaking to the transport committee last week, Grant Davis, chairman of the London Cab Drivers’ Club spoke of more and more his customers getting out of his taxi before reaching their destinations because his cab has simply stopped moving. Demand for the bus service has started to decline after years of increase, coinciding with slower speeds and worse reliability. Construction works, the proliferation of private hire vehicles and delivery vans, the halving of the congestion charge zone and a long-term loss of road space have all contributed to the growth of the problem over the past two years following a long period of general stability during which London has seen a big “modal shift” away from all forms of private transport, principally cars, towards public transport. Transport for London’s most recent annual Travel in London statistics treasure trove records that in 2000 34% of “journey stages” - the components of an excursion from one place to another - were undertaken on public transport compared with 43% by private vehicles. By 2014, the public transport figure had risen to 45% and the private transport figure had fallen to 32%. The pattern for “trips” - entire excursions within London - has followed a similar trend. Just 28% were taken by public transport in 2000 and 47% by private vehicle. But by 2014 both measures were running at 37%. Nearly all other journey stages and trips were done on foot, plus 2% by bicycle (see pages 33-36). Car ownership too has been falling, in marked contrast with the rest of England and Wales. So has the volume of motor vehicle traffic in London as a whole according to both Department for Transport estimates of distances travelled in them and TfL’s own traffic flow data (pages 57-60). And yet, for all this progress, the plague of road congestion is now getting worse. The committee’s investigation continues. It’s call for evidence is here. You can submit your thoughts on the issue via transportcommittee@london.gov.uk until 16 September."
2016-09-12T21:00:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Stephen Lawrence police investigate whether bag strap was used for weapon,"A bag strap found close to where Stephen Lawrence was fatally attacked is similar to a strap found attached to a hammer-head at the home of one of the men convicted of the black teenager’s racist murder, it has been revealed. One line of inquiry is whether the strap could have been used to adapt a weapon to attack Lawrence – who would have turned 42 on Tuesday had he not been murdered – as a similar strap was found in the home of David Norris, who along with Gary Dobson was ultimately convicted of the 1993 murder. It also emerged that the significance of the strap went unnoticed for 21 years. It was incorrectly recorded that the strap was found 80 metres from where Lawrence was attacked. But in 2014, 21 years after Lawrence’s murder in Eltham, south-east London, investigators discovered it had in fact been found just yards away, next to a pool of blood and Lawrence’s bag. Chris Le Pere, the senior investigator in the case, said he did not believe the error was a result of misconduct but rather just an “honest mistake”. The original scene examiner had handwritten the notes, which had been misinterpreted by a person who typed them up. Scotland Yard has established through DNA tests that the main user of the leather strap was a woman and wants to identify the owner, who is considered to be a witness rather than a suspect. But 58 out of 111 women approached by the Metropolitan police have refused to co-operate. The majority of those who have declined to offer DNA samples are family, friends and associates of the original five suspects in the murder. Three other suspects remain free. Neil and Jamie Acourt and Luke Knight deny involvement in the murder. Le Pere said: “Since January 2016, officers have been carrying out screenings to eliminate witnesses from previous lines of inquiry. So far we have been unable to identify the owner of the bag strap. “While there is no evidence that a woman was at the scene of the attack, I need to establish who this bag belonged to, and why it was at the spot where Stephen was attacked.” The Lawrence investigation has been dogged by allegations of corruption. In October last year the National Crime Agency (NCA) said it was investigating alleged police corruption during the original investigation. The inquiry is being managed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). “We’ve established since I took over the investigation in February 2014 it is not where the original investigation thought it was,” Le Pere said. “In my judgment, there’s no misconduct in this, in my judgment it was an honest mistake.” Le Pere did not know to what type of bag the strap belonged, but a handbag or sports bag were two possibilities. He said it did not belong to Lawrence and he believed it was left by one of the suspects at the junction of Dickson Road. It has been swabbed for DNA 70 times since 2002. Partial male profiles were found on the strap but were not “meaningful” enough to pursue. The testing led police to conclude the principle user of the bag strap was a woman. The investigating officer said “people are very frightened and anxious” when Stephen Lawrence is mentioned, so he was not surprised by the number of people who refused to provide DNA. Fifty DNA samples were provided but none of them matched. A further 46 refused to provide DNA and 12 refused to reply to the request. Three were discounted for medical reasons. Le Pere also wants a man who rang Crimewatch and Crimestoppers in 2013, who appeared to have significant information and asked about a reward, to call back. The new appeal featured on BBC Crimewatch on Monday. Lawrence’s father, Neville, sat for a fresh interview for the programme. “One small bit of information can bring it all together,” he said. “I’m begging and asking please come forward and give the information and some closure to this long-running tragedy.” Success in catching the killers would help Scotland Yard ease damage to its reputation caused by police racism which helped the black teenager’s killers escape justice for so long. The 1998 Macpherson inquiry into the police handling of the original murder investigation found evidence of “institutional racism” within the Met. As well as allegations of corruption, there was incompetence and prejudice among some investigators which blighted the hunt for his murderers, who were named within hours by locals. It took more than 18 years for Dobson and Norris to be brought to justice. The pair were jailed for life in January 2012 for their role in the attack. The Metropolitan police said they would continue to pursue others involved. Police will also use Monday night’s Crimewatch to appeal for a man seen wearing a jacket with a distinctive V emblem in an off-licence two hours before the murder, and 100 yards from where Stephen was attacked, to come forward. A man was seen wearing a similar jacket around the time of the attack. An independent review, led by Mark Ellison QC, who led the prosecution that resulted in the conviction of Dobson and Norris, was published in March 2014 and prompted the then home secretary, Theresa May, to appoint a senior judge to lead another public inquiry, this time to examine a wide range of allegations surrounding the conduct of undercover police officers since 1968. The latest inquiry, led by Lord Justice Pitchford, is to hold public hearings into the police’s covert infiltration of hundreds of political groups."

The tor, which at 420 metres (1,378 feet) above sea level is the highest point in Cornwall, lies within a 1,225-acre plot that includes a granite farmhouse and is on the market with a guide price of £2.8m. Actually, the name of the tor is more poetic than it may seem, coming from the Cornish Bronn Wennili, meaning “hill of swallows”. It has two manmade cairns on the summit and offers far reaching views across much of Cornwall. The estate agent, Savills, makes much of the romantic nature of the spot, claiming in its blurb: “The rare and diverse beauty of the area has, through the ages, turned the heads and filled the eyes and minds of warriors, poets, artists and thinkers.” Medieval field patterns and remnants of old settlements are still visible. The northern and eastern sections including Brown Willy tor comprise high downland made up of pasture, heather and rough grazing interspersed with outcrops of granite. There are also pockets of woodland which provide a habitat for woodcock and red, fallow and roe deer. The estate agent also points out that it is within striking distance of both surfing beaches and good schools. Though the farmhouse looks like something out of Poldark, it also has all the mod cons including a wind turbine to generate electricity for the property. Public right of way to the tor will not be affected by the sale, Savills has said."

Prosecutor Thomas Halpin told the court: “The allegation in summary is he was plotting a terrorist attack in the UK.” Syed, who was arrested last week, spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address. He was dressed in prison-issue grey jumper and tracksuit bottoms. District judge Elizabeth Roscoe remanded him in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on Monday. Two other men, aged 19 and 20, were arrested at the same time on suspicion of preparing an act of terrorism and a religiously aggravated offence respectively. They were later released on bail.

The 34-year-old woman was racially abused in a Co-op supermarket before the attacker followed her to her car and kicked her in the torso, knocking her to the floor. The victim lost her unborn child as a result of the assault, which happened on 6 August. She was taken to Milton Keynes general hospital for treatment and has since been discharged. Thames Valley police have released CCTV image of a man the force would like to speak to in connection with the incident, which took place at about 9.40pm on Water Eaton Road, in the Bletchley area of Milton Keynes.
PC Richard Armitage, said: “This racially aggravated assault had absolutely devastating consequences for the victim, who lost her baby as a result of the attack. Our thoughts are with her and her family at this incredibly difficult and sad time. “A thorough investigation is under way and we would like to speak to the man pictured as he may have information which could help with the investigation.” The offender also assaulted a 40–year-old man by hitting him over the head with a bag of ice and a bottle.

The decision by the upper appeal chamber of the Strasbourg court is a surprise following a series of unsuccessful legal challenges by those behind the failed attacks on the UK capital’s underground system on 21 July 2005. By a majority of 15 votes to two, the court’s judges dismissed claims by three of the would-be bombers – Muktar Said Ibrahim, Ramzi Mohammed and Yassin Omar – that they had not received legal assistance or a fair trial.
But in the case of one of their accomplices, Ismail Abdurahman, the judges voted by 11 to six that his convention rights had been breached because of delays in allowing him access to a lawyer. Abdurahman was initially interviewed as a witness before being charged with assisting one of the bombers and of failing to disclose information about the attack. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, later reduced to eight years on appeal. In its judgment, the European court of human rights’ grand chamber said: “The court was not convinced that the [UK] government had demonstrated compelling reasons for restricting his access to legal advice and failing to inform him of his right to remain silent. “It was significant that there was no basis in domestic law for the police to choose not to caution Mr Abdurahman at the point at which he had started to incriminate himself. Indeed, the decision had been contrary to the applicable code of practice. The consequence was that Mr Abdurahman had been misled as to his procedural rights.” His claim for damages was dismissed but he was granted €16,000 towards his legal costs. The ECHR judges recognised, however, that officers at the time had been working to prevent any further suicide bomb attacks. “The police had been operating under enormous pressure and their overriding priority had, quite properly, been investigations and interviews to obtain as a matter of urgency information on any further planned attacks and the identities of those potentially involved in the plot,” the Strasbourg court said. “The possibility of restricting access to legal advice in such exceptional circumstances recognised the unique and highly difficult conditions with which the police in London had been faced in July 2005 … the decision to limit the right to legal advice had been taken by a police officer based on the specific facts of each three applicants’ cases and the decisions had been recorded. The court was therefore satisfied that there were compelling reasons for the temporary restrictions of the first three applicants’ right to legal advice.” The proceedings in relation to the first three defendants – Ibrahim, Mohammed and Omar – had been fair, the judges ruled."
2016-09-13T15:57:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Corbyn ally barred from Unite roles over sexual harassment,"A union ally of Jeremy Corbyn who organised rallies in Liverpool for the Labour leader has been barred from holding office in Unite after an allegation of sexual harassment was upheld against him at an internal disciplinary hearing. Alec McFadden, the president of Merseyside TUC, Unite’s Wallasey branch chair, and one of the key organisers of the campaign of no confidence against the local Labour MP Angela Eagle, will no longer be able to stand for any position in the union. McFadden denies the allegations “in their totality”. The complaint was made internally to the union and there is no criminal investigation. It is understood the woman who made the allegation raised the complaint in October 2015. “I think it is really important that our movement is a safe space for everyone involved and see this [decision to bar McFadden from holding office] as a positive move forward,” the complainant told the Guardian. A spokesman for the union said: “Unite does not tolerate sexual harassment in any form. Unite can confirm that the matter has been dealt with in line with the union’s disciplinary procedures. “We are supporting the victim, and the individual concerned has been removed and barred from holding office in Unite.” McFadden said he was still a member of the union and had agreed to attend an equalities training course. “It is correct that I was subjected to a disciplinary process in relation to charges I firmly denied and continue to reject in their totality,” he said in a statement. “Those proceedings and their outcome were agreed to be and remain confidential but since the false allegation that I have been expelled has been published, I think I am entitled to put the record straight. “There was an agreement that I should attend an equalities training course which I am delighted to do. I have sought details of available courses and am awaiting responses. My membership of Unite was never in doubt and the fact that I remain a member of Unite has been confirmed in recent correspondence with the union.” Corbyn shared a platform with McFadden at a campaign rally organised by the latter in August last year. The Labour leader joked there was a “golden rule” that McFadden chaired every public meeting in Merseyside and the north-west. “From the dock strike onwards, you’re always there, you’re always standing up for justice and for people, and I was proud to be alongside you during the dock strike and the miners’ strike and many, many other things,” Corbyn told McFadden at the rally. A lifelong activist and anti-fascist, McFadden was put under police protection after he was nearly blinded in 2006 during a knife attack by a far-right assailant at his home. McFadden – who stood as a candidate in George Galloway’s Respect party in 2004 and for the leftwing Eurosceptic party called No2EU in 2004 – organised the informal meetings for Wallasey’s Labour party after the branch was suspended amid reports of intimidation and bullying around Eagle’s decision to stand against Corbyn for the Labour leadership. He told the Liverpool Echo he had joined Labour when Corbyn won the leadership election last year. “I have been in a number of different parties, and from time to time when Tony Blair was leader of a Labour party which took us into an illegal war, I didn’t join Labour,” he told the paper earlier this year. “However, when Jeremy Corbyn stood to be leader I joined Labour and I’m very content.”"

Police confirmed they had been called to Sandbrook retail park in Rochdale at around 11.20am on Tuesday following reports that a man was on fire. A spokesperson for North West ambulance service said that on arrival at the scene they found a man with severe burns from the waist down and on his hands. The man, who was conscious and breathing when paramedics arrived, was taken by air ambulance to the specialist burns unit at Wythenshawe hospital. Greater Manchester police said the man remained in a critical condition and inquiries into the incident were ongoing. A spokesperson for Frankie & Benny’s urged anybody with information to contact the police. “We can confirm that an incident occurred outside our premises involving an external member of the public who was not a guest at the restaurant,” they said. “Our team reacted quickly and involved the emergency services. This is now a police matter and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further.” Greater Manchester fire and rescue service said it sent a number of fire engines and officers to the scene, but the fire was out by the time they arrived.Witnesses told the Manchester Evening News that the man had entered the restaurant to get a fire extinguisher to put out the fire on his legs. The site remained cordoned off on Tuesday afternoon."
2016-09-13T17:21:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Religious observance rules at Scottish schools to face judicial review,"A Scottish court has given secularist campaigners approval to challenge strict rules requiring all school pupils to attend religious observance assemblies. Humanist Society Scotland (HSS) has accused Scottish ministers of acting unlawfully by refusing to give pupils aged 16 and above the right to opt out of religious observance, despite recommendations from a UN human rights committee. Its application for a judicial review of the policy was approved on Tuesday by Lord Pentland sitting in the court of session, which hears civil law cases. Sixth-form pupils and their parents in England and Wales already have the right to voluntarily opt out of religious observance, and in June the UN children’s rights committee urged Scottish ministers to follow suit. The society’s legal action is being backed by the Church of Scotland, whose ministers often have close links to state schools. With the exception of state-funded Catholic schools, Scottish schools are notionally non-denominational but in some areas still hold Christmas services in Presbyterian churches and have church ministers visiting schools, at the discretion of headteachers.
The Scottish government said in June it had no plans to allow opting out. HSS said the decision was made despite clear advice that the policy could breach several articles of the European convention on human rights on respect for privacy, freedom of religion and freedom of expression. The society says the laws in Scotland governing religious observance, dating to 1872, have not been updated since 1980 and were then reinforced by government guidance in 2011. Gordon MacRae, the society’s chief executive, said it had been lobbying the Scottish government for several years. “Sadly our efforts to seek progressive reform of this outdated requirement of Scottish education has failed,” he said. “The Scottish government’s policy on religious observance is a mess, a classic political fudge. Our young people deserve better.” The Rev Dr Richard Frazer, convenor of the Church of Scotland’s church and society council, said it supported calls by HSS for religious observance at school assemblies to be replaced by a non-religious time for reflection. “Such moments do not seek to indoctrinate or give preference to one faith tradition but instead enable shared reflection and a deepening of our understanding of the rich range of spiritual and secular traditions held within our society,” he said. A Scottish government spokeswoman said parents were already legally entitled to withdraw children from religious observance, but said allowing pupils to do so was based on discretion at school level. “Religious observance should be sensitive to individual beliefs, whether these come from a faith or non-faith perspective,” she said. “The flexible approach to learning and teaching afforded by curriculum for excellence in Scotland encourages schools to discuss options with both parents and their children. This could also include allowing pupils to withdraw from religious observance if they wish.”"
2016-09-13T18:44:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Taxi driver accused of Becky Godden murder offered to 'clear up' case,"A taxi driver who was being interviewed by police over the murder of a young woman told detectives he would “resolve the matter” if he was not pursued for other crimes, a court has heard. Christopher Halliwell appeared to accept that if he was found guilty of killing Becky Godden he would be given a full life term. But he told police: “I don’t want to keep coming back every couple of years on different charges,” adding: “If I can clear this up in the next few hours, will everything else be forgotten?” Footage of Halliwell being interviewed at Worcester police station has been released after it was shown to the jury hearing his trial at Bristol crown court. Halliwell, 52, from Swindon, is alleged to have strangled Godden, a sex worker who disappeared aged 20 in 2003, and buried her in Oxo Bottom field in Eastleach, Gloucestershire. He is serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 25 years after admitting stabbing and strangling officer worker Sian O’Callaghan, 22, in 2011. The jury has been told that Halliwell initially confessed to strangling Godden and led police to the spot where her remains were found. Halliwell has since pleaded not guilty to murder. Police arrested Halliwell on suspicion of Godden’s murder on 18 February last year. The jury heard that Halliwell underwent three interviews at Worcester police station and appeared to offer police a deal to resolve the case. He told officers: “If I get charged with this and found guilty, I’ll get a natural [a whole life order]. That’s it. Curtains, over. “I mean, I’m not being funny. I’m 50 now, but 25 years to go so chances are not looking good as it is.” Halliwell looks relaxed in the video and seems to smile. He said: “If I wrap this up in the next few hours, any other charges against me that will be brought, that’s bits of past. I think you probably know about various things in the past, there’s car thefts, break-ins, bits and pieces, some more serious.” Halliwell added: “I don’t want to keep coming back every couple of years on different charges … If I can clear this up in the next few hours, will everything else be forgotten? He said: “I can resolve the matter but I don’t want you coming back every couple of years, every five years, every 10 years, whatever, with this, with this ... If it goes to court and I’m found guilty, that’s it, they’re locking me up and throwing away the key. I’m under no illusion, I’m not stupid.” The court was told that Halliwell called his daughter from prison at 10.23am on 22 February and spoke to her about the interviews. “I was taken out of here and rearrested for Becky,” Halliwell said in the phone call, which was recorded. “I spoke to Detective Superintendent Sean Memory, the bloke in charge of the case. “I said ‘I will help you if I can but I want something in return’. They gave me a bit of paper that was way, way, way short of what I asked for but I have it in writing that the police don’t want me for anything else. “I got it off my chest. As far as I am concerned, I have offered them the goose that lays the golden egg and they have let it fly away.” The trial continues."
2016-09-13T18:59:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Men sentenced over illegal supply of migrant workers in East Anglia,"Two brothers who acted as illegal gangmasters in Wisbech have been given two-year prison sentences suspended for two years at Cambridge crown court. Stanislovas Dambrauskas, 38, and Andrius Dambrauskas, 34, pleaded guilty to operating as gangmasters to the food and agriculture sector without a licence. The pair, originally from Lithuania, were supplying up to 100 eastern European migrant workers at a time to other leading labour agencies, which in turn sent them to work on big farms and factories across East Anglia. Their main source of profit was rent collected from the workers for overcrowded accommodation they illegally sublet in Wisbech, often placing nine workers in three-bedroomed houses. In some cases workers’ wages were paid direct into the brothers’ bank accounts and they deducted rent and fees for transport to work from them before passing what was left on to workers. Sentencing, Judge Gareth Hawkesworth told the pair: “You ran a racket for 30 months [which] exploited your own countrymen … by stuffing them into properties.” He said the two men had abused the hopes of other migrants travelling from Lithuania by promising pay far in excess of what they could expect to earn in the UK. The prosecution follows on from the conviction earlier this year of a Latvian organised crime group based in Wisbech that was found to be exploiting eastern European workers in another illegal gangmaster operation providing workers to the supply chains of major supermarkets. The group was also laundering money and arranging sham marriages between Asians and eastern Europeans to facilitate illegal immigration. The prosecution in the Dambrauskas brothers’ case on Tuesday told the court that workers were recruited via agents in Lithuania who charged fees for work, which is illegal in the UK. Those signing up were warned not to tell anyone what they were doing or they would be fined, the court heard. When they arrived in London, in some cases 40 at a time, they were collected and taken by minibus to Wisbech where they were placed in cramped houses and charged £60 a week to share a room. They were sent to work, often at only a few hours’ notice in potato and carrot packing factories, and in the fields harvesting flowers, cabbages and sugar beet. Pay was often below the national minimum wage and was given without mandatory payslips, the court heard. Workers were charged for transport even if there was no work for them when they reached the farms or factories. The Dambrauskas brothers provided vehicles to transport them to the sites but did not have public service licences to do so. They came to police notice in part as a result of complaints from neighbours. Hawkesworth said he was taking into account the fact that requests for workers were initiated by other licensed agencies, and that although some workers said they had been threatened there had been no violence or money laundering. The language barrier also made it harder for the Dambrauskas brothers to understand the legal arguments, he said. Andrius Dambrauskas was of previous good character. Stanislavos Dambrauskas had two previous UK convictions for shoplifting and handling stolen goods and five prison sentences from Lithuania relating to theft and possession of an offensive weapon."
2016-09-13T23:01:01Z,uk-news,UK news,"Urgent clarity needed on HS2 costs and timescale, MPs warn","Urgent clarity is needed over the future of the £55bn HS2 high-speed rail project, MPs have warned, criticising the “significant uncertainty” faced by local communities as the government deliberates. MPs on the influential public accounts committee have said the government must set out “a realistic timetable for delivering HS2” and that the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, should make clear by the autumn if the first stage of the route, from London to the West Midlands, will be complete by 2026. In June, the National Audit Office said HS2’s first phase could potentially be delayed by up to a year. The committee said it was concerned that the timetable for opening phase one by 2026 was overly ambitious and cost estimates for phase two exceeded available funding by £7bn. After a Cabinet Office-led review of the estimated costs of phase two last year, the Department for Transport (DfT) and HS2 Ltd identified up to £9bn of potential savings, but the MPs said in the report published on Wednesday that they were not confident this could be achieved without sacrificing or adversely affecting many of the benefits of the project. The transport department is expected to make a decision by the autumn on phase two of the project, which extends a branch of the network to Crewe and another to Manchester and Leeds. However, the committee’s report also warned that cost estimates for the second phase were “still volatile and must be firmed up urgently”. The committee’s chair, Meg Hillier, said: “Parliament and the public are still in the dark about crucial details – not least when the railway will open, how much it is expected to cost and precisely where it will go. “The public must be confident the grand vision for HS2 does not blind the government to the finer points, which have implications for many people’s lives now and in the decades to come.” The report comes days after Simon Kirby, the boss of HS2 Ltd, quit his role to become chief operating officer of Rolls-Royce, which the MPs said “adds to the uncertainty enveloping a project on which strong and stable leadership is vital”. One key detail that needed clarification was the HS2 station in South Yorkshire, originally planned for the out-of-town Meadowhall shopping centre but which HS2 Ltd has recommended be moved to Sheffield city centre. The committee said the uncertainty was having a knock-on effect on the rest of the transport system, including on proposed transport investment in the rest of the north of England. “Greater assurance about sources of funding and finance for regeneration and growth is required to ensure that the promised regional benefits from High Speed 2 materialise,” it said. A DfT spokesperson said: “The government is fully committed to HS2 and the project is on time and on budget. We are keeping a tough grip on costs, and pressing ahead with plans for phase two – with further details due to be announced this autumn. “Improving regional infrastructure is vital in supporting regional growth and building an economy that works for everyone. HS2 is a key part of this, and will be the backbone of our national rail network.”"
2016-09-13T23:01:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Will belonging to Scot who died in Auschwitz found in church archives,"The handwritten will of a Scottish woman who died in Auschwitz after refusing to abandon Jewish girls in her care at a missionary school in Budapest has been discovered in church archives. Jane Haining is the only Scot named as “righteous among the nations” – non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews from the Nazis – by Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial.
Her will, which bequeaths “money left after meeting funeral expenses” along with her wireless, typewriter, fur coat and watches, was found in a box in the archives of the Church of Scotland’s World Mission Council in Edinburgh. The box also held about 70 photographs of Haining with her young charges, and documents revealing efforts to secure her release from the Nazi death camp. The material is to be handed over to the National Library of Scotland. The Rev Ian Alexander, secretary of the World Mission Council, said Haining’s story was “one of heroism and personal sacrifice”. The discovery of a will “gives a sense she was fully aware of the risks she was taking”, he said. “Scottish missionaries were advised to return home from Europe during the dark days of the second world war, but Jane declined and wrote: ‘If these children need me in days of sunshine, how much more do they need me in days of darkness?’” She “embodies so much of the internationalist spirit”, he added. Haining moved to Budapest in the early 1930s to work as a matron in a church-run school after a sheltered childhood on a farm and 10 years working as a secretary. Many of the 315 pupils at the school were girls from the city’s growing Jewish population. In 1939, when war broke out, Haining was on holiday in Cornwall but immediately returned to Budapest and her charges. A year later she was ordered by the church to return to Scotland, but refused. A Hungarian bishop, László Ravasz, later reported that “her superiors three times ordered her home, but she always replied that the Hungarian people were so true-hearted, honourable and chivalrous that among them not a hair on her head would be touched. ‘I shall continue to do my duty,’ she declared, ‘and stick to my post.’”
When Nazi troops entered Budapest in March 1944, she again rejected entreaties to leave, instead sewing yellow stars on to the clothes of Jewish girls on Gestapo orders. Within weeks, the Gestapo arrested her on suspicion of spying, giving her 15 minutes to gather her belongings. Haining was charged with eight offences, including listening to news broadcasts on the BBC. By May she was in Auschwitz, working in the labour camps, and by August she was dead. Her British citizenship meant the Nazis sent a death certificate to the Church of Scotland; it said Haining had died of “cachexia following intestinal catarrh”. More than a million people died in the Auschwitz concentration camps before they were liberated by Russian troops in January 1945.
As well as being honoured by Yad Vashem in 1997, after a 10-year investigation, Haining was posthumously awarded a Hero of the Holocaust medal by the UK government in 2010. Two glass windows bear tribute to her “service and sacrifice” at her former church in Queen’s Park, Glasgow. A street in Budapest is named after her. Rev Susan Brown of the World Mission Council said: “The previously unseen documents and photographs have, for me, evoked fresh feelings of awe about this already tremendously moving, inspiring and important story. To hear of Jane’s determination to continue to care for ‘her’ girls, even when she knew it put her own life at risk, is truly humbling.”"
2016-09-13T23:06:11Z,uk-news,UK news,GCHQ cyber boss plans British firewall to block hackers,"The UK’s surveillance agency GCHQ is planning to create a British firewall offering protection against malicious hackers. The proposal was made at a conference in Washington by the director general of cyber at GCHQ, Ciaran Martin, who is also head of the National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ. Asking GCHQ for protection carries risks, given its ability to hack into the private details of companies, but some companies and customers might be tempted by the trade-off in terms of proposed security against hackers. Its prime aim is to protect government sites and industries regarded as central to national security but it is offering to widen the scope to include major private companies. Martin’s proposal is only in its infancy. It would raise privacy concerns from customers about major companies opting to place themselves within the GCHQ corral. Martin told the Billington cybersecurity conference that the number of cyber security incidents – about 200 a month are detected – was growing and was double the level a year ago. Martin said the UK was vulnerable and a “flagship project” was being explored to protect against customers coming into contact with known malware and bad addresses. It was his first public comments as head of the National Cyber Security Centre, which formally opens next month."

But working in a winter wonderland means Santa and some of his helpers are having to sign up to zero-hours contracts. An advert for elves at Center Parcs Whinfell Forest site in Cumbria offers the opportunity to be to be one of Santa’s elves, greeting guests and serving customers from early November until Christmas Eve, with a small number on a zero-hours basis. Santa Claus is also being employed on a casual basis, at a rate of £10.53 an hour. “Becoming one of Santa’s elves is a truly magical task,” the advert reads. “It’s not just about helping children feel at ease with the wonderful experience of seeing Santa, it’s about keeping the spirit of Christmas alive which means goodwill, fantastic customer service and making people smile – whatever their query or request.” The advert makes it clear there are no guaranteed hours. “This is a zero-hour contract starting 2 November 2016 to 24 December 2016. You will be contracted to work on an as-and-when basis to cover busy periods.” Asked about its use of zero-hours contracts generally, the holiday firm said it used them to supplement full- or part-time contracted employees during its busiest periods. A Center Parcs spokesman said: “There are a very small number of zero hours contracts offered for these positions out of the overall Christmas recruitment across Center Parcs as a whole (8 positions out of a total of 110). “These roles were advertised alongside fixed term contracts and offer greater flexibility to suit individual’s circumstances. In fact, employees often return to work for us on this basis, in this type of role, at this time of year. Obviously due to the seasonal nature of the roles, they are offered on a fixed term basis.”"
2016-09-14T08:54:43Z,uk-news,UK news,"Rotherham girl's family fled UK after abuse by Asian men, court told","The family of a “lovely” 13-year-old girl who claims to have been groomed for sex by Asian men in Rotherham were so afraid of her alleged abusers that they moved to Spain after their complaints to the police, social services, their MP and the home secretary went unresolved, a court has heard. The girl, who cannot be named, is the main complainant in the trial of eight men from the South Yorkshire town who allegedly groomed and sexually exploited three underage girls between 1999 and 2003. Now 27 and a campaigner against child sexual exploitation, she claims her abusers threatened to “gang rape” her mother if she did not submit to their sexual abuse, which took place largely in an alley behind a branch of Boots in Rotherham town centre, in a local park and in bushes near a museum, Sheffield crown court heard on Tuesday. She claims that Sageer Hussain, 30, first raped her behind Boots when she was 13 and later called her a “white slag” when she tried and failed to stop him. She told police that the first and second time he raped her, between 1 January and 4 April 2003, he told her to scream so that his friends, waiting nearby, would know to come and watch. She claims that on another occasion she was driven to Rotherham’s Clifton Park by Hussain’s cousin, Mohammed Whied, who sat on the car bonnet watching while Hussain raped her inside. On a further occasion, Hussain allegedly raped her in bushes near the museum, calling her “a big baby” when she protested, then flicking cigarette ash in her hair, Michelle Colborne QC, prosecuting, told the jury. A few days later he punched her in the face and threatened her with a crowbar and set light to an aerosol in her face, the barrister said. The girl told her mother what had happened and gave a statement to police alleging that various men had raped her, including Hussain. A medical examination in April 2013 recorded bruises to her thighs and bottom, but she quickly withdrew the allegations and no charges were brought. Ten years later she reported the abuse to police again, saying she had been threatened by the men at the time. “For example, they threatened they would gang rape her mother. They would drive around the estate where she lived to make sure they were serious,” Colborne told the jury. The girl’s parents sought help from social services and the police, writing to their MP and the then home secretary, David Blunkett, who was a Sheffield MP at the time. They had a panic alarm installed in their house and eventually moved to Spain to get away, the court heard. Her mother later told police how she watched her child turn from “a loving, lovely girl to one she described as ‘horrible’ and she was powerless to control”, Colborne told the jury. She asked: “What causes a perfectly lovely child to go from that state to a life of deceit and fear?” Hussain had subtly groomed the girl with cigarettes, alcohol and cannabis, she said. The complainant now campaigned against child sexual exploitation, the jury was told. She ha has also written a book about her experiences, given evidence to the home affairs select committee and appeared in a Channel 4 programme called Britain’s Sex Gangs. Hussain’s older brother, Basharat Hussain, 40, is also accused of repeatedly sexually assaulting the girl during the same period. Another of their cousins, Asif Ali, is accused of raping her too, along with friends Ishtiaq Khaliq, now 33, Waleed Ali, 34, and Masoued Malik, 32. Malik is also accused of false imprisonment and conspiring to indecently assault her when she was 14, along with Naeem Rafiq, 33, in a house in Woodside Walk in Rotherham. Two further complainants came forward earlier this year to accuse Khaliq of indecently assault on various occasions between August 1999 and December 2001. The men deny all the charges against them. The case continues."
2016-09-14T11:19:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Man arrested over assault on pregnant woman who lost baby,"Police hunting an alleged racist attacker whose assault on a pregnant woman led to the death of her unborn child have arrested a man. Thames Valley police said the arrest was made on Wednesday. A 37-year-old man from Milton Keynes was detained on suspicion of racially aggravated assault and remains in custody. Police said the 34-year-old woman was racially abused in a Co-op supermarket in Milton Keynes before being followed to her car by the attacker. She was kicked in the torso, knocking her to the ground. Police said the woman lost her unborn child as a result of the assault, which happened at about 9.40pm on 6 August. The incident has been logged as a racially and religiously aggravated crime. Police declined to give the ethnicity or religion of the victim. A 40-year-old man was also attacked during the incident. He was hit over the head with a bag of ice and a bottle and needed hospital treatment. Police had released a CCTV image of a man they wanted to speak to in connection with the incident on Water Eaton Road, in the Bletchley area of Milton Keynes. Launching the appeal on Tuesday, PC Richard Armitage said: “This racially aggravated assault had absolutely devastating consequences for the victim, who lost her baby as a result of the attack. Our thoughts are with her and her family at this incredibly difficult and sad time.” Nada Piradeepan, who lives opposite the scene of the attack, said there had been trouble with racism in the area in the past. When a mosque opened on the site of a former pub several years ago, it was daubed with graffiti and a demonstration had taken place, he said. Weeks ago, Piradeepan had found a man trying to get into his garden early in the morning. “We spotted them and they started arguing with us and at one point they said, ‘This is English country, go back to your country,’” he said. The Muslim Council of Britain condemned the attack. Harun Khan, its secretary general, said: “As a father of three young daughters, I am completely shocked and saddened to hear of such a horrific and cowardly attack on a vulnerable woman in our society today. My thoughts and prayers are with both the victims, especially for the lady, who has now lost a child as a result of hatred and xenophobia. “We need strong action now from the authorities to show that they are taking all hate crimes seriously, including Islamophobia, which findings show has increased in recent times, especially post-Brexit.”"
2016-09-14T11:49:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Four teenagers arrested over attack on Polish man in Leeds,"Four teenage boys have been arrested following an allegedly racist attack on a Polish man in Leeds. The boys – a 14-year-old, a 15-year-old and two 16-year-olds – were arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated grievous bodily harm and violent disorder, West Yorkshire police said. They will be questioned over an attack on a 28-year-old Polish man who was kicked and punched by a gang in Armley on Friday night. The victim, who has not been named, and his friend were said to have been confronted by a group of up to 20 teenagers. More suspects are being sought over the attack, which is being treated as racially aggravated due to comments made towards the victim. Police said the man received a cut to his head that required stitches and had to be treated in hospital. Ch Supt Paul Money, Leeds district commander, said on Wednesday: “We have been carrying out extensive enquiries into this incident since it was reported and these arrests illustrate how that investigation is progressing. We have received a significant response from the public and we are grateful to everyone who has contacted us with information. “Given the understandable concern that this incident has caused among people in Leeds, particularly the local Polish community, and the wider focus there has been on it, we have prioritised the investigation to ensure that we are doing everything we can to bring our enquiries to a successful conclusion. “At the same time we will be maintaining increased patrols in the area where this incident occurred as part of our ongoing efforts to reassure the community.” In a statement published on social media last week, the Polish embassy said it had been saddened by the attack, which “has been the most serious of over 10 xenophobic incidents experienced by Poles in the north of England” in recent months. “The consular section of the Polish embassy in London offered assistance in [a] further 17 cases in the south and the midlands,” it said. Money said he met Łukasz Lutostański, the Polish consul general, to update him on the investigation and the force’s attempts to reassure the Polish community in Leeds. He added: “We will be maintaining that dialogue as the investigation continues, and we will also be working jointly to develop the Polish community’s awareness of our hate-incident reporting systems so that we can ensure we have as full a picture as possible and can respond accordingly to any issues raised. “I want to reiterate that hate crime and hate incidents are completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in any form. The police work closely in partnership with the council and other agencies to tackle hate crime, and we encourage anyone who has been a victim to report those incidents.”"
2016-09-14T12:27:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Man accused of Becky Godden murder blames suspected drug dealers,"A taxi driver accused of murdering a young woman and burying her body in a field has blamed the killing on two suspected drug dealers he says he used to ferry around. Christopher Halliwell, who denies killing sex worker Becky Godden, said he had driven the two men to the field in Gloucestershire after they told him they needed to “get rid of something”. He said he did not ask any questions and assumed the men, whom he did not name, were hiding drugs, money or weapons. Halliwell, 52, is serving life for the murder of Sian O’Callaghan, 22, who went missing from a nightclub in Swindon in 2011. After he was arrested over O’Callaghan’s disappearance, he accompanied police to a field in Eastleach, Gloucestershire, and allegedly guided them to the spot where the remains of Godden, who vanished aged 20 in 2003, were found. At the start of his defence at Bristol crown court, Halliwell, who is representing himself, said he had no need to lie as he was already in prison and had no real chance of being freed. He said: “I want to start by saying I am telling the truth. I have no reason to lie ... I have no real prospect of getting out and I deserve every day anyway. What happened between me and Sian – my actions were brutal. What I put Sian’s family through was inhuman. “Whether I get out or not is irrelevant; whether you the jury find me guilty or not guilty doesn’t matter. I come here to tell the truth. I already said ... you won’t like what you are going to hear.” Halliwell said that over three years, from 2001, he would drive two men around Swindon and be paid from a wad of cash kept in a holdall. He was often given £100 for a £25 fare, he claimed.
“I never asked any questions – I didn’t want to know.” Halliwell said. “I am a taxi driver and I was turning a blind eye. That’s their business. It may be morally wrong but it wasn’t my place to judge someone.” Halliwell said he got a pay-as-you-go mobile phone so the two men were able to contact him directly to arrange pick-ups. “It was apparent what they were actually doing, delivering large amounts of class A drugs. I commented on the amounts they were paying me and they said it was chicken feed.” The defendant said that in March 2003 he received a phone call from the men. “They said something has gone wrong and they needed to get rid of something,” he told the court. “I was under the impression it was temporary and they said as much and in a few weeks they would recover whatever they would get rid of and hiding. I took them to Eastleach. “When I picked them up, one of them opened the boot and they put a large sports bag in the boot. I didn’t ask any questions. I assumed it was either drugs, money, possibly weapons.” The trial continues."
2016-09-14T12:38:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Black Lives Matter activists admit trespass after City airport protest,"Nine environmental activists who staged a protest at London City airport under the Black Lives Matter banner have walked free from court after pleading guilty to trespass charges. The group, all but one of whom are white, have faced accusations of “cultural appropriation” and hijacking the Black Lives Matter movement to further their interests in climate change activism. Their stunt disrupted the journeys of an estimated 9,000 passengers. The protesters, who include a cousin of the actor Ralph Fiennes, an organic farmer and an Oxford University graduate, were sentenced at Westminster magistrates court to conditional discharges ranging from 18 months to three years, after admitting aggravated trespass. Sentencing the group, the district judge Elizabeth Roscoe told the defendants that she found it “rather hard” to make the link between the Black Lives Matter movement and climate change.
“I am not sure how that links to City airport and climate change,” she said. “I do not underestimate the sincerity of your beliefs.” The defendants included: William Pettifer, 27, of Radford, Somerset; Esme Waldron, 23, from Brighton; Natalie Fiennes, 25, of Wandsworth, south-west London; Deborah Grayson, 31, from Slough, Berkshire; Richard Collett-White, 23, of Kempston, Bedfordshire; and Ben Tippett, 24, also from Wandsworth. Sama Bakr, 27, Alex Etchart, 26, and Sam Lund-Harket, 32, who all live on a houseboat called “Northern Soul”, currently moored in Roydon, Essex, appeared with them. Philip McGhee, prosecuting, told the court that the group donned wetsuits and sped across the Royal Albert dock in motorised inflatable rafts to gain access to the airport. The protesters then put up a tripod made of three lengths of bamboo. Pettifer secured himself to the top of the tripod, while the remaining eight activists secured themselves to its base and each other. Police arrived to hear the group chanting “Black lives matter” and slogans about climate change, McGhee said. The defence solicitors, Adeela Khan and Mike Schwarz, provided further details of the environmental activism of the defendants in mitigation. Bakr, who is of mixed heritage, took an environmental studies course and campaigned with Time to Cycle, an environmental group. Collett-White, an Oxford graduate, had an interest in climate change and anti-aviation campaigns.
Etchart, who describes himself as a “community musician”, has taken part in Occupy London protests and anti-fracking campaigns.

After the City airport protest, the anti-racism campaigner Stafford Scott and Lee Jasper, a former equality adviser to Ken Livingstone, were publicly critical of the protest, accusing white leftwing activists of hijacking the Black Lives Matter banner. “It’s cultural appropriation.

2016-09-14T12:39:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Washing-line snobbery: why can’t I hang my knickers out to dry?,"In the US, they would call them “freedom panties”, which sounds terrible. In the tiny Devon village of Stokeinteignhead, they are known as Rozamund Perrin’s controversial smalls. The retired funeral director is at odds with her prudish neighbours in the latest skirmish in a global war on washing lines. “It is totally inappropiate [sic] for this type of garment to be displayed opposite the village primary school,” reads an anonymous note posted through Perrin’s letterbox with the offending knickers. “There are member [sic] of this community that would welcome a halting of this.” Since the note went viral on Facebook, courtesy of Perrin’s daughter, the 65-year-old has received dozens of pairs of knickers and the suggestion to turn them into protest bunting. If she makes enough, perhaps she could supply them to fellow clothesline champions hung out to dry by zealous landlords and Niybys (not in your backyard). In 2014, Norwich city council told Margaret Jowsey that the line outside her flat was a hanging offence and ordered its removal. Marie Corry suffered a similar fate in Reading, where the council ruled that her line, which had been in place for five years, was a fire risk under the terms of her tenancy agreement. Developers often now include clothes-line clauses in contracts. At a luxury complex in Beverley, East Yorkshire, residents are asked “to refrain from hanging washing in a manner that may detract from the visual enjoyment of the building or otherwise cause offence to fellow residents”. The right-to-dry fight is tougher in the US, where watt-guzzling tumble dryers are ubiquitous and a laundry uprising has inspired several states to pass laws banning the banning of clothes lines. For years, the struggle was led by the environmental group Project Laundry List. It’s worse for renters restricted not only by the absence of outside space, but also tenancy agreements that forbid indoor drying lest it cause damp. Mrs Perrin at least has the freedom to hang inside, but is unlikely to waver. “She’s not a shrinking violet and will stand up for herself,” her daughter says, adding of the neighbour with her knickers in a twist: “Someone should just get a life.”"
2016-09-14T13:11:49Z,uk-news,UK news,GCHQ's 'Great British Firewall' raises serious concern – privacy groups,"Privacy groups have expressed serious concern at the prospect of a “Great British Firewall” proposed by the surveillance agency GCHQ to protect major British companies against malicious hackers. They said they were worried that it could be used to deny freedom of speech, with the government potentially able to designate sites they disapprove of as “malware”. There is also concern about the prospect of handing over such power to GCHQ, given its track record of intrusion working in tandem with the US National Security Agency (NSA). Thomas Falchetta, a legal officer for Privacy International, said: “Given the broad scope of GCHQ’s hacking operations both domestically and abroad, this seems like the fox protecting the chicken.” GCHQ insisted that privacy concerns would be “hardwired” into the project and companies would have a choice about whether to participate or not. GCHQ has long argued that, in spite of all the revelations over the last three years about its hacking operations and the scale of its surveillance, it is also responsible for trying to battle hostile hackers. It says that its expertise make it best placed to help UK companies. Michael Harris, an adviser to Don’t Spy On US, an umbrella group for privacy organisations, said: “It is outrageous. It is what China is up to. This is taking place in a context in which the government is clamping down on freedom of expression and extending surveillance.”
He said that if, for instance, there was a preacher the government did not like, it could block them. It would also put the UK on a collision course with the European court of human rights. “We are seeing things floated in speeches without being thought through or without considering the long-term consequences,” he said. China’s Great Firewall is used for extensive censorship of sites it judges to be hostile. GCHQ’s plan was set out by Ciaran Martin, the head of its national cybersecurity centre, at a conference in Washington on Tuesday. Also at the conference was Admiral Michael Rogers, the NSA’s director and head of cybersecurity. Martin did not use the phrase Great British Firewall in his speech, but it was dubbed as such in parts of the UK media. What Martin is ostensibly proposing, though he stresses it is still in its infancy, is closer to a Great British Spam Filter. He said GCHQ was exploring a substantial increase in filtering. “What better way of providing automated defences at scale than by major private providers effectively blocking their customers from coming into contact with known malware and bad addresses,” he said. “It’s crucial that all of these economy-wide initiatives are private-sector led. The government does not own or operate the internet.” He said consumers had a choice. The filtering “would have to be opt-out based. So addressing privacy concerns and citizen choice is hardwired into our programme”. Asking GCHQ for protection carries risks, given its ability to hack into the private details of companies, but some firms and customers might be tempted by the trade-off in terms of proposed security against hackers. GCHQ’s prime aim is to protect government sites and industries regarded as central to national security, but it is offering to widen the scope to include major private companies. Martin told the Billington conference that the number of cybersecurity incidents detected was growing. It currently stood at about 200 a month, he said, twice as many as a year ago. He was making his first public comments as head of the national cybersecurity centre, which formally opens next month."
2016-09-14T13:37:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Man stabbed to death as he tried to stop gang stealing moped,"A 27-year-old man has died after being stabbed during a confrontation with a group of men who were trying to steal his moped. Ricky Hayden, a council worker who also worked as a security guard, was attacked, along with his father, Paul, 46, outside their house in Chadwell Heath, east London, shortly before 1.30am on Tuesday. He died from his wounds in hospital on Wednesday morning. His father, who was also stabbed, remains in hospital but his injuries are not life-threatening, Scotland Yard said. The pair had rushed outside after being woken by a noise and saw up to four men attempting to steal the moped. The group eventually fled without the vehicle. Police are questioning two men who were arrested on suspicion of murder on Wednesday. Neighbour Bella Tasci, 34, said there were cries of “get off him” as Hayden and his father confronted the men, who she saw make their getaway on two motorbikes. Tasci said they were a “lovely” family and that Hayden had built the bike with his younger brother Perry. She said the thieves also slashed the family dog in the attack.
Hayden was a member of the highways maintenance team at Havering council and also worked as a security guard, including at the wedding of footballer Peter Crouch and model Abbey Clancy. He also worked with his father on the security team for ITV’s This Morning and at bars in nightclubs in London. Paul Clarke, who works in ITV’s security team, told the Evening Standard: “I’ve worked with Paul for many years and with Ricky since he started in the security industry. “He was a pleasure to work with and very well respected by the This Morning team. He was also a good laugh and will be sadly missed by many people at ITV.” Tracy Aubrey, 50, who has known Hayden since he was young, described him as “the nicest boy you could ever meet, he was always joking and absolutely lovely”. She said her daughter went to school with him and was “in pieces” at the news. “Nobody would have a bad word to say about him,” she said. Havering council’s chief executive, Andrew Blake-Herbert, said everyone at the local authority was “devastated by the news of this horrendous, senseless crime. “Our condolences and thoughts are with Ricky’s family and friends, our prayers are also with his father who remains in hospital. “Ricky was a well liked team member and of course we will be offering support to his friends and colleagues in the council who will be feeling this loss very deeply.” The Metropolitan police appealed for any witnesses to contact them. DCI Andrew Packer said: “Gibbfield Close is a residential street and while there would not have been many people out and about at the time of this attack, it was a warm night and people would have had their windows open. “I am appealing to anyone who heard, or subsequently saw, anything suspicious to come forward and speak to police.”"
2016-09-14T16:32:17Z,uk-news,UK news,"Ex-police officer abused two boys at offenders' centre, court told","A retired police superintendent sexually abused two boys in the 1980s when he ran an attendance centre for young offenders, a jury has been told. Gordon Anglesea, 78, a former officer with North Wales police, abused the boys when they were 14 or 15, the court heard. The first alleged victim claims that he was assaulted by Anglesea in the showers and a changing room of the centre in Wrexham, north Wales. Jurors were told that the second claims that he was handed around “like a handbag” by a convicted paedophile called John Allen, who owned a Wrexham children’s home. Anglesea, from Colwyn Bay, north Wales, denies four sexual assaults between 1982 and 1987. His defence will be that the allegations are lies and inventions. Eleanor Laws QC, prosecuting, told Mold crown court: “Gordon Anglesea was in a position to abuse these two men when they were teenagers as a result of his position he held within the police force at the time.”Attendance centres were set up by the Home Office to provide an alternative to custody for young people and included physical training and woodwork. The Wrexham centre opened on Saturday afternoons. One of the complainants, who described the centre as a “naughty boy school” and had been sent there for “petty” crimes, made a complaint against Anglesea years later after receiving counselling. He said his attacker was a “big fella” and added: “You did what you were told because he was the boss ... He used to hit everyone around the head. He was a powerful person. He’s wrecked my life.” The court was told that Anglesea would make the youngsters do naked sit-ups and squat thrusts, then loiter around the showers at the attendance centre “with a smirk on his face”. The second complainant lived at a children’s home in Wrexham run by Allen. He claims that he was taken to various addresses and passed around to men including Anglesea. Laws said the second alleged victim had given an account of how, on one occasion, Allen took him to a house where he was abused by a male that he later named as Anglesea. The alleged victim claimed that Anglesea had said he had the power to send the boy away and ensure he would “never see his family again,” the court was told. Anglesea is said to have called him scum. The teenager did not complain because he was frightened of the man’s power and connections. Laws said the prosecution would call three other people to give evidence regarding the connection between Anglesea, Allen and another convicted paedophile. When he was arrested in December 2013, Anglesea strenuously denied the allegations and having any connection to sex offenders. “The prosecution say that Gordon Anglesea knew he was safe,” Laws said. “Who would believe them against him, at that time a high ranking police officer? And that of course is his defence now: look at who they are, how can you believe them?” When he was interviewed, Anglesea told police that he used to attend the Bryn Alyn children’s home, which Allen ran, to administer cautions to boys. The court was told that Anglesea started his police career in Cheshire, before being transferred to Wrexham in 1976, where he was promoted to inspector and ran the attendance centre between 1979 and 1987, before retiring as a superintendent in 1991. The trial continues."
2016-09-14T16:35:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Does Chris Grayling really want to give troubled Southern rail to Sadiq Khan?,"The troubled Southern rail service chuffed irritably into City Hall station during Mayor’s Question Time on Wednesday, bringing discord where there has been much harmony. Cross-party agreement on the London Assembly holds that Transport for London should be handed responsibility for the suburban parts of the notoriously tormented routes connecting the capital to Sussex and other Home Counties, but the Conservative group thought Sadiq Khan should get some grief over his overtures to new transport secretary Chris Grayling, plus a bit more besides. Khan has been calling loudly since July for TfL to take immediate control of Southern by sending in a management hit squad to knock things into shape while the Department for Transport sorts out its longer term future. He and AMs agree that that should mean control of the Govia Thameslink company’s London operation being handed to TfL as soon as possible. Khan has written to Grayling to that effect and on Tuesday the assembly’s cross-party transport committee did the same, as part of a general expression of concern about lack of progress on rail devolution. Khan said he thought the government had “missed a trick” in failing to accept his kind offer. What’s the problem here? It isn’t only Khan who thinks it’s Grayling. The new transport secretary has spoken up for “greater devolution to the nations and regions of the UK” in the past, but it’s easy to find luminaries of the London transport firmament who are completely convinced that he doesn’t really want to hand down power over Southern. One view is that he’s worried about putting stockbroker belt commuters in the hands of TfL at a time when it is coping with substantial funding cuts and also that he doesn’t much care for Khan, who was his pugnacious Labour shadow during his time as justice secretary. The Tory City Hall attack was delivered by Gareth Bacon, current leader of the eight-strong Tory group. After testing Khan’s general knowledge - just checking, but he did understand that TfL would be “controlling the franchise” rather than directly running the service, did he? - Bacon invited him to say how many people were in this TfL top team-in-waiting of which he speaks, what their names are, what jobs they are doing now and whether Southern would be getting their services for free. To which Khan retorted that Bacon was “clearly acting as a conduit for the secretary of state,” and there the cross-party compact got a bit frayed. Bacon then widened his attack to the RMT union, which has been making its own contribution to the Southern saga with a series of stoppages. If Khan could lacerate the train operator for cancellations and delays, could he not also tear a strip off the strikers? Or else, could he, with his strong union links, not have a friendly word, as he’d criticised Boris Johnson for failing to do with the London Underground unions for eight whole years. Khan, mildly wrong-footed, said he found it “astonishing” that “the workers” were being blamed. From the ensuing verbal scrimmage the words “megaphone diplomacy” and “asking assembly members to bat for you” then emerged. For the record, Bacon says the “conduit” charge is “complete nonsense”. It’s also worth adding that the RMT, unlike other London rail transport unions, is not tight buddies with Labour. But what matters much, much more than all of that - and on this, the consensus still holds - is that rail devolution for south London does indeed go ahead. The routes run by Southeastern (not to be confused with...), which happen to serve Bacon’s Kent-ish Bexley and Bromley constituents, is scheduled to be the first part of a “south London metro” to come under TfL’s auspices, in 2018. That needs to pick up speed if the timetable is not to slip and if other franchises are to follow efficiently. Grayling is, obviously, the politician best placed to make that happen. Is his heart really in it? Is Khan’s public lobbying helping or hindering?"
2016-09-14T17:30:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Warsaw sends police officers to Harlow after killing of Polish man,"Two Polish police officers have been sent to patrol the streets of Harlow in Essex following the killing of a Polish man in the town and a spike in hate crime directed at Poles in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union. Harlow’s sizeable Polish community is said to be “scared and worried” after the killing last month of Arkadiusz Jóźwik, 40, by a gang of teenagers in what is being treated by Essex police as a possible hate crime. Jóźwik and a second Polish man, who survived, were allegedly the victims of an unprovoked attack. Three other Poles have also been attacked in separate recent incidents in the town.
The deployment of the officers came as the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, condemned attacks on Polish people in the UK. “We Europeans can never accept Polish workers being beaten up, harassed or even murdered in the streets of Essex,” Juncker said in his annual state of the union address to MEPs in Strasbourg.
Essex police have taken up an offer by the Polish state police to deploy two officers in the town. The officers, second lieutenant Bartosz Czernicki and chief sergeant Dariusz Tybura, started work on Wednesday and will initially be on patrol for a week. They will have no formal police powers, but the move is designed to ease community tensions and reassure Poles, according to a spokesman for the Polish embassy in London. “They are there to assist with community relations for Essex. They will be helping to foster dialogue with the Poles and to help them feel more safe and secure in the area,” he said. Two Polish officers are also currently on secondment to the Metropolitan police in London. After a visit to Harlow last week at which the deployment of the officers was discussed, Col Rafał Batkowski, director of international cooperation with the Polish state police, said: “We wanted to get an assurance that appropriate measures are being taken to ensure that the Polish community in Essex feels safe and secure.” Eric Hind, a Harlow-based Pole who organised a protest march in the town after Jóźwik’s killing, was sceptical about the move. “I welcome everyone who wants to help with this complex problem, but I haven’t noticed the difference. I really hope I can see them back on the street at 11pm tonight actually doing something for the community, dealing with things and not just posing for selfies.” Hind pointed out that Poles were still being attacked in the UK. “Many feel let down by the British government. We made the UK our home, but we don’t feel welcome here anymore. People are scared and worried.” Four teenage boys have been arrested following an allegedly racist attack on a Polish man in Leeds. They will be questioned over an attack on a 28-year-old man who was kicked and punched by a gang in Armley on Friday night. The Polish embassy said it was aware of more than 29 attacks on Poles in the UK since the referendum. They include an arson attack on the home of Polish family in Plymouth in July and the assaults of Polish men in Yeovil and St Ives. The Polish embassy is encouraging Poles to report all suspected hate crimes to the police. Poland’s ambassador the UK, Arkady Rzegocki, welcomed Juncker’s remarks. He said: “We appreciate that the European commission shares our concern for the safety of the Polish nationals in the United Kingdom. We hope that more could be done to inform and educate about the positive contribution of EU migrants to the British culture, society, and economy.”"
2016-09-14T17:57:57Z,uk-news,UK news,Old Bailey jury to hear secret evidence from counter-terrorism officer,"An Old Bailey jury hearing allegations that a Birmingham man was trying to smuggle himself out of the UK to join Islamic State fighters in Syria is hearing secret evidence from a counter-terrorism officer. More than a week into the trial of Anas Abdalla, the court was told by the judge, Richard Marks QC, that the evidence being heard behind closed doors “will touch on matters of extreme sensitivity and of a confidential nature”. The jury had been listening to DC Brett Bambury of the West Midlands police counter-terrorism unit, who was explaining how Abdalla was discovered in the back of a lorry in Dover last year when the case went “in camera”, excluding the media and public. The court has already heard that an attempt was allegedly made in January 2013 by MI5 to recruit Abdalla. He believed that if he did not respond positively, his life would be very difficult, the prosecutor, Duncan Atkinson QC, has told the jury. The secret evidence session relates to the defendant’s defence. Abdalla, from Acocks Green, Birmingham, claims he was fleeing Britain because he was being “harassed and subject to oppressive treatment” by MI5. The 26-year-old was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, and first came to the UK as an asylum seeker. He denies the charge of preparing acts of terrorism under section 5(1) of the 2006 Terrorism Act. When Abdalla was discovered in the back of a lorry, he was hiding with three other men. One of the other men detained, Gabriel Rasmus, 29, from Lozells, Birmingham, has already pleaded guilty, the court heard, to preparing acts of terrorism. The court has heard that an undercover officer infiltrated a group of Isis supporters attempting to smuggle themselves out of the UK to Syria. Earlier on Wednesday, the jury was told that Abdalla had repeatedly been held by police officers at Birmingham airport and Dover ferry terminal under schedule 7 port stops over the course of several years. On some occasions, he had missed his flight because he was being detained and interviewed. The jury has previously been told by the prosecution that Abdalla and Rasmus were planning to travel to Syria via Bulgaria and Turkey “to join forces with so-called Islamic State and to offer their services, with their lives if necessary, to engage in acts of terrorism”. Rasmus had been under police investigation for some time, particularly through meetings conducted by an undercover officer known by the pseudonym “Muhamed” who was gathering information about alleged terrorist activity. Muhamed also met Abdalla, who told him that “Europe held nothing for him” and that he loathed his work in IT because he had to associate with non-Muslims, the jury heard. “He said he had been called on to go to Syria to fight and wanted to do so,” Atkinson said. Abdalla, it is alleged, expressed support for Isis. One of the other men detained in the back of the lorry was Mahamuud Diini. He, the court was told, had been trying to leave the country covertly. Diini, however, has been prosecuted previously for seeking to travel to Syria but was acquitted. The prosecution has challenged Abdalla’s claim that he was fleeing from security force harassment and argued that difficulties in his life were due to other causes. Abdalla, the court was told, had failed many of the modules of his computer technology course at Wolverhampton University and been required to leave due to his poor academic record. The case continues."
2016-09-14T18:04:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Everyman cinema chain is next to drop zero-hours contracts,"The Everyman cinema chain is set to move hundreds of staff off zero-hours contracts by the end of next year, joining a wave of companies turning against the controversial employment contracts. Crispin Lilly, the chief executive of the boutique cinema group, said five of its 19 outlets would be free of zero hours by the end of this year and the rest in 2017. The group began experimenting with guaranteed monthly hours at its Birmingham branch and has already introduced that system in new outlets in Harrogate and Chelmsford. In the next few months two further sites, including Leeds, will switch to the system, which promises at least 40 hours a month. Lilly said: “If all goes well we want to take it across the chain. Some people say, ‘why not do it tomorrow?’ but we want to make sure that when we move existing sites we don’t lose good employees in the process. We’ve proven it delivers the same level of flexibility that zero hours did but zero hours has been much maligned by [businesses] that treated it badly. “Our staff have never had problems with zero hours but it has become a bad word and there are employees out there who would not come to us if we’re associated with it.” He revealed the plans alongside a trading statement in which Everyman said revenues had risen nearly 51% to £12.1m in the six months to June as it opened a string of new sites. Box office takings at established cinemas fell by about 2%, in line with the wider market, as some box office blockbusters failed to ignite. Successes included Jungle Book and The Revenant but none was as popular as Jurassic World in 2015. Lilly said takings had picked up briskly in July and August with the release of The BFG, Suicide Squad, Ghostbusters and Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie. The appeal of the boutique chains has been tarnished by rows over the use of zero-hours contracts and low pay. Film fans have criticised poor pay and conditions when they are paying as much as £18.50 a seat to watch a film. In January last year, the Curzon chain moved all 200 cinema staff at its 14 sites off zero hours and onto the living wage. Cineworld, which owns the Picturehouse chain, told the Guardian it continued to use zero-hours contracts across the business but implemented them “on a ‘responsible use’ basis, which allows staff the same benefits pro rata as their fixed-hours counterparts.” Picturehouse said it offered staff the choice of zero- or guaranteed-hours contracts. Everyman’s move comes after retailer Sports Direct said it would offer 18,000 workers at its shops contracts guaranteeing at least 12 hours’ work a week following heavy criticism of its employment practices, although it has emerged that this change could take until the end of the year. Earlier this week Greene King said it would move thousands of pub workers at chains including Wacky Warehouse off zero-hours contracts after fellow pub firm JD Wetherspoon announced it would allow 24,000 staff to choose between a zero-hours contract and one offering fixed hours."
2016-09-14T19:10:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May set to give go-ahead for Hinkley Point C nuclear plant,"Theresa May is expected to confirm on Thursday that she will give the go-ahead for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, but will seek to impose new conditions on its French and Chinese backers. The prime minister announced a review of the contract to build the Somerset reactor in July, amid concerns about the costs and the potential security impact of Chinese involvement. May and Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, are thought to be hoping to persuade the contractors involved – the French utility company EDF and the Chinese state-backed firm CGN – to renegotiate the contract that specifies a generous minimum price for the electricity the project will generate. The National Audit Office warned in July that Hinkley Point C could cost energy consumers £30bn in top-up payments because of falling wholesale electricity prices. Under the terms of the subsidy scheme, the British consumer would compensate EDF for lower wholesale electricity prices over Hinley’s 35-year lifetime, an arrangement that has appeared increasingly poor value as energy costs have plummeted with the declining oil price. George Osborne, who was sacked as chancellor by May in one of her first acts as prime minister, had been determined to press ahead with Hinkley as part of his attempt to create a “golden decade” of relations with Beijing.
But May’s joint chief of staff, Nick Timothy, had previously expressed doubts about the security implications of allowing China to be involved in such a key piece of national infrastructure and Clark is said by Whitehall insiders to have raised concerns about whether the deal represented value for money. Downing Street sources insisted on Wednesday that no formal decision had been made, but May’s spokesperson has said an announcement would come in September. Thursday is the last possible day for a statement to parliament before the House of Commons goes into recess so that MPs can attend the autumn party conferences. Since the summer, No 10 has sought assurances about the security risks of Hinkley and examined the idea of separating the project from a second reactor at Bradwell, in Essex, which the Chinese hope to build independently. Clark told the House of Commons on Tuesday: “We are looking at all components of the deal and will make our decision before the end of the month,” adding that the government saw “new nuclear” as “an important part of a diverse energy mix that gives resilience to UK consumers”. Hinkley would be the first new nuclear reactor built in Britain in two decades. The shadow energy secretary, Barry Gardiner, said he would welcome a decision to give Hinkley the go-ahead, saying: “If the secretary of state has now managed to reduce the cost to British bill payers, in line with my suggestions, I promise not to gloat. I will simply say well done for sticking up for the consumer. “But in return, the government must stop the dithering. Their delay has put at risk £18bn of investment and jeopardised 25,000 skilled jobs in the nuclear industry, which are essential for the UK’s balanced energy portfolio.” However, environmentalists are likely to condemn the decision. The Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas said: “Instead of investing in this eye-wateringly expensive white elephant, the government should be doing all it can to support offshore wind, energy efficiency and innovative new technologies such as energy storage.” May has come under pressure from the Chinese government to approve the project, with Beijing’s ambassador to London warning that it could affect diplomatic relations between the two countries. Beijing was incensed by suggestions that UK ministers were unhappy about the national security implications of giving a Chinese company access to Britain’s national energy infrastructure. In a prominent opinion piece published in the state-run China Daily newspaper before May’s arrival for the G20 summit, China’s ambassador to London urged her to make “wise strategic choices” over Britain’s future relationship with Beijing. Senior military and intelligence figures had warned that plans to give China a big stake in Britain’s nuclear power industry posed a threat to national security. Critics have said the US would never allow China to work inside its national infrastructure, giving it the opportunity to sabotage energy supplies. The proposed scheme in Somerset to build two reactors capable of providing 7% of Britain’s total electricity needs has been hit by continual delays due to concerns inside EDF about the financial burden to the already heavily indebted energy company. The nominal cost of construction is £18bn, according to EDF. Beijing only agreed to fund 30% of the project on condition it would be allowed to showcase its nuclear prowess by building a Chinese-designed reactor at Bradwell in Essex. Beijing was therefore incensed by suggestions May might approve Hinkley but reserve judgment on Bradwell. The Chinese were brought on board as part of Osborne’s effort to forge closer ties with Beijing but also because of doubts about EDF’s ability to carry out the project. Hinkley is scheduled for completion by 2025, but many regard that timetable as unrealistic because reactors of the same design being built by EDF in Finland and France are running years behind schedule."
2016-09-14T19:11:15Z,uk-news,UK news,"Prison officers watched as inmate blinded himself, says report","Prison officers watched but failed to intervene to stop a young inmate as he blinded himself inside Northern Ireland’s top security Maghaberry jail, a damning report has found. The Prisoner Ombudsman for Northern Ireland has concluded that prison staff “directly observed” Sean Lynch inflicting wounds that were described as “shocking and extreme”. The report by Tom McGonigle, the prisoner ombudsman, said that on 5 June 2014, the day the 23-year-old blinded himself, two prison officers watched as the Derry-born former footballer injured himself on more than 20 occasions in the course of just over an hour. CCTV cameras showed the prisoner “crying in pain” and banging his cell door, the report said. McGonigle said: “It seems remarkable that several experienced Northern Ireland Prison Service officers, including a senior officer, all felt it was neither necessary nor appropriate to enter his cell to prevent Mr Lynch from self-harming further.” The prisoner ombudsman added: ”Their duty of care was trumped by security concerns that appear to have had little basis in reality.” His report also quoted a Catholic priest, who had visited Lynch days before the major self-harming incident, who said: “He needs to be in a psychiatric hospital ... his condition is beyond anything the officers can cope with.”
Sean Lynch’s father said his family has yet to received an apology from the Northern Ireland Prison Service over their son’s plight. Damian Lynch said he would like to see the prison officers who stood by and watched his son self-harming over a long period be sacked. Speaking on behalf of his family, he said: ”We believe this investigation clearly indicates wide-ranging failures in the care of Sean by both the prison service and health service. “We believe it is incredible, given Sean was on suicide watch, that prison staff refused to enter Sean’s cell on 5 June when he was self-harming for 67 minutes to prevent him from blinding himself. “We believe we are entitled to answers, to ensure that no other family will have to suffer like we have. The impact on the family and on Sean has been horrendous, our lives have been changed forever.” Just before he inflicted the injuries on himself Sean Lynch was on remand at Maghaberry prison outside Belfast for breaching an order banning him from going near a former girlfriend. His family say he became deeply depressed and frightened. The prison holds some of the most dangerous inmates in the UK, including dozens of paramilitaries. In an interview with the Guardian after his release from jail, Sean Lynch – who once had trials with Manchester United and Newcastle – said: “I will never see my loved ones again and they are just in front of me … I just kept asking over and over again for help and no one seemed to care. They let me go into a dark place and I’ll never be able to get out of it.” The Northern Ireland Prisons Service’s director general, Sue McAllister, said it was the most extreme case of self harm she had witnessed in 30 years of working within the UK prison system. “I hope that the recommendations to be taken forward will provide some comfort for Mr Lynch and his family that lessons have been learned from this tragic case,” she said. The South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust, which was in charge of Sean Lynch’s visits to a local hospital and his medical monitoring, said it also accepted the findings and recommendations contained within the prisoner ombudsman’s report."
2016-09-15T05:00:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Nuclear power is risky and expensive; here's a better idea,"In the 21st century, the UK will have to supply itself with power that is affordable, reliable and clean. But in almost every way, the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station offers only expensive and risky solutions from the 20th century. A nuclear power station is about as useful in solving the dilemma as a 20th-century nuclear weapon is in ending a 21st-century guerilla insurgency, because a ground-level energy revolution is taking place. The old regime of large, centralised power plants is being replaced a smart, efficient and widely distributed network, powered by increasing amounts of renewable energy.
If that sounds radical, it’s not – it’s just how the internet works to provide fast and reliable communications. If it sounds like a hippy dream, it’s not – New York State’s energy plan has embraced it in order to deliver 50% renewable electricity by 2030 and a 23% cut in energy use by buildings. In the UK, this government aims to improve the energy efficiency of just half the homes retrofitted by the last one. If you think New York State is alone in its thinking - it’s not. Bodies including the government’s own National Infrastructure Commission (NIC), the National Grid and industry group Energy UK all point to a smart system that is more secure, cheaper and faster to build and they all use the same word: “revolution”, while the International Energy Agency talks of a rapid “transition”. The momentum behind the revolution is straightforward: cost. While renewable energy and other energy technologies are plummeting in price, nuclear power continues its historical trend of getting ever more expensive. Even if the UK negotiates a sharp cut in the subsidies for Hinkley, it still could not be built before 2026 at the earliest. By then, a capacity crunch will have hit the UK as old power stations close. Hinkley puts a lot of generation capacity in one plan , which is very risky given the financial, legal and technical obstacles it faces. EDF, the French company leading the project, is taking on considerable financial risk, with Martin Young, an energy analyst at investment bank RBC Capital Markets, saying the project “verges on insanity”. Court challenges – including from EDF’s own trade unions – abound and the fiendishly complex project has been described by one nuclear engineer as unconstructable. Two attempts to build the same reactor in France and Finland are miles over budget and behind schedule. In contrast, energy efficiency could deliver six Hinkleys’ worth of electricity by 2030, according to the government’s own research. Four Hinkleys’ worth could be saved by increasing the ability to store electricity and making the grid smarter, with the latter alone likely to save billpayers £8bn a year. Capturing and storing carbon from fossil fuel plants is also vital, but has received scant attention from the government compared with Hinkley. It would halve the cost of beating global warming, according to government’s own official advisers, but in November ministers abruptly canned its plan. The government will not be able to get out of the Hinkley deal, however. Once signed, the deal with EDF contains a “poison pill” which could leave taxpayers with a £22bn bill if a future UK government shuts down the plant. The government has remained adamant that Hinkley, which could provide 7% of the UK’s electricity, is a vital part of a secure low-carbon future. But it is not just the idea of EDF’s partner, a Chinese state company, being involved that creates security fears. Nuclear power plants are prone to shutdowns, over safety concerns or even invasions of jellyfish into cooling waters as happened at Torness, in Scotland in 2011. Closing down such a giant plant at short notice immediately puts the security of the nation’s electricity supply at risk. One back-up option recently favoured by the government is to deploy farms of diesel generators, which emit large volumes of carbon dioxide, ready to start up when needed. Yet in a smart, distributed system, knocking out one wind turbine or solar panel is barely noticed by the grid. The risk with Hinkley is that will it bring about the mutually assured destruction of both EDF and UK energy policy, with an expensive, hard-to-build reactor, in which the taxpayer will end up footing the bill."
2016-09-15T06:00:35Z,uk-news,UK news,"Army veteran Tasered by police awarded £50,000 compensation","An army veteran has been paid £50,000 in compensation by Bedfordshire police after he was Tasered while suffering a flashback triggered by post-traumatic stress disorder. The former army corporal, known only as Michael for legal reasons, was knocked out by the 1,500-volt shock immediately after he asked the officer to put the Taser down. Michael told the Guardian that the incident had left him “too terrified to leave my own home in case I saw the police again” and that he believed officers should be better trained to handle mental health issues. The payout, thought to be one of the biggest compensation awards to a Taser victim, comes after the death of the former Aston Villa footballer Dalian Atkinson, who was Tasered by officers while suffering a medical episode. Michael, who served in Northern Ireland during 18 years in the army, developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after being injured by a hand grenade in Bosnia in 1991. “Being Tasered had a massive effect on my life. I went from someone who was struggling with PTSD but still able to have some sort of life to someone who couldn’t leave the house,” he said. “I used to stay up all night looking out the window because I was scared that the police would come and hurt me. It got so bad that we had to move to another part of the country so I wouldn’t see any officers from Bedfordshire. If it hadn’t have been for the support of my partner I don’t think I’d still be here today.” He added: “If I had another flashback in the same situation now I wouldn’t be confident that the police would know what to do. It’s really important that officers think very carefully before using a Taser, particularly on someone with mental health problems, as it can ruin lives.”
Police officers were called by Michael’s partner Joanne when the former serviceman suffered a flashback as they drove through Luton on 5 May 2014. Michael punched the front windscreen of the car before saying he was going to kill Joanne and then himself because he was too much to cope with. He then became disorientated and hid in bushes outside Luton and Dunstable hospital, believing he was still in the army, when officers were called at 9pm. When officers arrived, they tried to convince Michael – who was still distressed – to go to hospital, but he was reluctant to go. He asked officers to let him go home, but they refused. Michael’s solicitor, Gus Silverman, of the law firm Irwin Mitchell, said the officers tried to phone mental health specialists but “failed to take more than cursory steps” to contact them “despite the fact they were literally in the car park of a hospital”. After an hour of calm negotiation, one of the officers drew his Taser and instructed Michael to put his hands behind his back and turn around. At this point, the former serviceman was surrounded by four officers with his back to a fence. He asked the officer to put down his weapon so they could talk but was immediately Tasered, causing him to collapse unconscious as officers handcuffed him from behind. One of the officers recorded in his pocket notebook: “Due to the length of time it was taking a decision was made that the officers were going to take [Michael] to the hospital ... [the officer] drew his Taser and informed [Michael] of this. [Michael] stood with his hands in his pockets and said, ‘Ok, let’s talk’, but was Tasered.”
After being stretchered into an ambulance, Michael was detained under the Mental Health Act and taken to hospital. He was discharged in the early hours of the following day. In a subsequent internal investigation, a nationally trained Taser instructor who reviewed footage of the incident from a body-worn camera said she had been “unable to identify a rise, or change in the threat level to the public, the officers or the subject” before the 1,500-volt shock was discharged. The force refused to uphold a complaint into the incident, concluding that the officer honestly believed such force was necessary. But Silverman described that finding as “erroneous”, pointing out that the test is whether the officer “honestly and reasonably” believed it was necessary to use a Taser. Michael’s partner Joanne said the incident had caused his mental health to deteriorate to the extent that she is now his full-time carer. She added: “The officers who attended the scene that night knew that Michael was suffering from a flashback and had PTSD. “After they were there for about an hour and had been talking with him they suddenly pulled out a Taser and fired it. He fell on to the floor straight away and lost consciousness. “It was extremely frightening for me as I never expected the officers to do that to someone clearly suffering from a mental illness and who wasn’t a threat to anyone.” The £50,000 payout is thought to be one of the biggest compensation awards by police for a Taser incident. In 2014, a security guard from Birmingham received £26,500 in compensation from West Midlands police after being Tasered and wrongly arrested by officers."
2016-09-15T09:47:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Five police may face action over student in vegetative state,"Five police officers may face action following the arrest of a university student who was left with a broken neck and in a vegetative state, the police watchdog has said. The officers, from Bedfordshire police, are to be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service over whether they should face criminal charges, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said on Thursday. An investigation by the police watchdog has also decided that they could have a case to answer for discipline charges of gross misconduct. The case concerns Julian Cole, who suffered a severed spinal cord after a night out in Bedford in May 2013. Cole, then 20, was arrested by police outside a Bedford nightclub and carried to a police van. The IPCC investigated six officers in total; it has decided that five may face gross misconduct disciplinary charges for failing in their responsibilities and duties.
The IPCC also says that four officers it investigated might have a case to answer for “honesty and integrity” concerning accounts they gave, and that one officer could face a misconduct charge for use of force. One officer the IPCC investigated will face no action. The officers are understood to have denied any wrongdoing. The IPCC believes they should be suspended; the police force say four remain on active duties and one has retired. Cole’s case was first reported by the Guardian. His mother, Claudia Cole, said: “Following that night, he has been left paralysed and in a vegetative state and he will need 24-hour care for as long as he lives. Julian is still alive, but it cannot be said that he is really living. This year Julian was supposed to be graduating from Bedfordshire University with a degree in sports science, but he never got a chance to do that. Julian had big dreams, big ambitions, and all of those are dashed. We miss him so much every day.” The family claim they were misled about details of the case after the incident. They say one officer told them Cole was talking after his arrest, but this would have been impossible with a severed spinal cord. Another allegedly said Cole was drunk. He had consumed alcohol, but tests showed he was under the drink-drive limit. Claudia Cole added: “It has been the hardest three years waiting for the IPCC investigation to conclude. We want to see the report and all the evidence to learn the full truth of what happened. We also want to see justice for Julian – it will not bring him back, but we hope the CPS makes a swift decision on criminal prosecutions against the officers.” The incident happened when Cole returned to Elements nightclub in Bedford to request a refund after he and friends were asked to leave. CCTV captured some of the incident, but not the moment when Cole apparently lost consciousness. He reappeared on CCTV handcuffed and being carried by officers into a police van. He was arrested shortly after 1.30am and taken to a police station. At 2.08am an ambulance arrived and Cole was assessed as being in a coma. By 2.18am he had gone into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated. The IPCC deputy chair, Sarah Green, said: “This has been a complex and lengthy investigation involving examination of over 900 documents, interviews with witnesses, a number of medical expert opinions, CCTV trawls and forensic analysis. We are now satisfied we have gathered all the available evidence to enable the Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether or not charges should follow. We have kept Mr Cole’s family and Bedfordshire police updated on our progress.” A referral to the CPS is made when an IPCC investigation indicates that a criminal offence might have been committed. It does not mean that criminal charges will necessarily follow. The CPS will decide whether charges should be brought, based on the test set out in the code for crown prosecutors. Cole was arrested by police on suspicion of a public order offence, which was dropped because of the injuries he suffered."
2016-09-15T10:04:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Prince Charles left shaken after car collides with deer,"Prince Charles’s car has been involved in a collision with a deer at Balmoral, it has been reported.
The 67-year-old heir to the throne was uninjured but shaken by the incident, which took place over the weekend, according to the Mirror. It said the condition of the deer was unknown. The Audi the prince was driving was reportedly damaged in the collision at the Queen’s Aberdeenshire estate and sent away for repairs. A spokesman for Clarence House declined to comment on the crash. Between 40,000 and 75,000 deer are killed in collisions on the UK’s roads every year, according to the AA. Road accidents involving the animals result in more than 450 human injuries a year, as well as several deaths, and cause £11m of damage to vehicles. Unlike with some other animals, drivers who hit a deer are not obliged to stop or report the incident to the police. The Queen is patron of the RSPCA and Charles could take over the role if she steps down. But in the past he has taken different views to the animal welfare charity over issues such as badger culling and hunting."
2016-09-15T10:46:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Your guide to Hinkley Point C – the UK's first new nuclear plant for 20 years,"What is it? Hinkley Point C will be the UK’s first new nuclear power station in two decades, after finally getting the green light from Theresa May on Thursday. The plant is expected to cost £18bn to build, most of which will be financed by the French utility company EDF. Chinese investment, via the CGN group, will cover one-third of the £18bn cost. The Hinkley deal also involves the Chinese taking a stake in a new project at Sizewell and an agreement to build their own power plant at Bradwell in Essex. Hinkley Point C will be built next to the two existing facilities, A and B, and will be the biggest construction site in Europe. Hinkley A was decommissioned in 2000, and Hinkley B is due to be decommissioned in 2023. Once complete, Hinkley C will deliver 7% of the UK’s electricity, when most other nuclear power stations will have closed down. The construction is expected to provide 25,000 jobs, while the finished power plant will employ 900 people. Why has construction been delayed? The government unexpectedly postponed a final decision on the project in July. The official reason given by Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, was that the government needed to “consider carefully all the component parts of this project and make its decision in the early autumn.” But it was thought that doubts about the reliability of the plant’s future financing as well as fears about Chinese involvement in the future of UK energy made ministers put on the brakes. The delay goes back much further than July though. In 2007, Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF’s UK arm, predicted Britons would be using electricity from Hinkley to cook their Christmas turkeys in 2017.
Why is Hinkley Point C so controversial? Critics say that Hinkley C is too expensive, will take too long to build, is a bad deal for UK consumers, is potentially risky and leaves the UK too reliant on foreign powers for its energy. And some argue that UK energy policy should be focused on renewables, which are dropping in price. Let’s break these issues down: Chinese involvement Many suspect that the prime minister is not comfortable about Chinese involvement in the scheme. The former business secretary Vince Cable said that when she was home secretary May had raised national security concerns about the Hinkley Point deal in cabinet. She was “unhappy about the rather gung-ho approach to Chinese investment that we had, and that [then chancellor] George Osborne in particular was promoting and, as I recall, raised objections to Hinkley at that time,” Cable said. In October last year – on the eve of the Chinese president’s state visit to the UK – the prime minister’s joint chief of staff Nick Timothy wrote: “Security experts – reportedly inside as well as outside government – are worried that the Chinese could use their role to build weaknesses into computer systems which will allow them to shut down Britain’s energy production at will … MI5 believes that ‘the intelligence services of … China … continue to work against UK interests at home and abroad’.” Financing Critics argue that with the cost of borrowing so low following the vote for Brexit, the government should build its own new nuclear power stations. There are also doubts about the financial reliability of the French firm EDF, which is 80% owned by the French state. EDF’s market value has halved in the last two years and is now valued at only €22bn (£18.7bn), not significantly more than Hinkley C’s entire investment. EDF also needs to invest €50bn over the next ten years to upgrade existing French reactors, and the French government wants to end some state guarantees for EDF’s revenues. EDF’s finance director, Thomas Piquemal, resigned in March, reportedly because he believed proceeding with the project could jeopardise the company. Cost to consumers Much has also been said about Hinkley C’s “nuclear strike price” - the price the government has guaranteed EDF per unit of electricity produced. To secure French and Chinese investment, the last coalition government agreed in 2013 to pay £92.5 per megawatt hour (Mwh) of electricity – rising in line with inflation– for the first 35 years of the plant’s life. Critics say this now looks like a bad deal following the collapse in the wholesale price of energy in the last three years. Currently, £92.50 per Mwh is more than twice the cost of wholesale electricity. These guarantees could end up costing UK consumers up to £30bn, according to the National Audit Office – five times the original 2013 estimate. Technology Questions have been raised about the technology that will be used. The planned European pressurised reactor (EPR) for Hinkley C is a relatively new design, and its reliability is not yet proven. There have been problems at other EPR construction sites. In Olkiluoto in Finland, an EPR was due to come on stream in 2009 and is €2.6bn over budget. In Flamanville in northern France construction is also over budget and six years late. A serious flaw in the steel housing the reactor core at Flamanville was discovered in July last year. The UK government wants Hinkley to be fully functional by 2025 – the same year it wants to phase out “unabated coal” power. Alternatives Critics of Hinkley C argue that the government should not be investing in nuclear power, but instead pushing resources to wind, wave and other renewable power sources that would be cheaper and better for the environment. As few as four large offshore wind farms could match the 3.2Gw of power expected from Hinkley Point C. As wind is intermittent, gas could provide backup on windless days. Wind subsidies are guaranteed for 15 years at £120 per Mwh – more expensive than Hinkley – but costs are expected to fall as the industry matures. The cost of offshore wind projects fell 11% between 2010 and 2014. Proponents argue solar power is now cheaper than Hinkley, having fallen by half in the last five years. Critics also say we can expect further rapid advances in battery storage and “smart grid” technology to tackle issues of intermittency."
2016-09-15T11:23:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Sir Howard Bernstein to stand down from Manchester council,"Sir Howard Bernstein, the veteran chief executive of Manchester council who transformed the former “Cottonopolis” into the UK’s second city, is standing down after 45 years at the town hall. The 63-year-old, nationally regarded as a star of British local government, ended speculation over his future by saying the time was right to hand over the reins. Bernstein said it had been a “privilege to serve the city during such a pivotal period”, adding: “I’m incredibly proud of what the city has been able to achieve in this time and to have played a part in it.” Joining the council as an 18-year-old junior clerk in 1971, Bernstein rose through the ranks at a time of huge change for Manchester. From establishing Manchester airport as a limited company to overseeing the post-IRA bomb rebuild in 1996, Bernstein went on to secure the hosting of the Commonwealth Games in 2002 and has played a key role in raising billions of pounds of investment in the city. He has also been a vocal cheerleader for George Osborne’s “northern powerhouse” agenda, becoming the former chancellor’s most influential ally outside Westminster, as Manchester led the way in grasping devolved powers over areas such as transport, planning and housing. Bernstein said his decision to step down was partly the result of a need to create an orderly succession process, but he insisted he was not retiring. “It’s hard,” he said. “Do I wish I was 55 again? Yes, I do. Would I look forward to another eight years? Yes. But the platform we have got in Manchester for change and growth is unprecedented in generations. Whoever takes over from me, the long term future of this city is very, very strong.” He described Manchester as a “premier league world city” but said there remained significant challenges to address “to ensure everyone who lives here has the opportunity to share in, and contribute to, its growing success.” Described in reverential terms by those who have worked with him, the chief executive helped restore Manchester’s swagger from the top of town hall.
With a penchant for vivid socks and snappy scarves, Bernstein was a picture of sartorial style not usually associated with local government. “He would be standing up giving a speech at the height of summer wearing a black scarf – year-round, he was synonymous with it,” said one business leader who has worked closely with Bernstein. He said the only day Bernstein had ever taken off work was his 60th birthday. “He was well known for poring over his iPad late at night sending emails off to people round the world, getting them to dance to his tune,” the business leader added. “It’s a cliche about getting things done but he’s the most business-focused council chief executive I’ve ever seen. He’d jump on a plane to seal deals himself rather than get the business or landowner to do it. “He’s great at having high-level conversations with top businesspeople, prime ministers, but if he gets on with you, you could drop him a text and he would always prioritise what you wanted to get done.” Osborne, whose northern powerhouse initiative has faltered under Theresa May’s government, led tributes to Bernstein. “I have worked with lots of very clever civil servants in Whitehall and come across lots of officials in local government. But he is one of the very, very best public servants I’ve ever come across,” he said. “I just think in lots of different ways he’s the star of British local government and frankly I can’t think of anyone who comes close to him.” Andy Burnham, the Labour home affairs spokesman and mayoral candidate for Greater Manchester, said: “Sir Howard is one of the most incredible people I’ve ever met. He gave [Greater Manchester] a new sense of ambition. We’ll carry it on.” Lord O’Neill, the commercial secretary to the Treasury, who is from Manchester, said: “He was … a relentless supporter of our efforts to rebalance the economy and build a northern powerhouse – and his good work has helped create a dynamic, modern city that is the envy of others both across the country and beyond.” Sir Richard Leese, the leader of Manchester city council, whose partnership with Berstein has lasted 18 years, said the chief executive’s devotion to Manchester was unparalleled.
He said: “Sir Howard is widely recognised as one of the great local government chief executives. Having someone of his talent, vision and drive dedicate his career to the city has been an undoubted plus for Manchester. Working with him over many years, addressing challenges and attempting to capture opportunities for the city, has been a pleasure. “He will be a hard act to follow but part of his legacy will be the quality of the team, the strength of relationships and the depth of organisational ambition his successor inherits. Our new chief executive will need to be someone with the strategic vision, innovative ideas, partnership working skills and gravitas to help lead Manchester forwards into an exciting new phase.” In July, Bernstein led a delegation of senior Manchester figures to Beijing to drum up Chinese investment for the city, after the launch of the north of England’s first direct flight to mainland China, from Manchester airport. In an interview with the Guardian in Beijing, Bernstein said he had been “very reassured” about the prospects of Chinese investment in Britain despite the British vote to leave the European Union. He warned that the NHS would collapse if May’s government withdrew from EU freedom of movement laws. “Places like Manchester have welcomed people from different parts of the world for centuries and managed very very comfortably to ensure people can co-exist and play a full and active part in the city – it’s one of the things which I celebrate in Manchester,” he said. “I’m very, very clear about what free movement of labour can do for a city. I don’t see how some of our public services, the health service in particular, is capable of being sustained if we don’t have people from different parts of the world.”"
2016-09-15T12:46:00Z,uk-news,UK news,'Golden relationship' with China boosted by Hinkley approval,"When Theresa May announced a review of the controversial China-backed Hinkley Point C plant in July, she appeared to have sounded the death knell for a potentially lucrative “golden era” of UK-China relations heralded by David Cameron and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. “Right now, the China-UK relationship is at a crucial historical juncture,” warned Beijing’s ambassador to London, underlining how much the golden friendship hinged on Hinkley. With Thursday’s decision to approve the £18bn project - in which China will have a one-third share - May has given that special relationship a stay of execution. “I feel very happy about it,” said Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Shanghai’s Fudan University, reflecting Beijing’s glee. But May’s decision to give Hinkley the green light is far from a resounding endorsement of the UK-China relationship that was negotiated under her predecessor. When George Osborne – the golden era’s chief British architect – jetted out to China exactly one year ago he declared himself on a mission to become Beijing’s best friend in the west.
May has been far more cautious in her language since taking power, and her influential chief of staff, Nick Timothy, is known to harbour doubts about Osborne’s attempts to woo China’s authoritarian rulers. “What are the Chinese buying with their gold?” Timothy wondered last October, questioning the wisdom of allowing a “hostile state” to become involved in sensitive sectors such as energy and communications. Hinkley’s approval does little to suggest those concerns have been buried. Nor will it entirely convince Beijing of London’s continued commitment to the golden friendship. For China, the key will be whether Downing Street allows it to follow up its involvement in Hinkley by helping build a second nuclear plant in Sizewell, Suffolk, and – more importantly – its own Chinese-designed plant in Bradwell, Essex. The latter project would allow Beijing to show off its nuclear prowess to the rest of the world and is considered the real prize for China’s communist leaders. The state-owned China General Nuclear Power said it was “delighted that the British government has decided to proceed. We are now able to move forward and deliver much-needed nuclear capacity at Hinkley Point, Sizewell and Bradwell”. Yet the 724-word UK government statement announcing Hinkley’s approval made no mention of Bradwell, or even of China. Rather, it said “significant new safeguards” would be introduced for future foreign investment in critical infrastructure. Steve Tsang, an expert in China politics at the University of Nottingham, said Beijing would now be “looking very hard” at the implications of these new conditions, “not so much about Hinkley but about Bradwell, which is the real deal for China.” The nature of those conditions would determine whether the UK-China romance continued to blossom or was consigned to the scrap heap, he predicted. “A negative decision on Bradwell will mean the ‘golden era’ will not last.” Additional reporting by Christy Yao in Beijing"
2016-09-15T12:57:23Z,uk-news,UK news,MI6 rebuked over handling of Lee Rigby killer's Kenya mistreatment claims,"The security services were guilty of “serious failings” in their response to allegations by one of Fusilier Lee Rigby’s killers, Michael Adebolajo, that he was mistreated by Kenyan counter-terrorism units, a watchdog has found. Sir Mark Waller, the intelligence services commissioner, said MI6’s level of engagement with two oversight investigations into its response to the mistreatment allegations was “wholly inadequate” and “extremely unsatisfactory”. But Waller’s investigation also concluded that Adebolajo was “most definitely” not the subject of a conspiracy by the intelligence services, and that his allegations of torture or mistreatment at the hands of the Kenyan authorities were probably untrue. “Indeed, I think it highly unlikely that Mr Adebolajo was mistreated by any of the Kenyan police or intelligence units which work with [the British government],” Waller writes in his 126-page report published on Thursday.
The commissioner’s investigation into Adebolajo’s allegations was carried out at David Cameron’s request after the parliamentary intelligence and security committee reported in November 2014 that Rigby’s murder had not been preventable but that it had serious concerns about the way MI6 responded to the allegations of mistreatment and torture. Those concerns related to a four-month delay in opening an investigation into Adebolajo after he returned from Kenya in 2010, where he had been arrested after apparently preparing to fight with the Somali militant group al-Shabaab. Waller highlights three key defects in the performance of the British intelligence services in relation to Adebolajo’s time in Kenya. The first involves an MI6 officer’s incorrect supposition that his arrest was as a result of intelligence from a Kenyan agent rather than happenstance. The error distorted MI6’s understanding of the case, which might have been given a different priority if it had not been made. The second involves a claim by MI6 that it had sought and obtained assurances from the Kenyan authorities over Adebolajo’s treatment while he was in custody. “I am not satisfied they did this, although I cannot rule it out. There is no contemporaneous documentary evidence to support this claim,” Waller writes. When Waller interviewed the two MI6 officers in the case, neither could remember having done so. The third defect involved not following official guidance for such cases in which there is a risk the complainant might have been subject to unacceptable standards of detention. Waller subsequently found that after Adebolajo made the allegations of mistreatment, a “crucial” email from MI6 headquarters in London asking an intelligence officer to investigate them was blocked by “an unnecessarily hidden feature of its IT system. This was not known to any of those involved and so was not disclosed to or discovered by the intelligence and security committee.”. The commissioner says in his report that had this email not been blocked, “things may well have turned out differently, but its blocking cannot excuse the serious failings which followed … I found that the intelligence services thereafter failed to progress the matter at all, an appropriate assessment of [his] allegations was never undertaken, the notification of managers and ministers was not considered and the consolidated guidance was not followed.” Waller says that although such an investigation at the time is likely to have found the allegations were false, this was “a serious failing” because it meant that the formal notification of ministers was not considered when it should have been. The commissioner is also highly critical of MI6’s response to his investigation and a previous inquiry by the intelligence and security committee, calling it wholly inadequate. He says MI6 “demonstrated a troubling tendency to be defensive and unhelpful, it provided inaccurate and incomplete information and generally sought to fence with and close down lines of enquiry rather than engage constructively”. Waller says he does not think this was done maliciously or with the intention of obstructing or misleading either investigation, but the effects were both “significant and unsatisfactory”. He says MI6 strongly implied to the committee that it had consulted the officers involved in the case, when in fact it had spoken only briefly to one of them. Theresa May said in a written statement: “I welcome the fact that he [Waller] has firmly rejected any suggestion of a conspiracy by the security and intelligence agencies in Mr Adebolajo’s detention and that he has found no evidence to support the allegation that he was subject to mistreatment at the hands of the Kenyan authorities. “The government will look carefully at Sir Mark’s detailed analysis of the handling of this case and will take steps to address the issues where he has identified shortcomings.” Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were convicted in late 2013 of Rigby’s murder that year outside of Woolwich barracks in south London. Adebolajo was given a whole-life prison term and Adebowale was ordered to serve a minimum of 45 years."
2016-09-15T15:00:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Hinkley Point C nuclear power station gets government green light,"Theresa May has been accused of backing down on security concerns about Chinese involvement in nuclear power after she gave the go-ahead to the £18bn Hinkley Point C plant following a six-week review. The government insisted the new plant in Somerset was only being approved with “significant new safeguards” to make sure China and other foreign investors could not own stakes in British nuclear plants without UK government approval. However, Labour and environmental groups said the new security measures were merely “window dressing” and “hot air” that changed very little about the project, as the price remains the same and the new security powers already exist in law. Under the proposals, EDF, the French firm building the plant with a £6bn investment from a Chinese state nuclear firm, will not be able to sell on its ownership without permission. For future projects, the UK government will own a “special share” that means it will have a veto over owners if there are national security concerns.
In a sign the new requirements do not appear to be overly stringent, both EDF and China General Nuclear said they were delighted by the approval, which they claimed will let them proceed with Hinkley and their wider plans for nuclear construction in the UK in future. The Chinese are keen to proceed with a new plant at Bradwell in Essex in particular because it will be their own design built under the UK’s tough safety regulations, allowing the company to use it as a showcase to the rest of the world. “We are now able to move forward and deliver much-needed nuclear capacity at Hinkley Point, Sizewell and Bradwell with our strategic partners, EDF, and provide the UK with safe, reliable and sustainable low-carbon energy,” CGN said. “CGN and EDF have worked together in close cooperation for decades and this has laid a solid foundation for these three new nuclear projects. CGN looks forward to leveraging its 30 years’ experience in nuclear construction and operation and playing an important role in meeting the UK’s future energy needs.” The shadow energy secretary, Barry Gardiner, said the government has “backed down with a whimper” over its security concerns about Chinese involvement, saying it had announced “new powers they already possess”. He told Greg Clark, the business secretary: “They have claimed they introduced significant new safeguards into this package. The secretary of state already has such powers. Will the secretary of state acknowledge that he can prevent the sale of any element of critical infrastructure?” John Sauven, the Greenpeace executive director, also said the government’s review “appears to have been a lot of hot air”. “The prime minister has baulked at the political embarrassment of irritating the French and offending the Chinese. Consequently, even if EDF manages to get the technology to work, the UK will pay the price by saddling themselves until 2060 with an out of date, flawed and expensive technology,” he said.
Clark, the business and energy secretary, said the new security restrictions were an improvement, claiming EDF would have been at liberty to sell its stake on without the revised contract. His Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy confirmed that this was the only new security requirement for Hinkley to proceed. The controversial scheme in Somerset was approved six weeks after May unexpectedly placed the project under review, causing tensions with Beijing. Following the review, the government is keeping a guaranteed price of £92.50 to EDF for every megawatt hour of electricity generated, despite concerns that is far higher than the market rate. Chinese officials have previously given a series of veiled warnings that a decision by Britain to halt their investment in UK nuclear would be seen as a snub and would put at risk a supposed golden era of relations between the two countries. The decision means Hinkley will be the first new nuclear reactor built in Britain in two decades. Before an announcement in the House of Commons, Clark said: “Having thoroughly reviewed the proposal for Hinkley Point C, we will introduce a series of measures to enhance security and will ensure Hinkley cannot change hands without the government’s agreement. Consequently, we have decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation. “Britain needs to upgrade its supplies of energy, and we have always been clear that nuclear is an important part of ensuring our future low-carbon energy security.”
The wider changes to the government’s approach to the ownership of critical infrastructure are designed to ensure fuller scrutiny for the purposes of national security. This marks a departure from the more laissez-faire approach of David Cameron’s administration. A government statement said: “Following a comprehensive review of the Hinkley Point C project, and a revised agreement with EDF, the government has decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation. However, ministers will impose a new legal framework for future foreign investment in Britain’s critical infrastructure, which will include nuclear energy and apply after Hinkley.
“The changes mean that, while the UK will remain one of the most open economies in the world, the public can be confident that foreign direct investment works in the country’s best interests,” it said. The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, tweeted that it was excellent news that the project was going ahead and that it would be a boost for jobs in France. The economy minister, Michel Sapin, said it was an “undeniable success for French industry” and would be “a big contribution to supporting employment in France”. Jean-Bernard Lévy, the chief executive of EDF Group, said: “The decision of the British government to approve the construction of Hinkley Point C marks the relaunch of nuclear in Europe.”
But the news was met with dismay by environmental campaigners, who had been given hope it would be cancelled when May placed it under review. Greenpeace’s Sauven said the potential political embarrassment of scrapping the deal must have proved too great. But he added: “This decision is unlikely to be the grand finale to this summer’s political soap opera. There are still huge outstanding financial, legal and technical obstacles that can’t be brushed under the carpet. There might be months or even years of wrangling over these issues. That’s why the government should start supporting renewable power that can come online quickly for a competitive price.”
Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green party, said it was absurd and disappointing that the deal was to proceed when the government was reducing support for cheaper, safer and more reliable renewable alternatives. “Instead of investing in this eye-wateringly expensive white elephant, the government should be doing all it can to support offshore wind, energy efficiency and innovative new technologies, such as energy storage,” she said. However, business groups, engineers and trade unions welcomed the decision to proceed, saying it would create jobs and ensure a secure supply of energy. Claire Jakobsson, of the EEF manufacturers’ organisation, it was a “relief to see Hinkley proceeding after months of delays and uncertainty”, but called for significant reductions in the price of electricity generated by future nuclear projects. Brian Rye, acting general secretary of Ucatt, the construction union, said: “The go-ahead was vital for the construction industry, which desperately needed the confirmation of such a major project following a slowdown in the industry caused by the Brexit vote. It is also good news for the overall economy as it helps to guarantee the stability of our future energy supply.” The French secretary of state for industry, Christophe Sirugue, told France Info the Hinkley decision was good news because it validated French industrial strategy to invest in nuclear. He said it would create 4,500 jobs in France. Questions remain over the difficult financial position of the French state-owned power company EDF, which will assume up-front costs, which some unions in France argue could jeopardise the firm’s survival. Sirugue said the state had “taken serious account” of the concerns and would be reorganising and helping out the firm. He added that it was “extremely important” that the Hinkley project went ahead in terms of France “demonstrating our industrial savoir-faire” to the international market. Timeline November 2005 Tony Blair launches UK energy policy review. May 2006 Blair declares that failing to take action on the UK’s nuclear plants would be a “dereliction of duty”. July 2006 Government gives the green light to new nuclear power plants. The industry secretary, Alistair Darling, says the private sector will have to “initiate, fund, construct and operate” the nuclear plants. February 2007 The UK chief executive of French state-owned EDF says Britain will be cooking its Christmas turkeys on new nuclear power by 2017. August 2007 Safety checks begin on the EPR (European pressurised reactor) power plant design that will be used at Hinkley. January 2008 The government says the first new plant will be completed “well before 2020”. September 2008 EDF buys British Energy, a key player in the UK nuclear industry, for £12.5bn. October 2010 UK government names Hinkley Point as one of eight candidates for a new power station. October 2011 EDF submits 55,000-page planning application for Hinkley Point C. December 2011 First new reactor will not be operational until 2019, says government. November 2012 EDF awarded first new site licence for a UK nuclear power station in 25 years, at Hinkley Point. October 2013 Government announces subsidy deal for Hinkley Point, which will now not produce power until 2023, according to EDF. May 2014 European commission approves state aid for Hinkley Point and costs the plant at £24.5bn. October 2015 EDF signs Hinkley development deal with China General Nuclear Power Corporation, which will provide one-third of the cost, now estimated at £18bn. March 2016 Finance chief of EDF quits, amid fears Hinkley Point C could jeopardise the company’s financial position. EDF’s chief executive promises long-delayed final investment decision will be made soon. 28 July 2016 EDF decides to press ahead with building Hinkley Point C. But government takes everyone by surprise by postponing its final decision on the project until the early autumn. 15 September 2016 Theresa May finally gives £18bn project go-ahead, but adds “significant new safeguards” to ensure national security."
2016-09-15T16:21:13Z,uk-news,UK news,'It puts us on the map': Bridgwater business toasts Hinkley Point C,"Malcolm Pyne, butcher and entrepreneur, cracked open a bottle of bubbly at his store and takeaway in Bridgwater to celebrate the announcement. “This is fabulous news for the town and for Somerset. It really puts us on the map. I feel a bit tingly to be honest. We’ve been here before, thinking it’s going to happen but it really looks like this is it now. The lady [Theresa May] has spoken.”
Pyne and his wife, Julie, took a risk when proposals for a new power station at Hinkley Point emerged nearly a decade ago, and expanded from a high street shop into their current out-of-town store close to the M5, judging that north Somerset was set for a boom. They already supply local beef, pork and lamb to the existing site and are building a new meat-producing plant to cope with the extra demand Hinkley Point C will create. “We’ll also be increasing our staff from 40 to 60,” said Pyne. “Hinkley provides fantastic business opportunities.” The government’s announcement was largely welcomed on Thursday by Somerset council leaders, business bosses, schools and colleges. EDF says that over the 10 years of construction, 25,000 new “employment opportunities” will be created and at the peak there will be 5,600 people working at the site. It estimates that at any one time 900 people will be employed at Hinkley Point C during its 60 years of operation. It has been at pains to claim that wherever possible it will use local people and companies to build and operate the plant.
Duncan McGinty, the Conservative leader of Sedgemoor district council, said many of the new jobs would be well-paid and rewarding. “Hinkley Point C will be the UK’s largest engineering and construction project in modern times. This is a great opportunity,” he said. He accepted there would be some disruption as new infrastructure – roads, park and ride sites, accommodation blocks for workers – are built. He said action was being taken to make sure Hinkley did not leave other firms with a shortage of skilled workers, and plans to build new homes to try to prevent Bridgwater people from being displaced by new arrivals were on the drawing board. But he was convinced that the face of the town, long dismissed by many as second best to neighbouring Taunton, would improve. “There will be better shops, restaurants, hotels,” he said. Colliers International, a commercial property specialist, said the project was important not only to north Somerset but to the whole region, and could help create a new “south-west powerhouse”.
Tim Davies, head of the Bristol office, said: “Irrespective of whether you agree with nuclear power, the commercial benefits that the development will bring to the region cannot be underestimated. “What is needed now is for work at Hinkley Point C to get under way as soon as possible, as this will unlock extensive opportunities along the massive supply chain required, and will benefit sectors including construction, industrial, offices and hospitality.” The construction union Ucatt welcomed the government’s decision. Brian Rye, its acting general secretary, said: “The go-ahead was vital for construction, which desperately needed the confirmation of such a major project following a slowdown in the industry caused by the Brexit vote. It is also good news for the overall economy as it helps to guarantee the stability of our future energy supply. “The construction of Hinkley Point C will create 25,000 job opportunities over the lifetime of the project and during that time 1,000 construction apprentices will be created.” Of course, not everyone was wholly positive. Chris Morgan, a west Somerset councillor who lives in Stogursey, one of the villages closest to Hinkley Point, expressed not jubilation but relief. “It’s gone on so long we almost got to the point where we didn’t think it was going to happen,” he said. “People are very anxious around here. Some have moved away because of the plans; others are going to have years of upheaval while the construction takes place.”
Bridget Woodman, deputy director of the energy policy group at the University of Exeter, claimed the decision was a huge missed opportunity. She said: “The prime minister had a moment of common sense earlier in the summer when she realised that the viability of the project needed careful scrutiny, but in the end she has caved in to French and Chinese pressure to go ahead despite all the evidence stacking up that subsidising the station will cost electricity consumers billions of pounds over its lifetime, not to mention all the taxpayer underwriting for clearing up its radioactive waste when it stops operating. “This is a case of short-term politics winning out over the longer-term economic and environmental benefit of the nation. By going down the nuclear route, the prime minister has missed the opportunity to have a meaningful debate about the future development of the UK’s electricity system and the role that renewables and demand management can play in delivering cheaper, less environmentally damaging and more secure power than Hinkley Point.” Matilda King, 72, a retired civil servant, worried about possible disaster. “Look around here. All this – and all of us – could be gone if it does go bang.” she said. Allan Jeffrey, a former science teacher and a spokesperson for the campaign group Stop Hinkley, lives a few hundred metres from EDF’s visitor hub in the Angel Place shopping centre in Bridgwater. The front windows of his terraced house are adorned with anti-nuclear posters, the shelves inside heaving with files documenting Britain’s nuclear history. He summed up his reaction simply as “disappointed”, but remained convinced that the project would not go ahead in the end. “We’re told that nuclear power is safe but we’ve seen the devastating effects of accidents in Chernobyl and Japan,” he said. “This is old-fashioned technology when we should be investing in renewables.”"
2016-09-15T16:45:50Z,uk-news,UK news,East Finchley shooting: man and woman killed in north London,"A murder investigation has been launched after a 52-year-old woman and her 21-year-old nephew were shot dead in north London on Thursday morning. Paramedics from the London ambulance service called police to a road in East Finchley at 6.25am after responding to reports of two people with gunshot wounds. An LAS spokesperson said: “We sent three ambulance crews, an advanced paramedic and an incident response officer to the scene. We also dispatched London’s air ambulance.” Both victims were pronounced dead at the scene, Scotland Yard said. Police said there were no other injuries. Detectives from the Metropolitan police’s homicide and major crime command are investigating. There have been no arrests and police are appealing for witnesses. On Thursday afternoon, several dozen grieving relatives, friends and members of the wider Congolese community gathered by a police cordon on Elmshurst Crescent, a quiet council estate, to pay their respects to the people killed, who were named locally as Anny Basala Ekofo, a mother of nine, and Bervil Ekofo. Francine Ekofo said she understood that her brother had been asleep when he was shot. Her aunt was shot when she answered the door to the killers, she said, adding that it was a case of mistaken identity. “Apparently one of the family members was looking for somewhere to stay for the next few nights, because he knew something was going to happen,” she said, adding that this person had then disappeared. “A couple of days after that, this happened.” Francine Ekofo said her brother, a second-year psychology student at the University of West London, had never been in trouble, “not even in school”. Bervil Ekofo’s mother, Maymie Botanba, was also among the mourners by the cordon. “Where’s my son? Where’s my Bervil? Where’s my best friend,” she cried. A family friend among the mourners, who preferred not to be named, said Bervil Ekofo had been visiting his aunt and cousins when he was killed. The rest of the family were at the police station on Thursday, answering questions, she said. It is unclear how many people were at the property at the time.
“Bervil was not the target. Bervil just came to see them and unfortunately that’s what happened, but I really don’t know the rest,” she said. Many other family members were at home at the time, she said, most of whom had been taken to the police station, although others may have been in hospital. “Bervil’s dad, he’s in pieces, he can’t even talk,” she added. Catherine Moffitt, 56, a neighbour, described what she saw just before 6.30am. “About 12 cars were down this morning, about two ambulances, police running down the road with their blue gloves on. Some people did hear gunshots, but I didn’t,” she said. “I thought we were under siege, I really did. This has never happened down this road, it’s a lovely, little, quiet estate.” Throughout the day, mourners sat or stood near the cordon, talking, crying and comforting one another. Another family friend, who gave his name as Dominic, said Anny Basala Ekofo would have been getting ready to go shopping at the market, as she did every Thursday. Esperance Luhymber, 50, said Anny Basala Ekofo, who had seven sons and two daughters, came to live in Britain 26 years ago. “She was a very, very nice lady,” she said. “Calm, doesn’t talk too much.” At 3pm, news spread among those assembled that the coroner had arrived to take away the bodies of the victims. They gathered at the edge of the cordon as the plain, black van pulled up to the entrance to the block. Before officials could begin their work, Anny Basala Ekofo’s sister and Botanba rushed through the cordon to try to get closer to their loved ones, only to be intercepted by police. “Basala, Basala, wake up,” cried her sister. More family members came forward to comfort them as officers formed a line to prevent the mourners from advancing any further. The crowd stayed to watch as the bodies were taken from the block. Asked why they remained, Bridget Lita, 50, who grew up in the same village as Anny Basala Ekofo in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, said: “It’s our culture. To us, she’s our sister.”"
2016-09-15T17:00:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Police spy accused of urging anti-racist activists to commit arson,"An undercover police officer who spied on anti-racist groups has been accused of attempting to incite two political activists to set fire to a charity shop that was allegedly operated as a fascist front. Two anti-fascist activists claim the undercover officer – who adopted the fake identity of Carlo Neri to infiltrate leftwing campaign groups for four years – suggested the idea at a New Year’s Eve party they were attending. Joe Batty, one of the activists, said Neri had proposed that they go and see the charity shop, which was a few minutes’ walk away in London. He said that he and his fellow activists had been drinking, but Neri less so. He said a group went round to see the shop and then returned to the party at Neri’s home. According to Batty, Neri then made the suggestion in an indirect way. “He said something along the lines of ‘it would be unfortunate if it was set alight’, or something like that. It was leading the horses to water to see if they would drink.” Batty, a social worker, said he believed Neri was fishing around to see who in the group might take an interest in the idea. He said he had grown close to Neri, who had often said he felt strongly about the 1980 bombing of Bologna railway station, in which 85 people were killed, claiming that his parents came from that region of Italy. The charity shop was run by an Italian fascist who had fled to London and been convicted in his absence of being a member of a group implicated in the Bologna bombing.
Dan Gilman, another anti-fascist activist befriended by Neri, said that shortly after the New Year’s Eve party, Neri raised the suggestion again. “There was definitely talk of a petrol bomb from him,” he said. He said he and Batty had been in a car that the undercover spy had driven past the charity shop. According to Gilman, Neri said this was to “show us how to do what had been talked about”. Batty and Gilman, a teacher, said they would not have set fire to the shop because they reject all forms of terrorism. The activists make their allegations in a new edition of a book that is published on Friday. Their claims raise further questions about the conduct of the undercover officers sent to infiltrate hundreds of political groups since 1968. Other s have also been accused of acting as agents provocateurs, despite police rules forbidding such behaviour. The activities of the more than 100 undercover officers are due to be examined by a public inquiry led by Lord Justice Pitchford. The inquiry will examine revelations that the spies gathered intelligence on grieving families, deceived women into long-term relationships and hid evidence in court cases. The spy pretending to be Neri was exposed this year after it was revealed that while he was undercover, pretending to be a leftwing campaigner, he had a two-year relationship with a woman. She claims he asked her to marry him – a proposal she accepted – and told her that he wanted a baby with her. He did not tell her that he already had a wife and child and was working undercover to spy on her and her friends. Neri started his mission to infiltrate anti-racist campaign groups and the Socialist party in 2001. He asked the woman to marry him at the same New Year’s Eve party, to celebrate the start of 2003, at which he allegedly raised the idea of an attack on the charity shop. The Metropolitan police said they maintained their position of neither confirming nor denying if an individual had worked undercover.
They added that the deployment of the undercover officers “will be subject to the most intrusive scrutiny by the ongoing public inquiry into undercover policing. Lord Justice Pitchford has clearly set out how interested parties can give evidence to the inquiry. The Metropolitan police service is and will continue to cooperate fully with the inquiry.”. The Met added that it would encourage anyone who alleged that an undercover officer had sought to encourage others to break the law to report their concerns to the internal police inquiry, known as Operation Herne. The updated book – Blacklisted: The Secret War between Big Business and Union Activists, by Phil Chamberlain and Dave Smith – describes how major firms denied work to thousands of trade unionists, and examines allegations that police secretly shared intelligence with the firms. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP who has highlighted allegations in parliament that Bob Lambert, another undercover officer, set fire to a Debenhams store, said: “Carlo Neri, just like every other undercover officer who has deceived his way into personal and political relationships, was presumably following orders and it’s vital that, as well as preventing such fundamental abuses of basic rights from happening in future, all those responsible are brought to justice.” If you would like to pass on any confidential information, you can send a message via the Guardian’s SecureDrop service (see how here and here)."
2016-09-15T18:13:50Z,uk-news,UK news,UK immigration and asylum tribunal fees to rise by 500%,"The government is to press ahead with increases of up to 500% in court fees for immigration and asylum cases, despite a consultation in which all but five of 147 responses opposed the move. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) confirmed the decision on Thursday, saying it was grateful for the responses to the consultation, but the policy remained that, where fees were charged to access public services, they should be set at such a level to recover the full cost. The decision means that fees for an application to the first-tier tribunal dealing with immigration and asylum cases will increase from £80 to £490 for “a decision on the papers,” and from £140 to £800 for an oral hearing. Fees are to be introduced for the first time for appeals to the upper tribunal: £350 for applications and £510 for the appeal hearing. The ministry’s response to the consultation estimates that the charges will raise £34m a year on top of the £7m brought in annually by existing fees. This compares with estimated annual running costs of £86m for both tribunals. Ministers have made one concession as a result of the consultation. Immigration and asylum applicants who have already been assessed as destitute by the Home Office will not have to pay the tribunal fees. Existing exemptions, such as for those on asylum support or people who already qualify for legal aid, will continue to apply. The Law Centres Network said the rises were disgraceful and meant that asylum seekers faced “whopping” fees. The Public and Commercial Services Union said: “It is utterly reprehensible that this government is pressing ahead with a 500% increase in tribunal fees, despite overwhelming opposition from law firms, judges, professional bodies, charities and unions.” But the MoJ said the fee increases would secure the funding of immigration and asylum tribunals, while “protecting access to justice and the most vulnerable appellants through extension of the fee exemption scheme”. The fee increases for first-tier tribunals were to be implemented as soon as possible, followed by those for the upper tribunal. A separate MoJ consultation paper, titled transforming our justice system, published on Thursday, contains a commitment to continue the former justice secretary Michael Gove’s programme of introducing US-style problem-solving courts. “We are exploring the opportunities for problem-solving methods further with the judiciary and collecting the evidence base,” it said. “We are continuing to trial this approach in locations across the UK.”However, the paper was coupled with an announcement that two more magistrates courts in London, Hammersmith and Camberwell Green, were to close. The Labour MP and former justice minister Andy Slaughter said the closure of the Hammersmith court would “increase the travel and waiting times for users who will now have to travel to magistrates courts on the other side of London, something that is particularly troubling for those on modest means and those with reduced mobility”. However, the MoJ’s initiative to allow victims and witnesses to provide cross-examinations that were pre-recorded outside court was welcomed by Citizens Advice. “For victims and witnesses of crime, giving evidence in court can be a daunting experience,” said the Citizens Advice chief executive, Gillian Guy. “Some witnesses are understandably anxious about the prospect of attending court in person and going through cross-examination. Reliving what may have been a traumatic event in front of the defendant as well as the judiciary can be particularly stressful, especially for victims of crime.”"
2016-09-15T18:26:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Going underground: Crossrail's tunnels open to public in Open House weekend,"The giant tunnels of the Crossrail project in London are already feats of global engineering history and, this weekend, the public will have the rare chance to see the subterranean spectacle before the service becomes operational in 2018. Seven different sites, including Canary Wharf, Bond Street and Tottenham Court Road will be open to 900 members of the public as part of the annual Open House architecture event. Like many of the perennial favourites, including No 10 Downing Street, tickets for Crossrail have long been booked out but those lucky enough to get access will be in for an adventure as they travel around 40 metres below the capital. At Tottenham Court Road, visitors will be taken behind the hoardings of the £15bn railways project and descend into the Goslett Yard Box worksite. They will be allowed to walk along the curved platform in Crossrail’s central section stations as far as the Dean Street escalator incline, 24 metres below the streets of Soho, before returning via the eastbound platform.
Now in its 24th year, Open House provides free access to more than 750 buildings in the capital with 140 new entries for 2016. Classics in this year’s lineup include Crossness, in Abbey Wood, south-east London – an overground sewage pumping station dubbed “cathedral on the marshes” because of its ornate interior. Sir Joseph Bazalgette’s Victorian gem is renowned for its ornate ironwork but it is the four steam-powered beam engines which attracted engineering pilgrims when it first opened in 1865. Organisers expect 250,000 people to participate in the event and warn of queues at famous buildings including George Gilbert Scott’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Gherkin and the Brutalist Trellick Tower in west London. Architecture aficionados can get a glimpse of how the masters work in architect Lord Richard Rogers’ studios on the 14th floor of the Cheesegrater, while fellow octogenarian Lord Foster is inviting the public to his workshop in Wandsworth. With 29 boroughs participating, there will be a wide variety of options available, with many private homeowners willing to give access to architect-design conversions, extensions and new builds.
Among those exciting organisers most this year are architect Jonathan Tuckey’s The Yard House in Lordship Lane in Southwark, with its corrugated roof and glazing; Folds House in Haringey, with its stark zig zag walls; or the more modest Canopy House extension in Stoke Newington with a cantilevered roof. Four Stirling Prize winners, including an all-girls’ school in Wandsworth, are on show, while new housing schemes including Silchester Estate in Kensington and Chelsea and Darbishire Place in Tower Hamlets show how architects and developers are addressing the housing crisis. Other buildings taking part include the Argentinian ambassador’s residence in Westminster, the Royal Albert Hall, the Olympic Park, a yurt in a garden in north London and access to Deephams sewage works near Picketts Lock, Edmonton, and a recycling plant in Peckham. London’s deputy mayor for planning Jules Pipe, who launched the event at Richard Rogers’ offices in the Cheesegrater, said the it chimed with mayor Sadiq Khan’s aims to make London one of the most equitable cities in the world. The former Hackney mayor cited stories of primary schoolchildren being taken to City Hall and saying things like “I never thought I would be allowed into a building like this.” This type of experience was “transformative”, he said."
2016-09-15T18:31:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Sean Rigg: CPS rules out charges against police over station death,"The Crown Prosecution Service will not prosecute any officers in relation to the death of Sean Rigg in custody in 2008. The CPS told the Independent Police Complaints Commission it had determined there was not enough evidence to charge any of the officers involved in Rigg’s arrest, restraint and detention. Rigg, 40, died on 21 August 2008 at Brixton police station. In 2013 an inquest jury found police actions had contributed to Rigg’s death, after he was held down in a V shape in a prone position for eight minutes, despite it taking 30 seconds to handcuff him. During the restraint he was placed face down, with his legs bent back, in a caged footwell of a police van. A CPS spokesperson said on Thursday there was “insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against the arresting officers” for offences relating to Rigg’s death. “Of the five officers referred to us by the IPCC, one, Paul White, is facing trial for perjury relating to evidence he gave at Mr Rigg’s inquest,” the spokesperson added. The campaign group Inquest, speaking on behalf of Rigg’s family, said the decision was “deeply disappointing”. Rigg’s sister, Marcia, said: “After a damning review of the original IPCC investigation, and a successful challenge of the decision not to prosecute an officer for perjury, I had hoped for an opportunity to get justice.” Daniel Machover, the solicitor for the Rigg family, said: “There are some serious concerns about the legal basis of the CPS decision today. The family will now urgently consider reviewing it under the victims’ right of review.” The Metropolitan police welcomed the decision and said possible misconduct proceedings would be considered in due course. The force said it was aware that both the Rigg family and the officers involved were frustrated at the length of time it had taken to establish the circumstances surrounding Rigg’s death. “The MPS shares this frustration,” it said in a statement. “The delays have been beyond the MPS’s control and have fully cooperated at every stage of the process. “There has been much speculation about what took place on the night that Mr Rigg died and it remains a priority that the ongoing process is thorough and based on all the available evidence to fully establish the facts.” Rigg, a musician who had paranoid schizophrenia, had been living in a south London hostel. Police were called after he allegedly smashed a gazebo and made karate moves that staff regarded as threatening."
2016-09-15T18:32:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Food Standards Scotland defends Errington Cheese ban,"The Scottish food safety agency has insisted it has strong scientific evidence linking a cheesemaker with an E coli outbreak which has affected at least 22 people and led to the death of a three-year-old girl. Food Standards Scotland (FSS) denied charges from one of the UK’s leading bacteriologists, Professor Sir Hugh Pennington, that its decision on Wednesday to ban the sale of all six brands from Errington Cheese had been heavy-handed. In a detailed defence of its conduct, the agency said it had established that 15 of those who fell ill in July and since had eaten the Dunsyre Blue cheese that first sparked the food scare, while four others had eaten an unspecified type of blue cheese. “Errington Cheese Ltd has publically commented that E coli O157 has not been found in its cheese,” it said. “This is inaccurate. Some samples have tested positive for E coli O157 and for another [non-O157] strain of E coli. These organisms are considered a serious risk to public health.” Its latest tests, which followed discoveries at the weekend that Errington’s Lanark White had traces of E coli O157, found either the bug or the potentially lethal shiga toxin which E coli O157 produces, in three batches of Dunsyre Blue, which is also packaged and sold as Dunsyre Baby, and two batches of Lanark White. Only two of those five batches were on sale. It admitted that laboratory tests on traces of E coli O157 in one of the two cheeses which were on sale did not produce the shiga toxin, but it insisted the bug was still potentially dangerous. The FSS did not publish any evidence that the other Errington cheeses it has banned – Lanark Blue, Maisie’s Kebbuck and Cora Linn – had E coli contamination. It implied they were taken off the shelves because it had strong doubts about the safety of the company’s production methods as a whole. Errington, a Scottish pioneer of the move to produce small batch, artisancheeses in the 1980s and 1990s, has insisted its own rigorous testing of its cheeses, both before and after the E coli cases came to light, had found no traces of the bug. The FSS, however, said it was “not satisfied that the controls and production methods used by the business are producing safe food. “Furthermore, the reliance on a limited number of negative test results as evidence that the food is safe provides insufficient assurance, as it is clear that multiple samples across different cheese batches have had positive results.” Errington said the FSS ban may well force the firm to close. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland on Thursday, Pennington said he had serious misgivings about the FSS decision to ban every Errington product and questioned its scientific evidence. “The question here I think is: have they gone too far in overinterpreting scientific evidence? And yeah, I think that’s a real possibility.” The FSS said its actions were entirely justified. In an indirect criticism of Pennington, it said it had only released basic information where it was in the public interest to do so. “FSS is fully aware of the impact on the business, but its priority is to protect public health. [It] would not be appropriate to conduct an ongoing food safety investigation through the media,” it said."
2016-09-15T19:00:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May accused of avoiding security and cost issues of Hinkley,"Theresa May was accused of backing down on security concerns about Chinese involvement in nuclear power and failing to drive a better deal for taxpayers, following the announcement on Thursday on building the £18bn Hinkley Point C plant. May’s surprise decision to review the first planned nuclear power station for a generation when she arrived in Downing Street had been regarded as marking a break with George Osborne’s enthusiastic courtship of China, and a greater willingness to take on big business. But after the Chinese ambassador publicly raised concerns about future trading relationships if Britain pulled the plug on the deal, May gave the go-ahead. On Thursday Vince Cable, the former Liberal Democrat business secretary, said that the prime minister had ducked an opportunity to revisit the economics of the Hinkley contract – which will entail the Treasury promising a guaranteed floor price for the electricity generated, paid for through householders’ bills, over the reactor’s lifetime.
“Over the last few weeks we have been marched up the hill and back here,” Cable said. “Maybe she just wanted to demonstrate that this had her fingerprints on it.The biggest issues around Hinkley are the price, and the technology, and those remain unchanged. The big question is about the economics of it, and that is still unresolved, and worrying.” The government has guaranteed a price of £92.50 to EDF for every megawatt hour of electricity generated, despite concerns that that is more than double the current market rate. Cable called for May to take a tougher approach to other looming infrastructure decisions, including the proposed third runway at Heathrow, and the HS2 high-speed rail project. “There are problems with each of the three Hs,” he said. The government insisted the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset was being approved with “significant new safeguards” to make sure China and other foreign investors could not own stakes in British nuclear plants without UK government approval. However, Labour and environmental groups described the new security measures as mere “window dressing” and “hot air”, which would change very little about the project, since the price would remain the same and the power to block mergers on security grounds already existed in law. Under the new proposals, EDF, the French firm building the plant with a £6bn investment from a Chinese-state nuclear firm, will not be able to sell on its ownership without permission. For future projects, the UK government will own a “special share” that means it will have a veto over owners if there are national security concerns. But in a signal that the requirements may not be very stringent, both EDF and China General Nuclear (CGN) said they were delighted by the approval, which they claimed would let them proceed with Hinkley and their wider plans for nuclear construction in the UK.
The shadow energy secretary, Barry Gardiner, said the government had “backed down with a whimper” over its security concerns about Chinese involvement, saying it had announced “new powers they already possess”. He told Greg Clark, the business secretary: “They have claimed they introduced significant new safeguards into this package. The secretary of state already has such powers. Will the secretary of state acknowledge that he can prevent the sale of any element of critical infrastructure?” John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said the government’s review seemed “to have been a lot of hot air”. The Chinese are particularly keen to proceed with a new nuclear plant at Bradwell in Essex because it will be their own design built under the UK’s tough safety regulations, allowing the company to use it as a showcase to the rest of the world. CGN sources indicated they hoped to submit their formal plans for approval this autumn. “We are now able to move forward and deliver much-needed nuclear capacity at Hinkley Point, Sizewell and Bradwell with our strategic partners, EDF, and provide the UK with safe, reliable and sustainable low-carbon energy,” CGN said. “CGN and EDF have worked together in close cooperation for decades and this has laid a solid foundation for these three new nuclear projects. CGN looks forward to leveraging its 30 years’ experience in nuclear construction and operation and playing an important role in meeting the UK’s future energy needs.” Clark said the new security restrictions were an improvement, claiming EDF would have otherwise been at liberty to sell its stake on. His department for business, energy and industrial strategy confirmed that this was the only new security requirement for Hinkley to proceed. Before an announcement in the Commons, Clark said: “Britain needs to upgrade its supplies of energy, and we have always been clear that nuclear is an important part of ensuring our future low-carbon energy security.” The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, tweeted that it was excellent news that the Hinkley project was going ahead and that it would be a boost for jobs in France. Michel Sapin, the French finance and economy minister, said it was an “undeniable success for French industry” and would be “a big contribution to supporting employment in France”.
Jean-Bernard Lévy, chief executive of EDF group, said: “The decision of the British government to approve the construction of Hinkley Point C marks the relaunch of nuclear in Europe.”"
2016-09-15T19:05:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Think Hinkley is an expensive white elephant? Not compared with HS2 | Nils Pratley,"It was a good day to query the government’s use of flimsy statistics to justify massive infrastructure projects. After Hinkley, we’re on to Heathrow’s third runway and HS2 – and Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, is unhappy on both fronts. On airports, he still hasn’t had a reply to five requests for more detailed disclosures of the assumptions used in the Airports Commission’s final report. But his bigger beef is with the high-speed railway. “HS2 has the weakest economic case of all the projects within the infrastructure programme, yet it is being pushed through with the most enthusiasm,” he says. He’s right. What’s more, the cost of HS2 almost puts the other two in the shade. Hinkley and Heathrow are both £18bn projects, or thereabouts. HS2 is a £42.5bn or £55bn adventure, depending on whose numbers you prefer, and could be hurtling towards £70bn or £80bn by the time incidentals, like new trains, are included. The case for review ought to be overwhelming. The momentum behind HS2, however, seems strong now that Chris Grayling, the new transport secretary, has come out in favour. Like some of his predecessors, Grayling has given up justifying HS2 on grounds of speed and instead relies on the argument that more capacity is needed, especially on the west coast mainline. But then Grayling makes the leap that any new capacity must automatically be of the high-speed variety. “Of course it makes sense, if we’re going to build a new railway line, for it to be a fast railway line, to reduce travel times from north to south,” he said in July. “That’s logical.”
Is it really, though? Has the government approached the cost-benefit analysis with an open mind? A House of Lords committee last year urged the government to review options involving lower speeds, and Tyrie wants to see something similar. “The question of whether it is possible to improve capacity at lower speed and, consequently, at a lower cost, has not been comprehensively examined,” he told Grayling yesterday. It should be examined. So should smaller-scale enhancements of the road and railway networks that could deliver benefits more quickly. With Hinkley, prime minister Theresa May paused for thought and then failed, it seems, to consider costs. She must do better with HS2. Choppy waters jolt Next’s even keel For once, Lord Wolfson’s ingrained caution was fully justified. Next’s chief executive warned of tough trading conditions in his last City outing, and he was correct. Sales at Next rose 2.6% to £1.96bn in the six months to July, but pre-tax profits fell 1.5% to £342m. The punters come out for cut-price sales but it is harder to persuade them to buy new clothes at full price. In the circumstances, the 5% fall in the share price was understandable. Note, however, that Wolfson, who is admirably strict in providing forecasts of profits for the full year, didn’t tweak his projections one jot. He’s still expecting the final quarter to be strong compared with a year ago, when the country was basking in winter sunshine. That should serve as a reminder that the post-Brexit fall in sterling, though important for clothing retailers, is not the whole story. Next’s shares, at a shade under £50, trade at about 11 times earnings and carry a 3% dividend yield. Not bad for a company that hasn’t gone seriously off the rails for a couple of decades. Juncker talks the talk over Barroso’s Goldman affair “Personally I do not have a problem with him working for a private bank – but maybe not this bank,” says European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, getting himself deeper into the row over predecessor José Manuel Barroso’s choice of Goldman Sachs as new employer. Loathing Goldman, as an icon of Wall Street’s power and greed, is a popular sport, and not only in Europe. But let’s hear Juncker’s definition of an unsuitable bank for a former Brussels bureaucrat. Goldman, says Juncker, was “one of the organisations that knowingly or unknowingly contributed to the enormous financial crisis we had between 2007 and 2009”.
But dozens of banks could fit that description – certainly those that originated US sub-prime mortgages. Goldman, as it happens, did little origination, although it was up to its neck in the securitisation of financial junk. Should all banks in the sub-prime game be ruled offside? If so, shouldn’t the commission have drawn up a blacklist, which would include several European firms? Juncker has booted the Barroso affair to the commission’s ethics committee, but it’s hard to believe he intends to apply any actual sanctions. It would oblige him to draw up a few rules, which is harder than making airy statements."
2016-09-15T19:58:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan's planning incentives for more London affordable homes,"Bit by bit, Sadiq Khan’s formula for changing London’s housing landscape is coming into view. A little more was sketched in on Wednesday. Answering questions from Labour AM Tom Copley about his long-term goal of making 50% of all new homes in London “genuinely affordable”, Khan, as is now his habit, warned that “we won’t fix the housing crisis overnight” but went on: “I’m going to raise the level of affordable housing by using my planning powers alongside investing the funding available and the release of public land. In terms of planning, my team are currently developing supplementary planning guidance – SPG – to increase the numbers of affordable homes delivered through the planning system.” We’ve already seen him exercise those planning powers. Last month, Khan approved plans for the first large housing development on the vast Old Oak and Park Royal site in west London after the number of “affordable” homes was bumped up from 200 to 242 – from 33% of the total of 605 to 40%, with the possibility of raising that to 50% if sufficient profits are produced in the future. More recently, to the east, he approved the masterplan for the huge Barking Riverside regeneration after the “affordable” proportion of the possible 10,000 new homes there was upped from 28% to 35%. Provision for a possible subsequent hike to 50% is built in there too. Those were substantial tweaks to big bits of London housing arithmetic that had been lined up for a big tick from Boris Johnson. But it’s the draft SPG, expected in October, that will formally set the tone of the new mayoral administration on housing delivery. Khan explained that it has to be written “within the context of the policies in the current London Plan”, the legally-binding master policy blueprint for the development of the capital’s land. He intends to change the Plan, but acknowledged he’ll be bound by the present version “for the foreseeable future”, which could mean three years - that’s how long it took Johnson to produce a replacement for Ken Livingstone’s. Khan said that this constraint means “I cannot set a target for affordable housing”. This might come as a surprise - there have been reports that a 35% affordable “benchmark” for all new private housing schemes could be included in the SPG. But a target and a benchmark are not the same. Khan said that in drafting the SPG he was “exploring an innovative new approach, whereby if applicants voluntarily meet an agreed level of affordable housing, they could benefit from a faster and more certain planning process”. He stressed that “this level has not been finalized or announced”, though 35% seems unlikely to be far wide of the mark. But the operative word in all of this seems to be “voluntarily”. SPGs do not (and cannot) introduce new planning policies, but they serve to elaborate on or sharpen existing ones. The current London Plan policy on affordable housing requires only the “maximum reasonable” to be supplied as part of each individual private development. Khan is hoping to incentivise developers to maximise what they deem “reasonable” by effectively telling them that if they are prepared to meet the affordable level he sets down in the SPG, he will help to speed them on their way. Copley asked if this therefore meant that developers who didn’t accept the “affordable” housing levels he had in mind would find their assessments of a scheme’s financial viability coming under close scrutiny from him. Khan’s response? “Not an unfair summary of where we’re going”. A team of viability boffins is being recruited for such tasks. City Hall later elaborated: “Developers may opt to meet new minimum affordable housing thresholds to fast-track their applications”. So for “benchmark” read “thresholds” (the plural may or may not be significant. I’m told there’s still a bit of a fine-tuning to be done). The other angle on all this is that Khan’s affordable levels/thresholds are being designed to bring more clarity, speed and consistency to the planning application process. Recent controversies over viability assessments - in Earls Court and Southwark, for example - have centred on concerns that well-resourced developers get the better of boroughs in negotiations over the amount of affordable housing they supply as part of the deal. Yet some developers say that they could do without the grief viability wrangles entail. So there’s a trade-off to be proffered brewing here: in return for higher affordable yields Khan will provide a more straightforward planning environment and preferential treatment for the obliging. There is a long way to go before that 50% goal starts to be met. For example, Khan confirmed to Copley that doing so is going to mean hitting more than 50% affordable on publicly-owned land, such as TfL’s - no small task. But be glad. What we’re seeing the start of in Khan’s City Hall is a more rigorous approach to property market regulation, which is what planning policy is for. His Tory critics warn that it can only make things worse, but Khan hopes he’s got the key players onside. Their responses to the SPG will be enlightening."
2016-09-15T23:01:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Full uptake of cervical cancer screening could save hundreds of lives,"Hundreds more women’s lives could be saved every year if every woman invited to come for NHS cervical cancer screening turned up at their appointment, experts in the disease have revealed. New research has found that screening for cervical cancer is so effective that it prevents an estimated 1,827 deaths a year from it in England alone. However, if all women aged between 25 and 64 who were invited for screening attended, an extra 347 deaths a year there – almost half the 2014 total of 726 in England – could be avoided, researchers said. The study, published in the British Journal of Cancer, is the first of its kind to establish the impact that screening has had on deaths from the disease by examining screening information from women who have been diagnosed with it.
“Thousands of women in the UK are alive and healthy today thanks to cervical screening,” said Prof Peter Sasieni, the lead researcher, who is based at Queen Mary University of London. “The cervical screening programme already prevents thousands of cancers each year and as it continues to improve, by testing all samples for the human papilloma virus, even more women are likely to avoid this disease,” he added. Sasieni and his team reached their conclusions after studying the records of more than 11,000 women in England who had been diagnosed with the disease. Women aged 50 to 64 who come for screening, usually at a GP’s surgery, benefit the most. There would be five times more women of that age dying from cervical cancer if screening did not exist. Screening for cervical cancer was introduced across the UK in 1988. Women aged 25-49 are invited to come every three years and those aged 50 to 64 every five years, though in Scotland it is offered to females aged between 20 and 60. But there is concern that the falling numbers of women attending screening appointments may leave some at risk. Overall, between 70% and 73% of all eligible women turn up and the numbers have been falling since the surge in attendance sparked by the death of the reality-TV star Jade Goody from the disease in 2009. Dr Anne Mackie, Public Health England’s director of screening, said: “It is of concern that a smaller proportion of women are being screened. This is particularly evident in younger women, with 63.5% of women under 30 being screened every three years. “We are working hard to address this with academics and local services to investigate and use new ways of improving screening uptake among younger women,.” The latest data for England showed that 73.5% of eligible women came to cervical screening appointments in 2014-15, down from the 74.2% seen the year before, added Mackie. Nicola Smith, a senior health information officer at Cancer Research UK, said discomfort and embarrassment deterred some women from attending. “Most women who are invited for cervical screening do take up the offer but it is a personal choice. Cervical screening saves many lives but no test is perfect and treatment for abnormal cells can have risks. “If you have concerns about the procedure, for example you find it uncomfortable, it’s a good idea to speak to the practice nurse as there may be things they can do to make you more comfortable. “Some women may be embarrassed by the test but nurses do tests like this all the time so there’s no need to be worried and you can ask to see a female doctor if you’d prefer,” said Smith. Older women may not see the point of coming, Smith added. “Older women may not think this type of screening is relevant to them, but while cervical cancer is unusual in that it affects women at younger ages than most cancers, older women also develop the disease”, she said."
2016-09-16T04:21:10Z,uk-news,UK news,UK's 'China-phobia' spells trouble despite Hinkley decision – Chinese media,"Theresa May’s approval of the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant saved UK-China relations from being “tossed into uncertainty” but London’s “China-phobia” could still spell trouble for the partnership, Beijing’s official news agency has warned. In an opinion piece on Friday, Xinhua celebrated the decision to move ahead with the £18bn project which was unexpectedly placed under review because of what the state-run agency dismissed as “some fictitious ‘national security’ concerns about Chinese investment”. Xinhua said Hinkely C’s approval would mean the creation of 25,000 jobs and would help “provide a vital solution to [Britain’s] electricity needs”.
“But let us not forget that the program, despite its various benefits for all parties, was once on the brink of being killed by groundless worries that China’s investment would be a threat to Britain’s national security,” the Communist party-controlled news agency added. “Had the program gone under, all sides were to lose dearly, while China-Britain relations could have been tossed into uncertainty.” Xinhua said the prime minister’s first major strategic decision had brought the so-called “golden era” of UK-China relations, negotiated under David Cameron, back from the brink – for now. “However, in spite of the approval, China-phobia sentiments continue to hover and could possibly introduce more troubles as construction of the project gets underway,” warned the commentary, written by journalist Liu Chang. Xinhua voiced concern about the introduction of “significant new safeguards” for future foreign investment in critical infrastructure. Those measures, it argued, were the result of nonsensical “misgivings” held by Theresa May about a possible threat posed by China to Britain’s national security. “[Her] remarks reflect a fact that some westerners still harbour strong misunderstandings of China,” Xinhua said, adding: “Let us hope that London quits its China-phobia and works with Beijing to ensure the project’s smooth development.” Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for China’s ministry of foreign affairs, struck a more diplomatic tone. “The Chinese side welcomes the British government’s decision to approve the project, as it serves all parties’ interests,” Hua said in a brief statement. “It is hoped that with the hard work of China, the UK and France, Hinkley Point and other subsequent nuclear cooperation projects can proceed smoothly and produce win-win results.” Those comments were a reminder of the importance Beijing attaches to still being able to build a Chinese-designed nuclear plant at Bradwell in Essex. China hopes to use that project as a shop window to promote its nuclear technology around the world and experts believe the future of relations between London and Beijing will hinge on its fate. On Friday, the Guangming Daily, a leading party newspaper, said the Hinkely go-ahead had “great significance” for the advance of Chinese nuclear technology into Europe, “and even the world.” But it cautioned that the new rules on foreign investment in critical infrastructure meant it was now likely that the agreement to build Bradwell would be renegotiated. The China Daily, an English-language mouthpiece, painted the Hinkley decision as a triumph for Theresa May. “May has managed a good deal – she has managed to satisfy her domestic critics, satisfy her own cautious nature, and keep the Chinese on side,” one government official, who declined to be named, told the Beijing-run newspaper.

2016-09-16T09:28:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Ben Needham's mother told toddler may have been crushed by digger,"The mother of missing toddler Ben Needham says she has been told by British investigators that her son may have been crushed to death by a digger. South Yorkshire police confirmed its officers planned to return to the Greek Island of Kos, where the 21-month-old went missing in 1991, to excavate two sites after fresh leads. Kerry Needham, Ben’s mother, who has held on to hope for the past 25 years that her son may be alive, told the Daily Mirror police have been told a now-deceased digger driver accidentally ran over Ben.A witness has told police that his friend, Konstantinos Barkas, who died of stomach cancer last year, was responsible for the death. Needham told the newspaper: “What they had to tell me was the last thing they would have ever wanted to. They think my Ben could be dead and buried. They are no longer looking for a missing person. How do I cope with that? My mother’s instinct has always told me he was alive. What if I’ve been wrong all this time? “I have spent all these years desperately hoping for that fairytale ending and for Ben to walk through that door. Now the horrible reality is Ben could be dead and he could have been dead all these years.” Around the time of Ben’s disappearance, Barkas had been clearing entrances in his digger for a new property nearby. Before his death, he confirmed he had given a statement to police but reportedly did not mention the two areas of land police are now intending to search. Needham went on: “A new witness had come forward and given information about a friend of his who had recently died. The information was there had been an accident that day with the JCB which was working in the area and his friend who was driving it. They have got two areas of land to search. One is in the vicinity of the farmhouse where he went missing, the other I don’t know.” Forensics teams are reportedly set to begin excavating at two sites close to where Ben, from Sheffield, was last seen as he played near his grandparents’ home on the Greek island.
Needham said a dig at the site in 2012 was carried out in an attempt to rule out that an accident had taken place and move the investigation on as a missing person’s inquiry. However, in light of the latest possible breakthrough, she thinks detectives suspect an accident may have taken place. South Yorkshire police made a direct appeal through Greek media in May. The force said officers would travel to Kos in the coming weeks to follow up the new lines of inquiry. A Greek media appeal made by officers in May prompted the latest leads, which have been investigated over the past three months. DS Matt Fenwick, leading the investigation, said: “There will be planned operational activity at two locations on the island that have been identified as areas of interest to the investigation. “We continue to keep an open mind and have updated Ben’s family about certain lines of enquiry we’re currently exploring. A dedicated policing team continues to work extremely hard to find answers for his family and keep them fully informed and supported throughout the investigation.” Over the years there have been several reported sightings of Ben and a range of theories about what happened to the youngster. A number of potential new leads emerged since the appeal in May, including a claim by a man who said he could be Ben. On the day of his disappearance, Ben was being supervised by his grandparents in the village of Iraklise while his mother went to work at a local hotel. Ben was playing in and around the house, which the family was renovating when, at about 2.30pm, they realised he was missing. His disappearance sparked an international missing person’s hunt that dominated headlines."
2016-09-16T10:36:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Jury considering its verdict in Jalal Uddin murder trial,"Jurors have begun deliberating over their verdicts in the murder trial of an alleged Islamic State fanatic accused of killing a respected imam in Greater Manchester. Mohammed Syeedy, 21, has been charged with the murder or manslaughter of Jalal Uddin, 71, an Islamic scholar in Rochdale. The prosecution allege that Syeedy and his alleged accomplice, Mohammed Abdul Kadir, 24, murdered Uddin because he practised a form of Islamic spiritual healing. Uddin used healing amulets, known as taweez, as part of an ancient Islamic ritual designed to cure people of ill health and ward off evil spirits. Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, told jurors that Syeedy and Kadir were Isis supporters who believed Uddin practiced “black magic” and deserved the ultimate punishment. The former imam was bludgeoned to death with a hammer as he walked through a children’s playground on his way home from a mosque on 18 February. It is alleged that Syeedy and Kadir stalked Uddin through the streets of Rochdale before Kadir launched the brutal attack, which left the 71-year-old with fatal skull fractures. The jury at Manchester crown court has been told that Kadir fled to Istanbul in Turkey three days after the attack and is on the run from counter-terrorism police. The prosecution alleges that Syeedy and his friends, who are not on trial, surveilled Uddin for 18 months after learning he practised taweez. They initially planned to get the Bangladeshi scholar deported, the court has heard, but that tactic later took a sinister turn. Syeedy, a former Manchester United steward, denies murder and manslaughter. The electrical engineering student insists he did not know that Kadir planned to attack Uddin. Syeedy has told jurors that he followed Uddin in his car, with Kadir in the passenger seat, so that his alleged accomplice could get a taweez from him. The 21-year-old, from Rochdale, also denied supporting Isis and described the terrorist group’s actions as “completely wrong”."
2016-09-16T13:43:48Z,uk-news,UK news,UK troops condemned over drowning of Iraqi boy forced into canal,"British soldiers who forced a 15-year-old Iraqi boy into a canal and watched him drown after the 2003 invasion of the country have been condemned by a judge heading an inquiry into the incident. Ahmed Jabbar Kareem Ali was one of a number of Iraqi civilians who were forced into canals and rivers as British troops struggled to contain widespread looting that was triggered by the collapse of Saddam Hussein’s regime. Sir George Newman, who is conducting a series of inquest-style hearings into Iraqi civilian deaths, said in a report into the death of Ali published on Friday that he was now likely to investigate why the practice spread, and examine the response of the military high command. Sir John Chilcot’s report into the Iraq war disclosed that Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, who was then chief of the defence staff, issued no instructions on how to deal with an outbreak of lawlessness, despite the joint intelligence committee and the Defence Intelligence Staff warning that it was likely, and despite Tony Blair and the Ministry of Defence recognising the seriousness of the risk. Ali and three other youths were detained while looting in Basra, forced into the back of a Warrior armoured fighting vehicle and driven five miles to the Shatt al-Basra canal, where they were forced into the water. Newman said that all four youths “must have been terrified” and that Ali was “aggressively manhandled and assaulted” by the soldiers. “His death ensued because he was forced by the soldiers to enter the canal, where, in the presence of the soldiers, he was seen to be in difficulty, and to go under the water,” he said. The judge was scathing about the soldiers’ “manifest failure” to take any action to save the drowning boy’s life. “Notwithstanding the unlawful treatment involved in getting him into the water, his death could have been avoided because he could and should have been rescued after it became clear that he was floundering. “It was a clumsy, ill-directed and bullying piece of conduct, engaged in without consideration of the risk of harm to which it could give rise.” Four soldiers serving with the Irish and Coldstream Guards were subsequently charged with manslaughter but cleared at courts martial in 2006. During his inquiry, Newman heard evidence from one of the soldiers, anonymised as SO18, that he could see Ali panicking as he began to slip under the water, but he then obeyed a command to get back into the Warrior. Another, giving evidence as SO16, said he had been getting undressed to get into the water to rescue Ali, when he heard the order. “We got back into the vehicle and that was that.” An MoD spokesman said: “This was a grave incident for which we are extremely sorry. We are committed to investigating allegations of wrongdoing by UK forces and will use Sir George’s findings to learn lessons to help ensure nothing like this happens again.” After the invasion, British troops had moved quickly from fighting for control of Basra and the surrounding region to attempting to deal with looters. As the occupying power in the south-east of the country, the British government was responsible under military law for the maintenance of law and order.
At brigade level, there was a debate about whether looters could be shot, or shots fired into the air, Newman reports, but it was decided that neither was permissible. Initially, looters were detained and hooded, but this practice stopped after a hooded Iraqi died in custody. Soon, British troops found there were insufficient facilities to detain the large numbers of men and youths engaged in stealing. “Different platoons developed their own method of ‘on-the-spot justice’,” Newman reports. One method was to drive Warriors over carts that were being used to transport stolen goods. Another was to use marker pens to write the words ‘Ali Baba’ on looters’ foreheads. Newman’s inquiry was given a statement by a former captain in the Irish Guards who said that the practice of pushing looters into water “was absolutely known and understood” by British troops in Basra. “Unless you were an idiot, you could not have missed it and the talk of looters and what we did with them was on everyone’s lips all of the time,” the former captain said. “Everyone knew, even in our HQ – of that l have absolutely no doubt. I’m not saying it happened a lot, but it happened. If someone said they didn’t know about the practice and what was happening I would unequivocally call them a liar.” This former officer described how British troops were overwhelmed by the sheer number of people who were determined to strip public spaces of anything of value: “There were swarms of them, like termites, they stole everything, stripped everything bare. On one occasion, I stopped an old man who was stealing a lamppost from a motorway. I’d never seen anything like it before. “They were nice people, so you didn’t feel in extraordinary danger, but they stole everything.” Chilcot reported that both before and during the invasion, the chief of joint operations, Lt Gen John Reith, pointed out to the chiefs of staff that they had issued no instructions about what to do in the event of an outbreak of lawlessness. He concluded that while commanders on the ground were responsible for developing tactical measures, the chief of the defence staff and the chief of joint operations should have ensured that appropriate rules of engagement were issued. Newman concludes that need to do something fell into a “procedurally formless vacuum”, and that it was left to company commanders and section commanders to improvise a response."
2016-09-16T15:10:24Z,uk-news,UK news,Rochdale Muslims fear fervour of youth spilling into hate and violence,"Community leaders paint a bleak picture for young Muslims living in the borough of Rochdale on the outskirts of Greater Manchester. They have grave concerns that Muslim youth are increasingly turning to anti-western sentiment and extreme interpretations of Islam. In recent months the peace in the narrow streets sitting in the shadow of the impressive Jalalia Jaame mosque has been shattered.
A respected holy man, Jalal Uddin, 71, was stalked and murdered because he was a practitioner of a form of Islamic faith healing called taweez which involved the use of charms to bring good luck, good health and deter evil spirits. Friends Mohammed Hussain Syeedy, 21, who has been convicted of Uddin’s murder and Mohammed Abdul Kadir, 24, who is the subject of an international manhunt, had been Isis supporters and believed that those who practised taweez should be killed because they considered it a form of black magic, the trial at Manchester crown court heard. The murder of “quiet, dignified and well-respected” Uddin was fuelled by “hatred and intolerance,” the court was told. It was not the only murder in Britain this year motivated by differing interpretations of Islam. In March, a sectarian dispute in Pakistan was played out on the streets of Glasgow when a taxi driver, Tanveer Ahmed, from Bradford, drove hundreds of miles to stab a fellow Muslim to death. The simmering hatred towards Britain’s Ahmadiyya Muslim community spilled over into violence the day before Good Friday when Ahmed Shah was brutally murdered in his shop. Ahmed, a Sunni Muslim, was offended by Shah’s religious proclamations on social media that he was the next prophet of Islam – something some consider highly blasphemous. New figures given to the Guardian show that sectarian attacks have nearly doubled since last year, with a surge in incidents targeting Ahmadiyya Muslims since Shah’s murder. The number of anti-Ahmadiyya attacks more than tripled over the last year, from nine to 29, according to the monitoring group Tell Mama. In total, there have been 40 recorded incidents of sectarian violence this year, the figures show, up from 24 last year. Fiyaz Mughal, the founder and director of Tell Mama, said vulnerable young men were being radicalised online and “absolutely destroying and cannibalising” spiritual elements of Islam, such as taweez and sufism. “Spiritual dimensions of Islam are being eradicated by Salafist, Wahhabist stuff and young mindsets are seeing that as the devil within Islam,” Mughal said. The fatal attack in Glasgow on 24 March had echoes of events in Rochdale five weeks earlier. Community leaders say it is a signal of a growing intolerance among young Muslims of those who do not follow Islam in its most extreme and traditional sense. They say it is a disturbing trend of young Muslims adopting more fundamentalist beliefs on key social and political issues than their parents or grandparents. There is strong evidence of a “growing religiosity”, with an increasing minority firmly rejecting western life and anything that they consider varies from traditional, almost hardline Islamic scripture, according to local elders. Community leaders in Rochdale say youngsters now cherrypick a narrative to suit their own agenda and even question the imam’s authority armed with information from the internet. Teenage rebellion is nothing new. But where previous generations of British-born Asian youths were tempted by the western vices of alcohol, drugs and sex before marriage, this new way of revolting against their moderate upbringing is to experiment with extremism. This generation are more informed about the intricacies of Islam and educated enough to seek out alternative thought and teachings. One of those who is becoming increasingly concerned is Rochdale councillor Ali Ahmed. Ahmed a 40-year-old father of five who has lived in Rochdale all his life and became a councillor just under two years ago, has seen a change in the way that young Muslims interpret Islam. He said: “I guess some people would say that these were nice boys from a good family who have just fallen in with the wrong crowd, but I would agree that there is something bigger at play here. “The younger generation of Muslims are better informed about Islam and they are not shy about questioning an imam if they feel that something they are preaching is incorrect. This is very different to the older generation. We would never question an imam – it was not the done thing. Your father taught you to respect authority and we blindly followed. “This generation follow Islam in an almost deeper way and then of course there is Google. They are much more able to seek out information about the religion and no longer take the word from an imam as gospel. These youngsters are trying to catch the ustad [religious teacher] out. “The way the religion is being interpreted is also changing and there are also more and more divisions appearing. In Rochdale alone, there are many different mosques, catering for all these different ideologies and this can cause problems.” It is under this fractious atmosphere that a respectable man was murdered. Some youngsters believe his practice of taweez and ruqya was akin to black magic, a practice strictly prohibited in Islam. Ahmed added: “These practices went on when we were young but we just considered them harmless, but things are changing and the younger generation of Muslims are far more vocal about their views. “We are worried about this. There is a sense that these young men are seeking something, whether it is the kudos or the approval of outside forces, and we need to keep our community safe.” Ahmed tells of how nervous the community has become about its own youth and of the fears about the divisions between young Muslims which are sometimes leading to violence. On Sunday night outside his home, a group of young men gathered, dressed in traditional Islamic dress with ultra-conservative turbans. Some older members of the community were contacted and the youths were dispersed. “That is why when we saw the young men in turbans gathered together that we all went out and told them to clear off. We feel something is brewing and we don’t want any more trouble,” he said. “We have many youth projects in the area to try and keep them occupied but there is only so much we can do. Our biggest problem is the access to the internet – we cannot stop them if they want to seek something out.” Meanwhile, Habibul Ahad, who runs the Bangladeshi Association and Community project in Rochdale, and who knew Uddin, Syeedy and Kadir, said Muslim youths should not be demonised for being religious. “Yes, they follow Islam differently to the way that we did,” he said. “But that isn’t necessarily always a bad thing. Sometimes it makes them better people and gives them purpose. “I think the issues arise when they start researching on the internet and refuse to get any of their information from teachers and imams within the community. That is when we worry about radicalisation. “We need to all join together to condemn these acts of violence. You cannot kill somebody because you do not agree with their school of thought. We need to be able to live side by side like we have in the past.”"
2016-09-16T15:28:24Z,uk-news,UK news,Former Manchester United steward jailed for life for imam murder,"A former Manchester United steward has been jailed for a minimum of 24 years for the Islamic State-inspired murder of a “gentle, well-respected” former imam in Rochdale. Mohammed Syeedy, 21, was found guilty of helping to kill Jalal Uddin because the 71-year-old practised a form of Islamic spiritual healing considered to be “black magic” by some extremists. On hearing the jury’s verdict, Syeedy put his head in his hands and shook it in disbelief. In the public gallery, his family gasped and sobbed.
Members of Uddin’s family, who travelled from Bangladesh to attend the three-week trial, hugged and cried after Syeedy was led away. The murder has alarmed counter-terrorism experts, who fear that homegrown extremists are increasingly targeting fellow Muslims whom they view as heretics. Uddin was bludgeoned to death with a hammer on his way home from a mosque in Rochdale on 18 February. He was attacked with repeated, forceful blows from behind after having been under surveillance by his killers for months, the trial at Manchester crown court was told.
The judge, Sir David Maddison, said he did not believe the intention was to kill Uddin, but to “cause extremely grave and permanently disabling harm” so that he was unable to practise Islamic healing ever again. Syeedy played an “absolutely integral” part in the murder, the judge said, describing the killing as a “carefully planned”, “premeditated” attack on a vulnerable victim. Describing Uddin as “gentle, well-respected”, the judge said the “brutal” killing was a hate crime but did not match the sentencing threshold of a religiously motivated murder, which carries a minimum term of 30 years’ imprisonment. “It seems to me that this was a case of two members of the Muslim faith killing another member of the Muslim faith solely because they disapproved of a particular practice carried out by that person,” Maddison said. Jurors were told that Syeedy and his alleged accomplice, Mohammed Abdul Kadir, stalked Uddin around the streets of Rochdale before Kadir launched the attack on the older man in a children’s playground. Syeedy, the getaway driver, denied knowing about the murder plot. Kadir, a former John Lewis call centre worker, was not on trial because he fled to Istanbul three days after the murder. Counter-terrorism detectives are hunting for the 24-year-old, but believe he may have crossed the border into Syria to join Isis. Syeedy and Kadir, from Rochdale and Oldham respectively, developed a hatred of Uddin last summer after discovering he practised a form of Islamic healing called taweez, the court was told. Uddin moved to Rochdale 15 years ago from Bangladesh. The former imam was well known in the area for his use of healing amulets to ward off ill health and protect people from evil spirits. Uddin’s friends warned that the killing had left an open wound in Rochdale’s Muslim community, as his family paid tribute to a “greatly respected man, a caring and loving soul”. Uddin’s relatives said they had been “left empty” by his murder in a statement released by police. “We came to court to seek answers from Mohammed Hassan Syeedy. He has shown no remorse or sympathy towards Jalal or his family, as indicative of his attitude and demeanour throughout the last four weeks,” the family said. “Although Jalal was a Muslim who peacefully practised his faith, he had a love and respect for all religions, cultures and creeds, and the fact that he was murdered by someone inspired by Isil shows the true nature and barbarity of this organisation and those who serve it.” In a victim impact statement read to court, one of Uddin’s seven children, Sala al-Arif, said his father told him two days before he died that he planned later this year to return to Bangladesh for the first time in 15 years to see his wife, children and grandchildren. Instead, he said, his relatives have been left with an “everlasting void”. Al-Arif said that when he visited his father’s body in the mortuary he was “denied the most basic human right” to kiss his father’s face because of the horrific injuries he had suffered. Describing his father as a “devout pacifist who showed nothing but love to anyone he came across,” Al-Arif said Uddin’s relatives had been left without answers as to why he was targeted: “I cannot begin to understand why anyone would want to murder him. This is the ultimate question for me and my family: why was my father murdered?” Jurors were told that Syeedy and Kadir, who were not known to the police, believed Uddin’s use of taweez was black magic and that he deserved to be killed. Uddin, known as the Qari Saab by his followers for his deep understanding of the Qur’an, was mocked as a magician by Syeedy and his friends, who nicknamed him Voldemort after the evil wizard in the Harry Potter books. Six months before the murder, Syeedy and his friends destroyed Uddin’s notes and books on taweez after stealing them from their mosque. They then started monitoring Uddin’s whereabouts, taking covert pictures of him in the street, as they plotted to have the community leader deported by immigration services. But that plan was abandoned after a photograph emerged of Uddin with the Rochdale MP, Simon Danczuk, outside the Jalalia mosque in December last year. One of Syeedy’s friends shared the photograph and commented: “Oh crap ... voldermort nvr gna b busted by immigration now.” When detectives arrested Syeedy five days after the murder, they found gruesome footage on his phone of Uddin dying, along with reams of Isis propaganda. Jurors were shown photographs of Syeedy holding an Isis-style flag outside the Jalalia mosque. In another image, he wore a stabproof vest outside the mosque. Other photographs showed Syeedy and two people holding a jihadi flag over a road sign in Rochdale that had been altered to read: “War zone.” Detectives also found a black, Isis-style baseball cap, arm patches and a flag in Syeedy’s home, where he lived with his mother, younger sister and younger brother. Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, told the court that Syeedy had been drawn in by Isis propaganda surrounding the Syrian war over a period of three years. In 2013, he travelled to Syria on a medical aid convoy at around the same time that Alan Henning, the murdered Salford taxi driver, went on a similar “Rochdale to Syria” trip, the trial heard. Syeedy told the court he was friendly with Henning and was “disgusted” when he heard that the 47-year-old had been beheaded by an Isis militant who was revealed last year to be Londoner Mohammed Emwazi. Det Ch Supt Tony Mole, head of the north-west counterterrorism unit, said: “This has been a long and delicate investigation, with detectives working meticulously to establish exactly what happened to Jalal and I want to thank them for their work. “I would also like to thank the local community for the patience and support they have shown us. Their assistance and understanding has been vital and they have been a credit to Rochdale. “I hope the outcome here today will bring some closure to Jalal’s family and help them continue to rebuild their lives following their tragic loss.” One of Uddin’s friends, Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation charity, urged the Rochdale community to come together or “we may see such tragedies again”. He added: “It is beyond doubt that these young minds are being brainwashed and groomed online, they have no engagement or involvement with any of the mosques and these institutions are failing young Muslims. Giving evidence, Syeedy denied knowing anything about Uddin’s murder, but admitted he was with Kadir before and after the attack. He said he never suspected that his friend, whom he knew was an Isis sympathiser, had killed Uddin, even though the former imam was found dead moments after Kadir left the playground. Syeedy, an electrical engineering student who dropped out of university, denied being an Isis supporter and described the group’s actions as “completely wrong”. He told jurors he did not agree with Uddin’s use of taweez because it was dangerous to meddle with the supernatural world, but that it was up to God to deliver the punishment. “This is my country, I abide by the laws,” he told the jury."

Burdened by his ceremonial sword, or possibly the spurs on his polished boots, Douglas-Hughes, 72, appeared to stumble backwards over a concrete bollard outside Stewards Academy, where the royal couple were promoting a children’s mental health campaign.
Douglas-Hughes was helped to his feet by Prince William and others, who rushed to his aid. “I’m fine, thank you,” he said later. “The Duke was very concerned, but I reassured him I was perfectly all right.” As vice-lord lieutenant, Douglas-Hughes deputises for the Queen’s personal representative in Essex, although the role is largely ceremonial. Female lord lieutenants do not wear uniform or weaponry."
2016-09-16T16:47:15Z,uk-news,UK news,Father and son jailed for selling dangerous DIY teeth-whitening kits,"A father and son have been jailed for selling unsafe DIY teeth-whitening kits that left some users with bleeding gums from chemical burns. The family business made more than £3m over a decade and meant Matthew Hargreaves, 44, and his father, John, 69, could live a lavish lifestyle. But Merthyr crown court in south Wales was told that their products contained dangerously high levels of hydrogen peroxide, which can be used as a bleaching agent. Father and son were each jailed for 18 months. John Hargreaves’ wife, Jean, 71, who was also involved in running the business, was jailed for six months but her sentence was suspended for two years.
An investigation, codenamed Operation Gleam, began when trading standards officers from Powys county council came across a company trading at the Royal Welsh Show in Builth Wells in the summer of 2013. Advertising banners claimed the product was “ideal for any age group” and was “used by leading dentists throughout the UK and Europe”. Officers bought a sample of the product and were shocked to find it contained up to 110 times the allowable level of hydrogen peroxide. They issued a public warning that DIY kits which breached safety laws could aggravate gum disease or even cause chemical burns to the mouth. The investigation, which cost more than £800,000, spread across the UK, with officers speaking to dozens of people who had used the product. Matthew and John Hargreaves admitted fraud. Jean Hargreaves admitted engaging in unfair commercial practice. Mark Wyeth QC, prosecuting, said: “Their activities caused serious harm to unwitting members of the public. It involved the sale of unsafe and dangerous teeth-whitening products across the British Isles and Republic of Ireland. “They ran a thoroughly dishonest and dangerous business placing members of the public in serious harm for a period of eight years.” The court heard the three lived in a large house in Cheshire and had seven luxury cars. Whenever the pressure from trading standards or complaining customers became too great, the existing company would be wound up and another one, which was already set up, would take over. They have refused to say where the product came from. Judge Philip Harris-Jenkins told the defendants they had shown blatant disregard for public safety in order to make a huge profit. “You placed personal greed before greater public safety.” Clive Jones, Powys council’s lead for trading standards and community safety, said: “We will be working with the General Dental Council (GDC) on future campaigns as we need to ensure that such sharp practices are stamped out.” Katie Spears, of the General Dental Council, said: “The GDC continue to work hard to proactively spread the message that tooth whitening is the practice of dentistry and that only registered dental professionals can legally and safely provide such treatment. “We are particularly proud of the collaborative approach taken here with Powys trading standards to promote patient safety and will continue to work with trading standards and other stakeholders to guard against the promotion of potentially dangerous illegal tooth-whitening practices.”"
2016-09-16T17:34:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Man jailed for shining powerful torch at RAF jets flying over his home,"A man has been jailed for 18 months for endangering aircraft after shining a powerful torch at RAF jets flying training missions over his island home. John Arthur Jones, a former council housing director, was so upset by the roar of the jets flying over his land in Anglesey, north Wales, that he took to aiming the beam at pilots. The lights were “dangerously distracting” and sometimes pilots of Hawk jets who were being trained for combat had to abort landings. Jones was described in court by his defence barrister, Lisa Judge, as a Victor Meldrew type – after the grumpy One Foot in the Grave character. But judge Geraint Walters told him he was arrogant and could have caused serious harm. Jailing him at Mold crown court, the judge said: “You possess an abundance of self-belief in your own ability to achieve things, which transcends all reason and which is born out of profound arrogance. The consequences could have been devastating. Your conduct became a campaign over a long period of time.”
Jones, 66, denied 13 charges of endangering aircraft between November 2013 and September 2014 but a jury found him guilty. Instructors and pilots told the court how a sudden flash of light in the cockpit could be disastrous. The jury heard they were being trained at Mona airfield on the island for “touch and go” landings in readiness for conflict. While doing vital checks before landing, sudden lights were disorientating and landings were often abandoned, they said. The jury heard how it took time for pilots’ vision to adjust in the dark and once a cockpit was illuminated it could take 20 minutes or more for them to regain perfect vision. That could lead to a dangerous situation where a disorientated pilot might not believe his instruments and could lead to a crash, the court heard. The RAF alerted the police. On one occasion a police helicopter was launched and a night vision camera caught a person on the veranda at Jones’s home with a light. Undercover officers were sent in and caught him shining a light at a jet. In interview, Jones alleged pilots were deliberately harassing him by flying over his property. He claimed that he would simply go out to inspect his property with a torch and on one occasion he may have instinctively shone his torch up as a jet passed by but it was not deliberate. John Philpotts, prosecuting, told the jury: “The defendant endangered aircraft and their pilots by shining a bright light into the cockpits of Hawk jets as they prepared to land. He became displeased by the aviation activity in the skies near his land.” Philpotts told the court Jones was so annoyed that he threatened at one point to fly a weather balloon above his land to obstruct the jets but did not carry out the idea. “It is the prosecution case that he became obsessed with the activity of the aircraft,” Philpotts added. Jones was a “man on a mission”, the prosecution claimed, and kept detailed notes about flights, temperatures, wind direction and speed. Philpotts said Jones’ actions posed a danger to pilots and to motorists if a plane had crashed. “We are all horrifically familiar with the events at Shoreham,” he added, referring to the 2015 Sussex disaster when an air show stunt when wrong and a plane crashed on to a road, killing 11 people. The prosecutor said there had been disruption to military training. Some night time training had to be rescheduled and Philpotts said any delays could have an effect on frontline troops. Jones had denied that he had a vendetta against the RAF because the jet noise had destroyed his plans to build luxury holiday lodges. But the judge said he believed he had blamed the RAF for blighting his business scheme. Jones has now put his home on the market."
2016-09-16T18:26:26Z,uk-news,UK news,China must wait four years for decision on Bradwell nuclear plant,"China faces at least a four-year wait to find out whether its plans to build a nuclear power station in Essex will be approved. If it got the go-ahead, Britain would be relying heavily on Chinese investment for its future energy supply after the government approved the construction of an £18bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, which will be 33% owned by China General Nuclear (CGN).
Theresa May pushed through the Hinkley Point C project despite opposition from MPs and the public over its cost and the involvement of China. However, the project in Bradwell, Essex, is even more controversial because it would be majority owned and designed by China. The prime minister’s approval for Hinkley Point was backed by George Osborne, the former chancellor who championed the project. However, Osborne said the agreement with France and China approved by May looked “pretty much like the same deal” agreed last year by David Cameron’s government. This is despite May’s government claiming it had inserted a “special share” in the agreement to help protect national security and ensure the ownership of the nuclear plant did not change without state approval. “I’m very pleased that we are going ahead with the Hinkley power plant,” Osborne told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I don’t think anything has fundamentally changed from the deal that we put together in government just a few months ago. It looks to me pretty much like the same deal. “The advice we got from civil servants in the energy ministry and from the security establishment was that the special share would not add any additional protection beyond what the very tough and tight regulatory regime already provided us. It didn’t seem to me necessary to have some additional special share. Maybe the advice has changed over the last few months. I don’t know, obviously I’m not in the government any more.” Under the deal, CGN agreed to invest £6bn in Hinkley Point C in return for leading its own power plant project at Bradwell. The Bradwell plant is considered vital by the state-owned company because it would be the first Chinese nuclear reactor to be built in a developed country and an opportunity to promote China’s technological expertise. CGN plans formally to submit its plan for a nuclear reactor at Bradwell within weeks. However, it would take at least four years for the Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR) to assess the proposals and possibly approve them. This means that despite the government having approved Hinkley Point C, the shape of Britain’s future energy supply will remain unresolved for some time. Sources close to CGN said they were “confident” about winning approval but prepared for a “lengthy and meticulous process”. The company has held preliminary discussions with the ONR about Bradwell, its technology and its governance structure. The regulator said in an official document earlier this year that CGN was in a “good position” to begin a generic design assessment, the formal process to approve a new nuclear reactor. The GDA for Bradwell would begin when the Chinese company submitted its proposals and the government gave the ONR a green light. The process for the Chinese company would be the same as for other new reactors and would take around four years, as long as the group met the timetable for submissions and provided sufficient detail. The ONR said: “As the independent regulator for all [UK] nuclear sites we have strong powers to ensure the safe and secure delivery of any new nuclear project.” CGN would own two-thirds of the Bradwell B project, with the French energy company EDF owning the rest. This is the reverse of Hinkley Point C, which is two-thirds owned by EDF and of a French design. The government’s approval of Hinkley Point C has been welcomed in China. Johnny Hon, a Sino-British entrepreneur and vice-president of the 48 Group Club, which promotes trade links between the countries, said: “Although the news is most welcome from China’s perspective, their most anticipated deal is the third potential reactor in Bradwell in Essex – whose details are yet to be confirmed.
“This reactor would be the first in a developed country to use Chinese technology and [would] be a breakthrough in establishing China as a global leader in nuclear power.” Beijing’s official news agency, Xinhua, said May’s backing of Hinkley Point C had saved UK-China relations from being “tossed into uncertainty”. In an opinion piece on Friday, Xinhua said the project had been put at risk by “some fictitious ‘national security’ concerns about Chinese investment … Had the programme gone under, all sides were to lose dearly, while China-Britain relations could have been tossed into uncertainty.” Contracts relating to the construction of Hinkley Point C are already being awarded. First Bus and Crosville Motor Services have won a 10-year contract to provide bus services for workers involved in building the power plant in Somerset. Around 300 jobs will be created for the service, which will use 160 environmentally friendly buses. Meanwhile General Electric, the US industrial giant, has confirmed it is in line to receive $1.9bn (£1.5bn) by building steam turbines and generators for the power plant."
2016-09-17T18:59:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Met investigates filmed confrontation between driver and police officer,"The Metropolitan police are to launch an investigation after dramatic footage emerged that appears to show a police officer attacking a car after the driver refuses to get out. The clip, shared on social media and viewed more than 40,000 times, shows what appears to be a police officer – filmed from the position of the driver – repeatedly telling him to “get out of the car”, adding: “You’re not allowed to drive it.” In the footage, which was shared on Saturday by a former member of the music group So Solid Crew, the officer then appears to lose his temper yelling, kicking and pulling at the car door in an attempt to open it. He then reaches for his baton and starts hammering the car window with it.
The man inside filming tells the police officer that he has a licence and insurance, at which point the officer can then be seen repeatedly striking the windscreen, resulting in the glass shattering, while another police officer watches on by a police car. The man inside the car says: “You’re smashing this for no reason. Look what they are doing to my car.” The police officer then starts slicing around the damaged area of the windscreen with what looks like a penknife, to make the hole bigger. When asked by the driver what the problem is, the officer tells him he is “not allowed to drive”. The video has been shared thousands of times on Twitter and Instagram, where commentators describe the officer’s actions as “mindless vandalism and intimidation”. The driver, who filmed the footage, gave his name as Leon. He said the incident took place on Friday evening in the Gospel Oak area of north London, and said it was a case of “mistaken identity”, describing the officer’s actions as “a completely unlawful act”. Towards the end of the video, a police officer calls him TJ, to which the man replies: “I am not TJ, I am not TJ.” When contacted about the footage, a spokesman for the Metropolitan police said he was aware of it and was looking into it. The Met later released a statement confirming that the incident took place at about 5pm on Friday in the borough of Camden. “The footage will now be subject to an investigation by officers from the directorate of professional standards (DPS),” the statement said. “As soon as the MPS was made aware of the footage, the DPS was contacted immediately. The individual who uploaded the footage has been contacted by DPS officers. As this matter is in its early stages, the officers have not been suspended or placed on restricted duties. “No one was arrested during the incident,” it added.

In a unique insight into the undercover war against loyalist and republican terror suspects in the early 21st century, the army “spy” also discloses how the Real IRA wrongfooted a covert army squad, allowing the terror group to elude surveillance and murder a civilian worker at a Territorial Army base. A practised surveillance expert, the soldier planted bugs and cameras in and around the cars and homes of Real IRA and loyalist paramilitaries. He also claims two senior unnamed Sinn Féin politicians have been supplying information to British intelligence for many years. Seán Hartnett (not his real name) was born in Cork in the Irish Republic in the 1980s, and tried to join the IRA as a teenager. His revelations are contained in a memoir, Charlie One, which is about to be published, with the title based on the coded call-sign British military intelligence used for its most wanted targets in Northern Ireland. The Observer has spoken to Hartnett and obtained detailed information on his career in the Joint Communications Unit Northern Ireland (JCUNI), which appear to confirm his years of service. On the thwarted plot to murder Adair during a power struggle in the Ulster Defence Association in 2002, Hartnett claims the JCUNI had “solid intelligence” that Adair was going to be shot as he took his eight-year-old daughter to school. “The hit was to be carried out by two of the UDA’s most experienced hitmen. They would use one of their favourite assassination methods, a drive-by. Two men on a motorbike would approach Adair, pull up beside him, and the passenger would spray him with bullets,” Hartnett says. However, the murder bid was prevented by undercover soldiers driving a van, which they rammed into the motorbike. Hartnett says he watched the entire events unfold via secret cameras hidden around the Lower Shankill area – Adair’s Belfast stronghold. “The bike spun out and hit the ground,” he says. “The two men’s instinct to get up and run kicked in and off they went. The van was driven back to base, destined for the scrapyard.” Hartnett says he was sceptical at the reason his commanding officer gave for saving Adair’s life: concern that the UDA assassins would shoot his young daughter as well. “It was in most people’s interest to see him [Adair] gone, and yet we had just expended massive resources protecting him … There was only one plausible explanation. Adair himself had claimed he had been getting information from both British intelligence and Special Branch on republican targets for years, and we all knew that was a two-way street.” Not all of the undercover teams were successful in halting attacks. Hartnett says that on one occasion his team lost contact with one of two Vauxhall Cavalier cars that they had bugged, which belonged to a Real IRA cell based around Derry and Strabane. The undercover soldiers tracking the cars missed the transfer of a bomb hidden in a lunchbox from one car to another on 2 August 2002. The Real IRA were then able to plant the bomb inside the perimeter of Caw Territorial Army camp close to Derry. Civilian security officer David Caldwell picked up the lunchbox and the bomb went off. He later died from his injuries. “The mood that morning was one of anger, not just at the death of David Caldwell, a father of four, but ourselves for having failed the man,” Hartnett says. A specialist “handler” who ran informants for the unit revealed to Hartnett that two Sinn Féin politicians were providing British forces with information. The senior officer shared details that Hartnett said “sobered me up”. “I was so surprised: two well-known Sinn Féin politicians were providing information to British intelligence and had been for years.” Hartnett also claims the Real IRA came close to “blinding” army intelligence’s entire electronic spying operation across Derry. Hartnett points to a Real IRA attack on an unmanned communications station at Sheriff’s Mountain in Derry in June 2002. The security forces have never confirmed that the station acted as a key secret surveillance hub for military intelligence. Hartnett says North “Det” – the JCUNI unit in Derry – temporarily “lost perhaps its most valuable and potent surveillance tools”. Hartnett says in the book that many of his colleagues who had served undercover in Derry and Belfast in the early 2000s are now active in the secret war against Islamic State and its offshoots.

2016-09-17T19:59:22Z,uk-news,UK news,Imagining London in 2050,"A new book of essays about London’s future concludes with one from Gavin Kelly, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, that looks back from an imagined capital in 2050. He writes: The accelerating cost of living in London spurred on the Living Wage campaign and resulted in a major reboot of the popular and voluntary London Living Wage. London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan rightly took pride that under his watch – and with powerful use of the bully pulpit – the real Living Wage increasingly became the accepted benchmark in some mass-employing sectors like retail and hospitality. In the early 2020s, during his second term, the Mayor received the power to set a higher legal minimum wage than the rest of the country. After an initial row with business, a higher wage floor was introduced (following advice from the Low Pay Commission). It quickly became uncontentious and no party ever proposed reversing it. A happy thought. But: London’s poverty problem went far beyond the issue of hourly pay. For a start, the weekly earnings of low-paid Londoners continued to oscillate far more than those in other parts of the country over the economic cycle due to big shifts in hours worked (the 20% fall experienced in the years following the 2008 financial crisis wasn’t recovered until the mid-2020s). This meant that during difficult times Londoners needed to rely heavily on in-work welfare support and housing benefit, which continued to be scaled back by national government. Above all else there remained the towering issue of housing costs. For some years inner London’s poor, who lost out the most from benefit retrenchment, stayed put facing rising housing costs which pushed them into deeper disadvantage. But eventually there was a big shift in the make-up of inner London as more poor families moved to the outer fringes of London and beyond – both East and West. And Kelly’s imaginary look back recounts a continuing failure to tackle another, far less recognised, contributor to London’s high cost of living, though there’s eventually a happy ending to this part of the story The capital’s poverty problem was compounded by its strikingly low levels of maternal employment (again, the worst in the UK), which dragged down family incomes. Among other things this reflected a decades-long failure to address exorbitant childcare costs, as well as the city’s lack of decent ‘midlevel’ part-time jobs. Eventually, however, childcare made its way up the city’s priority list, establishing itself as an essential form of social infrastructure (after some powers transferred from boroughs and Whitehall). Predictably, though, it took London’s first female Mayor, not elected until 2028, to achieve this. Kelly’s clever piece also covers a rise in the importance of philanthropy, an influential “freelancers’ union”, social mobility, post-school education and - almost too thrilling to dare hope for - devolution of council tax band reform. His contribution is joined in the volume - called The Future of London (2050), published by thinktanks Localis and Bright Blue - by others from Sir Peter Hendy, Tony Travers, Alan Milburn, Justine Roberts, Mark Boleat, Matthew Taylor and more.

2016-09-17T20:44:54Z,uk-news,UK news,Priced-out tenants accuse National Trust of creating ‘ghost villages’,"This article is the subject of a column by the readers’ editor Tenants of the National Trust have accused the conservation charity of creating “ghost towns” out of the villages it owns by hiking up rents to unaffordable levels and then transforming the vacant properties into holiday lets. As the owner of many of Britain’s historic monuments and landscapes, the National Trust is considered to be the custodian of the nation’s heritage, yet it is also one of the UK’s largest landlords. Now some of its tenants claim it is “eroding national heritage” by pricing out local people in favour of tourists.
“There’s been an increase in National Trust tenanted properties being turned into holiday lets. It is of great concern because every home that is turned into holiday accommodation is one less home for a local person in a rural community,” said Joanna Leighton, co-chair of the Tenants’ Association of the National Trust (Tant), which represents about 10,000 tenants. “In many cases local people find its properties unaffordable, meaning they are only a viable option for wealthier tenants, who use them as second homes. This risks reducing our rural communities to ghost towns for many months of the year, eroding our national heritage. “Losing good tenants damages communities irrevocably and takes away the very fabric of village and country life, the particular thing folk coming to National Trust estates expect to see. Ghosts may have appeal in old castles but ghost villages are bare, cold and lifeless.” Robin Kisby, a former RSPB officer, and his wife Nicola have lived in Cotehele, near Saltash in Cornwall, as National Trust tenants for 14 years. “This has been our home for so long we can identify most of the birds here individually,” Kisby said. “Where on earth would we go?” In July 2015, the charity served the Kisbys with a Section 21 notice, sometimes known as a no-fault eviction, which they have been fighting ever since. Robin Kisby believes the eviction is linked to his complaints that repair work had not been done – he says that, for several years, the farmyard has flooded with water contaminated by manure – and their reluctance to accept a rent rise. “I am sure it wants this property back to refurbish it to a high standard and let it at a vastly higher rent, or as a holiday home,” he said. “Part of our problem is that it recently secured a massive rent on a similar luxuriously renovated farmhouse property less than a mile away.” That property, the Malt House, was the home of a National Trust employee for 20 years, but he moved out during the same period that it was asking for rent increases. His former home, a 19th-century three-bedroom cottage with its own battlements, is now let to holidaymakers for about £1,200 a week following extensive renovations. When asked about the Malt House, the National Trust said that it had been reserved for a staff member who had to live on the Cotehele estate for security reasons. It had decided that this was no longer necessary, and the property was not suitable for a domestic let. The problem, according to another Cotehele tenant, Kate Maciver-Redwood, is that the National Trust has failed to maintain its properties properly, which causes ill-feeling among the tenants. Her family runs Haye Farm, and she says it has taken three years for the local surveyor, who is responsible for maintaining the rented cottages, to arrange repairs. The Maciver-Redwoods have to pay half the cost, but have no control over the work. “It’s been seven-and-a-half years since the windows were painted and if they’d been properly maintained they wouldn’t need to be replaced,” she said. “Now they’re almost falling out.” She said they had spent “tens of thousands of pounds” installing a new kitchen and repairing the floor after regular flooding. When they first moved into Haye Farm, the farmhouse was full of chickens because the door had been left open.“They put our rent up 30% two years ago. I said ‘If this helps you crack on, then we’ll go ahead with it.’ How stupid and naive were we?” Tenants in Cornwall are not the only ones who are unhappy. Last year, the villagers of Low Newton-by-the-Sea in Northumberland complained when the National Trust refused to re-let a seaside cottage when it became vacant and instead turned it into a holiday let. The village of Blickling in Norfolk has five holiday lets out of 17 National Trust properties. The population declined from 136 to 113 between 2001 and 2011, according to the latest census. According to the charity’s housing policy, its aims include helping to meet “identified social housing needs where we are a significant housing provider”, and it also talks of selecting tenants with skills to help with its work and favouring people who make a contribution to the community. Yet that policy does not seem to be being followed, said Robin Kisby: “It talks about ‘tenant custodians’, but really it seems to be about making money.” The National Trust made £44m from tenants last year, a rise of 39% since the 2008 global financial crisis, while wages have remained broadly static. It makes another £10m from holiday cottages, and has added about 100 to its portfolio in the past 10 years. In 2006, it was advertising its “unique collection of over 320 properties”; now it is offering 418. A National Trust spokeswoman said: “We don’t have a policy of turning domestic rentals into holiday cottages. The number of holiday cottages has increased very modestly over recent years, by around five a year. That’s a rise of 0.3% as a proportion of our overall rented housing stock.” And holiday cottages were not always created from tenanted properties – sometimes they came from other farm buildings or operational buildings that were not residential. She said that two holiday lets in Yorkshire had recently been transformed into permanent rentals, and that in 2015, 64% of tenants who responded were “satisfied with us as landlords”. “We take our responsibilities for houses we rent out very seriously, which is why we are spending more than £25m this year on annual maintenance and refurbishment. We’ve never invested more than we do now.”"
2016-09-17T23:05:01Z,uk-news,UK news,"Sex, sovereignty and sausages: TV writer traces prejudice against Germans back  to Victoria’s time","The outbreak of anti-German sentiment in Britain that greeted the news that Queen Victoria was to marry Prince Albert rang unpleasantly familiar bells for the author of ITV’s new hit costume drama, Victoria, when she researched Sunday night’s episode. “I wrote these scenes long before the Brexit vote, but it did feel uncannily prescient when I saw it again on screen. I was slightly horrified and quite depressed by it really. Our Little Englander suspicions have been around a long time,” said writer Daisy Goodwin. The former television producer, who has enjoyed critical acclaim and high audience ratings in the past few weeks for her first television series, which stars Jenna Coleman as the young queen, said this weekend she had been surprised to find British prejudice against Germans had roots far further back than she had guessed. “I had thought a lot of the anti-German feeling in this country started with the first world war but, as I read around, I found it had been here a long time by then,” she said. After studying the newspapers and parliamentary debates of the era, Goodwin tried to reflect the public mood in her dramatic version of the months leading up to Victoria and Albert’s wedding in February 1840. Scenes in Sunday night’s episode will show politicians, including the Duke of Wellington, expressing fears that a foreign country might gain sway over the British empire, while the young Queen’s advisor, prime minister Lord Melbourne, played by Rufus Sewell, attempts to reassure his peers. But concerns were not limited to Westminster. “There were lots of cartoons at the time of Albert as a sausage. He really was fighting against a prejudice that was not of his making,” said Goodwin, in support of her fictionalised account.
Hansard parliamentary records for January 1840 show that after the Queen formally stated her intention of “allying myself in marriage with the Prince Albert of Saxe Coburg and Gotha”, she was quick to ask for an income for her future husband. “The constant proofs which I have received of your attachment to my person and family persuade me that you will enable me to provide for such an establishment as may appear suitable to the rank of the prince and the dignity of the crown,” she said. She was right to want clarification: parliament was not keen to offer her groom either a title or a large state allowance. Instead MPs were mainly concerned to reassure themselves and the public that he was not a Catholic gold-digger. Lord Seaford’s kinder comments recorded in Hansard reveal the patriarchal attitudes of the age: “It was impossible, considering the age and sex of the sovereign, that their lordships could consider this event drily, as a mere political alliance, or without feelings of the most anxious solicitude as to its influence upon the future domestic happiness of her majesty.” Goodwin was interested to see that popular prejudice against Germans took a different form in Victoria’s day. Far from being caricatured as officious and expansionist, they were ridiculed as chaotic and ill-educated. “Germany did not really exist as a country – it was a collection of principalities,” she said. “They were thought of as a ramshackle country that was rather low grade, a bit like the way some ignorant people might talk about Romanians now. It was thought Albert wasn’t grand enough to marry the Queen of England and Wellington asked for reassurances about his Protestantism.” A report in an edition of the Observer from 25 November 1839 supports Goodwin’s portrayal of the sniffy remarks made about his family background: “The singular fortunes of the family of Saxe Cobourg [sic] are the extraordinary and wonderful incidents of the age. The domain of Cobourg, the patrimonial estate of the present duke, the eldest of the family and brother of Leopold, was a very principality, the net revenue did not exceed £700 per annum. Of course upon such an income, the family pride was difficult to support, and the means of education for the younger branches extremely restricted.” The article goes on: “Never before, perhaps, in so short a space of time, did a family attain fortunes so magnificent without deeds of arms or special services of any public nature.”
The Times came to the same conclusion on 11 February 1840: “It would scarcely be possible to find in history an instance of a princely house increasing its hereditary possessions to such a degree and at the same time extending itself upon three Royal European thrones.” Goodwin explained that worry centred on sexual politics and snobbery, as well as religion: “Albert was penniless and that certainly worried them. They did not want to give him a proper title, like Duke of Edinburgh, because they did not want him to sit in the house of Lords. He was furious about it because he had a strong inclination towards public service,” she said. Albert’s uncle Leopold I, king of the Belgians, the man who brokered the engagement and is played in the series by Alex Jennings, had been viewed as a fortune hunter when he married Princess Charlotte of Wales in 1816. He was given a state allowance of £50,000 a year that he continued to draw long after Charlotte died in 1817. “The Coburgs were a little like the Kardashians, or maybe even the Middletons,” said Goodwin. “And there was concern that a member of the royal family was marrying into the family once again.” Coleman’s Victoria, who, quite correctly, Goodwin points out, has no German accent as, although her mother was German, she was raised in England, asks why her people hate Germans so much. “Melbourne is said to have told her, ‘I don’t mind their talents, but I don’t think much of their beauty,’” said Goodwin."
2016-09-18T09:11:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Bristol 'race attack' boy's neighbours raise more than £400  for day trip,"Neighbours of a 10-year-old boy who was injured in an alleged racist attack on a Bristol street have raised more than £400 to send him on a day trip. Awais Ali was walking to a friend’s house to play video games when two older boys allegedly called him “Paki” and demanded he hand over his phone and money. He did not have any cash and the boys allegedly dragged him to a disused building in the Fishponds area where they hit him with a stick and with a rubber or plastic pipe. Ali sustained injuries to his head, ribs, shoulder blades, his left leg and arms and had a trainer mark imprinted on his back from where the boys allegedly stood on him. His mother, Anisa Iqbal, 33, whose family moved from Pakistan 50 years ago, was so shocked and upset that she allowed images of the boy’s injuries to be released. A neighbour, Caryl Rundle, set up a Justgiving page to give Awais a day out, explaining that she wanted to show the family that their neighbourhood was behind them. She said: “What is important is that the community stands together to say no to racism and to support those who are affected by it.” Rundle said she had been overwhelmed by the response to the fundraising campaign. They exceeded their goal of £200 four hours after setting up the page and are in discussions with the family about how best to donate the excess. “I was, like many others, very shocked to hear of this attack. The fact all involved are so young is even more concerning. Fishponds, where I’ve lived for the last 19 years, is a vibrant and multicultural area,” she said. Police have questioned two boys, aged 11 and 12, and the case has been referred to the youth justice panel for consideration."
2016-09-18T09:47:57Z,uk-news,UK news,"Isis supporters posing as charity workers, says son of murdered imam","The son of a respected imam murdered by Islamic State supporters fears terrorist sympathisers are radicalising young people in Rochdale while posing as charity workers. Saleh al-Arif spoke out after Mohammed Syeedy, 21, was jailed for 24 years for the murder of Jalal Uddin, 71, who was bludgeoned to death in a children’s playground in February. Arif said: “I spoke to some members of the community. They are really worried about IS supporters. They believe there are a lot of supporters in the Bengali community. From the outside, it’s like they are doing something good, charitable work and other things. “They believe they are just trying to make a good impression and they are radicalising the young people in the community and they simply don’t want to see that. They are very scared and they believe they have some kind of link with IS. They just want to get rid of it and they want help from the police.” Uddin was murdered by Syeedy and Mohammed Abdul Kadir, 24, because the elderly scholar practised a form of Islamic healing called taweez, which is denounced as black magic by Isis and some hardline Salafi Muslims. The trial at Manchester crown court heard that Syeedy, Kadir and their friends surveilled Uddin for 18 months before he was murdered on 18 February. Kadir is being sought by police after flying to Istanbul, Turkey, three days after the killing. In an interview with Sky News, Arif said he believed there were others who “knew what’s going to happen” to his father, although they did not participate in the attack. “Someone should be keeping an eye on these people. It should be investigated properly,” he said, while also praising the police investigation. He described his father, who had seven children, as “the best dad in the world”. “He was very religious, very peaceful and very knowledgable. He had no political views but he had strong religious views and what he believed he tried to practise it to the death,” he said. In a victim impact statement read to court on Friday, Arif said his father told him two days before he was killed that he planned to return to Bangladesh later this year for the first time in 15 years. Uddin had not seen his wife, children or grandchildren since he left Bangladesh for Britain in 2002."
2016-09-18T13:53:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Officers in confrontation with driver in London put on restricted duties,"Two police officers have been placed on restricted duties after footage circulated on social media showed one of them smashing a car windscreen when the driver did not follow his order to get out of the vehicle. Scotland Yard confirmed that the driver, who gave his name in the video as Leon Fontana, was the victim of a case of mistaken identity. “The investigation will examine the officer’s use of force during the incident,” police said in a statement released on Sunday afternoon. The footage showed the man being told to get out of the car by the officers, who called him “TJ”. When he did not comply, one of the officers screamed at him, started pulling at his car window and hitting it, before smashing the windscreen and trying to cut away the shattered glass with a pocket knife.
The man told the officers he was not TJ and that he was recording the incident “for my safety”. The officers told him he was “not allowed to drive”, but he said he had a licence and insurance. One of the police officers was heard to claim “I’ve done absolutely nothing” shortly after the windscreen was smashed.
Police confirmed they had received a formal complaint on Saturday over the incident, which took place in north London on Friday afternoon. “The footage continues to be subject to an investigation by officers from the directorate of professional standards and the driver of the car has been spoken to by these officers,” Scotland Yard said. “Although the investigation is in its early stages, it has been established that the officers stopped the vehicle based on information relating to a man who is of interest to police. On conclusion of the incident the officers identified that the driver was not the man in question and he was not arrested.”"
2016-09-18T15:38:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Rogue dentist jailed for bungling operations,"A “profoundly dishonest and utterly incompetent” unregistered dentist has been jailed for bungling operations and causing permanent harm to some of his patients. Ronnie Barogiannis, 44, was sentenced to five and a half years at Hull crown court for fraud and assault causing actual bodily harm. Barogiannis has a dentistry degree, obtained in Sweden in 2003, but had never been registered to practise in the UK despite applying several times. After he was prosecuted for working illegally in Aberdeen, he stole the name and registration of a Greek colleague and worked at a clinic in Cottingham, East Yorkshire in 2013 and 2014. During that period he earned almost £50,000 and had about 600 patients on his books. The court was told that while he worked at the clinic he performed sub-standard and inappropriate treatment that police said had left eight patients with serious damage. Barogiannis was caught when the clinic he worked for was sold and he accidentally sent his new bosses an email under his real name. He was arrested in October 2014 and released on bail. His Greek passport had been confiscated, but he fled the country four days later using a Swedish passport. He was caught working in Sweden in March and extradited to the UK. Passing sentence, Judge Jeremy Richardson QC said: “This sort of case – although an isolated example of serious criminal conduct by a devious, profoundly dishonest and utterly incompetent dentist – inevitably affects the confidence of the public in dental surgeons. “You have damaged the standing of your profession, but I doubt it will be your profession for much longer. You have caused significant harm to your victims by the crimes you committed. You are a disgrace to your profession.” Among his patients were a 39-year-old woman who had the wrong tooth extracted and a 37-year-old woman who developed a severe infection after Barogiannis performed a sub-standard root canal treatment. He admitted fraud and four counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and now faces being sued by a number of his former patients. One of his patients, Lisa Eccles, 31, said that when she saw him to have a crown fitted he kept leaving the room to ask others about the procedure. “The measurements were obviously wrong and it didn’t fit properly, so would not screw far enough into the gum. He was trying to get it to fit for around an hour and a half. It was very painful,” she said. “Looking back now it seems obvious that he didn’t know what he was doing.” DCI Lucy Khan called Barogiannis a “very believable conman who weaved a complex series of lies”. “I hope that the jail sentence will prevent others from operating as bogus medical professionals,” she said. A spokesman for the practice, now called Oasis Dental Care, said: “Having identified and dismissed Barogiannis, Oasis wrote to all patients seen by Barogiannis and offered either an examination plus any necessary remedial work at no cost to the patient, or a refund of any fees paid to Barogiannis if patients preferred to seek dental care elsewhere.”"
2016-09-18T15:40:06Z,uk-news,UK news,London politics: Hackney just keeps on getting more Labour,"Labour won a large and expected win in Thursday’s by-election for a new executive mayor of Hackney, following Jules Pipe’s appointment as Sadiq Khan’s deputy London mayor for planning, regeneration and skills. His successor, Philip Glanville had filled in for Pipe since his departure in July and was the borough’s cabinet member for housing. He strolled to victory, taking a crushing 68.9% of the vote. This confirms that Hackney is one of the most solidly Labour places in London or anywhere else, but the overall outcome raises some intriguing wider issues too. Turnout was as massively low as Glanville’s triumph was hugely easy - just 32,778, or 18.6%, of the registered electorate of 178,203. It was the lowest turnout yet for any London borough mayor vote held on a day when there were no other big elections on in the same place: inaugural elections to such posts held back in 2002 in Newham, Tower Hamlets and Hackney itself persuaded around 25% of voters make the effort while 37.7% turned out for last June’s re-run of the voided 2014 Tower Hamlets mayoral poll. The ghostliness of the polling stations - which I saw for myself, being a Hackney resident - was the greater for 40% of votes being cast by post. The turnout figure is disappointing, though not, perhaps, surprising. Much of the campaigning took place during the summer, the London mayor and EU referendum battles might have induced voter fatigue, and supporters of other parties might have been disincentivised by the growing strength of Labour in Hackney this century, as the borough emerged from a period of complete chaos at the end of the 1990s (all splendidly documented here for Election Data by Andrew Teale). But Glanville will be pleased that Labour’s share of the vote was even greater than for the last of Pipe’s four wins, in 2014. Not only did he emulate his predecessor in that year and in 2010 by taking more than 50% of first preferences under the supplementary vote system, thereby again leaving no need for a second preference run-off, he also increased the Labour slice of the pie by 8.5%. This was largely at the expense of the Green Party, whose candidate finished second as two years ago, but with 4.3% less of the vote, securing 13.2% in all. The Conservative hopeful finished third, with 10.8%. The Tories have slipped back in mayoral contests over the years, having finished second in 2002, 2006 and third (to the Lib Dems) in 2010. What explains the ongoing consolidation of Labour power in Hackney? The party’s share of first preference votes in its mayoral elections has risen steadily and impressively ever since they began: in 2002, it was 42%; in 2006, 47%; in 2010, 54%; and in 2014, 60%. It is well organised on the ground. Running the council efficiently for most of this century won’t have done it any harm, as the borough has gradually shed its once gruesome reputation for rampant criminality and bad secondary schools. Demographic change, probably encouraged by the above, might have helped too. There’s been a huge rise in Hackney’s population over this period and, at the same time, a shift in its social composition. While the absolute numbers of people defined as being “in poverty” have remained almost the same, the proportion in high level occupations has risen - in 2014, two thirds of Hackney residents were employed in managerial, professional and technical roles. There’s also been a rise in the percentage of young people aged between 20 and 29. Given Labour’s tightening grip on power, it seems that these changes have been mostly to its advantage, with the in-coming middle classes being of liberal-left persuasion. Local MP Diane Abbott has wittily observed that most of the Guardian’s staff seem to live in Stoke Newington, a largely prosperous part of her rock solid seat. She’s not far wrong. The same trends might have helped the Greens up the Hackney league table in recent times too, perhaps especially - if you’ll indulge the cliches and speculation - the very visible influx of hipster youth. So why did they drop back in relation to Labour last week? The same thing occurred in a recent by-election for a council seat, which Labour’s candidate won very comfortably with an 11.1% increased vote share compared with 2014 and the Greens coming second with a 13% drop. An obvious first thought is that Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of Labour may have persuaded some on the left in Hackney who’d switched to the Greens to return to the party. (Certainly, Corbyn admirers on Twitter have claimed those results prove that their man is no vote loser. The problem there is that, even if Hackney Labour has been helped by a Corbyn factor, Hackney, like most of London, is very unlike the rest of the country). Glanville’s headline pledge was to devote himself to “building a Hackney that works for everyone”, expressing an appreciation in the Town Hall that the benefits of the borough’s growing economic prosperity aren’t being shared widely enough. He says he intends to double council house building and create a company to deliver Mayor Khan’s London Living Rent private sector homes. He also aims to enlarge the number of childminders in Hackney, another policy that could create employment and help boost incomes. The challenges he faces are very similar to those confronting Khan. Wish him well."

A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said that a 20-year-old man was arrested in the early hours of Saturday and has subsequently been released on bail until late October. A second man, aged 24, was arrested on Sunday and remains in custody at a north London police station. Besala Ekofo, 53, described by her family as “always [being] a comfort even in the hardest situations” and Kalikaka-Ekofo, 21, a university student who “never looked for trouble”, were shot at a flat in East Finchley early on Thursday morning. Both were pronounced dead at the scene. Four other people including a child were also at the property but were unharmed. A postmortem examination of Kalikaka-Ekofo was done on Saturday and the cause of death has been confirmed as a gunshot wound to the head. Besala Ekofo’s postmortem has yet to take place. Detectives appealed for information and said they are keeping an open mind as to the motive for the attack – as well as investigating whether anyone else associated with the address was the target."
2016-09-19T11:18:43Z,uk-news,UK news,'Our Gracie' comes home: Rochdale salutes Gracie Fields with statue,"The first statue of a woman to be erected in Greater Manchester in more than 100 years has been unveiled in Rochdale. The statue of the entertainer Gracie Fields, the world’s highest-paid female actor in the 1930s, was unveiled outside Rochdale’s Grade I-listed town hall on Sunday. Fields, who was born above a Rochdale fish and chip shop in 1898, often performed to crowds on her many return visits to the town during her travelling performances for the troops during the second world war. She was made a dame in 1979 a few months before her death aged 81. The life-sized sculpture was unveiled by the comedian and actor Roy Hudd, who was a friend of Fields.
Hudd said: “It was very important for me to be here as Gracie meant a lot to me. She’s one of my heroines. “Even though she died a long time ago, everyone wanted to be close to the statue. She was an amazing lady. You needed so many elements to give a performance like her, and it’s all right there in that pose with her holding out her dress. It really captures what she was about. “Her story is the Cinderella story of all time. She went from the fish and chip shop on Molesworth Street to a world famous superstar in Capri.” Fields made her first stage appearance in 1905 and went on to become a popular West End star. Her travelling performances for troops during the second world war led her to become known as “a forces’ sweetheart”, a title more commonly associated with Dame Vera Lynn. The statue is the first of a woman in Greater Manchester since Queen Victoria’s likeness was installed in Piccadilly Gardens more than a century ago.
A statue of the comedian Victoria Wood, who died of cancer in April, will be erected in her home town of Bury next year. A fundraising campaign set up by Wood’s brother, Chris Foote Wood, has so far raised more than £17,600 towards its £20,000 target, including a £1,000 donation from Dame Judi Dench. A campaign for a new female statue in Manchester, dubbed WoManchester, was launched by councillor Andrew Simcock two years ago. Earlier this year Emmeline Pankhurst was chosen for a new statue in Manchester after a public vote in more than 5,000 people took part. The leader of the suffragette movement, who was born in the city, polled more than the five other contenders put together. The £200,000 statue, which will be privately funded, is due to be unveiled in 2019."
2016-09-19T13:39:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Financial plight of Lutfur Rahman petitioners is absurd,"News that the four Tower Hamlets residents whose election petition brought about the removal of Lutfur Rahman as the borough’s executive mayor still face large legal bills arising from their victory adds another layer of absurdity to the great pile of it engendered by the Rahman saga as a whole. Campaigner Andy Erlam, restauranteur Azmal Hussain, Ukip member Angela Moffat and Labour Party activist Debbie Simone face a six-figure bill from solicitors they retained to recover costs against Rahman they had been awarded by the court, following the former mayor being declared bankrupt. Their predicament further underlines how unsatisfactory it is that legitimate concerns about the conduct of democracy in the UK had to be pursued by means of the ancient and, in some respects, rather bizarre legal channel of an election petition in the first place. Having triumphed, the four petitioners now face ending up skint for their trouble. John Biggs, the Labour politician who won a re-run of the voided 2014 election to succeed Rahman as mayor last June, has summed up the situation for the East London Advertiser: “It’s entirely wrong that they are facing this scale of legal bill despite their sacrifice being proved right. The legal system should be applauding them for challenging corruption, not burdening them to the point of bankruptcy.” It’s worth recalling what election commissioner Richard Mawrey QC did and did not write in his measured and very readable judgement on the petition. He concluded that Rahman had secured his win with the help of “corrupt and illegal practices” involving the payment of canvassers, the false portrayal of Biggs as racist, allocating community grants in a manner that amounted to bribery, the casting of invalid votes and by bringing “undue spiritual influence” to bear on fellow Muslim voters. He annulled the election and banned Rahman from holding office for five years. He was also quite clear that the court could draw no conclusion about whether enough invalid votes had been cast to have affected the overall result of the election. And, relating to a persistent theme of some of the media coverage of Rahman, he noted that the court had “not heard a shred of credible evidence linking Mr Rahman with any extreme or fundamentalist Islamist movement”. Some subsequent events are also worth mentioning here. The election court was not a criminal court and in March the police decided there was insufficient evidence that any criminal offences had been committed in relation to the 2014 contest for them to investigate Rahman further. More recently another strand of media coverage of Rahman unravelled, with the Telegraph apologising for a series of articles, most of them written by Boris Johnson’s now former cycling commissioner Andrew Gilligan, which had, in the apology’s own words, suggested that a local businessman was “a willing beneficiary of Mr Rahman’s corruption”. The Telegraph accepts that this was “untrue” and has paid the businessman concerned damages and legal costs. None of this is to downplay the wrong-doing documented in the election court judgement or to insinuate (as some still do) that Rahman is the blameless victim of racist Muslim-haters. On the contrary, it is to stress that an affair so damaging to the East End and so often clouded by misunderstandings and misrepresentations was always crying out for a thorough and dispassionate investigation by an authority with the right powers to do so. The election court, nothwithstanding the curiosities of the relevant legislation, provided this. But to secure it the petitioners had to go to risky financial lengths and are still paying the price, despite the bulk of their complaints being borne out. How can that be right? You can help the four Tower Hamlets petitioners raise funds to meet their legal bills by making a donation here."
2016-09-19T14:23:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Chris Halliwell: painstaking fight to bring Becky Godden's killer to justice,"Four years ago, taxi driver Chris Halliwell was jailed for life after admitting the brutal, sexually motivated murder of office worker Sian O’Callaghan. He abducted the 22-year-old from a nightclub in Swindon, stabbed her in the head, strangled her and left her partially clothed body on the side of a country road in Oxfordshire.
O’Callaghan’s family at least had the relief of seeing Halliwell jailed for life and told that he would serve a minimum of 25 years before being eligible for parole. But it was very different for the family of a second young Swindon woman, 20-year-old sex worker Becky Godden, who went missing eight years before O’Callaghan’s murder. When he was arrested over the abduction of O’Callaghan, Halliwell told the police he had also killed Godden. He even led the senior investigating officer in the O’Callaghan case, Steve Fulcher, to a field in Gloucestershire where he said he had buried Godden’s body. Her headless remains were duly found.
But, extraordinarily, Halliwell could not be brought to justice over Godden’s killing at the time because of the way Fulcher had interviewed him. Fulcher believed at the time that O’Callaghan could still have been alive, so he ignored the rules and questioned Halliwell on a remote Wiltshire hillside without giving him the chance to seek advice from a solicitor or reading him his rights. Fulcher’s reasoning was that he believed O’Callaghan’s right to life outweighed Halliwell’s rights. As it turned out, O’Callaghan was already dead, and unfortunately for the officer, Halliwell backtracked on his confession to Godden’s murder. There was other forensic evidence to show the taxi driver had killed O’Callaghan, and he admitted her murder in October 2012. But it was ruled at that time that the confession over Godden could not be used in court and, to the despair of family and friends, Halliwell seemed to have got away with the woman’s murder. Since then, Wiltshire police have worked hard to make sure Halliwell was brought to justice. Their job has been to find the evidence in addition to the hilltop confession to show he had killed Godden. It has been a painstaking effort.
One of their first tasks was to try to piece together Godden’s last movements. Her mother last saw her in December 2002, when she gave her a lift after a court appearance. Detectives found a beat officer who patrolled the red light district in Swindon and his notebook showed he stopped seeing Godden on 27 December 2002. Officers traced a friend of Godden’s who remembered last seeing her early in January 2003 getting into a taxi outside a Swindon club after arguing with the driver. Detectives were to conclude that Godden was probably abducted and murdered on the night of Friday 3 January. In the early hours of that day, Halliwell’s Volvo ran out of petrol and the RAC breakdown service was called out. The location was the village of Inglesham, north of Swindon – just six miles from Oxo Bottom field in Eastleach, where Godden’s remains were found. Later that day, police found, Halliwell had gone to his GP complaining of a sore right hand that he said had been injured in a fight with a customer. He also had scratches to his face and the doctor recalled him being distressed. But police found Halliwell’s work logs from 2003 and discovered he had not worked that day. There was nothing to connect Halliwell forensically with Godden’s skeletal remains. But police still managed to link him to Oxo Bottom field through analysis of items found in his shed. It turned out the geological characteristics of the field, the site of a neolithic settlement, were unique – and traces of soil from the location were found on the spade and tape. Detectives also investigated Halliwell’s computers. They found he had viewed scenes of child sexual abuse and bestiality and had an interest in violent sex and rape. Officers spoke to a man who said in the mid-80s Halliwell had once asked him how many women someone would have to kill before becoming a serial killer.
The breakthroughs meant there was evidence to support the original confession. The trial judge, Sir John Griffith Williams, agreed that the jury ought to know that Halliwell was in jail for O’Callaghan’s killing and be allowed to hear most of what he had told Fulcher including the fact that Hallwell led him to Oxo Bottom. Put together, it must have made the jury’s verdict relatively simple. But the Halliwell story may not be over. When he appeared in the witness box, Fulcher suggested Halliwell may have killed others. Halliwell had told him that Godden’s body was buried 5ft deep. In fact her grave was just a few inches below the surface. To Fulcher, the disparity suggested Halliwell could have got confused between this burial site and others. Addressing Halliwell during the trial, Fulcher, who has left the force and is working in Somalia, told him: “What I inferred … is that Becky is one of your victims, as is Sian, and you got confused about the nature of this deposition. You described very clearly a 5ft hole. That led me to conclude that there are other victims.” In 2014, detectives found the pond where Halliwell disposed of O’Callaghan’s boots – and also retrieved dozens of scraps of material that could be women’s clothing, plus a shotgun, from the pond and surrounding area. There are a number of unsolved murders in the south-west, the most infamous being that of Melanie Hall, who went missing from a Bath nightclub in 1996, aged 25."
2016-09-19T15:13:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May resists calls for UK to accept more Syrian refugees,"Theresa May has resisted calls for the UK to take in more vulnerable people fleeing Syria as she flew into New York for two summits on refugees hosted by the UN and Barack Obama. Before the summit, the prime minister argued it was better to help more refugees in their own region than resettle a smaller number, and said the UK was the second biggest humanitarian donor to camps in the countries around Syria. Charities, religious leaders and Labour have criticised the government ahead of the summit for agreeing to take only 20,000 vulnerable Syrian refugees over the next four years, even though places for them have already been found with local councils.
Speaking on her flight to New York, May dismissed the criticism and pointed to existing UK programmes to help those fleeing war in Syria. Asked by the Guardian whether she would consider calls for Britain to resettle more refugees, she said: “We have always taken the view that we can help more Syrian refugees by putting aid into the region.” She added that some Syrians were also coming to the UK through the normal asylum-seeking routes, as well as 3,000 children from the region. Her answer appears to confirm that May will take the same approach as David Cameron, who only agreed to the programme for vulnerable refugees from Syria under pressure. May was also pressed on the slow progress made towards fulfilling the so-called Dubs amendment by allowing more unaccompanied refugee children in Europe to enter the UK. It emerged this weekend that a 14-year-old year old Afghan boy eligible to be helped was killed trying to make his way illegally to the UK from Calais while his application was delayed.
The prime minister insisted that enough was already being done. She said: “We are working with local authorities and NGOs in relation to delivering on the Dubs amendment and we have for example speeded up our processes for ensuring family reunification can take place.” May’s main intervention at the UN summit will be to awarn of the dangers that mass uncontrolled migration poses. She will call for a better global system to manage the movement of people and propose better differentiation between refugees and economic migrants. It is understood that she is unlikely to announce any increase in the quota of refugees to be accepted, but the UK is expected to commit more money and humanitarian aid at the summit. Obama and the outgoing UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon hope to make progress in getting world leaders to pledge more help for refugees before the end of their tenures. Amnesty and other groups, however, have criticised the declaration due to be adopted at the UN summit for lacking teeth and merely reiterating humanitarian principles. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, was one of 200 religious leaders who called last week for more action from the UK, criticising the government’s response to the refugee crisis as “too slow, too low and too narrow”. David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee in New York, said this weekend that May should use the summit to promise that the UK would resettle more refugees. “Frankly, the UK should be saying ‘we’ll take 20,000 or 25,000 a year’, so four times the current level to match the commitment of countries like Canada.” Maurice Wren, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “These proposals indicate that the prime minister is intent on attempting to reinforce the untenable status quo, blocking off people’s escape routes and leaving poor countries looking after nearly nine out of 10 of the world’s refugees. “What we really need to see instead is the UK leading by example, adopting sustainable solutions aimed at saving refugees’ lives and implementing a more equitable system for sharing responsibility for protecting them.” Yvette Cooper, the chair of Labour’s refugee taskforce, called on May to meet the government’s pledge to resettle 20,000 Syrians two years early and offer more help to those fleeing the war. “This will be a terrible missed opportunity if we don’t get strong international action, and if Britain doesn’t show the leadership needed,” she said. “The prime minister is not doing enough. She is right to say there is a distinction between refugees and economic migrants, that is exactly why Britain should be doing more to help those fleeing persecution and war. Alongside border controls, we also need safe, legal routes to sanctuary including speeding up family reunion which is far too slow and mired in bureaucracy. “After a 14-year-old boy died in Calais trying to reach his brother in the UK, children’s safety should be the top of the agenda. There are 900 children alone in Calais at serious risk of harm and exploitation. It is a complete disgrace that still not a single child has been helped under the Dubs legislation parliament voted for, and that Home Office delays are blocking hundreds of unaccompanied children from reaching their family and safety.” As well as making an intervention on migration, May will host a “round table” on stopping modern slavery and trafficking - one of her personal priorities as home secretary. The prime minister will point to the UK’s new taskforce and announce that the heads of Mi5, Mi6, GCHQ and Interpol will join it when required. “Just as it was Britain that took an historic stand to ban slavery two centuries ago, I am determined that the United Kingdom will once again lead the way in defeating modern slavery,” she said ahead of the session for world leaders. In her maiden speech to the UN on Tuesday, May will call on the UN to deal better with problems that need a global response such as terrorism, mass migration and modern slavery. At the summit, May will also defend the vote for Brexit in her speech to the UN, saying the British people “did not vote to turn inwards or walk away from any of our partners in the world” but they did want “a politics that is more in touch with their concerns and bold action to address them”. She will echo her claim made at the G20 in China that too many people are feeling left behind by globalisation. May is expected to have bilateral meetings with Ban Ki-moon, and the prime ministers of Pakistan, New Zealand, Egypt, and Turkey. She will also meet the prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, for the second time in a fortnight, after Tokyo’s warning at the G20 summit that it’s businesses could leave the UK without more clarity about the consequences the Brexit vote. On Monday evening, May will hold a reception for about 60 executives from companies such as Amazon, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Morgan Stanley and Black Rock, as the UK attempts to calm investors’ fears about Brexit. “What I will be talking about with both American and British leaders is about how we can encourage that trade and investment between the countries,” May said. “Something like a million [British] people wake up each morning and go to work for an American company.”"
2016-09-19T15:52:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Man sent back to prison for breaching Tpim conditions,"A man who was convicted of terror offences has been sent back to prison after breaching the terms of the terrorism prevention and investigation measure (Tpim) that was imposed upon him on his release. The man, who can be identified only as EF, was jailed for 20 months at the Old Bailey. The court heard that the breaches included using a mobile telephone to call Mesut Baybasin, a former jail mate, and receiving money that came indirectly from Baybasin. Under the terms of the order, he was prohibited from using communication devices without authority, or possessing more than £75 cash in any one week. The court also heard that the 28-year-old had been suffering depression before committing the breaches and was briefly detained for treatment under the Mental Health Act."
2016-09-19T16:51:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Chris Halliwell found guilty of Becky Godden murder,"Police said there was a “distinct possibility” that a taxi driver twice convicted of murdering young women could be responsible for other unsolved killings. Christopher Halliwell, 52, laughed as a guilty verdict was returned at Bristol crown court on Monday and smiled at relatives of Becky Godden, who went missing aged 20 in 2003 when she was a sex worker in Swindon. He is already serving life for the murder of 22-year-old Sian O’Callaghan, whom he abducted from a nightclub in the Wiltshire town in 2011. After the verdict, Det Supt Sean Memory, the senior investigating officer in the Godden case, said Halliwell may have killed others. “I am really open-minded – there is an eight-year gap between Becky and Sian,” Memory said. “I would appeal to Christopher Halliwell – if he wants to speak I’m willing to speak with him. “I can’t rule out that there are other victims. He’s not forensically linked to outstanding cases. However, that’s not to say he hasn’t committed other offences. “I’m not specifically looking at any one particular offence, but I do want to try to understand why there’s an eight-year gap between his offending behaviour. There’s a distinct possibility there could be further offences.” It can now be revealed that in the mid-80s, while he was in prison for an unrelated offence, Halliwell asked a prisoner how many women one needed to kill before being considered a serial killer.
And when police searched a remote pond where Halliwell dumped O’Callaghan’s boots after stabbing and strangling her in 2011, they discovered dozens of scraps of material that may be clothing. In common with many violent sexual offenders, Halliwell had a fascination with hardcore pornography, including child abuse and bestiality. Computer search terms he used showed he had an interest in murder, violent sex and rape. After a two-week trial, a jury found him guilty of the murder of Godden. He became besotted with her after meeting her while working as a taxi driver in Swindon’s red-light district. In January 2003 he had sex with her, strangled her and buried her body in a field in Gloucestershire. Godden’s murder came to light only after Halliwell was arrested over O’Callaghan’s disappearance in 2011. He led the senior investigating officer, Steve Fulcher, to where he had left O’Callaghan’s body at the side of a country road – and to where he had buried Godden’s remains eight years before. But because Fulcher did not follow the rules over how suspects should be treated, Halliwell initially escaped justice. Fulcher believed at the time that O’Callaghan could still have been alive, so ignored the rules and questioned Halliwell on a remote Wiltshire hillside without giving him the chance to seek advice from a solicitor or reading him his rights. Fulcher’s reasoning was that he believed O’Callaghan’s right to life outweighed Halliwell’s legal rights. Outside court, Becky’s mother, Karen Edwards, said: “It has been an extremely painful journey but today we have received the justice that has felt like an eternity for our beautiful little girl Becky. We have all sat and listened to heart-breaking evidence day after day.” She paid tribute to Fulcher for finding out what had happened to her daughter. Edwards said: “I would like to thank him from the bottom of my heart for bringing my little girl home. I will always respect him and be indebted to him for making that moral decision as a police officer.”
Fulcher, who faced disciplinary proceedings over the O’Callaghan inquiry, has left Wiltshire police and is now working as a consultant in Somalia. Edwards continued: “He should never have suffered the consequences, the loss of reputation and career for doing such a thing.” Also speaking on the court steps, Becky’s father, John Godden, added: “Becky was our daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece, cousin and auntie. Her life was taken too early but she will always live in our memories. Our time has come to put Becky to rest and hopefully she can now be at peace.” Sian O’Callaghan’s mother, Elaine Pickford, said she believed there may have been other victims. She said: “As far as I’m concerned I think there would be others. I don’t think a man starts killing at the age he killed Becky and I don’t think he’d have gone the length of time between Becky and Sian without needing his fix.” Breaking his silence about the case, Fulcher said: “Halliwell is an evil and depraved violator of women. I caught a serial killer, preventing any further girls being murdered.” Fulcher said he was convinced that the way he handled the questioning of Halliwell without giving him access to a lawyer was “the right and moral thing to do”. He added: “I felt that I correctly prioritised the human rights of the victims and their families, balanced against the rights of the perpetrator. “It is perfectly clear that, had I not acted as I did, neither Sian nor Becky would ever have been found and Halliwell would be free to abduct and kill other girls.”
He was angry that his actions were deemed to be acts of gross misconduct. “The public will need to know how this can be, and what the police will do on behalf of their loved ones who are missing.” Because the details of how Halliwell led police to Godden’s body were ruled inadmissible in 2011, detectives had to find other evidence to link him to the killing. They painstakingly mapped Godden’s last movements and matched them to where Halliwell was at the time. They also showed that soil found on tools in Halliwell’s shed was probably from the field where Godden’s remains were found. Trial judge Sir John Griffith Williams told the court he was considering either a whole-life order or a significant minimum term of imprisonment for Halliwell when he sentences him on Friday.It can also be revealed that, in common with many violent sexual offenders, Halliwell had a fascination with hardcore pornography, including child abuse and bestiality. Computer search terms he used showed that he had an interest in murder, violent sex and rape."
2016-09-19T17:42:05Z,uk-news,UK news,"Hunt saboteur left with broken ribs after being struck by rider, court told","A huntsman “recklessly” galloped into a saboteur leaving her lying seriously injured in a field, a jury has been told. Dressed in red hunting clothes, Mark Doggrell allegedly rode at pace into the area where Nicola Rawson and other saboteurs were trying to distract the hounds. His alleged charge, which took place near the village of Charlton Horethorne near border between Dorset and Somerset, left Rawson with broken ribs. The jury at Taunton crown court was shown footage captured by a camera in the saboteurs’ Land Rover. Rawson’s colleagues can be heard dialling 999 and telling emergency services that she had been “run down by a horse” and was “unconscious and not moving”. Doggrell, 46, denies maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. Giles Nelson, prosecuting, said the incident took place in August 2014 and involved the Blackmore and Sparkford Vale hunt. Nelson said there were five hunt saboteurs in the vehicle who followed the hunt around for several hours. During the first two hours he said the “usual standoff and mutual animosity took place between the sabs and the hunt and those associated with the hunt”. Various incidents were recorded by both sides against each other and there was an “escalation of tension”. At 6pm Doggrell allegedly charged Rawson. Nelson said the saboteurs must have been in the huntsman’s sight, adding: “The noise they were making was obvious. There was no particular need at that time for him to ride that horse as hard as he did.” He said that in doing so, Doggrell had acted recklessly and it was not surprising that a serious injury resulted. Doggrell rode on after allegedly striking Rawson, he added. Nelson told the jury: “The issue of the rights and wrongs of fox hunting is, for some, an emotive topic of course.” He said, however, that the case was not about those rights and wrongs but how Doggrell’s alleged riding led to the consequences that ensued. In his police statement Doggrell said he was the huntsman responsible for the hounds. He said two people “appeared before him” and his horse shied. He claimed his horse made “glancing contact” with Rawson and he rode on to collect the hounds. Doggrell said he had not meant to make contact with anyone and he was a careful rider who had been cantering at the time. Nelson said: “This was a reckless act. He foresaw the risk of injury by his actions and rode that way deliberately.” The jury was also shown other videos. In one, Rawson was dressed in black clothes and wore a black balaclava mask, and she and another saboteur were spraying a road to disrupt the hunt and its hounds. The trial continues."
2016-09-19T18:54:15Z,uk-news,UK news,HS2's promise of a jobs bonanza is an absurd way to look at things | Nils Pratley,"The last resort of promoters of large infrastructure projects is to point to the jobs that will be created, as if that were an end in itself. Thus a group called High Speed Rail Industry Leaders – essentially firms hoping to secure contracts to build HS2 – told us breathlessly on Monday that 27,000 people could work on the high-speed railway project by 2020. It described the figure as “a jobs bonanza” and said HS2 would be “far and away the biggest single source of new jobs in the UK infrastructure sector”. There’s no reason to query the numbers, it should be said. HS2 would be a very large project – £42.5bn if one accepts the official (under) estimate. Rearranging the approach to Euston station, or cutting through the Chilterns, carries massive engineering challenges. Yes, a lot of designers and constructers would be needed. Yet inviting us to lie back and think of a “bonanza” from a “single source” is an absurd way to look at things. If the government has a few tens of billions of pounds to throw at infrastructure upgrades, the question is whether those 27,000 people could be more usefully employed on other schemes with clearer economic benefits. Railwaymen can name dozens of smaller-scale upgrades of track and junctions that would ease congestion. The road transport lobby will relate a long list of road-widening schemes that could be delivered cheaply. Or the government could prioritise the construction of new houses. Do several such projects and you could have 27,000 people employed productively at a fraction of HS2’s costs. In championing a jobs bonanza, the HS2 lobbyists really tell us they are rattled. So they should be. The House of Lords economic affairs committee, and the Treasury committee in the Commons, keep pointing out that the economic case for HS2 hasn’t been made conclusively, or at least contains gaping holes. The vacuum will not be filled by a boast which amounts to little more than a statement that big infrastructure projects tend to require large workforces. Tell us something new, like how a series of smaller transport schemes would score on an independent cost-to-benefit analysis. Little sympathy for Slater & Gordon Quindell’s reputation as a company where anything can happen has been earned many times over, but here’s a novel entry. In its new guise as Watchstone, the company said its half-year results published on Friday were wrong on every measure related to earnings per share. A junior operative, it seems, miscalculated the number of shares in issue. Happily, the correction was in the “right” direction: Watchstone’s loss per share was only half as bad as previously said. All the same, the oversight is astonishing. The directors and accountants at KMPG are meant to have a nose for numbers that are obviously out of place. Monday’s other news out of Watchstone was less surprising: Australian legal outfit Slater & Gordon is suing over last year’s £673m acquisition of Quindell’s professional division, which chases personal injury claims. That S&G itself suffered serious injury is not in doubt. The Melbourne-based firm has taken a huge write-off, its share price has collapsed and its shareholders are furious. In making their claim, the Aussies will have to show they were misled. That legal scrap will be fought on the facts, but the purchase was always utterly misguided. Quindell was in well-publicised disarray at the time, mired in accounting woes that eventually led to interest from the Serious Fraud Office. It would have been cheaper, and infinitely safer, for S&G to intensify Quindell’s pain by the old-fashioned method of competing. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the dispute, sympathy for S&G should be limited. Ofwat idea just a drop in the bucket Do you want to save £8 on your annual water bill? Few of us would say no, but one suspects the chance to claim the equivalent of a free pint of beer every six months will not spark a revolution in consumers’ behaviour. In the energy market, annual savings can run to hundreds of pounds and it’s still a struggle to persuade the punters to fill in the forms to switch suppliers. Trying gamely to sound enthusiastic about the idea of introducing competition to the household water market, the Ofwat chief executive, Cathryn Ross, says: “Water companies provide an analogue service in a digital age.” OK, maybe it’s odd that one can’t sack, say, Thames and give one’s custom to Northumbrian. But since the same water would be coming through the same pipes, it may take more than £8 to banish the worry that fixing a leak would take longer if two faceless utilities were required to talk to each other. Consumers should really demand a harder approach by the regulator during price reviews. The National Audit Office said last year that water companies had retained excess profits of at least £800m over the past five years. Fix that, Ofwat, and we’ll worry about the £8 another day."
2016-09-20T08:39:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Theresa May affirms commitment to 'northern powerhouse',"Theresa May has insisted the “whole machinery of government” is behind the “northern powerhouse” in an attempt to end weeks of speculation over her commitment to the north of England.
In a lengthy article in the Manchester Evening News, the prime minister said she was “absolutely committed” to devolving powers away from Westminster. She said: “I don’t want to see our country dependent on one city any more. I want to get all of our great cities firing on all cylinders to rebalance our economy.” May’s comments come days after George Osborne accused her of having a “wobble” on the “northern powerhouse” as he launched a thinktank to promote the project with the backing of the American billionaire Michael Bloomberg. The prime minister used her article to confirm that the national parade to celebrate the success of Great Britain’s Olympic and Paralympic athletes will be held in Manchester on 17 October. A second parade will be held a day later in London.
She described Osborne’s devolution agenda as “huge, tangible changes” but said more needed to be done to “put local people back in control”.
“I don’t want to see our country dependent on one city any more. I want to get all of our great cities firing on all cylinders to rebalance our economy,” she said. “I will work with leaders here in Greater Manchester to build on the ‘northern powerhouse’, celebrating and further spurring the enormous contribution and potential of cities like Manchester, to deliver economic prosperity and more opportunities for everyone.” Yet her comments are likely to be met with suspicion by some political leaders in the north-east of England. Two weeks ago May’s communities secretary, Sajid Javid, pulled the plug on devolution to the region after council leaders failed to agree on whether to move forward with the plans. There is speculation that Newcastle could break away from its north-east neighbours and seek a “city region” devolution deal, similar to the model being pursued in Liverpool. Speaking in Manchester on Friday, Osborne said he had convinced May to push forward with the project. The scheme will lead to hundreds of millions of pounds and a raft of new powers devolved to elected mayors for cities and regions including Manchester, Liverpool, Tees Valley and the West Midlands. Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram, Labour’s candidates for the mayoral elections in Manchester and Liverpool, recently warned May that pulling the plug on the “northern powerhouse” agenda would be “as big a betrayal as the 1980s when Margaret Thatcher pulled the plug on our industries”."
2016-09-20T09:07:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Chris Halliwell officer in talks with police forces over serial killer fears,"A senior detective has said he is talking to police forces across the UK about unsolved crimes and missing people because he believes a taxi driver convicted of murdering two young women may have killed others. Chris Halliwell, 52, faces a full life term after being convicted of the murder or Becky Godden, a sex worker who vanished, aged 20, in 2003 from Swindon. He is already serving life for the murder of Sian O’Callaghan, 22, an office administrator whom he abducted from a nightclub in the Wiltshire town in 2011. DS Sean Memory, the senior investigating officer in the Godden case, said Halliwell may have killed others. “I’m definitely concerned. We know that Becky died in 2003 and Sian in 2011. What I don’t understand is why there is that gap and how he can turn from a mild-mannered taxi driver taking young vulnerable women home and on other occasions turn into a killer,” he said.
Memory told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he did not have any lines of inquiry. “I do know that Halliwell was very forensically aware. When he killed Sian he removed items of her clothing, he tried to get rid of fibres and he tried to get rid of items from his car. I definitely can’t rule out he committed other offences. “I appeal to him to say: ‘You’ve put two families through absolute hell. This is the time to come forward and if there are any other offences speak to me now.’” Memory referred to an odd exchange he had with Halliwell when he interviewed him in February last year. “He tried to strike a deal with me that if he would clear up Becky’s murder that I would never interview him about anything ever again. “Of course I couldn’t give him that guarantee in case there are other rapes or murders. He said I didn’t go far enough in the guarantees I’d offer him. It’s a strange deal to try to strike if there are no other victims. He wanted absolute immunity from prosecution for the rest of his life.” Memory added: “I will now go away and look at the timeline for Christopher Halliwell. He’s been a taxi driver up and down the country, he’s been a ground worker up and down the country. I’ll look to other police forces to find out if they have missing people in similar circumstances and see if any of that fits into any of the evidence I have.” In the mid-80s, while he was in prison for an unrelated offence, Halliwell asked an inmate how many women a person needed to kill before being considered a serial killer. And when police searched a remote pond where Halliwell dumped O’Callaghan’s boots after stabbing and strangling her in 2011, they discovered dozens of scraps of material that may be clothing. In common with many violent sexual offenders, Halliwell had a fascination with hardcore pornography, including child abuse and bestiality. Computer search terms he used showed he had an interest in murder, violent sex and rape. An extraordinary element of the case was the way Godden’s body was found. Halliwell led police first to O’Callaghan’s body and then to the field where Godden’s remains were to be unearthed. But because the officer in charge of the O’Callaghan inquiry, Steve Fulcher, had ignored some of the rules governing the way suspects should be treated, Halliwell initially escaped justice over Godden’s murder. Memory said he believed Fulcher had acted honestly, but was wrong in law. “There is a distinct possibility that Becky would still be in the ground now if it wasn’t for those actions. I’m utterly convinced she’d still be there now. Nobody knew she was missing. They believed she had started a new life in Bristol.” Asked if Fulcher, who resigned after facing disciplinary action and was now working as a consultant in Somalia, had been vindicated, he said: “It’s very difficult for me to say. He made a very honestly held decision. However it was wrong in law.” Halliwell will be sentenced at Bristol crown court on Friday."
2016-09-20T12:01:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Becky Godden detective: why I broke rules over Christopher Halliwell,"The story of how the taxi driver Christopher Halliwell led police to the bodies of two young women is extraordinary. Halliwell faces a full life term in prison but the detective who caught him, Steve Fulcher, has resigned from the police and is working as a law enforcement consultant in Somalia after being disciplined over how he handled the killer. Halliwell was arrested in March 2011 on suspicion of the abduction of Sian O’Callaghan, who vanished after leaving a nightclub. He refused to tell the arresting officers where O’Callaghan was. Because Fulcher believed there was a chance O’Callaghan was still alive he ordered that Halliwell be taken to a remote hillside rather than a police station. He has said he wanted to give him one last chance to do the right thing. Fulcher realised that by denying Halliwell access to a lawyer and not warning him of his rights, he was ignoring rules laid down in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act But Fulcher argued that O’Callaghan’s right to life outweighed Halliwell’s right to a see a lawyer.
Halliwell duly led Fulcher to where he had dumped O’Callaghan’s body. Then he asked him: “Don’t know if you want to go for another?” Halliwell directed Fulcher to where he had buried the body of the sex worker Becky Godden eight years before. She was missing but nobody knew that she was dead. The taxi driver was jailed for life over O’Callaghan’s murder in 2012 but initially evaded prosecution for murdering Godden because the evidence obtained by Fulcher was ruled inadmissible in court. Finally this week a jury found Halliwell guilty of Godden’s murder after a new team uncovered fresh evidence. Here Fulcher explains in his own words why he acted as he did I am very pleased that Karen Edwards has finally seen justice done for her beautiful daughter Becky, who was brutally murdered by Christopher Halliwell. She has fought a very dignified battle for the past five and a half years to bring Halliwell to court and she should not have had to. I hope she finds some comfort in this verdict. I thank Karen for her resilience and determination to obtain justice for her beloved daughter. Halliwell is an evil and depraved violator of women. I did all I could to find an abducted girl, Sian O’Callaghan, in an effort to save her life; the first duty of a police officer. I also recovered a second victim of Halliwell’s murder: Becky, returning her to her loved ones after eight years of their misery. I caught a serial killer, preventing any further girls being murdered. I adhered to the ACPO kidnap principles. Halliwell had to be arrested as he was about to commit suicide. As the law stands, the expectation was that I should have prioritised Halliwell’s right to silence and legal protection over Sian O’Callaghan’s right to life. I remain convinced that the action that I took in allowing Halliwell to take me to the bodies of both Sian and Becky, was the right and moral thing to do. In so doing, I felt that I correctly prioritised the human rights of the victims and their families, balanced against the rights of the perpetrator.
The stance that Halliwell has taken since his confession to both murders, as demonstrated during this trial, I believe vindicate the actions that I took. It is perfectly clear that, had I not acted as I did, neither Sian nor Becky would ever have been found and Halliwell would be free to abduct and kill other girls. My actions are deemed by the police service to be acts of gross misconduct. The public will need to know how this can be, and what the police will do on behalf of their loved ones who are missing (over 300,000 missing people are reported to the police each year). When the extraordinary facts of this case are explained it is likely to lead to a public crisis of confidence in the competence and credibility of the police service. Despite everything that has happened to me, I cannot regret the decisions that I took that day. Ultimately, that decision ensured the return of two beautiful young women, which bought comfort to their families and ensured that Halliwell has been duly convicted of both murders. Now the trial is over and I am no longer a serving police officer, I am able to put these issues into the public domain for the first time. I would like to prevent any family having to suffer the same agony that Karen Edwards has had to endure. I want to ensure that any senior investigating officer, faced with crimes in action, is able to take the right decision without suffering the repercussions I experienced whilst performing my duty."
2016-09-20T16:31:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Bexley mass brawl: riot police called to fight between schoolchildren,"Two people were taken to hospital and seven arrested after a mass brawl broke out between schoolchildren. The Metropolitan police said officers were called to “a large fight” between youngsters in Northumberland Heath in Bexley, south-east London, at about 5.40pm on Monday. Some reports on social media suggested up to 100 youths were involved, some wearing school uniform, near the Duchess of Kent pub. Unverified footage appeared to show some youths armed with sticks. Jeanne Asquith wrote on Facebook: “Never seen anything like it and I’ve lived here eight years ... I just hope the schools deal with those involved. Most were wearing school uniform!” A resident who did not want to be named said she was shocked to see children in school uniform involved in the fracas. “This is the first time for a long, long while that we’ve had gang-related problems round here,” she added. “They were all youngsters, a lot of them were in school uniform – that was the shock, seeing them in the uniforms. They’re still youngsters – it’s quite a shock when they’re all en masse like that, I didn’t want to go outside.” She said the police were on the scene quickly and the group started shouting abuse at the officers. “We don’t know what it was over or why it even began – it’s crazy,” she added.
A police spokesman said seven people were arrested and were taken to south London police stations. He added: “Officers from the borough and the Met’s territorial support group were called to the scene. Two individuals suffered non-life-threatening injuries. They were taken to a south London hospital by London ambulance service to be treated for their injuries.” On Tuesday a number of police officers were seen on the corner of Northumberland Heath, where the fight spilled out from the park on Monday. Quiet had descended on the area but residents were heard discussing the brawl as they walked by. Bonnie Lampard, 23, witnessed much of the brawl from the Duchess of Kent pub where she works. “About 50 boys came running out the park, and they all had something like knives or bars,” she said. “A lot of them had balaclavas on.” Lampard said the fight appeared to be between a group of predominantly white boys and another group of mainly black boys. Although they were wearing school uniform, they were not in blazers so it was hard to determine from which school they came. Lampard said some boys discarded weapons in nearby residents’ bins and a file was thrown over the fence into the beer garden. “After the police came the boys went but about half an hour later, some of them came back and it was getting heated again. We took one of the boys inside the pub and had to bolt the door.” Lampard said there were a lot of police but they were still outnumbered by the boys. “I heard it was because of another fight that happened over the weekend,” she said."
2016-09-20T16:48:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Work begins on Calais wall to stop refugees trying to board lorries to UK,"Work has begun on a £1.9m wall to block migrants and asylum seekers from attempting to board lorries heading to the Calais port. The structure will stand 4 metres tall and 1km long on both sides of the dual carriageway approaching the port, a few hundred metres from the main refugee camp, where more than 10,000 people live in conditions that charities describe as dangerous and dirty. It will be made of smooth concrete, making it harder to climb, and extends an existing wire fence that flanks the immediate approach to the port. But charities working with those in the camp have said the project will endanger lives by forcing migrants and refugees to take ever greater risks to reach the UK. Steve Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s refugee and migrant rights programme director, said: “This wall will simply push desperate people further into the hands of smugglers and into taking far greater risks to get to the UK, and more will die in the attempt.”
The immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, announced the plan last week. It will be paid for by the British government as part of a £17m joint Anglo-French package of security measures aimed at preventing people from the “Jungle” refugee camp from stowing away on lorries and other vehicles on the French side of the border. The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, has said he intends to dismantle the camp entirely by the end of the year. In 2015-16 more than 84,000 migrants and refugees were caught trying to illegally enter the UK at “juxtaposed ports” such as Calais – where immigration checks are carried out before boarding a train or ferry – according to Home Office figures. Photos of foundation works on the wall emerged on Tuesday, but a Home Office spokesman said construction started last week. Charities working with those in the camp say that 13 refugees and migrants, including three children, have died this year attempting to board vehicles approaching the port in a desperate attempt to reach Britain. Last week, a 14-year-old Afghan boy became the latest fatality, dying in a hit-and-run after he fell off a lorry. The boy, who has not been named, was understood to have a legal right to travel to the UK as he had relatives there, but had become frustrated with delays in processing his case. “This wall is going to prevent migrants from getting on to the road every night. They put tree trunks, branches, gas cylinders” in the road to stop the trucks, the Calais port chief executive, Jean-Marc Puissesseau, said earlier this month, according to AFP. “We can no longer continue to put up with these repeated assaults,” he said. Research by Help Refugees, one of the charities that works in the camp, found that in September the camp’s population rose above 10,000 for the first time, including more than 1,000 unaccompanied children. An official count by the French authorities last month put the number of people in the camp at 6,900. Matilda Gladstone, a spokeswoman for Help Refugees, said: “We are disheartened that once again money and resources are being poured into building walls to keep people out, and not into helping care for the vulnerable, displaced people in the refugee camp in Calais.” She added: “We would like to see Theresa May prioritise the safety of children over the fear of immigration.” Leigh Daynes, the executive director of Doctors of the World, said: “The use of British taxpayers’ money on fences in France is ludicrous. Walls are not the answer to the humanitarian catastrophe in Calais. “They will not deter vulnerable refugees from seeking to have their asylum claim heard here. It is time for the UK to hear and settle those claims in France and end the suffering of ordinary people in search of a better life.”"
2016-09-20T18:37:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Met police arrest two officers in anti-corruption operation,"Police anti-corruption investigators have arrested two of their fellow officers, including a detective attached to a Scotland Yard intelligence unit. The arrests on Tuesday follow claims police say they received about a luxury car-hire company allegedly being used to launder money and make false insurance claims. The Metropolitan police say that as well as the two officers, seven other people have been arrested as part of the operation. Among those detained was a 32-year-old detective constable from the Met intelligence unit, who was arrested at a home in London on suspicion of money laundering, fraud by false representation, perverting the course of justice and offences under the Computer Misuse Act. The second officer detained was a police constable, aged 22. He was arrested in Essex on suspicion of fraud by false representation, police said. The investigation is being conducted by anti-corruption officers from the Met’s directorate of professional standards and the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission has been informed. DCI Sharon Brooks, who is leading the investigation, said: “Acting on intelligence, we have carried out an operation that has resulted in nine arrests, including two serving police officers. “We are committed to dealing with all corruption in the Met, and that includes those who seek to corrupt our staff.” The seven other arrested include six men aged 22 to 46 who were arrested at addresses in London and Essex. They were arrested on suspicion of offences including money laundering, perverting the course of justice and fraud by false representation. A 38-year-old woman was arrested in Barnet, north London, for alleged money laundering. Police said all were taken to central London police stations for questioning and that the status of the arrested police officers was being reviewed, a reference to whether the two officers will be suspended from duty or allowed to keep working while inquiries continue."
2016-09-20T18:54:59Z,uk-news,UK news,"UK delays resulting in exploitation of Calais children, says anti-slavery chief","The UK’s new anti-slavery commissioner has warned that the slow pace of Britain’s efforts to give sanctuary to unaccompanied child refugees in Calais is exposing them to the risk of modern slavery and exploitation only 24 hours after the prime minister launched her international campaign to tackle the menace. Kevin Hyland, who was appointed by Theresa May to the “critical role”, wrote this week to Amber Rudd, after visiting Calais this summer. He highlighted May’s personal commitment to tackling modern slavery and said not enough was being done to protect vulnerable young children living in “unsuitable and unsafe” conditions in the camp. He said that young women, particularly from the Horn of Africa, are being forced into prostitution in the Calais camp’s “nightclubs” to pay people smugglers for the next leg of their journey. Other young women have testified that they have also had to perform sexual services to pay the traffickers. Hyland also cited evidence that boys from Afghanistan are made by older men in the camp to perform “bacha bazi”, which involves dancing and sexual exploitation, and warned that young people generally are being forced into criminal activity in Calais. The lack of urgency in the UK response to the crisis meant that even those children with a legal right to be reunited with family in Britain no longer had any confidence in the system, and were choosing instead to risk their lives trying to smuggle themselves on trucks to get to the UK. The resulting frustration meant “unfortunately migrants had more trust in smugglers than in state-led procedures that exist to ensure their protection” leading to “risk-taking behaviour, which leads to higher exposure to modern slavery and exploitation” and other multiple dangers, he wrote. The warning from Hyland, who has been described by the prime minister as “critical in our fight to stop criminal gangs exploiting innocent men, women and children”, that children are at risk comes just 24 hours after May appealed to world leaders at the United Nations on Monday night to join her crusade against modern slavery. A a 14-year-old boy from Afghanistan who died near the port last week after falling from a truck was named on Tuesday as Raheemullah Oryakhel. He was the third refugee child to die in the Calais area this year. A spokeswoman for Unicef UK said: “If our government had acted more quickly, Raheemullah Oryakhel could be alive and with his family today. He had a legal right to be in the UK and his brother had a bedroom here waiting for him. “This tragedy must now lead to action. The UK must work with the French authorities to get children into appropriate accommodation, where they can have access to care and legal support so they can reach their families safely.” Hyland, who was appointed as an independent anti-slavery commissioner after the Modern Slavery Act was passed last year, expressed concern that UK officials were not effectively identifying or registering vulnerable children in Calais. “It is absolutely unacceptable that these children are left in the camp at the disposal of the criminal networks and they continue risking their lives daily to reach the shores of the UK,” he wrote. “Not enough is being done to address the vulnerabilities of migrants, in particular unaccompanied children.” A census carried out by the charity Help Refugees estimated this week that the camp population has increased to over 10,000 for the first time, a 12% increase on last month, with 1,179 minors, of whom 87% are travelling alone. “The prime minister has described modern slavery as the great human rights issue of our time,” Hyland wrote. “A more proactive and urgent response is needed to ensure criminal networks are disrupted and vulnerable migrants, in particular unaccompanied children, are better protected.” He criticised worsening conditions in the camp, which he described as “unsuitable and unsafe, particularly for women and children”, with hundreds of unaccompanied children sleeping in overcrowded tents, which puts them at “very high risk of abuse, violence and exploitation”. “These children have fled violence, poverty and conflict. To reach Calais they have had to travel on long and perilous journeys only to find that their suffering is not yet over. They are faced with the severe and dangerous realities of living in Calais and try every single night to cross the English Channel, even though the risk of being caught and returned to the camp, or even the risk of serious injury or death, is very high.” He said it was vital to “proactively identify unaccompanied children and safeguard them from existing risks” to ensure they are “protected from any further abuse and exploitation”. The French government has made a commitment to close the camp before the end of the year, but Hyland warned that a rapid eviction “will result in many more children being pushed into the hands of traffickers and smugglers as a result of desperation and a sense of urgency to leave the camp”. If the eviction is to go ahead it it crucial that safe accommodation for unaccompanied children should be provided first, he wrote. He called on the government to provide more funding, and staff to travel to Calais to “quickly identify eligible children” who had a right to come to the UK legally under family reunification rules or under the so-called Dubs amendment of the Immigration Act, under which the UK government committed to give homes to some vulnerable unaccompanied refugee children. “Children are not waiting. Every night they go to their smugglers who have promised to get them across the Channel ... However, every night each of these children are at risk of exploitation and sadly even dying as they take huge risks to reach the UK,” he wrote. He was also critical of a French charity, France Terre d’Asile, which received over £500,000 from the UK government to identify victims of trafficking in the area, pointing out that they had failed to recruit enough interpreters, which “resulted in failure to establish a direct rapport and trust with the migrant community”. “There is very little confidence in asylum-seeking procedures in France,” he said, which was also pushing children to risk their lives to get to the UK. A Home Office spokesperson said the department would respond to the commissioner’s recommendations in full in due course but stressed the government’s priority was to offer humanitarian support to those most in need and to work closely with the French government to protect those vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation. “We are dedicated to ensuring that children in Calais with family links in the UK are identified, receive sufficient support and can access the Dublin family reunification process without delay. Over 120 cases of unaccompanied children in Europe have been accepted for transfer to the UK under the Dublin regulation since the start of the year and we want to build on this progress,” they added."
2016-09-20T20:50:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Â£100m of UK aid budget to be spent controlling  immigration from Africa,"More than £100m of the UK aid budget will be spent on returning Somali refugees to the country they fled and encouraging people escaping war zones not to cross the Mediterranean under plans outlined by Theresa May in New York. The prime minister used her maiden speech at the United Nations to expand on proposals aimed at stopping “mass uncontrolled population movement”, which has seen refugees travelling long distances in search of better lives. Her plans attracted criticism earlier in the summit over the suggestion that those fleeing war zones should stay and claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, rather than seeking sanctuary in European nations such as Britain.
However, May pressed on with the argument on Tuesday in an address to the general assembly, as she focused on actions in north Africa to stop migrants crossing the Mediterranean. In her speech, May said Britain would send more troops to Somalia to help train local troops to combat the al-Shabaab militant group, including up to 30 teams of between five and 30 personnel with no more than 70 in the country at any one time. “The UK is now going to increase further our security support and we will be calling on others to do the same, hosting an international conference on Somalia in 2017 to maintain this vital momentum,” the prime minister said. While acknowledging Somalia is facing serious security problems, the government is also contributing £20m from the aid budget to encourage refugees who fled the country to return home from the Dadaab camp in Kenya. “We will invest £16m in Somalia to help do things around food, education, shelter and sustainable livelihoods and then £4m to Kenya to help support the process of returning these people,” a UK official said. The process has recently been criticised by the Human Rights Watch group, which said the return of the refugees from Kenya to Somalia cannot be considered voluntary as the Dadaab camp is at risk of being shut down. The UN has insisted there are no forced returns. At a later summit on refugees, hosted by the US president, Barack Obama, May said another £80m from the aid budget will be aimed at helping migrants, largely Eritreans, stay in Ethiopia through the financial support for the construction of new industrial parks offering 100,000 new jobs, including 30,000 for refugees.
This is an expansion of the programme used in Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon to try to encourage refugees to settle in the region rather than make journeys to European countries. Of the 124,000 refugees who crossed the Mediterranean to Italy between January and September this year, 12% were Eritrean – second only to Nigerians who made up 20% of the numbers crossing. At the Obama summit, May also announced that more of the UK’s aid budget would be spent on humanitarian efforts. A UK official said £1.5bn for the year would be going towards refugees and others in dire need, which is an increase of 10% on the aid budget. About £2.5m will go to an international fund to help resettle refugees in other countries. However, May unveiled no new commitments for the UK to take in more than the 20,000 vulnerable Syrians who David Cameron agreed to accept by 2020, despite calls from charities and Labour for Britain to do more. Speaking before the summit, May argued it was better to help a greater number of refugees at camps in countries bordering Syria than to resettle a smaller number in the UK."
2016-09-21T06:00:18Z,uk-news,UK news,UK nuclear weapons convoys 'have had 180 mishaps in 16 years',"Military convoys carrying nuclear weapons through Britain’s cities and towns have experienced 180 mishaps and incidents, including collisions, breakdowns and brake failures during the last 16 years, according to a report produced by a disarmament campaign. The incidents catalogued in the report – based on official logs released under the Freedom of Information Act – include fuel leaks, overheated engines, clutch problems, and other mechanical faults in the convoys. At other times, according to the report, the convoys went the wrong way, were diverted, and lost communications with commanders. The rate at which the incidents have occurred has risen in recent years, with 43 in the last three years. In its report published on Wednesday, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican) warns that a serious accident involving the convoys could spread radioactivity over cities, contaminating communities and increasing cancer risks. The convoys pass through cities and towns between Scotland and southern England. However, an opinion poll commissioned by Ican shows that nearly two-thirds of British adults did not know that the military transports nuclear warheads on British roads, prompting the campaigners to argue that members of the public have not given their consent to the dangers they pose. Materials for nuclear weapons are driven through or flown over 122 local councils in the UK, including densely-populated areas such as Bristol, Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield, Manchester and Newcastle, according to Ministry of Defence data. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “The transport of defence nuclear material is carried out to the highest standard in accordance with stringent safety regulations, and all operational and engineering incidents are reported, however minor.” “In over 50 years of transporting defence nuclear material in the UK, there has never been an incident that has posed any radiation hazard to the public or to the environment.”
The Ican report describes how nuclear warheads are carried in dark green, 44-tonne trucks between a bomb factory at Burghfield near Reading in Berkshire and a naval depot at Coulport on Loch Long near Glasgow, where they are loaded onto submarines. The 900-mile round trips, usually spread over one or two days, are completed between two and six times a year, with the most recent one reported to have been completed this week. According to Ican, the convoys – comprising up to 20 vehicles including police cars and a fire engine – use a variety of routes. One from Burghfield, where the warheads are assembled and maintained, goes along the M40, round Birmingham and past Preston on the M6, and then the M74 to Glasgow. Another takes the convoy round London on the M25 and then north on the M1 via Leeds and Newcastle and then the A1 or A68 to Edinburgh and the M9 to Stirling. In January last year, the convoy travelled through the centre of Glasgow during a fierce storm, according to the report. The short descriptions of the incidents released by the MoD in response to freedom of information requests do not disclose where most of them happened. Two occurred in May 2013. After a rest break at a military base, one of the vehicles in the convoy came into undefined contact with a parked civilian vehicle, and on another occasion, two convoy vehicles were involved in what the MoD said was a “minor road traffic collision” that left “marks to bumper on one vehicle”. There was another collision with a parked car at an MoD base in January 2014. The campaigners said that one of the most dangerous mechanical failures happened in July 2011 when one of the vehicles broke down on the M6 in Cheshire. The vehicle suffered “a sudden and dramatic loss of power and was forced to pull onto the hard shoulder of the motorway” along with the rest of the convoy, according to the MoD’s report of the incident. It closed two lanes of the motorway and resulted in 10-mile tailbacks. The incident was caused by a manufacturing fault, which had to be rectified across the whole fleet, according to the report. Other incidents include delays caused by poor weather such as snow, computer software glitches and traffic jams.
The convoys are necessary because Britain’s nuclear weapons need to be returned to Burghfield periodically so they can be refurbished or dismantled. Listed among the incidents are delays caused by protests by anti-nuclear campaigners, one of whom glued themselves to the roof of one of the vehicles. The convoys are often tracked on social media. Matt Hawkins, spokesman for Ican, said the report “painted a grim picture of the great risks posed by nuclear convoys”, adding that nuclear weapons “only add danger to our lives, exposing us all to the risk of radiation leaks or an attack by terrorists on one of these convoys”. In 2003, following pressure from the Guardian, the MoD was forced to publish a list of accidents involving nuclear weapons between 1960 and 1991 after decades of secrecy. It showed that the weapons had been dropped, struck by other weapons and carried on a truck that slid down a hill and toppled over."
2016-09-21T08:27:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Up to 100 teenagers involved in Manchester brawl,"Up to 100 schoolchildren have been involved in a mass brawl in Manchester city centre, a day after a huge fight broke out among teenagers in south-east London. Dozens of teenagers, aged 13 to 17, took part in the fracas in the city’s busy Northern Quarter district on Tuesday night, police said. Riot police had been called on Monday to a fight involving more than 100 schoolchildren in Bexley, south-east London, in which two teenagers were treated in hospital and seven arrested. A Greater Manchester police spokeswoman said officers received a number of 999 calls at about 7.20pm to reports of a large group of people fighting. Reports from witnesses said between 30 and 100 teenagers were involved in the brawl on Dale Street, which would have been busy with people in bars and workers making their way home at that time. By the time officers arrived the group had dispersed, the police spokeswoman said. No injuries have been reported and there were no reports of weapons being used. The force’s city centre Twitter account posted to alert people about the incident.
Some of the youths were seen wearing school blazers during the mass fight although it is not yet known which school they attend. Police are appealing for people with any information about the brawl to get in touch on 101 citing the reference number 2146/20."
2016-09-21T09:01:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Woman who posed as man to trick friend into sex appeals against sentence,"A woman who was jailed for duping her friend into having sex by pretending to be a man is to appeal against her prison sentence. Gayle Newland, 26, was jailed for eight years after she tricked her friend for two years by disguising her appearance and voice and persuading the woman to wear a blindfold whenever they met. The pair had sex about 10 times until the complainant took off her mask and saw Newland wearing a prosthetic penis, the trial at Chester crown court heard. Judge Roger Dutton described Newland as “an intelligent, obsessional, highly manipulative, deceitful, scheming and thoroughly determined young woman” as he jailed her for eight years in November. Newland, from Willaston in Cheshire, has maintained her innocence despite being found guilty by a jury of three counts of sexual assault. Her legal challenge will be heard at the court of appeal on 12 October at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. Three judges will consider the strength of the former University of Chester student’s conviction and and whether sentence exceeded judicial sentencing guidelines. Newland claimed her accuser always knew she was pretending to be a man as they engaged in role play while struggling with their sexuality. She told the trial last September that no blindfold was used and said she did not strap bandages to her chest or wear a woollen hat and swimsuit. The trial heard that Newland created a bogus Facebook profile in the name of Kye Fortune and mimicked a man’s voice to speak on the phone with the victim a number of times after their first contact in 2011. The complainant told the jury that when they finally decided to meet in February 2013, Newland, posing as Kye, asked her to wear a blindfold, claiming to be insecure about his looks after undergoing brain surgery. They were said to have spent more than 100 hours together and the encounters would include the complainant wearing a blindfold while they watched television and even when sunbathing."
2016-09-21T10:41:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Second video of 'windscreen-smashing police officer' appears,"A police officer who was filmed smashing the windscreen of a car in a video that went viral appears to have have been captured in new footage of a separate incident in which a black moped rider accuses him of discrimination. The Metropolitan police began an investigation after dramatic footage emerged at the weekend that appeared to show a police officer attacking a car after the driver refused to get out.
The clip, widely shared on social media, shows what appears to be a police officer – filmed from the position of the driver – repeatedly telling him to “get out of the car,” adding: “You’re not allowed to drive it.” In the footage, which was shared on Saturday by a former member of the music group So Solid Crew, the officer then appears to lose his temper yelling, kicking and pulling at the car door, trying to open it. He then reaches for his baton and starts hammering the window with it. The incident has been referred to the police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The new footage was filmed by Kyle Adair-Whyte, who came forward after the other video appeared and has been released by 4Front media, the media arm of a project working for and with young Londoners. He believes that the same officer stopped him on 4 September after seeing him pushing his broken-down moped along the road and accused him of being a thief. Adair-Whyte, 24, who says he is a part-time courier and student in footage accompanying that of the incident, said that he was wearing his dress shoes at the time and was on the way to a friend’s house. The officer can be heard telling him that he was being stopped because he was walking along the road with a moped that was “all smashed up”.
Adair-Whyte replies by asking: “How do you deem it not roadworthy? I wasn’t driving. The engine wasn’t on so it doesn’t matter if it was not roadworthy. I was just pushing it along.” He adds: “I don’t understand. You just stopped me through discrimination. You stopped me because you saw a damaged bike.” The officer can be heard telling him: “No, I’ve stopped you because I’ve seen you pushing a moped along the road and I wanted to make sure that you hadn’t just picked it up from somewhere. “Having stopped you I have become more suspicious because I have seen the state of the moped and I suspect it might be involved in moped-enabled snatches. At the moment you are staying here while I confirm or allay my suspicions.” A spokesman for the Metropolitan police said on Monday that it was aware of the second video, which appeared on social media, and that its contents were being assessed."
2016-09-21T13:13:48Z,uk-news,UK news,St Helena islanders want compensation over unusable new £285m airport,"It was due to herald the end of St Helena’s status as Britain’s most marooned but populated island outpost, but instead the airport has become a runway to nowhere, on course to take off as the government’s biggest overseas aid fiasco. The airport cost £285m to build and was due to open on 21 May, intended to boost the economy of the British overseas territory. Instead the opening has been delayed indefinitely after it was discovered that the wind shear was so severe that commercial planes cannot land, leaving the isolated South Atlantic island without a clear economic future and the taxpayer facing a multimillion-pound bill. There are now demands from the island’s 4,000-strong population for compensation and the St Helena legislative council this week passed a motion calling for an independent inquiry into the catalogue of errors, including where responsibility lies. Leading figures on the council this week demanded the release of further information from the UK government over when it knew there was likely to be a serious problem with unpredictable and dangerous wind speeds if Whitehall went ahead with building the airport. The international development secretary, Priti Patel, has responded to the criticism by saying she will establish a panel of experts to look into how the airport can be made to work. “Clearly some decisions were not up to scratch, but this is not a postmortem. It is about finding a solution,” a government source said. Ministers are resisting offering any compensation to those that made investments on the basis that as many as 30,000 tourists would fly to visit the remote but beautiful island. As a stop-gap measure, the Department for International Development has also agreed to an extension for RMS St Helena until next year. Built in 1990, the boat, which makes a four- to five-day trip from South Africa, had been due to be decommissioned but will continue as the island’s rusty lifeline.Although plans for an airport have been circulating in Whitehall for over a decade, DfID was warned of the risk of high winds in a Met Office report commissioned in October 2014 and completed in January 2015. The report, sent to the St Helena government, warned of alarming wind speeds, but the site for the airport had been chosen three years before that report.
In 2011, the then foreign secretary William Hague and the then international development secretary Andrew Mitchell nevertheless pressed ahead with the runway construction claiming it would be value for money, even though it was deemed high risk. After the construction of the airport, tests proved the wind shear was indeed dangerous. Some St Helena residents, represented by a 49-strong council, claim the fiasco means they have lost tens of thousands in modernising now empty hotels, eating into their savings. But the UK government-appointed governor of the island, Lisa Phillips, insisted in a letter to residents that ministers will not help out. She wrote: “I need to be clear that the St Helena government cannot be held liable for any losses for any businesses that anticipated a definite start date for operations. This was not in our gift and our communications have always stated this risk.” The chairman of the legislative council’s economic development committee, Henry Lawson, in a speech at the council this week called for an independent inquiry. “So much has been done to gather information about the wind conditions that exist at the airport, but sadly, much of this was after the runway has been laid and one has to question how such a monumental project can be carried out without doing these extensive tests before,” he said. “Who was responsible for approving the final runway design with the current alignment without first carrying out the necessary tests to ensure that aircraft could land safely from the approach that the runway was constructed for, taking into account also that the design of the runway is to enable landings from two approaches? “The question therefore, is why were there no further studies carried out into the severe weather conditions and the amount of turbulence that was known to exist before the final design and alignment of the runway was finalised?” Lawson added. In Britain, the Labour peer Lord Foulkes has taken up the issue and is pressing ministers to explain the sequence, and logic, of its flawed decision-making. He has asked the chair of the public accounts committee, Meg Hillier, to call in the relevant ministers. The investment in the airport has already been condemned as likely to be bad value for money by the National Audit Office. Foulkes says “islanders feel they have had to reply on leaks of information, giving the impression to islanders that they are facing a wall of silence. The latest panel of experts means further indefinite delay”. Lord Ashcroft, the former deputy chairman of the Conservative party who resigned from the Lords last year, has obtained a copy of the internal Met Office report. He said: “Why was the Met Office report only commissioned when the building work for the new airport was in its final stages, ie far too late to relocate the runway if it highlighted insurmountable problems? “Why was the Met Office report not immediately made public – or, at the very least, shared at once with ‘relevant parties’ so that they could make contingency plans?” Hazel Wilmot, the owner of the Consulate hotel on the island, has written to Foulkes to complain of the costs of expanding her hotel: “Had I known, I for one would not have embarked on the costly planning exercise, with architect’s fees, nor would I have proceeded with the major renovations at the hotel, employed extra staff to cope with the expected influx of tourists, purchased stock, fixtures, fittings, equipment and the like.” Whitehall sources suggest some of the complaints of lost income are questionable, but Patel, known for her determination to root out waste from her department, has a jumbo-sized mess to clear up. • This article was amended on 22 September 2016. An earlier version said Lord Ashcroft had taken leave of absence from the Lords. Ashcroft resigned from the Lords last year."
2016-09-21T13:50:12Z,uk-news,UK news,"'Fake Sheikh' had vested interest in Tulisa prosecution, court told","An undercover reporter conspired to tamper with evidence in the trial of pop singer Tulisa Contostavlos to protect his reputation and standing as “king of the sting”, a court has heard. Mazher Mahmood, 53, known as the Fake Sheikh, allegedly plotted with his driver Alan Smith, 67, to change a statement made to police which showed the former N-Dubz singer and X Factor judge disapproved of drugs, a jury was told. Opening the case for the prosecution, Sarah Forshaw QC told an Old Bailey jury: “Mr Mahmood may be the master of subterfuge and deception, but on this occasion it is he, together with his employee, who has been exposed.” Mahmood had posed as a wealthy Bollywood producer promising the singer and aspiring actor a lead role in a major film alongside Leonardo DiCaprio. She had allegedly arranged for the journalist to be sold half an ounce (14g) of cocaine by one of her contacts for £800, the jury heard. The journalist then published an exposé in the Sun and handed his “evidence” to police. Contostavlos faced trial for allegedly being concerned in the supply of the class A drug with Mahmood as the main prosecution witness, a jury heard. Mahmood and Smith are charged with conspiring together to do an act, namely that Smith would change a draft statement to police with the intention to pervert the course of justice between 22 June and 22 July Both deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Mahmood allegedly had a “vested” interest in the prosecution succeeding. “He liked to call himself the king of sting and had written a book in which he boasted of the number of convictions he was responsible for,” said Forshaw. Smith was his “achilles heel”, she added.
Smith had driven Contostavlos and two associates home after an alcohol-fuelled meeting with Mahmood in London, and later told police the singer had said in the car she disapproved of drugs because a family member was dependent on cocaine. He told the officer drafting his statement that the singer “seemed really negative about cocaine and expressed her disapproval of drugs”, the jury heard. Smith changed the statement the following day, removing the anti-drugs passage. Smith’s original statement was helpful to Contostavlos’s defence who, at a pre-trial hearing in June 2014, were arguing the case should be dismissed because she was the “victim of entrapment” and of an “elaborate deceit”, said Forshaw. “It’s how that change of account came about which lies at the heart of this case,”she added. The prosecution alleged Smith’s statement was changed the day before Mahmood was due to give evidence in that pre-trial hearing, following a “flurry” of texts and emails – since “deleted or destroyed” – between the journalist and his driver during which Mahmood was emailed Smith’s original statement. “In effect, the hearing in June 2014 put Mr Mahmood and his journalistic process on trial,” said Forshaw. “He knew that if it could be shown that he had acted improperly as an agent provocateur, inducing Miss Contostavlos to do something she would not otherwise do, his own credibility and standing and the prospect of conviction in the case might both be severely damaged.” During the pre-trial hearing at Southwark crown court, Mahmood was asked if he had discussed with Smith the comments made in the car, and said on oath that he had not. “It must have been obvious to Mr Mahmood he was being asked on oath if he had discussed with Smith the conversation in the car,” said Forshaw. “He deliberately misled the court – not only had he discussed it, but he had been sent a copy of the statement just three days earlier and he had read it.” The next month Mahmood was called to give evidence in the trial of Contostavlos. On the same morning Smith met Contostavlos’s defence lawyers and told them he had sent Mahmood a copy of his original statement because he was unhappy with it and wanted his advice. “The cat was out of the bag – and not only was the cat out of the bag it was in the hands of the defence solicitors,” said Forshaw. The following day, as Mahmood continued to give his evidence, he was asked if he had discussed the statement, said Forshaw. This time he replied “yes”. From his out-of-court communications with Smith “he must have known he could no longer sustain” what he had told the judge in the pre-trial hearing, said Forshaw. Mahmood then told the judge in the Contostavlos trial that he had not discussed the actual evidence with Smith, just the fact he was unhappy with the statement and had not gone into detail, said Forshaw. The trial of Contostavlos was then halted. In a statement read to the court, Contostavlos said that after the meeting with Mahmood, whom she believed to be a film producer called Samir Khan, at London’s Metropolitan hotel, she, her PA Gareth Varey and friend Michelle McKenna were all very drunk. She was “hyper drunk” rather than “sleepy drunk” and aware of her surroundings, she said. She started to sober up as Smith drove for 45 minutes to her Hertfordshire home and her memory of the journey was “quite vague”. She remembered “snippets and bullet points”, she said, including an argument with Varey. She also remembered a “fairly intense” conversation about a relative of hers and her concern about their “hard drugs use”. The singer said she had discussed these events with her legal team after she had been charged but before any issue over the statement by Smith was raised. Det Sgt Andrew Nicklin, who took Smith’s statement, said he had drafted it following a telephone conversation with the driver, and read it out over the phone to him. Smith had agreed it and gave no indication he was unhappy with the contents, he said. The following day Smith contacted him and asked him to remove the passage about the drugs conversation. Nicklin said: “He said he wasn’t sure now if he got it right. His focus was on driving and he asked me to remove it. He said ‘I can’t remember now who said what.’” He said Smith had described the journey to the singer’s Hertfordshire mansion as “horrendous”, with Varey and Contostavlos arguing, and Varey trying to get out of the moving car. During cross-examination from Trevor Burke QC, for Smith, Nicklin denied suggestions he had not read out the original statement on the phone to the driver before creating a PDF [digital document]. He agreed there could be some confusion over handwritten notes he took during his conversation with Smith, which occurred more than a year after the singer’s arrest, and what appeared in the statement. The case continues."
2016-09-21T13:58:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Northern Irish police raid homes of prominent republican family,"Northern Irish police have raided 15 homes, including some belonging to a prominent Irish republican family in a security operation directed at dissident republican activity. Four men were arrested after 15 houses were targeted by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in the Woodville area of Lurgan, north Armagh, on Wednesday morning. Mandy Duffy, a republican activist from North Armagh, confirmed in a Facebook post that the homes of her family were searched. “Here we go again … A number of Duffy family members’ homes currently being raided from early this morning … End British policing in Ireland!” Three of the four men detained, two aged 22 and the other 24, were arrested in Lurgan. A 46-year-old man was detained in Coalisland in Co Tyrone while PSNI officers with dogs raided the homes in Lurgan. All four men were taken to Belfast to be questioned by the PSNI. The Democratic Unionist MP for Upper Bann, David Simpson, said he backed the security operation but was worried about increasing reports of dissident activity in the area. The Ulster Unionist assembly member Doug Beattie said the searches highlighted “the proactive approach the PSNI have in disrupting this type of [dissident] activity”. Sinn Fein assemblywoman Catherine Seeley condemned those who had earlier left a suspect device nearby. “This security alert and house searches has brought nothing but disruption to the local community in the Kilwilkee estate,” she said. The Lurgan/Craigavon area is one of the few strongholds of dissident republican groups opposed to the power-sharing settlement in Northern Ireland. In 2009 gunmen from the Continuity IRA shot dead PC Stephen Carroll in Craigavon. He was the first-ever member of the reformed PSNI to be murdered by paramilitaries."

2016-09-21T16:18:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Huntsman cleared of deliberately riding horse into saboteur,"A huntsman has been cleared of deliberately injuring a saboteur by riding his horse into her. Peter Doggrell, 46, was found not guilty by a jury of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on Nicola Rawson. Rawson, 43, suffered seven broken ribs and a punctured lung when she was struck during a drag hunt on the Dorset-Somerset border. A video shown to the jury at Taunton crown court captured the moment when Rawson was sent reeling to the ground. She and colleagues were trying to disrupt the Blackmore and Sparkford Vale hunt. Doggrell told the jury he did not see the Dorset hunt saboteurs in the field nor hear their horn, which was being used to distract the 45 hounds. Asked how close he was when he became aware of the saboteurs, he replied: “I was more or less on top of them.” He denied being irritated or annoyed by the disruption to the drag hunt, in which hounds follow a scent. The prosecution had claimed he had up to 15 seconds to see the saboteurs’ Land Rover and was riding hard, saying it was a “reckless act’. He rode on after the contact but told police he thought it was a “glancing blow” and did not realise Rawson had been hurt until 20 minutes later. He was cleared after a three-day trial. Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said: “We are very pleased that Mr Doggrell has been found not guilty and that Miss Rawson, who was injured in this incident, has recovered. “There are, however, some serious questions to be asked about how this case ever got to court. That decision to prosecute Mr Doggrell has cost taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds and put him through a long, stressful and unnecessary process.”"
2016-09-21T16:36:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Ringleader of gang responsible for £113m fraud jailed for 11 years,"The head of a fraud ring has been sentenced to 11 years in prison for his part in a £113m scam, which funded purchases including a fleet of customised Porsches and shopping sprees at Harrods. Feezan Hameed, 23, partied with pop stars while splashing out on Rolex watches, jewellery and trips to Dubai, London’s Southwark crown court heard. The Glasgow-based criminal, known as Fizzy, owned several luxury cars including a Bentley and a Lamborghini, paid for from the takings of a £3m-a-month fraud, which involved duping victims over the phone into thinking they were having a conversation with their bank. He was eventually caught after targeting 750 RBS customers in the biggest cyberfraud the Metropolitan police had seen. It can be revealed that he was jailed for 11 years last week at Southwark crown court after restrictions were lifted. He admitted conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to convert and transfer criminal property. Hameed flew people 8,000 miles from Scotland to Pakistan to polish his fleet of Porsche Cayennes outside his villa in Lahore, the court heard. Michael Shorrock QC, prosecuting, described the fraud as “a nationwide conspiracy to defraud companies and businesses by hacking into their bank accounts and stealing large sums of money” between January 2013 and October 2015. “Literally within a blink of an eye, this money was being moved from one account to another,” he said. “The fraudsters were able to interfere with the telephone system of the bank customers, so the customer was unable to receive calls while the fraud was taking place.” Pitman Blackstock Solicitors were fleeced out of £2,260,625.89 after getting a call from someone called “Peter”, who claimed that he was from the security department of Lloyds Bank. In another instance, £750,000 was transferred in seconds. Hameed used aliases including “Simon Hughes” and “Matthew Fraser” and would tell unwitting customers that they had been hacked by “someone in Aberdeen called Stevenson or King”. He was the “leader and prime mover” and made almost all the calls, the court heard, making sure that they appeared to be coming from a location that would not arise suspicion. Hameed would claim to be a member of the bank fraud department when he called customers, before persuading them to reveal their internet banking details in a “very persuasive, very articulate” manner, Scotland Yard said. While Hameed kept victims talking, his associates would gain access to their bank accounts and empty them. The fraudsters used a “network of money mules” to disperse the cash, before it was laundered to Dubai and Pakistan. Between January 2013 and October 2015, the gang took £113m from victims, of which £47m has been recovered. The outstanding amount is believed to have been laundered from the UK. The scam was brought to an end in a series of police raids in Glasgow and the West Midlands last year. Hameed took £500,000-£1.5m a month, prosecutors said. He spent time with the Pakistani singer Bilal Saeed and claimed to have been producing a music video for him, the court heard. Hameed was arrested after trying to board a flight from Paris to Pakistan with a fake passport last November. He was then returned to the UK to face trial. DCI Andrew Gould said: “When they were at their height, when they’d really got the hang of this, they were probably making £1m-£2m a week. “It was a Monday-to-Friday, nine-to-five operation, and when they were busy and active, they were just smashing victims all day, every day, running their criminal business like a proper business.” The gang were extremely sophisticated in their techniques, displaying false telephone numbers on the phones of victims and disposing of prepaid phones and dongles once they had completed a hit. Hameed kept clear of the cash and was treated with “respect and deference” by the rest of the group, despite only being in his twenties. “He is very much the controlling guy, totally in charge,” Gould said. “The kind of guy that when he flies to Dubai for a weekend shopping with his chums, they all fly economy, he flies first class.” DC Neil O’Sullivan of the Metropolitan police’s Falcon (online crime and fraud) unit said: “This was the largest covert proactive operation the Met has ever undertaken against cyber-enabled crime.” Other members of the gang were also sentenced. Hameed’s brother Nouman Choudhary, 22, acted as the accountant, investing money in properties in Scotland and Pakistan. Nouman was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for conspiracy to launder money. A confiscation hearing is set for 3 May 2017. Abdul Iqbal, 23, of Edinburgh, was sentenced to 21 months for conspiracy to money launder. Hameed treated him as a butler or servant, but he received a £3,500 watch from the scheme and was present at Harrods when £70,000 was spent. Syed Ali Amish, 24, of Luton, Bedfordshire, was sentenced to 32 months for conspiracy to launder money. Mohammed Mehtab, 35, of Watford, Hertfordshire, was given an eight-month suspended prison sentence after pleading guilty to conspiracy to launder money. He allowed more than £9,000 to go through his account. Syed Haider, 31, of Slough, Berkshire, and Bilal Ahmed, 26, of Ilford, east London, are due to be sentenced later. They have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money."

2016-09-21T17:52:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Ben Needham case: excavations to begin on Greek island of Kos,"Excavations will begin on the Greek island of Kos next week in the search for Ben Needham, who went missing 25 years ago. Ben, from Sheffield, was 21 months old when he disappeared while on holiday with his mother and grandparents on 24 July 1991. Last week, police told his family to prepare for the worst after new evidence suggested Ben could have been crushed to death by a digger.
A statement from police said the new lines of inquiry had been “explored and investigated over the last three months” and would result in digs at two sites on the island, close to where Ben was last seen. “It is anticipated the first dig will take the team 10 to 12 days to complete,” said the police statement. “A cordon will be in place at the scene to protect the forensic work [...] to allow the team of officers to get on with the important task at hand. “Please be aware that it is entirely expected that the team will regularly come across bones in the ground as the site is former farmland. Any unusual items recovered will be subject to forensic testing.” In January last year, the Home Office agreed to give special grant funding to a team of British detectives to help search for Ben following a number of possible sightings and theories about what might have happened to him. Needham’s mother, Kerry, has never given up hope that Ben could still be alive. A spokesperson from the Find Ben Needham campaignsaid the group was feeling “nervous, scared and anxious”, adding: “As the dig for Ben’s remains starts next week, we are supporting the Needham family and each other as much as we can. The campaign has received thousands of comments, emails and messages of support which is simply overwhelming and goes to show Ben and the Needhams [are] in the heart of the nation at this time. “A few people have asked what is next for the Find Ben Needham campaign and the answer is the same as it always has been – to find Ben and, until the day he is found, we will never stop.”"
2016-09-21T20:19:50Z,uk-news,UK news,How many Londoners are switching from public transport to bicycles?,"The brand new Transport for London (TfL) board and its chair, Sadiq Khan, will on Thursday consider an upbeat account of the progress of cycling policies introduced by Boris Johnson. TfL commissioner Mike Brown’s written report documents a record-breaking July for Santander cycle hires, progress on delivering superhighways, quietways and suburban infrastructure schemes, and a 5% year-on-year increase in cycling journeys within central London’s congestion charge zone. See pages 24-27 (pdf). But there are many ways of measuring cycling’s effects on London’s transport habits. A “key outcome” listed in Johnson’s Vision for Cycling was creating hospitable routes on over-stuffed parts of the Underground and bus network with the aim of “prompting transfers to the bike and relieving crowding for everyone”. So how much switching from the Tube and the bus has been going on in London and are the trends encouraging? It’s difficult to quantify any distinct impact from Johnson’s policies, including cycling initiatives while he was mayor that pre-date the Vision (published in 2013), not least because their implementation is ongoing and much of the most ambitious stuff is still new. Even so, data TfL supplied me with from its annual London Travel Demand surveys of about 8,000 households provide interesting pointers to transport “modal shift” patterns over the past ten years. The short story told by the figures is, firstly, that increasing numbers of frequent Tube and bus users alike have also been getting around by bicycle and, secondly, that the rise has been greater among Tube-travellers. For example, in the 2005/08 period just under one in a hundred Londoners who used the Underground five or more times a week also made a trip by bicycle during that week. By 2012/15 the number had risen to 3.7 in every hundred. By comparison slightly more five-or-more-day-a-week bus passengers also cycled during that week – 1.36 in every hundred to be precise – between 2005/08 and by 2012/15 that frequency had risen to nearly three. So, an increase of more than double but a smaller one than the nearly four-fold hike among equivalent Tube-users, which has resulted in their overall likelihood of cycling overtaking that of bus-users. That general pattern – more cycling among both bus and Tube users, but especially the latter – holds to varying degrees almost all the way down the scale of frequency of bus and Tube use, with the largest increases among the most frequent Tube-users. What conclusions can be drawn from these numbers? Well, maybe that over-crowding on the Tube is more hellish than on buses. Maybe that the sorts of people who use the Tube a lot are more the like the sorts of people who cycle. Maybe both. They don’t, of course, tell us anything about any switching from private motor vehicles to cycles (TfL don’t have comparable data on that). They certainly underline that cycling has been becoming more popular in London although - to take the glass half empty position - they also confirm that the amount of cycling in London, while increasing in percentage terms, remains very small in absolute terms. Mike Brown’s report to the TfL board highlights strong growth in the use of the showcase central London superhighways, yet the most recent TfL Travel in London shows that although the estimated number of cycling journey stages - components of an excursion from A to B - rose from 400,000 a day in 2005 to 600,000 in 2014 (the most recent year for which figures were available), cycling still accounted for only 2% of journey stages by all modes of transport in Greater London as a whole throughout that period See pages 29 and 33 (pdf). Will cycling in London increase at a greater rate in years to come and, if it does, to what extent will that be attributable to Johnson’s schemes bedding in and newer ones from his successor as mayor coming on stream? Will it be possible to tell? Discuss."
2016-09-21T20:37:15Z,uk-news,UK news,MI6 to recruit hundreds more staff in response to digital technology,"The UK’s overseas intelligence agency is to recruit hundreds more staff over the next four years in response to the pace of change in digital technology. MI6, which employs 2,500 people at present, deals with intelligence-gathering and operations abroad, while MI5 is responsible for security within the UK. The government announced last year that the security services would be given 1,900 additional staff – and MI6 is the main beneficiary. BBC’s Newsnight put the rise in staff for MI6 at 1,000 but it is believed to be fewer than that, though still substantial. There is increasing reliance by worldwide intelligence agencies upon the internet, social media and changes such as facial recognition; rather than the running of agents as in the past.
One fear is that easier access to information, tracking and cross-checking can also be used against MI6 operatives. The head of MI6, Alex Younger, speaking in Washington DC on Tuesday, said: “The information revolution fundamentally changes our operating environment. In five years’ time there will be two sorts of intelligence services: those that understand this fact and have prospered, and those that don’t and haven’t. And I’m determined that MI6 will be in the former category. “The third and most important part of British intelligence is the surveillance agency GCHQ, which in partnership with the US National Security Agency, is responsible for scooping up most of the intelligence through tracking phone calls, emails, chat lines and other communications.” Younger expressed concern about enemies also exploiting these new capabilities. He said: “Our opponents, who are unconstrained by conditions of lawfulness or proportionality, can use these capabilities to gain increasing visibility of our activities which means that we have to completely change the way that we do stuff.” Both the NSA and GCHQ relied heavily on cooperation from the major internet companies but that relation was badly damaged by the revelations of the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013. The internet companies not only faced a backlash from customers concerned about their privacy but were displeased on discovering that, in spite of their cooperation, the agencies were accessing their information anyway through backdoor channels. Younger said: “I think that the real issue for us has been the effect that this has had on the levels of trust between the intelligence communities internationally and the technology community where I think that the right and proper response to the common threats that face us is through community of effort and teamwork between those different groups. And to the extent that those revelations damaged and undermined the trust that needs to exist, I think it is highly problematic.” Asked about the threat posed by groups such as al-Qaida and Islamic State, Younger said: “I would like to be optimistic about this but we have got quite a long experience of this phenomenon now and I see it very much as the flip-side to some very deep-seated global trends, not least of all globalisation: the reduction of barriers between us. “It’s a function also of the information revolution and the capacity for ideas to travel. It is fuelled by a deepening sectarian divide in the Middle East and there are some deep social economic and demographic drivers to the phenomenon that we know as terrorism. Allied with the emergence of state failure this means that, regrettably, this is an enduring issue which will certainly be with us, I believe, for our professional lifetime.” At the conference, staged by the Central Intelligence Agency and George Washington University, Younger said increased cooperation between agencies and improvements in the way governments tackled terror were “doing a great deal to mitigate the threat”."
2016-09-21T21:00:31Z,uk-news,UK news,National living wage 'failing to provide basic needs for lowest paid',"The “national living wage” falls short of providing a decent standard of income to low-paid staff because of rising rents and slowing wages growth, say campaigners against low pay. After a six-month review, the Living Wage Commission said it had assessed the “best available evidence on living standards” and concluded that the £7.20 an hour national living wage (NLW) for the over 25s, introduced in April, was failing to provide the basic needs of low-paid households. The commission said the fall in take-home pay across the country after the 2008 banking collapse, and slow wages growth in the past eight years, had left millions of workers struggling to make ends meet. Wages need to increase at a faster rate than rising rents, petrol prices and heating bills to continue closing the gap with higher-paid workers, the commission said. The report will come as a blow to employers that have reported a decline in profits after the introduction of the NLW. Last week John Lewis warned of job losses in its department stores to fund salary rises after promising to keep wages above the new minimum level. Shares of Mitie lost more than a quarter of their value this week after the cleaning and elderly care businesscited the cost of paying the NLW as a reason why clients’ budgets had been squeezed. The NLW, announced by the former chancellor George Osborne, was expected to increase the wages of 2.5 million low-paid workers, after lifting them above the £6.70 minimum wage. Ignoring the pleas of business representatives, Osborne said the NLW should rise to £9 an hour by 2020 to achieve the government’s objective of ensuring that the low paid earned at least 60% of median earnings by 2020. The Living Wage Commission, a charity that lobbies for a voluntary £9.40 London living wage and £8.25 nationally, said full-time workers on the higher rate earned about £80 more than workers paid the NLW in London and £40 more a week than those paid the NLW nationally. Gavin Kelly, chair of the commission, said: “This review marks the next phase of the living wage campaign for decent pay and provides a robust and up-to-date analysis of the wage needed for people to meet their everyday costs in London and the UK. “The findings make clear that the living wage benchmark in the capital is going to have to rise in the years ahead if people are to be able to get by. With living standards set for sluggish growth in the years to come, the need for employers to pay the independent living wage rates is stronger than ever.” Ikea, National Grid, Nestlé, the cosmetics retailer Lush and independent brewer BrewDog are among the employers to pay workers the charity’s higher living wage. Osborne handed the task of assessing how much to increase the NLW to the Low Pay Commission, a government-appointed body that decides the annual minimum wage increases. It is expected to limit yearly increases after listening to objections from business leaders. But employers have lobbied the Treasury and the Low Pay Commission to limit the impact of the NLW, arguing that a steep rise would be an unsustainable burden for many firms when the economy was expected to slow over the next year. Responding to the Living Wage Commission report, Josh Hardie, deputy director general of the employers’ body the CBI, , said the higher Living Wage Commission rate was a good guide for employers who can afford to pay it. But, he added: “We should also recognise that it is a stretch for many firms in some sectors – especially amongst smaller firms in retail, hospitality and care – who would be forced to employ fewer staff or offer shorter hours if their bottom pay rate rose too high. “That’s why it’s right that the Living Wage Commission maintains its voluntary target, and we also have a statutory minimum wage, set by the independent Low Pay Commission and taking into account possible effects on employment opportunities if the rate is unaffordable. But Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, encouraged all employers to pay the independent living wage. She said UK workers were still paid less than before the financial crisis in 2007 after the largest fall in wages of any developed country except Greece. “The government’s increased minimum wage for workers over 25 is a step in the right direction, but it’s not enough to live on,” she said. The best benchmark for what workers need to live on is the independent living wage rate set annually based on the cost of living.” This article was amended on 22 September 2016. A previous version stated the Living Wage Commission had called for a rise in the national living wage."
2016-09-22T05:00:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan sets up inquiry into garden bridge project's use of public money,"The fate of London’s proposed garden bridge has been placed in jeopardy after the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, announced a formal inquiry into whether the controversial project is worth the £60m of public money pledged to it. Dame Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who spent five years grilling chief executives and senior civil servants as head of parliament’s public accounts committee, will lead a review into the planned £185m structure across the Thames, from Temple to the South Bank. While Hodge’s inquiry is not explicitly tasked with considering whether the project should be built, it piles further pressure on a troubled and delayed scheme that has yet to raise the private donations needed, or to clear all the necessary planning hurdles. Unlike the previous mayor, Boris Johnson, Khan is notably more sceptical about the planned bridge, intended to feature 270 trees and thousands of plants, and has promised no more public money will be spent on it. If Hodge’s report concludes the bridge does not provide value for money – and she is known to be suspicious of expensive public projects in the uncertainty following Brexit – it could potentially be the prompt for Khan to reconsider the scheme. Hodge’s remit will be to assess the public sector contribution to the project and “whether value for money has been achieved”, as well as to examine the way Transport for London (TfL), the Greater London Authority and other bodies dealt with the proposal. There has been previous criticism that under Johnson’s mayoralty the project was not properly scrutinised, and that the decision to award the design contact to the studio of the London 2012 Games torch designer Thomas Heatherwick was less than fully transparent. Supporters argue the bridge will become a landmark, and provide a much-needed pedestrian link in central London. Opponents, however, question the use of such large sums of government money for a privately owned structure in an already thriving part of an economically dominant capital. Khan said he was adamant the trust would not get a bailout if it hit trouble, and that the project had not shown “the necessary standard of transparency and openness”.
He added: “Nearly £40m of public money has already been spent on the garden bridge project, and Londoners deserve far more information about the decisions that have been made around how their money is being spent.” Hodge said that while she took no view on the bridge itself, “it is clear that there needs to be far more transparency around how funds are being spent”. Of the bridge’s total cost, £30m has been given by the Department for Transport and the same amount from TfL, though two-thirds of this latter sum was later made into a long-term loan. Around £37m of the public money has already been spent by the Garden Bridge Trust, prompting Khan to argue shortly after his election in May that it would cost more to cancel than to proceed. However, since then there have been more doubts about the project’s viability. In August it emerged that several private donors had pulled out, meaning the trust had to raise more than £50m more of the £115m in necessary private funding, rather than another £30m. On Monday Joanna Lumley, the actor who came up with the idea of the bridge, said in an interview that the Garden Bridge Trust, on whose board she sits, was struggling to secure a vital consent needed before construction can begin. The south side of the bridge will be sited on land leased long term to a community housing trust, Coin Street, which must agree to its lease being amended. It had yet to do so, and Lumley told BBC Radio London that Coin Street’s leaders seemed “very opposed” to the project. Coin Street denies this, but has set a series of conditions on any deal, which the Garden Bridge Trust is struggling to meet. One source familiar with the talks said there had been no discussions for several months, and that Coin Street had worries about the trust’s ability to deliver the project. A Garden Bridge Trust spokeswoman said Lumley had been mistaken in thinking that Coin Street opposed the project, but agreed that time was pressing: “We’ve been talking to Coin Street for three years now, and they still haven’t agreed a deal with us. Things are becoming quite urgent and it would be nice to make some progress with them.” Initial construction on the bridge was due to have started earlier this year, but will now not begin until 2017 at the earliest, obliging the trust to agree a new timetable with contractors."
2016-09-22T08:45:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Crane fire on M40 and Dartford tunnel closure cause traffic chaos,"An exploding crane and a tunnel closure have caused chaos on two major motorways, leaving motorists stuck in traffic for up to five hours. About 35 firefighters were called to tackle a blaze on the London-bound carriageway of the M40 in Buckinghamshire, after the 96-tonne crane burst into flames on Wednesday night. And in Kent, motorists approaching the Dartford Crossing queued for up to five hours after one of the two tunnels was closed overnight. There were no reports of injuries from the crane fire but witnesses spoke of hearing a number of explosions.

The crane, near Gerrards Cross between junctions 2 and 1a, caught alight near a gantry after a large spillage of hydraulic fluid. Police closed the southbound carriageway and one lane northbound, but the clearup is expected to last much of Thursday, and Highways England warned motorists heading to London to expect long delays. A specialist lifting team has removed the crane from the motorway, but one lane remains closed heading towards the capital while debris is cleared. A Highways England spokesman said: â€œThe lane closure will remain in place all day for safety reasons due to serious damage on the road surface, which is planned to be resurfaced tonight. Road users are advised to plan ahead.â€� In Kent, travellers reported being left trapped on gridlocked roads on their approach to the Dartford Crossing overnight. Some took to social media to vent their frustrations:

And another driver, Marc Tuohey, wrote: â€œHighways England please do something with the Dartford tunnel. Itâ€™s long overdue and it isnâ€™t like it doesnâ€™t self-fund.â€� The delays come after more than 11,000 people signed an online petition calling for a public inquiry into the crossingâ€™s operation amid claims that improvement works have been botched."
2016-09-22T09:50:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Rotherham cuts threaten obesity clinic set up after Jamie Oliver campaign,"A pioneering obesity clinic in Rotherham established following a healthy eating campaign in the town by TV chef Jamie Oliver may be forced to close due to funding cuts. The Rotherham Institute of Obesity is one of 21 public health services under review by the local council after it was forced to cut £1.3m from its budget by the government.
Clinical manager Dr Matt Capehorn said that any cuts to the clinic’s funding would leave them unable to operate. “We’re very concerned for the population of Rotherham,” he said. According to local authority figures, around 73% of adults in the South Yorkshire town are overweight and obese, leading it to being dubbed “fat capital” of the UK. “We see on average about 1,500 patients referred to [the institute] each year and our budget is £300,000 from the local authority,” Capehorn told the BBC. “Even a small financial cut means we would have to close.” Labour councillor Chris Read said: “The fact that we’re losing £2m over this three-year period will affect that and the council has no choice but to reduce those services.” Local MP Sarah Champion has called on the local authority not to cut the service, saying it was “literally saving lives” in her constituency. The Rotherham Institute for Obesity, or RIO, is part of the NHS Rotherham Weight Management Strategy which won the 2009 NHS health and social care award for best commissioned service. It provides a counselling service, cooking classes and diet planning to patients. In 2011 the clinic came under fire for its use of public money. The service spent £775,000 treating 1,600 overweight adults and 200 children over 18 months, equating to £60 for every pound of weight lost. Champion said: “[Rotherham metropolitan borough council] is facing £1.3m government cuts to public health so I understand they have to make tough choices, but closing RIO is the wrong decision. “RIO is more than just a weight loss clinic. It empowers people, gives them their lives back and turns them into ambassadors for healthy living. “Public health investment is all about prevention, which saves money in the long term. If people aren’t supported to lose weight they may have health complications, suffer from social isolation and even mental health issues. Treatment for these resulting conditions would be much more than addressing the weight.” In 2006, a backlash against Jamie Oliver’s healthy school dinners campaign saw parents taking lunchtime fast food orders for pupils at the Rawmarsh community school. Oliver went on to set up his Ministry of Food in the town, which aimed to teach the town’s residents how to cook healthy, cheap and appetising meals."
2016-09-22T10:13:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Number of terrorist prisoners  in UK jails hits record high,"The number of terrorist prisoners held in British jails has reached a new peak of 152 – 50 higher than five years ago, according to the latest set of quarterly Home Office figures. The record number of terrorist prisoners follows the Acheson review, which warned of complacency and growing Islamic extremism in jails, and the decision to push ahead with specialist high-security units to separate the most subversive inmates. The latest statistics show that 125 of the 152 prisoners, or 84%, have been convicted for terror or terrorism-related offences. The remaining 27 prisoners are on remand awaiting trial. A further 13 prisoners are inside for domestic extremism or “separatism” offences, such as Irish republicanism. This latter figure has fallen from a peak of 70 in March 2015.
The quarterly Home Office terrorism figures show that arrests for terror-related offences fell by a third in the year to June 2016 from 330 to 222, bringing the number of arrests back to a level similar to that in the years before last year’s spike.
The fall in terror arrests in Britain came despite the heightened awareness of the threat after the wave of Isis attacks in France and Belgium earlier this year. The Crown Prosecution Service counter-terrorism division reported the completion of 62 terrorist trials in the 12 months to June 2016, of which 54 resulted in a conviction. More people were sentenced to longer periods in jail for terrorist offences, with the number given a life sentence rising from one to seven. Those sentenced to between four and 10 years rose from nine to 21. The number of people stopped and searched by the Metropolitan police under counter-terror powers rose 26% to 552, of which 12% led to an arrest. Despite the increase this is still half the level of 1,154 “section 43” anti-terror stop and searches carried out by the Met in 2010/11, but with a far lower arrest rate. The number of people stopped and examined at airports and ports on their way in and out of the country fell by 23% in the year to June 2016 to 23,300 examinations under the Terrorism Act 2000. The use of these port powers has fallen consistently year on year and compares with 65,684 carried out in 2010/11."
2016-09-22T10:28:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Police search for gang who fled raid in London on mobility scooter,"Police are searching for a gang who used a mobility scooter as a getaway vehicle after a raid on a pharmacy in Dagenham, east London. The Metropolitan police have released CCTV footage of a bald man driving away from the shop with cash from the till. Three other men also took part in the raid at Kry BA Chemists in May. The same four men are suspected of being involved in another burglary at a cosmetics centre in Dagenham in August. It is not known whether a mobility scooter was used in the earlier raid. CCTV cameras outside Kry BA Chemists caught the moment when two men used a crowbar to break into the shop. Footage released by the Met shows a till being taken out of the store and given to the man on the mobility scooter. In a statement, the Met said the man was “able to travel quickly away from the store”. Mobility scooters have a maximum speed of 8mph, limited to 4mph on pavements. The getaway driver is described as white, bald, wearing dark clothing and driving a dark mobility scooter. Police want to hear from anyone who may recognise any of the four men or witnessed either of the burglaries. Those with information are asked to call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
2016-09-22T13:06:59Z,uk-news,UK news,UK military investigating hundreds of alleged abuses in Afghanistan,"The political row over legal action against British soldiers who served overseas has intensified after the Ministry of Defence confirmed that more than 120 royal military police (RMP) personnel are investigating alleged abuses in Afghanistan. The scale of the inquiry into claims that British troops mistreated Afghan detainees between 2005 and 2013 has expanded to include more than 600 allegations made by 150 individuals.
The investigation, known as Operation Northmoor, based in Newquay, Cornwall, employs 124 RMP soldiers, according to the MoD. One of the cases is understood to involve Serdar Mohammed, who was captured by UK soldiers in April 2010, but not handed over to the Afghan security services until July that year, despite regulations requiring any transfer to take place within 96 hours. Mohammed was eventually released to return to his home in Helmand province. He claimed that the Afghan authorities tortured him. Commenting on the investigation, an MoD spokesperson said: “Our armed forces are rightly held to the highest standards and, whilst rare, where there are credible claims of criminal behaviour, we should investigate them. An independent investigation is the best way to make sure that innocent personnel are not dragged through the courts without cause – none of the Op Northmoor allegations investigated have so far been referred to the Service Prosecution Authority.” When Mohammed won his claim for mistreatment at the court of appeal last year, the judges – the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas, Lord Justice Lloyd Jones and Lord Justice Beatson – also expressed misgivings about UK forces overseas being subject to the European convention on human rights (ECHR) rather than the Geneva conventions on warfare. In their judgment, they referred to “significant reservations in respect of the correctness of the decision extending the ECHR to the battlefield”. On Thursday Theresa May discussed the issue of legal claims against soldiers during a meeting with defence chiefs which also covered armed forces recruitment and the fight against Islamic State. A spokeswoman for the prime minister said she stressed that abuse of the legal system must be prevented and troops protected from vexatious claims. Continued investigations and legal actions against British troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan have led to increasingly acrimonious relations between the government and human rights lawyers. Two law firms, Leigh Day and Public Interest Lawyers in Birmingham, are facing disciplinary action after the government lodged complaints with the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) over Iraq cases commenced by both firms. Both firms deny any wrongdoing. The Law Society accused the government on Thursday of attempting to undermine the rule of law by intimidating solicitors who pursue legitimate cases. Its president, Robert Bourns, said: “The rule of law protects and holds every single one of us accountable, from the most powerful to the most vulnerable. “Military personnel should have the ability to pursue claims for wrongdoing and should also be held to account if their conduct breaches international laws. Lawyers are also held to account if their actions violate their professional code of ethics or break the law. Each case must be based on merit, without prejudice. “Lawyers must not be hindered or intimidated in carrying out their professional duties and acting in the best interests of their clients within the law. They should not be identified with their clients or clients’ cases. This principle is set out in the United Nations basic principles on the role of lawyers. “The right to access to justice for all depends on lawyers being able to represent their clients’ cases within our framework of laws, no matter how the client or case may be perceived by the public, media or government. The merits of each case are decided by the relevant court, a function that is and must remain separate from government.”
In an article for the Guardian, the director of Liberty, Martha Spurrier, defended the application of human rights standards to the battlefield. “Soldiers at war,” she argued, “need a set of legal principles that they can operate within. But this is what the laws of war, including human rights, provide. The lawyers who drafted the European convention on human rights – many of them British Conservatives – made clear that it applies during wartime, tailoring its requirements to the necessities of conflict.” A spokesperson for Leigh Day said: “We understand the RMP are actively investigating a handful of our clients’ cases which were referred to the RMP by the MoD. We have no confirmation from the RMP that the case of Serdar Mohammed is amongst these cases. “These investigations are separate from the civil cases brought by Leigh Day on behalf of Afghan citizens which are all brought against the MoD, not individual soldiers and concern allegations of unlawful detention, abuse whilst in detention and unlawful killings.” The European court of human rights in Strasbourg on Thursday rejected a claim that the Dutch government should have prosecuted three Dutch soldiers who were members of the UN peacekeeping force in Srebrenica at the time of the 1995 massacre of civilians during the Bosnian war. Relatives of the victims claimed Dutch soldiers should not have ordered them to leave the safe UN compound."
2016-09-22T13:31:54Z,uk-news,UK news,Champion fell-runner Lauren Jeska admits attempted murder,"A champion fell-runner has pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of a UK Athletics official at an athletics stadium in Birmingham. Lauren Jeska, from Machynlleth in Powys, admitted trying to kill Ralph Knibbs, who is head of human resources and welfare at the sport’s British governing body as well as a former professional rugby player. Jeska, 41, was previously listed as a member of Todmorden Harriers on the West Yorkshire-based club’s website. She was described as the women’s 2010, 2011 and 2012 English fell-running champion, who also won the British Championship in 2012. According to West Midlands police, officers were called to the Alexander Stadium in Birmingham, the headquarters of UK Athletics, just before 10.30am on 22 March after reports that a 51-year-old man had been stabbed in the head and neck, suffering “life-threatening injuries”. Appearing via videolink at Birmingham crown court on Thursday, Jeska also pleaded guilty to two counts of unlawful and malicious wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm on two other men. Tim Begley and Kevin Taylor, who also work for UK Athletics, had stepped in to help Knibbs as he was attacked. Their injuries were described in court as “not of the most serious order”. Jeska pleaded guilty to further charges of possession of knives in a public place – a 12cm kitchen knife and 13cm kitchen knife – but she denied possessing a bread knife which had been left in a bag before the attack. Knibbs, a former Bristol RFC centre, who represented England at under-23 level, turned down the opportunity to tour with England in South Africa in 1984 in protest against apartheid. He was in court to hear Jeska enter her pleas from a video conferencing suite at HMP Foston Hall in Derbyshire. Judge Philip Parker QC was told that the defendant had been the subject of psychiatric assessment but further reports would be necessary before she is sentenced on 15 November. After Jeska’s pleas were entered, defence counsel Julie Warburton said a diagnosis of autism may be raised at the next hearing, which would be invited to consider whether a “medical disposal” would be available to the sentencing judge. A spokesman for UK Athletics said: “We are pleased that today’s admission brings to a close a difficult period for our colleagues following the unprovoked attack on Mr Knibbs and staff at our Alexander Stadium head office in Birmingham earlier this year. “UK Athletics would like to place on the record a number of thanks following events on 22 March. A thank you to staff who reacted quickly in restraining the individual concerned, putting themselves at risk. “A thank you to staff who worked calmly and yet with urgency to apply what was life-saving first aid to Mr Knibbs. Finally, a thank you to all staff and colleagues not only of UK Athletics but also England Athletics and Birmingham city council, who not only assisted with first aid to Mr Knibbs and the police investigation with witness statements and detailed accounts, but most crucially have supported each other in the aftermath of the incident.”"
2016-09-22T13:44:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Met police acknowledge lack of sensitivity over spit hoods plan,"The commissioner of the Metropolitan police has said that the force should have been more sensitive about the introduction of spit hoods, after plans to use them in London were met with an outcry. However, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told the London assembly’s police and crime committee that he did not think that the use of the hoods, already in place across 18 British police forces and approved by the National Police Chiefs’ Council, was particularly contentious. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, earlier this month ordered a pause in the plan to introduce the use of spit hoods in the capital’s custody suites, which had been approved by the Met without his knowledge. Responding to questions as to whether there ought to have been more engagement with the public, Hogan-Howe said: “Probably we should have been more sensitive to what you’ve described and we take that on the chin and accept it. “The dilemma that we have is we have significant number of officers bitten or spit at each year. I think over the last three years we’ve had 264 officers spit at, I think another one last night who was spit at as they arrested someone for a firearms offence, and then we’ve had … 498 incidents over the past five years of biting.” Hogan-Howe said the decision to introduce the mesh hoods, which cover the whole of a suspect’s head, making it impossible for them to spit at or bite officers, was not taken lightly and was discussed five times at the Met’s policy forum. “We thought in the end that it wasn’t too intrusive a tactic and the way of mitigating any concerns that people may have was to make sure it was in a very controlled environment,” he said, referring to the decision to restrict their use to custody suites. He added: “Perhaps we didn’t anticipate the emotional response and the proper interest that people have.” The use of spit hoods by British police was highlighted in July, after witnesses filmed four British Transport Police officers pinning a 20-year-old man to the ground at London Bridge station and pulling a hood over his head. He was later released after accepting a caution for an offence under section five of the Public Order Act. The incident is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Freedom of information requests by the Guardian later revealed that the practice had been used more than 500 times since last year, and on children as young as 13, mostly by a handful of provincial police forces. Scotland Yard’s plan to begin using the tactic at 32 police station custody suites was revealed only after questions to the force, prompting Khan, who was unaware of the plan, to ask them to postpone the pilot. Hogan-Howe said teething problems surrounding the handover from the previous mayoral administration had left Khan and his team unaware of the plan. “This was our decision prior to the mayor and deputy mayor arriving,” he said. “We didn’t raise it with the new mayor or deputy mayor. I’ve already acknowledged that probably, with retrospect, we didn’t anticipate the response because we didn’t think it was such a big issue. But clearly for people it has been.” Martha Spurrier, the director of Liberty, earlier this month described spit hoods as “primitive, cruel and degrading” tools. “Spit hoods belong in horror stories, not on the streets of a civilised society. We urge the Met police to think again,” she said."
2016-09-22T14:50:17Z,uk-news,UK news,'Fake Sheikh' trial: police officer tells of surprise at changed statement,"A police officer has told a court of his surprise when a potential witness in the trial of the singer Tulisa Contostavlos changed his evidence. Mazher Mahmood, 53, known as the Fake Sheikh, and his driver Alan Smith, 67, are accused of altering a statement made to police that revealed the former N-Dubz singer and X Factor judge disapproved of drugs in order to prevent questions being raised over a newspaper sting against her. Mahmood, seeking a scoop, had posed as a wealthy Bollywood producer promising the singer and aspiring actor a lead role in a major film alongside Leonardo DiCaprio. Contostavlos had allegedly arranged for the journalist to be sold half an ounce (14g) of cocaine by one of her contacts for £800, the jury at the Old Bailey heard. As a result Contostavlos faced trial for allegedly being concerned in the supply of the class A drug. But the case was halted when it emerged Smith, who had driven Contostavlos and two associates home after an alcohol-fuelled night with Mahmood in London, had changed the original version of events he gave to police after contact with the reporter. He told DS Andrew Nicklin, who was drafting his statement on 23 June 2014, that the singer “seemed really negative about cocaine and expressed her disapproval of drugs”, the jury heard. But Smith changed the statement the following day, removing the anti-drugs passage. At the Old Bailey on Thursday, Nicklin said of the change: “I was surprised. There was no doubt about the statement earlier and it was the most significant part of his statement.” He said he had previously read Smith’s initial statement back to him without him raising any objections. “I remember him saying yes, yes, yes, repeatedly,” Nicklin told the court. The jury also heard that about a month after taking Smith’s account of events, Nicklin, in a witness statement, wrote that the driver told him after informing the officer of the singer’s comments about her disapproval of drugs: “I know it doesn’t help your case [against Contostavlos].” But Nicklin later removed that line from his witness statement, he told the court, because he was not satisfied he could accurately remember what was said. Prosecuting, Sarah Forshaw QC said Nicklin emailed the draft statement to Smith the next day. She said email and call data showed that in approximately six minutes after Smith accessed his email account for the first time after being sent the draft, there were eight text messages sent back and forth between the defendants, and that Smith made a six-second call to Mahmood. Longer calls followed, as well as more texts, and both defendants accessed their email accounts. Mahmood, a reporter with the Sun and Sun on Sunday, also called the legal department of the Times, which has the same owner as the tabloids. Later that day, Smith called Nicklin requesting that his statement be changed. Communication between Mahmood and Smith continued the next morning when the amended statement was sent by Nicklin to Smith. The contents of the emails and texts are not available because they were deleted or destroyed the court heard. Mahmood and Smith are charged with conspiring together to do an act, namely that Smith would change a draft statement to police, with the intention to pervert the course of justice. Both deny the charge. The case continues."
2016-09-22T16:05:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Families take legal action over stalled Troubles inquests,"The families of dozens of people killed during Northern Ireland’s Troubles have launched a legal attempt to force the state to hold inquests into the deaths of their loved ones. Members of more than 30 families from both unionist and nationalist backgrounds delivered notice of the challenge by hand to the Stormont offices of the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire. The victims include many who died in controversial circumstances at the hands of security forces. The families have given the Northern Ireland Office and the power-sharing executive at Stormont 14 days to release funds that would allow the inquests to begin.
Rita Bonner, whose brother John Laverty was shot dead by British soldiers in Ballymurphy, west Belfast in 1971, said the failure to hold an inquest into his and other deaths was a “total and utter disgrace”. “In any other democratic society we wouldn’t be standing here. We shouldn’t have to be standing here pleading for our inquest to be opened,” she said. Nichola Baxter, whose cousin Craig McCausland was killed by loyalist paramilitaries in 2005, said the families were being denied closure. “I come from a unionist background. We are waiting 11 years for an inquest and therefore a death certificate, simple things that the law says we are entitled to as families,” she said. “We are not getting answers and it’s the same for everybody here. A lot of people here are waiting longer than 11 years and it’s an absolute disgrace.” Padraigh O Muirigh, a lawyer for the families, said the Westminster and Stormont administrations were in breach of their legal obligations to ensure inquests took place. “I believe the British government are ignoring a warning from the Council of Europe and also from the lord chief justice,” he said. “Very clearly, they are in breach of their human rights application on this issue.” The lord chief justice for Northern Ireland, Sir Declan Morgan, has demanded the creation of a special unit to deal with the backlog of inquests into some of the most controversial killings of the Troubles. Morgan said the devolved government in Belfast should fund the new unit. A range of organisations representing victims of the Troubles say there are 57 legacy inquests that need to be held, relating to about 100 killings during 25 years of violence."
2016-09-22T17:00:40Z,uk-news,UK news,BBC to be ‘unashamedly Hull-centric’ during city’s year in cultural spotlight,"There will be Bacon’s Screaming Popes, Spiders from Mars, the world premiere of a new Richard Bean play and a particularly important and surprise commitment from the director general of the BBC: from 1 January 2017 Hull will always be on the weather map. To cheers, Tony Hall made the pledge at the launch of the programme for Hull UK City of Culture, adding that the BBC would be “unashamedly Hull-centric in 2017”. Hull was named UK City of Culture after the success of Derry’s inaugural year in 2013. Both follow the transformative examples of Glasgow and Liverpool, which were European Capitals of Culture in 1990 and 2008 respectively. What that means is a budget of £32m and a blizzard of arts and culture in the city over 365 days. Among the details announced on Thursday was a new Bean play, The Hypocrite, which will premiere at Hull Truck theatre in February before transferring to the RSC in Stratford. Bean said the play, a comedy, was inspired by the life of Sir John Hotham and his role in making Hull the place where the English civil war started.
Bean, who wrote One Man, Two Guvnors, was born in Hull and proud of it. “If you are born here you know Hull is a great city and I always felt extraordinarily privileged. “When I got older and started writing plays I realised, thank God I wasn’t born in Guildford. Thank God I was born somewhere there is tragedy and comedy every other second.” The distinctiveness of Hull will be a key part of the year’s programme. Martin Green, the CEO and director of Hull 2017, said that the city was a place which was countercultural, quirky and questioning and that the opening season had been “wrenched from the fabric of the city”. It is a programme that has edge and takes risks, such as in the planned retrospective exploring the work and legacy of COUM Transmissions, a subversive collective founded in Hull in the late 1960s – one which was described by Conservative MP Nicholas Fairbairn as the “wreckers of western civilisation”. There will be four distinct seasons in the year, the first called Made in Hull, curated by the documentary film-maker Sean McAllister. Among the highlights will be a four-day season of Nordic music curated by the singer-songwriter John Grant; the transformation by Opera North of the Humber Bridge into a piece of music; a season of films by Anthony Minghella; and a retrospective celebrating the work of ambient music pioneer Basil Kirchin. There will also be a homecoming show for David Bowie’s backing band the Spiders from Mars which featured local boys Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick “Woody” Woodmansey. The plan on 25 March is for a live rendition of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders from Mars in its entirety, by the band Holy Holy – featuring Woodmansey, Tony Visconti and Heaven 17’s Glenn Gregory. One of Hull’s shiniest jewels is its Ferens art gallery which will reopen in January after a £4.5m refurbishment. It will display its permanent collection, containing works by artists from Frans Hals to Barbara Hepworth and Mark Wallinger. They will be joined by an early 14th-century devotional work which the gallery bought in 2013 and which it is hoping will be a true star. Pietro Lorenzetti’s Christ Between Saints Paul and Peter has been through four years of research and conservation at the National Gallery and will be revealed for the first time in January, joined by loans of other early Sienese paintings.
There will be a slew of significant loans in the year including five of Francis Bacon’s Screaming Pope works; Rembrandt’s The Shipbuilder and his Wife from the Royal Collection; and Manet’s Le Déjeuner sur l’Herbe from the Courtauld. Hull is being helped by arts organisations across the UK to, it hopes, make it the buzziest place to be in 2017. In the autumn, Hull will host the 2017 Turner prize. But not everything has gone to plan. The city hoped to be able to borrow Jason, the De Havilland Gipsy Moth plane flown by Hull-born aviator Amy Johnson, from the Science Museum. It was impossible to move, said Green, so instead they have funded a replica – built by prisoners. “The idea that there are prisoners building a plane,” he said. “I think that is very of this city.” Green, who was head of ceremonies for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, promised that the year of culture was the start of a far bigger council-driven 30-year plan for Hull. “Legacy” would be more than just a word. “I’ve been around the block a bit on these things and this is the most well-prepared, well-funded and thought through legacy programme I have ever seen.” And of course there is the question of Hull and BBC weather maps, which several people had raised, said Hall. “Sometimes it’s there, quite often it is not. I’ve just made a telephone call and I can tell you that as of Jan 1 2017 Hull will be there on every weather map, national and local. And as we’re talking about legacy … 2018, 2019!”"
2016-09-22T17:05:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Counter-terrorist detectives arrest 33-year-old man in Cardiff street,"Counter-terrorism detectives investigating fears about planning for a terrorist attack have arrested a man in a Cardiff street. The man, 33, was detained in the third operation in a month to lead to an arrest in Britain to disrupt an alleged Islamist plot. The arrest was made by detectives from Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command. Two addresses were being searched in the Welsh capital, at least one of which is residential and linked to the arrested man. The man was arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of terrorist acts under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Under the provision “a constable may arrest without a warrant a person whom he reasonably suspects to be a terrorist”. The intelligence development underpinning the investigation was led by the domestic intelligence service, MI5. Counter-terrorism detectives from London and Wales were also involved in an operation described as “pre-planned and as a result of a pro-active investigation”. Last month, police made arrests in Birmingham amid fears of a potential attack plot, leading to four people being charged, and earlier this month detectives made arrests in London, leading to one person being charged. In a statement about the Cardiff arrest, police said: “The arrest, which took place in the street in Cardiff, was pre-planned and as a result of a pro-active investigation by the Metropolitan police service counter-terrorism command supported by the Wales extremism and counter-terrorism unit.” The UK threat level from Islamist terrorism has been at severe since 2014, meaning an attack is assessed as being highly likely. The main reason for the heightened level of threat is the potency of Islamic State and its desire to stage attacks against western targets."
2016-09-22T17:20:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Man who has to inform police before sex has 24-hour notice period lifted,"A man who was told he had to give police 24 hours’ notice before having sex has won a bid to get the order lifted, and must now inform them “as soon as is reasonably practicable” if he wants to have a sexual relationship. At a hearing at York magistrates court, district judge Adrian Lower described John O’Neill, a 45-year-old IT consultant from the city, as manipulative. He said he was quite satisfied that he posed a risk to women, but concluded that the original sexual risk order was disproportionate. Courts can impose sexual risk orders on any individual whom police believe poses a risk of sexual harm, even if they have never been convicted of a crime. The judge imposed 12 conditions, including requiring North Yorkshire police to monitor O’Neill’s internet use. He is also forbidden to discuss fantasies and sadomasochistic tendencies with medical staff, and a third party is to be required to be present at his medical appointments except in emergencies. O’Neill was cleared of raping a woman during a trial at Teesside crown court in November last year, but in a rare move the judge told the Crown Prosecution Service he still considered him to be dangerous. He was subsequently placed on an interim sexual risk order, making him the first person in the UK obliged to give police notice before he could have sex. During a hearing in August, it was alleged that O’Neill had made a series of confessions to medical staff in 2014, including choking a woman until she lost consciousness, that he had thought about killing her and that he needed women “to be scared or I don’t respond”. O’Neill, a single father-of-two, said he was being penalised because of his interest in sadomasochism and visits to fetish clubs. In June he threatened to go on hunger strike in protest against the order. His identity was made public this year after an order protecting his anonymity was lifted. On Thursday he said he was still unhappy about the conditions imposed. “I’m supposed to be able to be frank and open with a doctor. How can I now be expected to make any frank disclosures to a medic?”"
2016-09-22T17:58:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Alleged snatching of four-year-old in London foiled by elder brother,"An investigation has been launched into the alleged attempted abduction of a four-year-old boy outside a primary school in east London, the police have confirmed. The child, who was wearing school uniform, was allegedly snatched by a stranger near St Agnes Catholic primary school in Bow on Monday. His older brother ran after the man and caught up with him, and the boy was dropped seven metres down the road after a struggle. Lorraine Spiteri Sammut, who says she is the child’s grandmother, wrote on Facebook that it had all happened fast and they were lucky to get him back. She wrote: “A man picked him up, put him over his shoulder and ran down the road with him, my 11-year-old grandson gave chase and managed to pull him out of the man’s arms. “Keep hold of [your] kids’ hands. Everything happened so fast. Police measured where the man ran and it was seven metres down the road ... We was lucky. Due to the fast actions of my 11-year-old, we got my grandson back!” She also alleged the man had been seen hanging around the school earlier in the day. She added that they were all a bit shook up. She said: “Couldn’t sleep last night. Sick to my stomach. It’s awful, I can’t stop kissing and cuddling him, thank God my Leli reacted so fast and managed to get him back.” Police described the suspect as a black man who was wearing a black baseball cap with blue writing on the side. He was also wearing a long thick gold chain and a blue T-shirt. A Metropolitan police spokesman said: “Police are investigating a report that a four-year-old boy in school uniform was the victim of an attempted kidnap near to St Agnes primary school. “The boy was allegedly picked up by the suspect at the end of a school day. The suspect tried to make off with the boy before being confronted, dropping the child and leaving the scene.” A member of staff at the school said: “The police are making enquiries and have been taking witness statements.” She refused to comment further but Tower Hamlets council said neighbourhood officers would be stationed outside the school following the incident. A statement read: “There was an alleged attempted abduction of a child outside St Agnes primary school on Monday 19 September. Police are investigating the incident. Neighbourhood police will now be present outside the school at the beginning and end of the school day. “Tower Hamlets Council and police are reminding parents, staff and children to remain vigilant and to report anything they believe to be suspicious to the police by calling 101.”"
2016-09-23T09:41:31Z,uk-news,UK news,May vows to protect UK troops who fought in Iraq from legal 'abuse',"Theresa May has told senior commanders that every effort must be made to stop British soldiers from falling victim to “abuse of the legal system” by lawyers representing Iraqis who allege they were victims of war crimes during the occupation of their country. In a 90-minute meeting with senior commanders, the prime minister said she was determined to protect the armed forces against any “vexatious complaints” relating to the eight-year occupation, during which tens of thousands of British soldiers were deployed to the Arab republic. It comes amid mounting criticism of the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (Ihat), which was set up to investigate allegations of murder, abuse and torture by British forces. Former soldiers have claimed they have been hounded through the courts on unfounded claims and there are growing calls for Ihat to be shut down. Reports claim more than 1,200 cases of alleged abuse will be dismissed in the next three months after the collapse of a single law firm, Public Interest Lawyers, after it was stripped of legal aid funding over a failure to come clean about conflicting evidence in a case against British forces. A Downing Street statement said: “The prime minister spoke of her pride in the UK armed forces, and praised the work they do to keep our nation safe. She said that every effort must be made to prevent any abuse of the legal system, and restated her determination to protect the armed forces against any instances of vexatious complaints.” But the Law Society, which represents lawyers, hit back, warning that political interference in the legal cases risked undermining “the independence of the legal profession, the rule of law, and the separation of powers which are fundamental to a strong and diverse society.” Robert Bourns, president of the society, said: “Lawyers must not be hindered or intimidated in carrying out their professional duties and acting in the best interests of their clients within the law. They should not be identified with their clients or clients’ cases.” He added: “The right to access to justice for all depends on lawyers being able to represent their clients’ cases within our framework of laws, no matter how the client or case may be perceived by the public, media or government. The merits of each case are decided by the relevant court, a function that is and must remain separate from government.” In Thursday’s meeting with chief of the defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, the Ministry of Defence permanent under secretary, Stephen Lovegrove, the heads of the navy, army and air force, and commander joint forces command, May was briefed on “the full extent of current operations”, Downing Street said. “The PM reiterated the UK’s determination to keep Britain’s streets safe by taking the fight to Daesh in Iraq and Syria and noted that we have conducted more than 1000 airstrikes in both countries, second only to the US,” the statement said. She also discussed tackling the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean, the UK’s role in United Nations operations and Nato, collaboration between British and French armed forces and the Navy’s operations against pirates off the Horn of Africa and in sea lanes in the Gulf. May said: “The men and women of our armed forces do an incredible job, often making huge sacrifices to keep us safe. Whether taking the fight to Daesh in Iraq and Syria, helping to tackle the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean or providing flood relief at home – we owe them a huge debt of gratitude. “Our armed forces are the best in the world and with the biggest defence budget in Europe and the second biggest in Nato we will continue to play our part on the world stage, protecting UK interests across the globe.” The Conservative MP Johnny Mercer, a member of the defence select committee, who is heading an investigation into Ihat, has branded the legal pursuit of troops “a national disgrace” and called for the team, which was set up in 2010, to be axed. This month, Mercer claimed that May’s predecessor, David Cameron, had wanted to shut down the investigations, only to be overruled by the attorney general. The Birmingham-based Public Interest Lawyers had submitted hundreds of allegations of misconduct and unlawful killing by British soldiers, including triggering the £31m Al-Sweady inquiry into the conduct of British troops in a 2004 firefight with insurgents. However, it was subsequently accused of sitting on evidence that undermined its clients’ claims in that case for a year, before withdrawing their claim. It was criticised when the inquiry’s 2014 report concluded the most serious allegations of war crimes following a 2004 battle in southern Iraq were based on “deliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility”. It was announced in August that the firm would no longer receive public funding after the legal aid agency ruled it had breached contractual requirements."
2016-09-23T10:08:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Taxi driver Chris Halliwell given full life term for Becky Godden murder,"The taxi driver Chris Halliwell has been given a full life term for the sexually motivated murder of Becky Godden, almost four years after being jailed for killing Sian O’Callaghan. Halliwell joins notorious killers such as the Moors murderer Ian Brady and Rose West who will never be released.
Attention will now turn to whether Halliwell, 52, from Swindon, may have killed other women along with Godden, 20, and O’Callaghan, 22. Following the sentence police repeated that they believed he had killed other women and revealed that they were pursuing other lines of inquiry on other possible offences after calls had come in making further allegations. Wiltshire detectives will work with other forces and the National Crime Agency to try to find other victims. As a chauffeur and a ground worker, Halliwell travelled the UK so it is feasible there could be victims across the country. Sentencing Halliwell to a full life term, high court judge Sir John Griffith Williams said he was a “self-centred and domineering individual”.
Halliwell had smiled at Godden’s family as he was convicted earlier this week. He simply said “thank you” to the judge when he was told on Friday he would never be released and left the dock with his eyes down.
During the sentencing hearing, Godden’s parents, Karen Edwards and John Godden, paid tribute to their “little girl” who went missing in 2003. Both described how during the eight years before her body was found they continued to search for her and buy her presents in the hope she would turn up. Outside court Godden said he still now expected her to walk through the door. Halliwell was already in the high-security Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire serving life for the murder of O’Callaghan. He picked up the office worker in his taxi after she left a nightclub alone in Swindon, Wiltshire, in 2011, stabbed her in the head, strangled her and left her partially clothed body next to a road in Oxfordshire. On Monday a jury at Bristol crown court took less than three hours to find him guilty of the murder of sex worker Godden. In January 2003, he had sex with her, strangled her and buried her body in a field in Gloucestershire. Godden’s murder only came to light after Halliwell was arrested over O’Callaghan’s disappearance. He led police to where he had left O’Callaghan’s body, and to where he had buried Godden’s remains eight years before. But because senior investigating officer, Steve Fulcher, did not follow the rules over how suspects should be treated, Halliwell initially escaped justice. Fulcher, who has left the police and now works in Somalia, was not in court to watch Halliwell being sentenced but his wife, Yvonne Fulcher, sat in the public gallery. Passing sentence, the judge said he did not believe that Fulcher had been oppressive in how he interviewed Halliwell. The judge described Halliwell’s account of Godden being buried in the field by two drug dealers as a “cock and bull story”. He said: “The account in which you advanced so glibly with little or no regard to the truth made no sense at all. I have no doubt that you are a self-centred and domineering individual who wants his own way. You are both calculating and devious.” The judge said Halliwell was controlling of Godden. “You used her for sex whenever you wanted to, taking advantage of her vulnerability as a drug addict and prostitute.” Explaining why he was handing him a rare full life term, the judge said: “I am satisfied that there are real similarities between the two murders. The fact that some nine years elapsed between them probably reflects the absence of opportunities. “I have concluded both murders involved the abduction of the victim and sexual conduct and both were aggravated by the concealment of the bodies. I am satisfied your offending is exceptionally high and satisfies the criteria for a whole life term.” Speaking after the sentencing, Det Supt Sean Memory, the senior investigating officer in the Godden case, said police had new lines to follow on other murders Halliwell might have committed. He said: “I’m very very clear that there must be other victims out there whether they are sexual offences or other women that he has taken. The offending behaviour for Becky was cold and calculated. I cannot believe that was his first offence from being a burglar in the 1980s to a murderer in 2003. There is a significant gap in his offending. “Sian wasn’t murdered until 2011. What happened in the interim eight years? He talked candidly in 1985 about wanting to be a serial killer. I genuinely believe that is a distinct possibility. “I will now look to review outstanding cases. I appeal to Christopher Halliwell: now is the time to the tell the truth for once in your life. Come forward and speak to me. There will be victims out there, I know. “I will look to see where the investigation goes. We have had a number of calls to the incident room that have given us more lines of inquiry to follow. I need to take stock. I’m clear what his method is. He likes to abduct women, he likes to commit sexual offences, he likes to kill. He also likes to remove their clothing and bury them. If there are other offences I will pursue them. He has demonstrated how dangerous he is. He has no compassion, he is a callous and cold killer. “He is an incredibly dangerous man. For me one of the most chilling things is we have testimony of how good a taxi driver he was, how he used to pick up young girls and take them home safely. I need to understand, where’s his trigger? How can he do that one day and then next day decide he’s going to take someone’s life. “In the mid-80s, while he was in prison for an unrelated offence, Halliwell asked a [fellow prison] inmate how many women you needed to kill before being considered a serial killer.” In common with many violent sexual offenders, it has emerged Halliwell had a fascination with hardcore pornography, including child abuse and bestiality. Computer search terms he used showed he had an interest in murder, violent sex and rape. Before rising, the judge praised Godden’s family for their “quiet dignity and courtesy”.
Addressing them, he said: “You have had to live with every parent’s nightmare of a missing child and then the discovery that she had been dead for some years, buried naked in a field. “You have been deprived of the opportunity we all want, to say farewell to our closest and dearest. And then you have had to live through the criminal processes as Christopher Halliwell was brought eventually to justice. “There must have been moments when you wondered whether the case would ever be completed. If I may say so, you have behaved throughout with quiet dignity and courtesy. “I hope that you will feel justice has been done and while that cannot bring Becky back, that may at least bring you some solace. I will include Mr and Mrs O’Callaghan because this trial must have been an ordeal for them as they had to relive the evidence of how Sian died. They too behaved with dignity and courtesy. I pay tribute to you all.”"
2016-09-23T10:37:19Z,uk-news,UK news,"Sadiq Khan's new TfL board's first meeting: hopping, inclusive and refreshed","The first meeting of Sadiq Khan’s new Transport for London (TfL) board took place on Thursday, characterised by much newbie enthusiasm, an upbeat vibe and a few jokes from the Mayor in the Chair, determined to set a new tone to match the new approach he requires. The board’s job is approve TfL’s business planning and accounts and “other major and strategic issues and policies” and to see that the organisation’s top brass are doing their jobs. This means, among other things, asking intelligent questions at board meetings, which are held in public. The following are a few of the more diverting matters that were discussed. Devolution of suburban rail (Southern, and all that) Later this year, the Department for Transport (DfT) is expected to start the process for re-letting the franchises for rail services in south-east London and Kent - appointing the companies to operate commuter trains in those areas in future. The mayor and London politicians across the spectrum believe responsibility for the performance of those services within the capital should be devolved to TfL because, frankly, it’s the best organisation for doing the job. TfL favours a “concession” arrangement - different from a franchise - similar to those in place for the London Overground (which already covers suburban services out of Liverpool Street) and the Docklands Light Railway. Basically, TfL sets the level of service it requires and pays the operating company to provide it. If the company over-performs it gets a bonus, if it under-performs, it gets fined. TfL receives the fares income. The argument goes that TfL’s track record, ever since getting its hands on the what used to be called the North London or Silverlink line in 2007, shows that it rapidly improves services and attracts more passengers as a result of being in charge, resulting in more money for re-investment. “It’s the best way to operate metro-style services across an integrated transport system,” explained Gareth Powell, director of strategy for London Underground and rail, to the the board. While the mayor has been calling for the DfT to let TfL start rescuing the troubled Southern franchise right away there has been a lot of talking behind the scenes. Some of it, proper and formal, has been between TfL and the DfT about possible ways forward. Some of it, all unofficial, has been to the effect that new transport secretary Chris Grayling is nothing like as keen to oblige TfL and the mayor as his predecessor seemed to be. Meanwhile, the London Assembly’s cross-party budget and performance committee has said in a recent report that the TfL board “must rigorously scrutinise any proposal for TfL to take over suburban rail services” to ensure that any further devolution is a success. A lot of the new board’s work is going to be mathematical. A low crime Night Tube so far The launch of weekend Night Tube services on the Victoria and Central lines last month were accompanied by some concerns that they’d be marred by crime and antisocial behaviour. Extra transport police were deployed accordingly. However, the news so far is good. “The level of crime on the Night Tube has been very, very low,” said TfL commissioner Mike Brown. “Last weekend we had two reported, which is actually lower than what we’ve seen on normal days.” Many hops with the Hopper ticket You can now make two pay-as-you-go or contactless bus (or tram) journeys for the price of one within a one hour period, thanks to the mayor’s new Hopper ticket. The board heard that between its launch on 12 September up until the end of Wednesday, the extra “free” ride had been taken 2.64m times and it was confirmed that a second stage of the Hopper policy will enable an unlimited number of bus or tram journeys within an hour for the price of one. TfL hope to introduce this in 2018, and also enable the bus rides to be punctuated by journeys on other public transport modes, which can’t be done at present. Being better friends with the taxi trade The recent publication of a private hire and taxi action plan to help “protect the capital’s iconic back cab trade” and improve standards across the private hire industry was welcomed by Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association. This caught the eye - relations between the black cab trade and TfL have been difficult in recent times. But Mike Brown told the board: “I cannot stress enough the importance I place, and the mayor places, on us working together with the trade representatives in our implementation of these commitments. A fundamental part of the action plan is to ensure that our engagement with the taxi trade is far more inclusive and far more pro-active than it perhaps has been in the recent past.” A “refreshed” approach to finance presentation During the election campaign the future Mayor Khan said he believed TfL indulged in “creative finances” to protect their budgets against suggestions that they could be more efficient and, in truth, probably afford things like the freeze of its public transport fares he’s going to introduce. Others had long contended that TfL’s budgets were undesirably opaque. On Thursday, Khan introduced the report to the board from relatively new chief finance officer Ian Nunn by saying he’d asked for the way this was done to be “refreshed” in order to address complaints, fair or otherwise, that in the past these bulletins had been “difficult for human beings to follow”. Nicely done. It was nice too that members of the board, which includes some formidable financial brains, made various suggestions for further enhancements. You can read Ian Nunn’s finance report and separate quarterly performance report via here and you can watch a webcast of the board meeting in its entirety via here. It was held on 22 September, 2016."
2016-09-23T12:40:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Becky Godden's mother speaks of 'devastation' over murder,"In a victim-impact statement, Becky Godden’s mother, Karen Edwards, described the day – which would have been her daughter’s 29th birthday – when officers broke the news that the young woman’s remains had been found. Taxi driver Chris Halliwell was given a full life term on Friday for murdering Godden in Swindon, almost four years after he was jailed for killing another woman in 2011. He will never be released from prison. Edwards said: “My world had fallen apart, shattered in seconds, and that emotion I have woken up with every day since. That feeling of total devastation, disbelief, loss, pain, the flash of sudden panic that hits me in the stomach and just repulses me. It has changed my world. The world as I knew it has been totally destroyed and will never be the same, complete, ever again.” Edwards added: “It is such an effort some days just to get up and function. My thoughts every day are of my little girl. The little girl that can never be replaced. What must she have gone through that night? Anyone who is a mother or father, your instinct is to protect your children. I see her photo, when I open my eyes, on my bedside table, and all around the house I see my beautiful child, Becky. “I will never be able to give her a hug ever again and make things right for her, or take her shopping, brush her hair, have a moan at her for not keeping her room tidy or taking my makeup. No waiting up half the night for a phone call to pick her and her mates up after a night out.”
“The only thing I can buy her is flowers for her grave. I kneel down beside her grave still disbelieving she is there. I have only been told she is dead,” she said. “I never had a body to kiss goodbye before she was buried. But of course she had already been buried, in a lonely field in the middle of nowhere, for years. Just left to rot. She was brought back home in that coffin. I was told not to open it and the reason for that was because all that was in it was just my daughter’s bones, and part of Becky’s skeleton. “Where was her head? Well that has never been found … I stayed with her coffin for three weeks until the day of her funeral.” Edwards, who married her husband, Charlie, when Godden was a teenager, said he was worried she would take her own life in order to be reunited with her daughter. “Charlie watched over me after the news had been delivered. I said that I couldn’t live without Becky and that I wanted to be with her. I have a belief in the afterlife and I felt that if I died, too, I could be with her.
“My need to be with Becky became greater than my need to be here. Charlie worried if I went out and was late home. He thought I would take my own life. I was so mentally fragile. “I always planned that when Becky got married I would give her a wonderful wedding and she would have made a beautiful bride. I did not anticipate a funeral would replace her wedding day. Even that has been taken away from me. I miss her so much every day. I envy other mothers when I see them with their daughters. “Then I feel guilty for feeling like that, but I have had that pleasure taken away from me, never to be had again, and as for grandchildren that Becky may have given me in the future, that too has been denied. “Since Becky was found, my future has become very different. Tell me, how can anyone get over such an enormous ordeal and loss? Just pictures and memories, a broken heart and a grave. That is all I have left of my beautiful daughter.”"
2016-09-23T13:06:49Z,uk-news,UK news,"Army spied on Sinn​​ Féin years after IRA ceasefire, soldier claims","An undercover British army soldier has claimed he bugged a hospital and planted listening devices in the homes of senior Sinn Féin politicians years after the IRA ceasefire in 1994. The former intelligence soldier told the Guardian that many of the tiny cameras and minute bugs he secreted all over Northern Ireland were still in place years after he left a secret military unit. Senior Sinn Féin members, the including former IRA hunger striker Raymond McCartney, were still being targeted in secret surveillance operations until the 2000s, he said. “We put a bug into Raymond McCartney’s house because we were not sure which way the republican movement was going in the early part of the 21st century.” Seán Hartnett (not his real name), who has just published a book about his part in the secret counterterrorism war, said republicans were “still gathering intelligence on the security forces in the early 2000s despite being on ceasefire, so we did the same on them”. “The bug I know was planted in Raymond McCartney’s house was so sophisticated I would be hugely surprised if it has ever been found.” Hartnett revealed that British military intelligence in the early 2000s hid tiny cameras and bugs in various places, including one inside Altnagelvin hospital in Derry, as part of its secret war against the Real IRA. He said many were probably still in place. Hartnett’s memoir focuses on the seven years he served in the Joint Communications Unit Northern Ireland (JCUNI), formerly the controversial Force Research Unit, also known as the Det. He alleges that one of the undercover units he was working for was prepared to carry out a shoot-to-kill operation against a Real IRA cell outside an army base in Omagh just four years after the terrorist group’s bomb attack that killed 29 people in the County Tyrone town. The 40-year-old former military spy-technician, who was born in Cork in the Irish Republic, said he would not return to the UK because he feared he could be arrested and prosecuted for breaching the Official Secrets Act.
In an interview in Ireland, Hartnett said he was certain the advanced spying equipment his units used to monitor Real IRA and Ulster loyalists was now being used to watch Islamic State terror suspects in the UK. Although, he added, the devices he used while tracking Real IRA suspects and gathering “political intelligence” on Sinn Féin were now even more advanced. “The technical advances they had made would lead even someone like me to struggle to pick out say a hidden camera in a parked vehicle these days,” Hartnett said. He said that, just like in Northern Ireland, many of the cameras and listening devices hidden in homes, businesses, vehicles and other places in the rest of the UK would remain in place long after surveillance operations were wound down. “Northern Ireland is awash with bugs and secret cameras because, after all, we never went about taking them out when our operations were ended. The same will be true of any spying equipment that is planted in English cities and towns.” Asked where the strangest place was that he had planted a listening device, Hartnett replied: “Definitely in Altnagelvin hospital in Derry. It was 2002 and after the Omagh bomb atrocity of 1998 the Real IRA had a resurgence. They were bombing again in Britain in the early 2000s; the rocket attack on MI5’s headquarters and the bomb at the BBC come to mind. “There was one suspect/patient from Derry in the hospital who was being visited by another Real IRA operative and we wanted to know what they were taking about on these visits. So I was sent in personally to place the listening device where they were having their chats. To be honest it’s probably still there.” He repeated the allegation, made in his book Charlie One, that military intelligence was prepared to kill two Real IRA men on their way to kill British soldiers at an ATM in Omagh in 2002. “The Real IRA cell had the ATM at a garage under surveillance because soldiers from the nearby St Lucia army barracks in Omagh were using it to draw out cash. We had the team under surveillance and thanks to one our listening devices we had hard intelligence the Real IRA were going to use a motorbike to carry out a drive-by shooting as squaddies left the base to take out money at the ATM. “I was told the plan was to surround the garage with undercover soldiers and open fire as the motorbike team turned up and the pillion passenger drew his gun. But at the last minute, the attempted hit on the soldiers didn’t take place because the Real IRA team couldn’t get their motorbike started. If the machine had started up these two men would be dead today. “My colleagues told me they were determined to take them out as one of them had been responsible for the murder of a police officer during the Troubles. Those Real IRA pair do not realise how lucky there were.” Hartnett said his book originated while he was undergoing therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder after being discharged from the undercover army regiment in 2005. “My counsellor told me to write down all my experiences of the secret war and having amassed so many stories of my time in the Det I realised there was a book in this. “I don’t know if the British authorities will prosecute me for telling my story but I am not taking any chances and won’t be back in the UK again. But out of therapy came this book and it’s my story which I had to tell.” Charlie One is published by Merrion Press"
2016-09-23T14:41:53Z,uk-news,UK news,A cold day in Hull: why the city is finally on the (weather) map,"Name: Hull. Age: First mentioned in 1193. Full name: Kingston upon Hull. Twinned with: Freetown, Sierra Leone. Appearance: Fixed dot on a map of the British Isles, next to a cloud. Is that all? Of course not. Sometimes there will be rain coming out of the cloud. What about a sun? Theoretically, that could happen, too. The point is that this city of 258,995 souls, nestled on the northern bank of the Humber, has been granted a permanent spot on BBC weather maps, from January until for ever.
Was it not there before? It came and went – a bit like Brigadoon – much to the irritation of locals. Why the change? It’s part of BBC director general Tony Hall’s overall plan to make the Beeb “unashamedly Hull-centric in 2017”. Wow. How does a mid-size English city earn such odd flattery? It has to be named the UK City of Culture for 2017. That sounds like a lot of paperwork for a spot on some stupid map. Oh, but there is much, much more. The title also comes with a £32m budget and a year’s worth of cultural attractions. Like what? Hull will play host to the 2017 Turner Prize. A new Richard Bean play, The Hypocrite, will premiere at Hull Truck theatre. The expensively refurbished Ferens art gallery will open its doors. A four-day festival of northern music is scheduled, as is a special performance by David Bowie’s backing band, the Spiders From Mars. What has Hull ever done to deserve all that? The city has a long and rich artistic history. The Spiders from Mars – Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Woody Woodmansey – are local boys. The poet Philip Larkin spent most of his life in Hull. Andrew Marvell grew up there, and was once its MP. So is everybody in Hull wholly and unironically committed to this government-sponsored renaissance? Perhaps not everybody. Hull AFC supporters have been known to chant “You’re only here for the culture!” at opposing fans. Interesting non-cultural fact about Hull? If you drilled from Hull straight through the centre of the Earth, you’d come out in Nugget Point, New Zealand. Do say: “Hull isn’t just a city of culture; it’s a cultural community.” Don’t say: “Hull is other people.” • This article was amended on 26 September 2016. An earlier version placed the city on the northern bank of the river Hull, where it meets the Humber estuary. Hull is on the northern bank of the Humber, and bisected by the river Hull."
2016-09-23T15:12:58Z,uk-news,UK news,All prospective private-hire taxi drivers in London could face written English test,"Anyone hoping to drive a private-hire taxi in London could be forced to take a written English test after Transport for London admitted that exemptions for English speakers would hit black and minority ethnic people hardest. TfL is introducing new rules from 1 October requiring taxi drivers to pass English exams costing £200 to obtain or renew a private hire licence. Uber, the taxi-hailing app, has argued in court that, while it supports oral tests, the written element is unnecessary and would force some of its drivers out of business. The company appealed against TfL’s plans to allow exemptions for drivers from English-speaking countries such as Australia, the US and Jamaica. It wants the plans for written English tests dropped completely. TfL said in papers submitted to the high court that it would abandon the exemption for people from those countries to avoid discrimination, after an outcry from drivers and immigrants’ groups. “The imposition of a requirement to communicate (including speaking, listening, reading and writing) at an appropriate level will (obviously) have a disproportionate effect on certain nationalities,” said TfL. “It will also have a disproportionate effect on black and minority ethnic (Bame) applicants ... “TfL accepts that an exemption from the obligation to demonstrate English language competence should not be based on nationality; and it will accordingly give further consideration to the precise scope of the exemptions (if any).” The decision raises the prospect that people born and raised in English-speaking countries will have to pass tests in rudimentary English. TfL said the organisation was now drawing up new plans for exemptions for some licence applicants but could not say what they would be. “We are in the process of finalising the exemptions, taking into account equalities impacts, and we will publish details in the near future.” That leaves drivers for Uber and other taxi services facing uncertainty over their employment prospects with under a fortnight to go until the rules are due to come into force, on 1 October. Chai Patel, policy director for the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, welcomed TfL’s decision to scrap exemptions but questioned the need for written English tests. “It’s quite right that TfL have moved away from the discriminatory policy that would require only individuals with certain nationalities to go through the burden of an additional English language test. Nevertheless, we remain concerned about the level of written English expected. “It is quite right that regulatory bodies should require members to meet certain standards for customer service and safety purposes, but if a language requirement is not proportionate to the real needs of the job, it hinders integration and creates an artificial bar for migrants trying to earn a living. “The language test TfL is seeking to impose is higher than that of many other comparable industries, and we have not seen any convincing evidence from TfL that it is necessary.” A spokesperson for Uber said TfL was “right to admit that its plans are discriminatory”. The San Francisco-based company said written exams had “nothing to do with communicating with passengers or getting them safely from A to B”. “Thousands of drivers could lose their livelihoods as a result. Instead of tinkering with the exemptions, TfL should just scrap these unnecessary new rules.”"
2016-09-23T15:25:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Did Christopher Halliwell kill others? What police will do now,"One of the first key steps for officers as they try to find other victims of Christopher Halliwell will be to improve the timeline they have for him. Halliwell was born in Swindon but brought up in south-west Scotland before returning to Wiltshire as a young man. He has lived in a string of addresses in Swindon and worked in dozens of jobs, from window cleaner to builder, ground worker, chauffeur and, of course, taxi driver.
As a nighttime driver, Halliwell got to know the red light district of Swindon well, often ferrying sex workers and drug dealers around, but also became familiar with the countryside around the town. He was a keen angler and had an encyclopaedic knowledge of waterways and ponds. In the early 90s he married a woman called Lisa Byrne, a shop assistant, with whom he had three children. By 2003, when he abducted and killed Becky Godden, he was approaching his 40th year. In 2005 he left Lisa for a neighbour, Heather Widdowson, and moved in with her a few doors down. He continued to have one-night stands and – by his own admission – paid sex workers for their services. One potentially helpful line of inquiry is Halliwell’s work diaries. His ex-wife Lisa has handed over his diaries from 2000 to 2005 (though unfortunately for police 2001 is missing). Officers may be able to map his movements in some detail for what may be a crucial four-year period.
They will also pore over their own dealings with Halliwell. He was a car thief and burglar who served time in Dartmoor prison in Devon in the mid 1980s. Oddly, Halliwell was also a serial complainer to the police and other authorities. Between 2000 and 2010 he made numerous reports about perceived slights and wrongs against him. They could help build up the timeline. Officers will also talk to criminologists and are in contact with the intelligence unit at Long Lartin, where Halliwell is imprisoned.
What makes police think he may have killed others? There are a number of factors that led them to believe Godden and Sian O’Callaghan are not his only victims. They include: In the mid-1980s while he was in Dartmoor for an unrelated offence, Halliwell asked a fellow prisoner how many women a person needed to kill before being considered a serial killer. Had he already killed by then? His age. It is rare for men to begin to kill in their late 30s. Detectives cannot believe he did nothing in between being a burglar and thief in the 80s and killing Becky Godden in 2003. In common with many violent sexual offenders, Halliwell had a fascination with hardcore pornography, including child abuse and bestiality. Computer search terms he used showed he had an interest in murder, violent sex and rape. He is known to have been worried that police were investigating him over allegations involving girls. There has been no such inquiry. Halliwell was “forensically aware”. When he killed Sian O’Callaghan in 2011 he removed items of her clothing and attempted to get rid of fibres that he feared would connect him to her death. He tried to strike a deal with police that if he cleared up Godden’s murder police would never interview him about anything ever again. The mistake over the depth of Godden’s grave. Halliwell initially told police he had buried her 5ft (1.5 metres) down but she was found just a few inches below the surface. Police believe he may be confused because there were other burial sites. Propensity. He was no random killer. Godden and O’Callaghan were young and slim. He mistakenly thought both were sex workers. The transitory nature of his work. In common with serial killers such as Peter Sutcliffe, Levi Bellfield and Robert Black he had a job that gave him the opportunity to abduct and murder."
2016-09-23T15:52:40Z,uk-news,UK news,CPS to review Poppi Worthington death,"Prosecutors are re-examining the case of a toddler from Cumbria who died after being sexually assaulted. A judge ruled earlier this year that 13-month-old Poppi Worthington was probably abused by her father, Paul Worthington, shortly before she died. He was arrested nine months after her death in December 2012 but no charges were brought against him. He has always maintained he never harmed Poppi. Three medical experts have backed him, telling the judge they believed she died of natural causes. But Mr Justice Peter Jackson found that, on the civil standard of the balance of probabilities, Worthington had abused Poppi in the hours before she died. The judge concluded: “Shorn to its essentials, the situation is one in which a healthy child with no medical condition or illness was put to bed by her mother one evening and brought downstairs eight hours later by her father in a lifeless state and with troubling injuries. “Careful assessment of the meticulous pathological and paediatric evidence has clearly established that the injuries were the result of trauma from outside the body.” A second inquest into Poppi’s death was due to be held in Kendal on 10 October. But on Friday the Cumbrian coroner announced he had been asked to suspend the inquest after being told the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was to carry out a fresh review of the evidence. A CPS spokesman said: “On 19 September the CPS appeals and review unit received a request under the victims’ right to review scheme in relation to the death of Poppi Worthington. The case material will be considered and the review will be completed as soon as possible.” As recently as July the CPS said there was insufficient evidence to charge the father with any crime. A spokesperson said then: “The CPS has looked at the original decision in this case that there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction – as we often do in other cases. We have reached the same conclusion.” Legally, a coroner is obliged to suspend an investigation when somebody may be charged with a homicide offence involving the deceased. The Cumbrian coroner, David Roberts, said he would suspend the inquest until 30 November, having been advised that the review should be completed in about 56 days. The first inquest, held in October 2014, took seven minutes to declare Poppi’s death “unexplained”."
2016-09-23T16:19:31Z,uk-news,UK news,'Fake Sheikh' says he felt confused by Tulisa drugs trial questioning,"The undercover journalist known as the “Fake Sheikh” told police that his evidence in the drugs trial of the pop singer Tulisa Contostavlos may have seemed inconsistent because he felt “steamrollered” by the questioning, a court has heard. Mazher Mahmood, 53, and his driver Alan Smith, 67, are accused of altering a statement made to police that suggested the former N-Dubz singer and X Factor judge disapproved of drugs. Mahmood was questioned by police in September 2014 – two months after the Contostavlos trial was stayed. The case was halted when Mahmood – who was giving evidence against Contostavlos, having carried out a newspaper sting alleging she had arranged for him to be sold drugs – revealed that he had discussed Smith’s witness statement with the driver. Smith’s original account given to police of when he drove Contostavlos home from a meeting with Mahmood, said the singer “seemed really negative about cocaine and expressed her disapproval of drugs”, but he changed the statement the next day, removing the anti-drugs passage.
Mahmood, who at an earlier hearing had said under oath that he had not discussed the singer’s comments in the car, explained the apparent inconsistency in his evidence by saying he had not discussed the detail of the statement, merely that Smith was unhappy with it. At the Old Bailey on Friday, the court was read a transcript of Mahmood’s interview at Charing Cross police station. The reporter, accompanied by his lawyer, had read a prepared statement and refused to answer any questions afterwards. In it, he said that after two days of questioning from the prosecution and defence, “I was thoroughly confused. I was doing my best to answer the questions but was steamrollered into answers. “It felt like all sides were trying to discredit me and it was a difficult and uncomfortable experience.” Mahmood said any inconsistency was unintentional. He denied lying under oath or encouraging Smith to change his statement, claiming the driver had sent him a copy of his statement despite Mahmood not requesting it. The reporter said he spoke to Smith on the phone after receiving the document, but it was to discuss a future investigation, not the statement. However, Mahmood claimed that Smith then raised the issue of the statement during the conversation. Mahmood told police: “I did not discuss his evidence, I did not discuss the nature of the evidence he could give. Mr Smith was unhappy with certain issues, he wasn’t sure some of the stuff the officer has put in it was accurate.” Mahmood said he accepted that he “could perhaps have added” in his evidence at the trial that Smith had spoken to him about being unhappy about his statement and that the reporter had, as a result, referred him to his newspaper’s lawyers. But Mahmood said he had told Smith he could not discuss the driver’s evidence and had not even opened the statement at that stage so had not known about the comment Contostavlos was said to have made in the car. “I had no intent to invent, suppress or manipulate evidence,” he told police. “I believe the court was looking for an excuse to drop the case.” Mahmood said what the singer said in the car was irrelevant to him as he had “irrefutable evidence that Miss Contostavlos had arranged the supply of cocaine and that was all that was needed in that case”. Mahmood, seeking a scoop, had posed as a wealthy Bollywood producer promising the singer and aspiring actor a lead role in a major film alongside Leonardo DiCaprio. He said in his police statement that he had acted on information that Contostavlos was a user and supplier of drugs. His exposé alleged that she had arranged for him to be sold half an ounce (14g) of cocaine by one of her contacts for £800. Mahmood and Smith are charged with conspiring together to do an act, namely that Smith would change a draft statement to police, with the intention to pervert the course of justice. Both deny the charge. After reading the transcript of a police interview with Smith, also from September 2014, the prosecution rested its case. At the beginning of his police interview Smith read a short statement in which he denied that he discussed his statement with Mahmood or that the reporter influenced his decision to change it. He was then asked a series of questions by the officers but offered “no comment” to several, including ones on whether Mahmoud had urged him to change his statement. The case continues."
2016-09-23T17:05:24Z,uk-news,UK news,Becky Godden case shines light on issue of UK's missing women,"For eight long years after she vanished in 2003, Becky Godden’s parents searched, waited and hoped. “I was out looking for her all the time,” her father, John Godden, said on Friday. “It becomes surreal. I still think she’ll come walking through the door. My heart goes out to other families still in that position now.” Godden’s mother, Karen Edwards, described how she would automatically look for her daughter’s favourite biscuits and sweets when she went shopping – then remember she had gone. “Where was she? What was she doing? I spent hours driving around the town at all hours of the day and night.” Edwards suffered sleepless nights, paranoia, even feelings of anger towards her daughter. Godden loved Christmas. “Every year I bought her a card and presents and I put them under the tree, anticipating that she would return home,” said Edwards. The case of Christopher Halliwell, who has been handed a full life term for the murder of 20-year-old Godden, a sex worker, and – eight years later – the killing of Sian O’Callaghan, 22, an office administrator, shines a light on the issue of women who have vanished. Godden’s family at least know the worst now that taxi driver Halliwell has been found guilty of murdering her and burying her body in a remote Gloucestershire field in 2003. Many other families live in limbo. An estimated 250,000 people go missing every year, around half of them women. Most return swiftly. But according to the UK Missing Persons Bureau, which is run by the National Crime Agency (NCA), around 2,100 people become long-term missing every year. Approximately half of them are women. It is difficult to pinpoint how many become murder victims. Home Office research that looked at data from around a third of UK forces found that over an eight year period, 98 people who had been reported missing were killed, and two thirds of them were women. But many who work with missing people believe that this may be the tip of the iceberg. The lack of a central database of missing people – something the NCA is pushing for – and patchiness in the way police forces across the UK collate the figures makes it hard to know exactly how many women go missing – and how many come to harm. Susannah Drury, director of policy and research at the charity Missing People, said the Halliwell case highlighted the lack of a central information point. She said: “Having a central database would make a huge difference in terms of intelligence sharing and give us a clearer picture of the extent of the issue.” Peter Lawrence, whose daughter Claudia remains missing after vanishing from York in 2009, said the best source of information tended to be Missing People rather than the authorities. “I’m sure there could be more national co-ordination,” he said. When his daughter vanished, he was shocked at the lack of official support, although it has improved over the years. “But more could be done,” he said.
Karen Shalev Greene, director at the Centre for the Study of Missing Persons at Portsmouth university, said the way police forces handled missing persons reports had improved in the five years since the story of Becky Godden first emerged. “I think there is more awareness of risk factors but improvements are still needed,” she said. The confusion over missing people was illustrated this week when various media outlets named six women who might have been victims of Halliwell. The Guardian has now established that three of the women are alive. However, Halliwell may have been involved in the disappearance of 25-year-old Melanie Hall, a hospital worker, who went missing in Bath in 1996 after leaving a nightclub. Linda Razzell, a 41-year-old college worker, went missing in Swindon in 2002. Her body has not been found and her estranged husband, Glyn, was convicted of her murder but has always protested his innocence. Perhaps the disappearance of most interest to the Halliwell team is that of 23-year-old Sallyann John, a sex worker who went missing in 1995 from the same red light area – Manchester Road – as Becky Godden. Her body has not been found and in 2014 police said they believed she had been murdered. Her mother, Lesley John, has said she thinks of her daughter every day and – like John Godden – imagines her walking through the door. “I have had to deal with the thought that she may have been killed. However, I have never given up hope that one day she might walk through the door. I still cannot believe that in all these years no one has come forward to say where Sally is. Someone out there knows what happened to Sally.” Whether or not Halliwell is behind John’s murder, detectives are convinced he has killed more. They do not believe he suddenly became a killer as he approached his 40th year – or that there was such a long gap between murders. His choice of career – he was a chauffeur and ground worker who travelled the country as well as a taxi driver – meant he would have had other chances to kill, and police are sure he would have taken them. Criminologists agree with police that there are probably other Halliwell victims to find. David Wilson, professor of criminology at Birmingham City university and a former prison governor, said: “Most serial killers start to kill when they’re in the late teens or early 20s. Halliwell probably wasn’t starting off when he killed Becky Godden. He is old to begin to commit that sort of murder. There was then a significant gap before he killed Sian O’Callaghan. That is very unusual. “The question he posed in prison over how many people you need to kill before being considered a serial killer is important. A lot of killers fantasise about that. They buy books about serial murder. The become fascinated with the phenomenon. In defending himself during his trial, Halliwell revealed his narcissism. He will love this speculation about what else he has done. “If I was to have a cookie cutter and put it on the mass of male humanity and say this was the cookie cutter shape for a serial killer it would be him.” The tough task of locating more victims will begin with police trying to pinpoint his timeline going back 30 years. They will consult forces across the UK and the NCA. Meanwhile, women like Becky Godden continued to work the streets of Swindon this week. Jess Halsall, an outreach worker for the charity the Nelson Trust, said: “They face risk every day. They take it on the chin and move on.” Halsall recently supported a sex worker in her 40s who was subjected to a vicious sexual attack after being picked up on Manchester Road. She bravely gave evidence and her attacker, Barrie Zervanro, was jailed for eight years. “There is so much violence against these women,” said Halsall. “They are so vulnerable.” Whenever Halsall sees one of the 40 or so women she works with she feels a mixture of sadness and relief: “I worry if I see the women; I worry if I don’t.”"
2016-09-23T18:10:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Murder inquiry launched after Czech man 'beaten to death' in London,"A man who was followed down the street and beaten to death by teenagers in east London has been named as Zdeněk Makar, a 31-year-old Czech who lived in the area. He was involved in an argument with one of the teenagers as he waited to be served in a takeaway in Poplar, police believe. Scotland Yard has launched a murder investigation and detectives are appealing for witnesses after the victim was found close to All Saints Docklands light railway station by East India Dock Road in Poplar. Makar was pronounced dead at the scene at 12.22am on Thursday, police said. A postmortem held on Friday gave the cause of death as traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage – a stroke caused by bleeding on the brain. Next of kin have been informed. Police understand that Makar, who was dressed in a suit and tie, was involved in an altercation with a group of men inside Perfect Fried Chicken on East India Dock Road. He was then followed down the street and attacked. A Met spokesperson said: “At this early stage, there is no evidence to suggest that this was a racially motivated attack.” A worker at the chicken shop told the Evening Standard: “I don’t know what the argument was about but there was no pushing or shoving, no one threw a punch. They were swearing at each other but it was all over in about 10 seconds.” The witness described how the teenager, who appeared to be aged 16-17, went outside to speak to his friends, one of whom came into the shop, put his arm around the victim and said: “You shouldn’t have spoken to him like that.” The witness added: “They both took their food outside and that was it. Ten minutes later, we saw all the police and ambulance turn up.” A second witness, a shopkeeper, told the Standard he went to the scene after seeing the emergency services. He saw a cyclist there with blood on his face after trying to give the victim mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, he said. Witnesses should call police on 020 8345 3985 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. No arrests have been made."
2016-09-23T18:23:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Denis Donaldson's family say Provisional IRA did not kill him,"The family of Denis Donaldson, a British spy inside the IRA who was murdered in 2006 after he was exposed as being a secret agent, have said they do not believe his former comrades in the Provisionals killed him. Donaldson’s relatives also rejected claims broadcast on a BBC investigation earlier this week that Gerry Adams sanctioned the killing of his former colleague at a remote cottage in Donegal a decade ago.
A lawyer for the Donaldson family met the deputy head of the Garda Síochána on Friday to discuss the allegations contained in the Spotlight investigation on BBC One. Following that meeting, solicitor Ciaran Shiels, speaking on behalf of the Donaldson family, said: “The one theme that has come of today’s meeting is that the theory that was being advanced by BBC Spotlight earlier this week, that this was in some way carried out by the Provisional IRA or authorised by Gerry Adams, I think it’s absolute nonsense. “It does not marry in any way with the lines of inquiry that have been progressed by the [Garda] or by the police ombudsman.”
The BBC has consistently defended the integrity of the programme and also rejected calls on Friday from the Sinn Féin deputy leader, Mary Lou McDonald, that the Spotlight team pass on the name of an informant who made the claims about Adams to the Garda. A BBC spokesman said: “As stated in the programme, the source’s identity must be protected for reasons of safety.” The Real IRA admitted responsibility for killing Donaldson at his cottage in Glenties shortly after the former senior republican was exposed as a long-term British agent. Gerry Adams has categorically denied having any involvement in the Donaldson murder and has indicated that he might issue legal proceedings over the allegations."
2016-09-24T11:54:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Youth hostels head upmarket and into the cities,"Rickety bunk beds, spartan shared bathrooms and walkers and backpackers in woolly socks returning from a refreshing hike in the countryside. These are the images many people associate with a stay in a youth hostel. Yet the Youth Hostels Association has been overseeing a gradual process of modernisation and, this week, will make arguably its most significant move since it was founded by philanthropic members of the Holiday Fellowship in Liverpool in December 1929. On Monday the YHA will submit plans for the biggest commercial venture in its history, investing £30m in a partnership with Westfield, the company that owns Britain’s largest shopping centre. Work is due to start early next year on building a new hostel in the Olympic Park, next to Stratford station in east London. It will have 850 beds, nearly three times as many as any other YHA property. From woolly socks to Westfield is quite a leap but the transition is the climax of the organisation’s evolution over the past few years. “We’ve never been busier, never been healthier, on the back of our modernisation programme,” said YHA commercial director Joe Lynch. Most significantly, the YHA has switched its focus away from the traditional, often remote countryside hostels to concentrate on city centre properties. In 2014 a hotel near Brighton pier was converted into a hostel and major refurbishment has been carried out in the past two years at three properties in London, plus others in Cambridge, Bath, Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester, York and Oxford. The next cities on the wishlist are Birmingham and Leeds. There have been grumbles, mainly from “traditionalist” members, but modernisation may just have rescued the UK’s youth hostelling movement, which less than a decade ago was floundering. In 2001, a foot and mouth epidemic saw rural travel restricted: hostels closed and the charity took a multi-million pound bashing. “That really knocked the stuffing out of us,” said YHA chief executive Caroline White. There was a cash loss of £2m and revenue was down £4m year on year. The next setback was bird flu, then along came the recession. Some staff doubted the organisation’s ability to cope with another financial battering. “They would ask me, ‘Do you think we’ll survive?’ They were worried,” said White, who was appointed for six months in 2008 to sort out the worst of the problems, but has stayed on.
The YHA decided to spend millions of pounds on city centre hostels, using the income from these to help to fund investment in the rural network – 11 of the 12 projects planned for 2017 and 2018 are in the countryside, including a major new build in Northumberland. Only 15% of the YHA’s 140 properties are in urban areas, “but with 99.5% occupancy rates in London, it is clear that they can generate far more income than the rural hostels,” said Lynch. In London, Brighton and Cambridge, more than half of all stays are by overseas visitors; in rural areas it is one in 10. Speaking at the new hostel in Brighton, Lynch added: “The traditional concept of membership has probably had its time. Today, we’ve had families, individual travellers, and an Irish youth football team staying here. Our walkers, surfers and cyclists will be aged from mid-30s to mid-90s, but our biggest single customer base is school groups. There was grumbling when we modernised but the argument in favour has won the case. In the past our biggest problem was image, but not now.” A problem at a hostel in Ambleside in the Lake District this year emphasised how much that image has changed. In days gone by it might have been boys sneaking into the girls’ dormitory or someone refusing to do the washing up. This time it ran out of prosecco. Until the 1980s there would have been no prosecco crisis because alcohol was banned at YHA hostels, as was using cars to reach its properties: arrival had to be on foot, by bicycle or in a canoe. Now there are family rooms, en suite bathrooms, “exclusive hire” parties, free Wi-Fi and 24-hour reception desks. Looking back to the dark days of the foot and mouth epidemic, White can see positives. “It forced the closure of several hostels that should have been closed a long time ago,” she said. “It helped us to start looking at what it needed to do.”"
2016-09-24T23:05:18Z,uk-news,UK news,‘I’d do it all over again’: last hurrah for the veterans of Cable Street,"It was a day that shaped Willie Myers’s life. A few weeks before his 15th birthday, the Jewish lad from the East End of London joined thousands to block the passage of fascists through their community. The violent fray – between Jews, Irish dockers, trade unionists, communists, Labour party members, housewives and children on the one hand, and police and fascists on the other – on 4 October 1936 went down in history as the battle of Cable Street. Eighty years on, Myers is one of a handful of participants still alive to pass on his memories and the lessons he has carried through his life.
“I remember the day so vividly, I can see it clearly,” he said. “After Cable Street, we carried on the fight against fascism and racism. Even today, if I had to do it all over again, I would. We haven’t learned the lessons of the past. Prejudice is still directed at Jews, but it’s even worse towards Muslims. When I hear of Muslims, or Polish people, being attacked today, I feel angry. I cannot fathom out why we can’t see each other as human beings. If we’re cut, we all bleed the same.” On 9 October, Myers will join the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, at an event hosted by the London Jewish Forum to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the battle. It will follow a march and rally in east London organised by Cable Street 80, an ad hoc coalition of trade unions, Bangladeshi associations, synagogues and anti-racist organisations, to be addressed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. “This anniversary is particularly important because it’s probably the last one where we’ll hear the voices of people who were there,” said David Rosenberg of Cable Street 80. “Most are now well into their 90s. We should honour the people who fought against fascism and show our commitment in the present and the future against racism and prejudice and for a multicultural society.” Adrian Cohen of the London Jewish Forum said: “Cable Street is a notable event in its own right, but also part of the heritage of London Jewry. Most of the Jewish community is no longer based in east London, but this is something we don’t want to lose.”
In 1936, Hitler’s Nazis were gathering strength across Europe. In Spain, the civil war between Republicans and Franco’s Nationalists – aided by Hitler and Mussolini – was galvanising socialists and communists to join the fight against fascism. In Britain, Sir Oswald Mosley’s blackshirted and jackbooted British Union of Fascists was seeking to stir up anti-Jewish hatred among working-class Londoners. Mosley announced his forces would march through the East End. After the government refused a request by local groups for a ban, there was disagreement over how to respond. The Jewish Board of Deputies and the Labour party were against confrontation. “Jews are urgently warned to keep away from the route of the Blackshirt march and from their meetings,” said the Jewish Chronicle. “Jews who, however innocently, become involved in any possible disorders will be actively helping antisemitism and Jew-baiting. Unless you want to help the Jew-baiters, keep away.” The advice was widely rejected by the people of east London, and especially by the Communist party, which was building a popular front against fascism. Myers, who had recently joined the Young Communist League, ignored his father’s warning to stay away. “I was fired up and ready for a big battle. And it was a big battle! I’d never seen so many people in my life,” he said. About 300,000 people turned out to block the fascists and the police who were protecting their march. Barricades were built from paving stones, tables and chairs, mattresses; women emptied dustbins and chamber pots from windows on to the heads of policemen; children threw marbles under the hooves of police horses. According to newsreel reports, about 6,000 police were deployed. “Communists, Labourites and Jews jam the fascist route, resisting the peaceful efforts of the outnumbered police to clear a way,” ran the commentary, showing young men clenching their fists in a universal symbol of resistance.
The crowds shouted the Spanish civil war slogan “No Pasarán!” – they shall not pass – and “One, two, three, four, five – we want Mosley, dead or alive”. Bill Fishman, a social historian who died in 2014 aged 93, recalled the scene: “We all charged towards Cable Street. At the bottom end, an overturned lorry was used as a barricade and we blocked the road – Hasidic Jews with little beards and great strapping Irish dockers all standing together. People began to throw down their mattresses to block the street and a mass onslaught on the police ensued, with two officers even being taken hostage.” The newsreel showed punches being thrown and mounted policemen swinging truncheons at the crowds. “Batons are drawn and heads are broken as the anti-fascist demonstrators resist efforts to disperse them,” ran the commentary. For teenage Myers, it was an eye-opener. “I had a great opinion of the police until then. Our local copper was a friendly man, he knew everyone. But when I saw the baton charges, I changed my mind there and then. It seemed to me they were doing the work of the fascists for them.” After hours of running battles, including about 80 arrests and scores of people treated at ad hoc first-aid stations, word came that the fascists had turned back. The crowd was triumphant. “Everyone was embracing,” said Fishman. Eighty years on, the issues faced in Cable Street in 1936 have not gone away, said Rosenberg. “There is still racism and neo-fascism across Europe. Here in the UK, the explicitly fascist organisations are very fragmented, but in the post-Brexit climate racism and xenophobia are on the increase.” The tactical debates around Cable Street have strong echoes today, said Cohen. “To what extent should you confront the radical right directly, or should you ignore them, deny them the oxygen of publicity?” In the 1930s, the population in the area around Cable Street was more than 50% Jewish. In the postwar years, the community largely moved north, to Hackney, Stamford Hill and Golders Green. There has also been political change. In the 1930s, Jews were the stalwarts of the Communist party, fighting not just against fascism and racism but also for workers’ rights and social justice. Now many British Jews are suspicious of the left and its views on Israel, with many believing antisemitism lurks behind support for the Palestinian cause. Today, more than half the population of the London borough of Tower Hamlets are black or ethnic minority, with 32% of Bangladeshi heritage. According to the 2011 census, white British residents formed 31% of the local population, against 80% nationally. A huge mural commemorating the 1936 battle covers one end of St George’s town hall on Cable Street. Passersby one lunchtime last week encapsulated the diverse melting pot of London: a Gambian, Romanian, Italian, Lithuanian, Irishman, Iranian and a history student from Bristol. Danny, the student, had come to see the epic mural. “Given the current climate, the battle of Cable Street still has enormous relevance,” he said. “There are rightwing nationalist movements in France, Germany, Austria – and here we have Ukip. The way things are going, future generations need to learn the lessons.”"

Raymond Sculley, of Sherman House, Poplar, will appear at Thames magistrates court on Monday charged with 31-year-old Zdeněk’s murder in East India Dock Road on Wednesday 21 September. Two others arrested on Friday – a 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy – have been released on bail pending further inquiries. Both are due to return to a police station in east London on dates in early October. Makar, 31, was pronounced dead in the street near the All Saints Docklands light railway station in Poplar on Wednesday night, the Metropolitan police said. His death reportedly followed a row in a chicken takeaway shop in east London. A postmortem examination on Friday revealed that Makar died from head injuries."
2016-09-25T17:06:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Claudia Lawrence case ‘fits behaviour pattern’ of Christopher Halliwell,"The disappearance of chef Claudia Lawrence, who was last seen in 2009, fits with the pattern of behaviour of double murderer Christopher Halliwell, according to the former detective who originally caught the killer. Former Wiltshire detective superintendent Steve Fulcher said Halliwell’s links to the area where Lawrence vanished should be investigated and also suggested he could be linked with the disappearance of 25-year-old university graduate Melanie Hall. Halliwell, from Swindon, was last week given a full-life term – meaning he will die in prison – for the sexually motivated murder of 20-year-old Becky Godden, almost four years after he was jailed for killing 22-year-old Sian O’Callaghan. Lawrence disappeared on her way to work at the University of York from her home in March 2009 and no sign of her has been found. In March the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to bring charges against four men who were arrested in 2015. Hall disappeared in 1996 after leaving a nightclub in Bath, Somerset, and her remains were later found in vegetation off the northbound slipway at junction 14 of the M5 at Thornbury in 2009. A 45-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murdering her was released on bail in June. Fulcher told the Sunday Express: “Claudia Lawrence disappeared from York seven years ago. Halliwell’s father lived a few streets away from where Claudia went missing. It fits his pattern of behaviour: abducting women walking alone either late at night or early in the morning.” Following Friday’s sentence police repeated that they believed Halliwell – a chauffeur and a ground worker who travelled the UK – had killed other women and revealed that they were pursuing other lines of inquiry on other possible offences after calls making further allegations. North Yorkshire police are investigating the possibility of linking Halliwell to the Lawrence case. A spokesman for the force said: “The investigation team is aware of this matter and they will carefully assess the information in line with the ongoing review of the Claudia Lawrence case. However, to be clear, the team is not aware of any evidence that would link this individual [Halliwell] to the disappearance and suspected murder of Claudia.” Fulcher, who is now a security consultant in Somalia, suggested Halliwell could also be linked to the murder of Hall. “The circumstances match his modus operandi in abducting a girl late at night from a nightclub. Evidence of her being tied up with rope is consistent with Halliwell’s interests,” he said. Halliwell originally confessed to the murder of O’Callaghan and led Fulcher to the field where he had dumped her body, but the confessions were later ruled inadmissible by a high court judge because the detective had failed to caution the killer, breaching police procedural rules for the interviewing of suspects. Fulcher was found guilty of gross misconduct by a police disciplinary panel and resigned from Wiltshire police several months after being given a final written warning, ending his 27-year police career. The mother of Godden has also said she believed her daughter’s killer could be linked to the disappearances of both Lawrence and Hall. Karen Edwards told the Mail on Sunday that during her own inquiries into Halliwell she discovered Lawrence had gone missing exactly two years before he abducted O’Callaghan. “I believe he has been up and down the country murdering young women,” she said. She added: “Serial killers are usually triggered by dates. That was the day that Halliwell broke up with one of his partners. Halliwell was familiar with York – his father lived in Huddersfield – and the description of Claudia’s murderer is identical to him: a left-handed smoker, 5ft 8-10in, with slightly receding hair and a skinny build.” Martin Dales, a friend and spokesman of Lawrence’s father, Peter, said the claim should be investigated, as the retired officer had “a detailed knowledge of things”. He said: “It’s a heartbreaking period to go without somebody and we hope this will come to some conclusion - whether this is it is for other people to find out.”"
2016-09-25T23:01:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Parents urged to boycott requests for children's country of birth information,"Parents are being urged to boycott requests to disclose their child’s nationality and country of birth over fears it could turn teachers into de facto border guards and stoke divisions in the classroom. Human rights groups are concerned that the data, collected for the first time this year from pupils aged two to 19 as part of the schools census, could be used against children and their families by immigration enforcement. The Department for Education (DfE) insists that the information will not be handed to the Home Office and that the data is being collected and input to the national pupil database (NPD) to ensure children “receive the best possible education”. However, disclosures under freedom of information laws have shown that the Home Office has been handed NPD data on 18 occasions since 2012, while police requests for information from the dataset were granted 31 times. Disclosure is not compulsory, but a recent investigation by the trade magazine Schools Week found that schools were misinterpreting official guidance by demanding pupils’ passport numbers and even specifically targeting the parents of non-white children. “That creates a climate where half the class is being told you’ve got to bring in your passport and the other half haven’t,” said Gracie Mae Bradley, from Against Borders for Children. “In a post-Brexit environment, kids are already precarious; they are already feeling like it’s not a good thing to be a migrant child and this further divides them.” She called on parents to boycott the census questions. “If every parent in the country exercised that right to refuse, that would protect all undocumented children from any potential enforcement action and it also sends a very strong signal about the kind of society that we want to live in.” On Monday, more than 20 groups are writing to the education secretary, Justine Greening, to ask her to reverse the requirement for schools to collect the data, warning that the plan risked violating the right to privacy of children and families. “Our grave concern is that the new data will be shared with the Home Office and therefore used for immigration enforcement purposes,” says the letter, whose signatories include Liberty, the Migrants’ Rights Network and Privacy International. “We have already seen data-sharing between the Home Office and other departments increase since the government announced its commitment to creating a ‘hostile environment’ for undocumented migrants. Such measures deter vulnerable children and families from accessing essential services, exercising their human rights and participating on an equal basis in our communities.” Campaigners see the new census requirement as the latest step in a crackdown on what the government has dubbed “education tourism”. In 2013, ministers were forced to abandon proposals to exclude the children of undocumented migrants from school, amid fears it would breach international human rights law. But two years later, Nicky Morgan, then education secretary, ordered officials to investigate how much of a “pull factor” state schools were for immigrants, as part of measures to slash net migration. “And then, in 2016, you get this announcement about monitoring the scale and impact of pupil migration on the education sector,” Bradley said. Bella Sankey, policy director of Liberty, the human rights group, said the latest plan risked creating “a chilling effect around school attendance”. “Hostile-environment policies are deeply problematic,” she said. “They outsource immigration enforcement to private citizens and public sector workers whose roles have nothing to do with border control. This latest wave of reforms targets sensitive public services like healthcare and education. It is insidious to be targeting the kids and risks making them additionally vulnerable if they are then kept away from school.” Don Flynn, director of the Migrants’ Rights Network, said the proposal jeopardised “a decade of real advance” in the relationships between schools and migrant communities. He said: “People in migrant communities across the UK have been thrown into great uncertainty about their future as a result of the Brexit vote and the harsher tone of the public debate. “The DfE should not be adding to this anxiety by introducing a measure which will inevitably increase the sense of being watched and scrutinised by state agencies with a view to future deportations.” The DfE insisted it took the privacy of children seriously and that the data would be used for research purposes and not be routinely published. A spokesperson said: “These data items will not be passed to the Home Office. They are solely for internal Department for Education use for analysis, statistics and research. “This information will be used to help us better understand how children with, for example, English as an additional language, perform in terms of their broader education and to assess and monitor the scale and impact immigration may be having on the schools sector.”"

Three thousand photos are alleged to have been stolen from Middleton’s account, apparently including images of Middleton’s sister, the Duchess of Cambridge, and her children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. An unidentified individual contacted reporters at the Daily Mail and Sun last week on WhatsApp offering them access to the photos. The Sun said it had been asked for £50,000 in 48 hours. The photos included images of Middleton at a wedding dress fitting and a nude picture of her fiance, James Matthews, the Sun reported. A 35-year-old man was arrested in Northampton on Saturday night on suspicion of an offence under the Computer Misuse Act, and was questioned by officers from the Metropolitan police.

Her departure was announced as disgruntled Southern passengers closed in on a fundraising target in an effort to pay for a judicial review of the rail franchise. Dyan Crowther, chief operating officer at Southern’s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), will become chief executive at HS1, the link between London and the start of the Channel tunnel in Kent. Crowther, who will join HS1 next year, has presided over operations at GTR during an industrial relations and reliability crisis that has infuriated passengers. Southern services have been disrupted for months amid a protracted dispute over staff shortages and the role of conductors. The Rail Maritime and Transport (RMT) union is planning14 days of strikes from October to December. More than 900 Southern users affected by the ongoing dispute have clubbed together to raise the cash to fund a judicial review of the franchise award to GTR. The Association of British Commuters said it has now raised £18,000 of the £25,000 needed to move ahead with the courtroom challenge. The group’s lawyers have written to the Department for Transport asking to see documents related to the award but say their requests have not been granted.
“We have been delighted with the public response to our campaign,” the group said in a statement. “What has been extremely disappointing, however, is the Department for Transport’s failure to engage with us. “We have asked the most straightforward of questions and have been met firstly with two weeks of silence, and now with a further delay whilst they consider whether to lift the lid on the franchise. This conduct just underlines the fact that judicial review is the only option available to us.” Emily Yates, the group’s campaign co-ordinator, said: “It is hard to understand why they cannot be transparent about their dealings with a private company that is failing on such an unprecedented scale.” The group is planning a protest at Victoria station in London on Thursday."
2016-09-26T15:57:50Z,uk-news,UK news,"Former HBOS banker received string of bribes, court hears","A senior former banker at HBOS received a string of bribes over five years – including cash, use of a credit card, luxury holidays and payments for prostitutes – in exchange for agreeing bank loans channelled to ailing business with little or no hope of recovery, a court has heard. Lynden Scourfield had been in charge of dealing with many businesses across the South of England and Wales that were struggling to repay HBOS loans, deciding whether the bank should waive repayments, offer further funding, or allow the business to go bust. A jury at Southwark crown court was told on Monday that he had been engaged in a corrupt relationship with former banker and venture capitalist David Mills, who had set up a turnaround consultancy business called Quayside Corporate Services. Scourfield insisted that struggling businesses dependent on HBOS funding must hire the services of Quayside before he would advance further loans. He then signed off further high-risk loans that were not in the interests of the bank. “Scourfield advanced huge sums to the businesses, and continued to do so well past the point when it would have been obvious to any honest banker that the bank debt could and would never be repaid,” prosecution counsel Brian O’Neill QC told the court. This allowed Mills and his associates to demand allegedly excessive fees for consultancy services and, in some instances, provided an opportunity for them to take control of the struggling companies, running them for their own benefit. More than £28m passed from HBOS through the bank accounts of either Mills, his wife or companies under his control, O’Neill said. Not all of that sum stayed with the defendants, he conceded, though Mills and his wife “did benefit enormously”. Meanwhile, HBOS incurred losses of about £245m on lending managed by Scourfield, the jury heard, all of which ultimately had to be written off. “The motivation was greed,” O’Neill told the court. “Police ... uncovered evidence of huge rewards provided by Mills to Scourfield to effect his corruption. “This took the form of money transfers, cash, expensive gifts, use of an American Express card for personal spending, unauthorised and inappropriately lavish hospitality, luxurious foreign travel and sexual encounters with high class escorts.” The jury were told to ignore the fact that Scourfield was not sitting alongside Mills and five other defendants in the dock. “He is not on trial and you must not speculate about his absence or the reasons for it,” O’Neill explained. Mills faces charges of conspiracy to corrupt, fraudulent trading and conspiracy to conceal criminal property. His wife and former business associates Michael Bancroft, Tony Cartwright and Jonathan Cohen, together with a second former HBOS banker Mark Dobson, variously face similar charges. Struggling businesses the alleged conspirators were said to have used to conceal their corruption included a textile business called Magenta and a pornographic magazine firm called Remnant. The trial continues."
2016-09-26T16:45:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Man charged with helping Rochdale imam's killer flee UK,"Detectives investigating the murder of a respected imam in Rochdale have charged a man for helping his killer flee the country. Mohammed Syadul Hussain, 24, has been charged with assisting an offender over the murder of Jalal Uddin, police said. He is accused of helping Mohammed Kadir – described by a judge as Uddin’s killer – leave the country for Turkey three days after the murder on 18 February. Hussain, from Rochdale, had been remanded in custody to appear at Manchester crown court, Greater Manchester police said. The fresh charge comes 10 days after Mohammed Syeedy, 21, was jailed for a minimum of 24 years for his part in Uddin’s murder. Kadir and Syeedy killed 71-year-old Uddin because he practiced a form of Islamic healing considered to be “black magic” by some extremists, the trial heard. Syeedy and his friends surveilled Uddin for 18 months before Kadir bludgeoned him to death with a hammer in a children’s playground as he walked home from his mosque at night. Counter-terrorism police are hunting for Kadir but fear he may have slipped across the Turkish border and joined Islamic State in Syria. The trial heard how the 24-year-old, from Oldham, “drained his bank account” and flew to Istanbul via Copenhagen three days after the killing. The judge, Sir David Maddison, said he did not believe the intention was to kill Uddin, but to “cause extremely grave and permanently disabling harm” so that he would be unable to practise Islamic healing. Syeedy played an “absolutely integral” part in the murder, the judge said, describing the killing as a “carefully planned, premeditated” attack on a vulnerable victim. The judge refused to refer to Kadir by name throughout his sentencing, referring to him only as “the killer”. Describing Uddin as “gentle” and “well-respected”, the judge said the “brutal” killing was a hate crime but did not match the sentencing threshold of a religiously motivated murder, which carries a minimum term of 30 years’ imprisonment. “It seems to me that this was a case of two members of the Muslim faith killing another member of the Muslim faith solely because they disapproved of a particular practice carried out by that person,” Maddison said."
2016-09-26T18:53:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Police accused of failing to investigate if Christopher Halliwell is serial killer,"The former senior detective who caught the double murderer Christopher Halliwell has accused the police of failing to seriously investigate if he is a serial killer – and has suggested a specific date he believes the taxi driver may have habitually struck on. Taxi driver Halliwell is beginning a full life term – meaning he will never be released – for the sexually motivated murders of Swindon women Becky Godden and Sian O’Callaghan. Wiltshire police have said they will now examine if he may have killed others, but Steve Fulcher, the ex-detective superintendent who tracked down Halliwell in 2011, claimed much of the information that pointed to him being a serial killer was available five years ago but had not been acted on. Speaking to the Guardian, he said: “He was quite apparently a serial killer. We had 43 packs prepared for each of the forces across the country detailing everything we knew about Halliwell with a view to putting him against outstanding inquiries. We did timelines, we knew his vehicles, his associations.” Calling for an inquiry into police handling of the case, he said: “All the information was there in May 2011 but no investigation was conducted by Wiltshire police. There needs to be an inquiry asking why. It is utter madness that this wasn’t done.” Fulcher also called for a commission to be set up to look at the issue of the thousands of vulnerable women – like Becky Godden – who vanish every year. The former detective flagged up 19 March as a date when Halliwell may have committed other offences. He pointed out that:
Office worker Sian O’Callaghan, 22, went missing on 19 March 2011 after leaving a nightclub in Swindon. Halliwell was to lead Fulcher to her partially naked and mutilated body at a remote spot in Oxfordshire. Another Swindon woman, Linda Razzell, went missing on 19 March 2002 aged 41. Fulcher said that Halliwell did building work for Razzell. Her husband, Glyn, has been jailed for her murder though her body has never been found and he denies any involvement. The chef Claudia Lawrence, 35, failed to turn up to her work shift in York on 19 March 2009. Halliwell has a connection with the area – his father lives in the neighbourhood. Fulcher said: “I’m not saying Halliwell has killed Linda Razzell. I’m saying that prospect has to be investigated. Glyn Razzell protests his innocence. There’s potential for a miscarriage of justice. On Claudia Lawrence, again I’m not saying Halliwell is responsible. I’m saying there’s enough connection there to investigate.” “What you’d be looking at is events in his life correlating to that date. You’d be looking at that from a psychological perspective.” Fulcher said no investigation into a possible link to Lawrence and Halliwell had taken place; North Yorkshire police said a review of the case was ongoing but the “team was not aware of any evidence that would link” Halliwell. The former officer, who is now working as a law enforcement consultant in Somalia, emphasised he was not suggesting Halliwell only killed on or around 19 March. Becky Godden is thought to have been killed in January 2003, aged 20. Halliwell said he would be “very surprised” if Halliwell did not kill Sallyann John, who like Becky Godden was a Swindon sex worker. She went missing in September 1995 when she was 24 and her body has never been found. Fulcher said Halliwell was known to consort with John and lived nearby. Fulcher said he was also amazed that Halliwell had not been spoken to over the murder of 25-year-old Melanie Hall, who like O’Callaghan went missing from a nightclub, though in Bath, in June 1996. “Avon and Somerset police say they’re happy it’s not him. Melanie Hall’s never been put to Halliwell. How can you be happy it’s not him? You’re supposed to keep an open mind.”
Fulcher left Wiltshire police following a disciplinary procedure over Halliwell. After the taxi driver became his prime suspect in the abduction of O’Callaghan, Fulcher, the senior investigating officer, had ordered that he be arrested. Halliwell refused to say where O’Callaghan was so Fulcher had him taken to a remote hill fort, Barbury Castle, where he met him in person. Fulcher believed O’Callaghan was still alive and wanted to give Halliwell one last chance to come clean. Halliwell agreed to take Fulcher to O’Callaghan’s body – she was already dead – and from there led him to a field where he had buried Godden’s body some eight years before. A judge initially ruled that this “confession” evidence was not admissible in court. There was other evidence linking Halliwell to O’Callaghan and he was to plead guilty to her murder in 2012. But he denied having anything to do with Godden’s death and was only convicted last week following a trial at Bristol crown court. Fulcher insisted he was right to act as he did – morally but also in law. Of the encounter with Halliwell, he said: “It was an extraordinary moment. We had a bond formed at Barbury Castle and at Uffington White Horse and Eastleach [respectively where O’Callaghan’s and Godden’s bodies were found]. He was crying on my shoulder, pleading for my help. That has turned into hatred. In his moment of weakness he confessed. He’s kicking himself. He has realised that if he had kept silent he would be continuing his killing spree to this date. We would never have found Sian or Becky’s [bodies].” Fulcher said at Barbury Castle there had been a “contest” between O’Callaghan’s right to life – he believed she was alive – under section two of the European convention on human rights, and Halliwell’s right to silence and access to a lawyer under Pace – the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. Fulcher insisted he was not a “maverick” as he is often portrayed, but was closely following the rules set out in the police’s kidnap and extortion manual. This includes the paragraph: “The primary objective of a crime in action investigation is article 2 right to life. This means that the normal investigative priorities of securing evidence, arresting an offender and prosecution are relegated.” Fulcher said there had been no Pace-compliant way of getting O’Callaghan back had she been alive – or of finding Godden’s remains. He added: “It was a straightforward choice. In Sian’s case, do I try to save her life or don’t I? As far as Becky is concerned, do I find Becky or don’t I? There is no middle ground. I conducted negotiations under the kidnap procedures. What else could I do? Nobody has been able to identify that.” The former detective said officers now would not put finding another O’Callaghan or Godden before a suspect’s rights in case they were treated as he was. “Missing people will not be properly investigated,” he said. “The public needs to know what the police will do now or won’t do if a daughter is kidnapped.”
Fulcher praised Godden’s mother, Karen Edwards, arguing that Halliwell would not have been brought to justice for her daughter’s murder if she had not kept the pressure on the police and prosecutors. “She is an amazing woman,” Fulcher said. He also said that not enough was done by society to make sure women did not vanish from sight. Some 250,000 people are reported missing every year. Fulcher said: “And these aren’t the most vulnerable ones. The ones we don’t know about are the most vulnerable – the prostitute community, the traveller community, the trafficked people, the migrants. We know nothing about them, we do nothing about it. What is the plan? What are we doing to help women who have been drawn into drugs, into a chaotic lifestyle like Becky? Very little.” A Wiltshire police spokesperson said it was due to the “diligence and professionalism” of the team that took over the Godden investigation that Halliwell had been found guilty of her murder. Following Halliwell’s conviction for Godden’s murder, the senior investigating officer confirmed that outstanding cases would now be reviewed. However, on Monday following Fulcher’s criticism, the spokesperson said: “From the early stages in this complicated investigation, it was conceivable that there may have been further victims of Christopher Halliwell. “This has always formed an important part of the senior investigating officer’s approach and this has been a key aspect of the investigation throughout. “We have already engaged with a number of agencies in relation to Christopher Halliwell. The additional information we have learned about Halliwell’s character during the court case, alongside the facts established regarding his modus operandi, will assist us going forward. “Serious and major crime investigations are a complex aspect of policing. It remains our commitment to keep an open mind and follow the evidence wherever that may take us, so if there are further victims of Halliwell, then our investigation will work tirelessly to bring justice for all those concerned. “To assist us in this, we strongly discourage speculation as this will cause further distress to families and friends of people who are currently missing across the country, who will clearly be desperate to have news of their loved ones. We would, however, welcome any new information from the public, or indeed, from Halliwell himself.” Elaine Pickford, the mother of Sian O’Callaghan, said on Monday she felt there was too much speculation around Halliwell’s suspected victims. She said: “Despite my belief that there is likely to have been more victims, I personally do not feel it is helpful to either the police or those families to publicly speculate on those victims, scenarios and to presume.”"
2016-09-26T19:59:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Jeremy Corbyn steps back from damaging Trident row,"Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader and lifelong campaigner against nuclear weapons, has agreed to put to one side any attempt to reverse Labour’s support for renewing Trident in a bid to reduce tensions with unions and rebel MPs. Clive Lewis, the shadow defence secretary, told the Guardian that Labour would continue to scrutinise moves to build a replacement for Britain’s nuclear deterrent – clarifying the leadership position hours after an apparent row on the issue. He added: “I won’t be coming back to conference between now and the next election to try to undo the policy we have on Trident as things stand.” The statement came after a bizarre episode at the party’s annual conference in which Lewis appeared to react angrily after a senior Labour figure altered his speech to delegates at the last minute. Seumas Milne, director of strategy and communications, was said to have used the autocue to remove the suggestion that Labour “would not seek to change” the party’s formal pro-nuclear policy before a general election, in a move that critics claimed was an attempt to tone down the announcement. Sources close to Lewis and Corbyn tried to play down the suggestion of a row, saying instead there were last-minute tweaks to the text of the speech and insisting that there was no divide on policy. They said that Labour’s collective position would remain in support of Trident renewal, but revealed that Corbyn would continue to speak out in opposition in line with his longstanding support of unilateral disarmament. The leader’s closest ally, John McDonnell, also waded into the debate by insisting that the deal to “park” any changes on Trident policy was meant to “steady the ship” but insisted that neither he nor Corbyn would be silenced on the issue. “On the Trident issue, as we did with Syria, there are strong differing views so there is always going to be a free vote. Jeremy and I and others will keep on campaigning and arguing the case but we recognise that these are really strong conscience issues,” he told the Guardian. A source suggested that Corbyn had been persuaded because he knew that the renewal had already been passed by a vote in parliament. However, the leader also took the opportunity to pass a new policy through Labour’s national executive committee promising to “honour our international treaty obligations on nuclear disarmament”, something that he believes would be breached by the renewal of Trident. “Jeremy has not changed his view at all and will not be under any obligation to do so but this is a collective position for the party, it gives us a way forward,” they said. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, told the BBC the party’s overarching defence review was continuing. It is understood that the issue has been discussed with trade union leaders who fear that Labour’s position will endanger their members’ jobs. But the pledge drew an angry response from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, of which Corbyn is a vice-president and long-term supporter.
The organisation accused Lewis of “abandoning the defence review” and defying the democratic wishes of the majority of Labour members. “There is enormous opposition to Trident replacement within the Labour party and there will be huge disappointment at this U-turn by Clive Lewis,” it said. “We have no doubt that Labour members will work to oppose this disastrous announcement and bring a democratic debate to Labour’s conference next year. This issue is too important for Britain’s future to be left to questions of political tactics.” On the question of Milne’s eleventh-hour intervention, sources suggested that all speeches had to be agreed with the leader’s office, and it was not unusual for there to be last-minute changes. It is understood that Lewis was “a bit frustrated” by the number of late tweaks, although sources insisted that his anger was not linked to the content of the deletions. It is understood that GMB reps, who support Trident renewal, were unaware of the ongoing row within Corbyn’s office over defence policy. Delegates were expecting to hear a speech which would reinforce Lewis’s position of “wait and see” as the party’s defence policy review was concluded. Union insiders were pleased to hear a policy which appeared to reinforce the party’s current policy of calling for the renewal of Trident. In his platform speech, Lewis, a former army officer who served in Afghanistan, said he was “sceptical about Trident renewal” along with many of those at conference. “But I am clear that our party has a policy for Trident renewal,” he added. He said Labour would put multilateral disarmament at the forefront of its defence policy, committing to making headway on the international stage. “We will make our longstanding multilateralism reality, not rhetoric,” he said. “We will be working with international organisations, including the UN general assembly first committee on disarmament and international security, within the spirit and the letter of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.” John Woodcock, the MP for Barrow in Furness where the replacement submarines will be built, said: “This policy is unchangeable now so if this unfortunate behind-the-scenes tête-à-tête has made Labour’s leadership confront that reality then I suppose that’s a positive thing.” Lewis also used his party conference speech to mount a staunch defence of Nato, saying it was in keeping with Labour’s values of “collectivism, internationalism and the strong defending the weak”. Corbyn has been lukewarm about Nato and in the past has called for its membership to disband. Earlier this year, he avoided answering the question of whether he would automatically come to the defence of a Nato ally under attack. However, Lewis, an ally of the leader, made plain he was an outright supporter of the organisation and in a speech to the conference floor earlier in the day pledged as shadow defence secretary to commit the party to the 2% defence spending target met by the Conservatives. “Every Labour government since Attlee’s has met Nato’s spending target of at least 2% of GDP, every single year. And I confirm today that the next Labour government will do the same, including our UN and peacekeeping obligations,” he said."
2016-09-26T20:12:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Keith Vaz calls off Labour 'Diversity Nite' event in Liverpool,"An annual event organised by Keith Vaz to celebrate racial diversity in the Labour party has been cancelled. The former home affairs committee chair, who resigned over sex allegations, called off Diversity Nite a week and a half ago, according to staff at the Eastzeast restaurant in Liverpool, close to the party’s annual conference.
The event has became famous for giving Vaz the opportunity to be photographed dancing a bhangra with ministers or shadow ministers wearing fixed grins. In recent years, he has been photographed with Ed Balls on a brightly lit dancefloor, a precursor to the former shadow chancellor’s entrance on Strictly Come Dancing. Vaz was caught last month in a tabloid sting allegedly using the services of sex workers at the same time as his committee was investigating prostitution. Under intense media scrutiny and at the centre of Leicestershire police inquiries, he has not attended the conference. However, friends insist the event will be held again in the future. At the restaurant last night, a party promoting Labour’s links with the US took place on the top floor, where Vaz’s event had been held in previous years. Staff at the restaurant said the cancellation had cost the venue some takings but added that cancellations are part of the restaurant business."
2016-09-27T10:19:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Greater Manchester police investigate eight-man machete fight on quiet street,"Police have launched an investigation after eight men were involved in a machete fight in a quiet residential road. Officers were called to Car Bank Avenue in Atherton, Greater Manchester, shortly before 11am on Monday following reports that a group of men were fighting with the large blades. One man was found with minor injuries and three cars that had earlier been involved in a collision – a silver Fiat Stilo, a black Vauxhall Astra and a blue Vauxhall Omega – were abandoned on the same street. There have been no arrests and the victim did not require hospital treatment. Police have appealed for witnesses. DS Craig Hurst from Greater Manchester police said: “This is an unbelievable incident on the streets of Atherton. I know the community will be alarmed but we are putting all our efforts into finding those responsible. “There will be extra police in the area and anyone with any concerns can speak to our officers.”"
2016-09-27T13:38:39Z,uk-news,UK news,Council asks for child’s birth certificate before it will collect nappies,"A local authority in north Wales has told parents they must show their children’s birth certificates if they want binmen to collect dirty nappies. Waste management teams at Anglesey council have introduced the rules in an effort to cut waste, meet recycling targets and avoid fines from the Welsh government. They are asking parents to prove their child is three or under if they want nappies to be taken away, and say they have “evidence that most children are potty trained between ages of two and three”. But some families say the rules do not take account of different rates of child development or that some disabled children may need nappies beyond a certain age. Anglesey council has a service where parents can set up fortnightly nappy collections. Those who cannot prove their child is under three will be asked to put nappies with their household waste, which is collected every three weeks. Ian Cheney, whose five-year-old daughter Olivia has Down’s syndrome, said the new rules were “ludicrous” and accused the local authority of discrimination. Cheney, who lives in Amlwch with his wife Heather said: “They are using a blanket rule for all families which is just so frustrating. “There are so many families with disabled children who need this service so that are homes aren’t full of nappies and then also the fact that they are assuming that all children will be out of nappies by the age of three. The rules are not realistic. Cheney, a former careworker, added: “I automatically assumed that Livy would be eligible for the council service because of her disability. “She has some health issues related to her Down’s syndrome, including holes in her heart and some difficulty walking. At the moment, with fortnightly collections, it’s a struggle but we usually make it. But we have no hope of being able to cope for three weeks. “The council obviously knows it is hard for families to cope with three-weekly collections, which is why they’ve brought in this fortnightly nappy service. “But Livy is obviously bigger than a toddler so her nappies are also taking up more space. I’d have thought that disabled children who still need to wear nappies would be automatically eligible.” Steph Roberts, from the village of Gwalchmai on Anglesey, said: “I think it’s disgraceful that they’ve placed an age limit on the service. “I have a three year old who’s currently being potty trained and I know I’m not the only one in the same situation.” A council spokesman said they had evidence to suggest that most children are potty trained between the ages of two and three, so wants to make people prove their child’s age if they want to receive the service. He added: “It has therefore been agreed to offer this service up until a child’s third birthday. “Requesting a copy of a child’s birth certificate will allow us to monitor the number of children benefiting from the service and their respective ages. “It should be noted that this service will only be provided to the home address of the child and does not extend to any nursery, creche or child minding service they may attend.” The council has organised drop-in sessions to explain the changes at a local leisure centre and at a library."
2016-09-27T13:41:37Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan mayoral triumph is Labour's blueprint for surviving Corbyn,"Sadiq Khan’s speech to the Labour conference was carefully crafted to win audience applause but also, and most of all, to make point after point about the need to win elections and wield power. He congratulated Jeremy Corbyn on winning the most recent election he has run in, the pushover that has further strengthened his stranglehold on the Labour Party. After that, Khan didn’t mention Corbyn at all. He didn’t need to. The London mayor had already made clear what he thinks of Corbyn’s chances of emulating on a national scale his recent triumph in the fight for City Hall: “If Jeremy remains as leader, Labour is extremely unlikely to win the next general election.” Full marks for concision. So much is being written about Corbyn. So little is required. He is an ineffective Labour leader, both in parliament and in the country. Labour MPs from across the left-right spectrum have known this from day one. The Great British electorate too is unimpressed, including working-class voters Corbyn’s admirers insist he can inspire and floating voters he must attract. Those who’ve kept him in place as party leader are either naïvely idealistic, coldly manipulative or blissfully consumed by their own piety. While Corbyn leads it, Labour will fail to command the House of Commons or the general public’s confidence. His notion of building Labour into a grassroots movement that will transform society from below is fanciful. That’s all you need to know. The task now for Labour politicians who want to do more than address rallies of admirers and pretend in the face all evidence that they are on the path to victory is to work out how best to outlast Corbyn’s ascendancy until the Outer Left alliance that sustains him succumbs to disappointment, its customary internal bickering and its deep, ancestral longing to feel betrayed. That struggle to endure will take various forms. Khan has shown a way to do it. Others have used the conference to get their own, related strategies underway. The mood music from those who haven’t joined the “I’m With Corbyn” chorus has been conciliatory in a minor key. How generously they’ve greeted a victory they think calamitous. How plangently they’ve harmonised with their conqueror’s calls for unity. It is all part of their survival strategy. Andy Burnham, who has stayed on as shadow home secretary and steered a neutral course during the leadership campaign, was among the first to take this line. Next spring, he will seek to be elected executive mayor of Greater Manchester. His path to that post, which he clearly finds more appealing than being mired in endless parliamentary opposition, will be the smoother if he can neutralise the Corbyn drag effect. Sparing himself harassment by Corbynite inquisitors will be part of that. A bigger part will be separating himself from Corbyn in electors’ minds. In London, Khan could hardly have distanced himself from Corbyn more completely, running a self-contained campaign and allowing himself to be seen just twice in Corbyn’s company. His need to do so was increased by his having nominated Corbyn for the leadership ballot last year, despite being from the “soft” rather than “hard” left of the party. Cynics might suspect this was a ploy to help him vanquish his chief rival to become mayoral candidate, the Blairite Tessa Jowell. Cynics might be on to something there. Whatever, it led to Zac Goldsmith, Khan’s Tory opponent in the mayoral race itself, no doubt informed by private polling, trying to detrimentally link Khan and Corbyn in voters’ minds as part of a wider scare strategy. Khan’s response was to insist and, indeed, to demonstrate that he was his own, very different kind of politician. Corbynites protest that Khan’s huge win in May was really Corbyn’s. Team Khan, which secured the win, don’t see things that way at all. His success is now a blueprint for how Labour candidates of several kinds can establish in voters’ minds that they are not Corbyn’s men or Corbyn’s women. By this time next year there will almost certainly be Labour “metro mayors” in post in Liverpool and Birmingham as well as Manchester, with varying powers over their cities and surrounding areas. They, along with Carwyn Jones, the First Minister of Wales, will be the most powerful Labour politicians in the UK: high profile and, hopefully, on the road to becoming highly effective at implementing Labour programmes in new forms of regional government. Their progress, and that of Labour leaders of other big cities - Bristol, Leeds, Newcastle and more - in the years leading up to 2020 will depend less on the endeavours of their party’s national leader than on their marshalling of the resources they have at their disposal and their ability to persuade, enthuse and cajole a range of interest groups – housing providers, public sector bodies, educators, voluntary organisations, businesses and so on - to pursue progressive common goals. In the longer term, they will want to talk to the Conservative national government into giving them greater leeway to do things their way in the post-Brexit national interest. Collectively those governing Labour politicians could, in effect, represent a parallel, much broader Labour Party than the narrow one Corbyn leads; a very different political entity sharing the same name. This parallel Labour would be largely autonomous and, by necessity, pragmatic, practical and consensual. It would be localist, focused on fostering local growth, nurturing local skills and meeting local need, but also internationalist, looking outwards to the wider world to attract know-how and investment. It could be electorally helpful to Labour council and parliamentary candidates too, its endeavours and mayoral figureheads boosting hard-pressed contenders for marginal wards and constituencies. Would such candidates sooner be photographed with can-do winners like a future Mayor Burnham or Mayor Khan, or with Corbyn, who looks to most voters like a loser? There is, of course, serious talk of a Labour split. But an informal Labour fragmentation looks more likely, with the party’s separate strands increasingly going their own ways within the UK’s increasingly fragmented political landscape. By such means Corbyn’s leadership might be survived. Dave Hill is the author of Zac Versus Sadiq: The Fight to Become London Mayor, which is available from the Guardian Bookshop."
2016-09-27T15:38:38Z,uk-news,UK news,Three men face fraud trial over horsemeat scandal,"Three men have appeared in court charged with fraud relating to the horsemeat scandal of 2012. Andronicas Sideras, 54, from Southgate, north London; Ulrik Nielsen, 57, from Gentofte in Denmark; and Alex Ostler-Beech, 43, from Hull, are accused of conspiring together and with others to defraud customers by mixing horsemeat with beef to be sold dishonestly as beef that ended up in products such as burgers. The three appeared at City of London magistrates court on Tuesday. They were jointly charged after an international investigation led by the City of London police specialist fraud division for the Food Standards Agency. They were arrested and interviewed under caution in the summer of 2013; a fourth man interviewed at the same time has not been charged. The Crown Prosecution Service said it was bringing the charges, which relate to the period between January and October 2012, after careful examination of evidence from the UK and overseas. The three men were released on bail and ordered to reappear at Inner London crown court on 25 October."
2016-09-27T17:06:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Man arrested over 1965 murder of schoolgirl Elsie Frost,"Police officers investigating the murder of a schoolgirl who died more than 50 years ago have arrested a man in his 70s. Elsie Frost, a 14-year-old school prefect, was walking alongside a canal towpath in her bright red jacket, floral skirt and new shoes when she was stabbed in her back and head on 9 October 1965. A new investigation into Elsie’s murder was launched in 2015 by West Yorkshire police, involving a team of 14 police officers who examined thousands of pages of written evidence. On Tuesday, officers from the force’s homicide and major inquiry team arrested a 78-year-old man in Berkshire – named locally as Peter Pickering – on suspicion of her murder. He is now in custody at a police station in the Thames Valley and will be questioned by West Yorkshire officers. Although Elsie was murdered more than half a century ago her family never gave up hope of finding her killer. The horrific events that Saturday afternoon in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, left scars on the close-knit community: Elsie’s parents, railway worker Arthur and his wife, Edith, died without seeing anyone brought to justice for their youngest daughter’s murder. But last year the case was reopened when her siblings 69-year-old Anne Cleave, who was 18 at the time of the murder, and 58-year-old Colin, who was six, contacted the media calling for a fresh investigation. Elsie’s sister said the family would continue to push for justice. “It has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride. We were aware that there had been mistakes in the early days, but the police have worked really hard on our behalf to get this far in the past year,” she said. “You are never quite aware what you will feel like when these announcements are made. We have both felt queasy and a bit stressed when we found out about the arrest. The bigger step will come if he is charged.” While the family did not know how the case would develop, she added that the police had been “amazing” at keeping them informed. “When you have got something you are looking for, and that’s justice, then you have to keep pushing for it. We want justice for Elsie.” Speaking about the new arrest, Detective Superintendent Nick Wallen, senior investigating officer, said: “A re-investigation into Elsie’s murder was launched in 2015 by West Yorkshire police, backed by a publicity campaign on the 50th anniversary of her death. “Since then we have received significant numbers of calls and emails from members of the public offering new information, and have generated new lines of inquiry which officers have been progressing ever since. “Following those inquiries we have now arrested a 78-year-old man in the Berkshire area and will be interviewing him under caution to progress our investigation.” Colin Frost told the BBC: “As a family, we’re very pleased. All we wanted was to be taken seriously. “We were aware that mistakes were made in 1965, but we’ve been impressed with the commitment of West Yorkshire police in the reinvestigation – the number of officers involved, the number of agencies involved. “We wanted the investigation to be reopened and that’s what we’ve achieved.” On the day of her death, Elsie had gone to watch her friends learn to sail at a water-filled gravel pit known as Millfield lagoon near her home in the suburban area of Lupset, on the south side of Wakefield. According to one version of events, she chose a different route home to her friends along the towpath to avoid getting her new shoes muddy. As she entered a 30ft tunnel beneath a railway embankment she was struck from behind and stabbed. A post-mortem examination found she had been stabbed five times – twice in the back, twice in the head, once through the hand – with the fatal blow piercing her heart. Despite her terrible injuries, Elsie managed to stumble through the tunnel to the bottom of what locals called the “ABC steps”; a steep flight of 26 steps up to the main road. She was found dying at the bottom of the steps by a local man, Thomas Brown. Brown, who had taken his three-year-old daughter, Beverley, five-year-old son, Martin, and their dog Pip for a walk, saw Elsie face down and assumed she had fallen down the stairs. Within minutes, others appeared on the scene and waited with her body while Brown ran to call for an ambulance and the police. They included lock-keeper Ralph Brewster and John Blackburn, one of the sailing instructors from the lagoon. Back at Elsie’s home in Manor Haigh Road, her parents received a visit from the police, who informed them that their daughter had died. A clear motive was never established by police. The pathologist who examined the Snapethorpe high school pupil’s body gave the cause of death as “shock and haemorrhage due to multiple stab wounds”. The hunt for the killer made national news for weeks. West Yorkshire police combed the area for clues and divers searched the river and lagoons for the murder weapon. Scotland Yard detectives joined the investigation. Police officers went from door to door interviewing every man living in the area. About 12,000 men were questioned by police, including members of her own family. While the police investigation continued, an inquest was opened and adjourned by the Leeds and Wakefield coroner, Philip Gill. One arrest was made at the time of the murder, but a judge cleared Ian Bernard Spencer, who was 33 at the time, of any involvement."
2016-09-27T21:45:10Z,uk-news,UK news,HBOS banker allegedly received bribes to pay prostitutes at Marylebone flat,"A senior HBOS banker accused of corruption allegedly received regular bribes in the form of envelopes stuffed with thousands of pounds in cash to pay for prostitutes at a flat in Marylebone, central London, a court has been told. Lynden Scourfield, who dealt with many of HBOS’s most financially distressed borrower clients, is accused of playing a central role in a multimillion pound corruption plot along with a former venture capitalist David Mills, a jury at Southwark crown court has been told. Between 2003 and 2007, a string of businesses with little or no hope of survival were fed with fresh loans by Scourfield, allegedly so that the money could be channelled – in “consultancy fees” and other charges – to Quayside Corporate Services, a turnaround consultancy controlled by Mills. Mills, his wife and three other of his business associates – along with a second HBOS banker – are all on trial, charged with various offences relating to the alleged plot. All have denied wrongdoing. Scourfield, meanwhile, is not in the dock. Jurors have been told they “must not speculate about his absence or the reasons for it”. Prosecuting, Brian O’Neill QC told the court: “As the figure who held the key to continued funding, Scourfield could exercise enormous power over the directors of the companies under his supervision. Many felt they had no choice but to comply with his or Mills’ demands.” On the second day of his opening remarks, O’Neill painted a detailed picture of how some of the alleged conspirators had used prostitutes at the flat on Portman Square, in Marylebone, London. Rent for the flat, O’Neill told the jury, was paid for by one of the distressed companies linked to Scourfield and Mills, while another struggling business allegedly had paid for prostitutes. The court heard how a Quayside employee had visited the flat three times to deliver envelopes in 2005. On one occasion, having seen the envelope being filled, the Quayside worker estimated it contained £3,000 to £4,000. He was later told by a senior colleague that this was “funny money” for Scourfield to pay for women. On his first visit to the flat, the Quayside worker had let himself in, O’Neill told the jury. He found Scourfield emerging from the bedroom in just a towel. The court was told the banker allegedly said words to the effect: “Hi Terry, you got some stuff for me?” As he was speaking, a women in her twenties also allegedly emerged from the bedroom. Later, the prosecution said, a businessman who ran a struggling pornographic magazine company was asked by a Quayside consultant, Michael Bancroft – one of the defendants on trial – to arrange prostitutes for Scourfield. The businessman took this to be a demand rather than a request and believed that he was expected to pay. He therefore arranged for Bancroft’s number to be given to a fixer who was able to arrange women on two occasions. The fixer later told police how the “bank man” – alleged by the prosecution to be Scourfield – was particularly rude to the women. One of the prostitutes later described him to police as being “a bit edgy”. A diary entry from one of the prostitutes read: “Met guys, me, Amber and Suzie. Chinese meal. Then drinks at flat and quick shag. Easy £1,500.” O’Neill told the jury none of the defendants were intending to contest the evidence of the prostitutes. The jury heard alleged payments for sex were only part of the corrupt rewards said to have been taken by Scourfield. In addition, he stayed at Mayfair hotels, took trips to Las Vegas and Barbados, bought a £3,220 Cartier watch and enjoyed three nights on a six-star cruise from Nice to Saint Tropez. The trial continues."
2016-09-27T23:01:49Z,uk-news,UK news,"Historian EP Thompson denounced Communist party chiefs, files show","EP Thompson, one of the most influential historians of the 20th century, wrote an impassioned denunciation of the leadership of the British Communist party at the height of the cold war, but few outside MI5 knew anything about it after the agency intercepted the letter. The party’s leaders, Thompson said, were despotic and untrustworthy, and would sweep away long-cherished political freedoms if they ever achieved power. Thompson, himself a Communist party member at the time, wrote the letter in 1956, shortly after the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave a speech in which, for the first time, he criticised Joseph Stalin, who had died three years earlier. A copy of the letter lies within MI5’s files on Thompson, five of which have been declassified and transferred to the National Archives at Kew, in south-west London. It shows Thompson’s clear dismay that leading communists in Britain may have been aware of Stalin’s crimes, yet had been responsible for misleading rank-and-file members and for spending two decades spreading “uncritical and often hopelessly inaccurate (our opponents would say mendacious) propaganda”.
The party’s executive committee, he wrote, were guilty of “acting as high priests, interpreting and justifying the holy writ, as emanating from Stalin, rather than creative Marxists continually striving to form an independent analysis. “All I can say is, thank God there is no chance of this executive committee ever having power in Britain: it would destroy in a month every liberty of thought, conscience and expression, which it has taken the British people 300-odd years to win. And it would do it with all the benevolent safety-valves and in a smug and supremely self-righteous belief that it was acting in the interests of the working class, whose interests it was divinely inspired to interpret.”
After steaming open the letter and copying it, MI5 allowed it to continue to its intended recipient, a regional party official in Yorkshire. Copies were circulated within MI5, and one was sent to John Rennie, a future head of MI6 who was at that time running the information research department, the Foreign Office’s secret cold war propaganda unit. With it was a covering letter from a senior MI5 officer, who explained that “we had obtained sight, by secret and delicate means, of a long and reasoned denunciation of the leadership of the British Communist party by one of their best-known intellectuals”, and asking that it not be used without being paraphrased. Thompson subsequently launched a dissident communist publication, the New Reasoner, and left the party after the Soviets crushed the Hungarian uprising at the end of the year. The files on Thompson that have been transferred to Kew cover the years from 1943, when he came to the attention of MI5 while serving in the British army, to 1963, the year of the publication of his most influential work, The Making of the English Working Class. They contain copies of letters to and from Thompson and comments made about him by officials at the Communist party’s headquarters in London, where the agency had installed a number of microphones. It is unclear from the transferred files whether MI5 continued to keep Thompson under surveillance after 1963. MI5 kept close watch on a number of people who were known within the British Communist party as the Historians Group. The agency’s files on two other prominent historians, Eric Hobsbawm and Christopher Hill, were declassified two years ago. Files on a fourth member of the group, Rodney Hilton, have been transferred to Kew alongside those on Thompson. Hilton, one of the outstanding medieval historians of the 20th century, first came to the attention of MI5 in 1937, while he was a student at the University of Oxford. His files show that while he was serving in the army during the second world war his commanding officers were asked to report on his activities, and that after the war police helped MI5 keep Hilton under surveillance. His telephone calls were recorded, his post opened, and his second wife, Gwyn, kept under surveillance. In 1952, after discovering the interception of his mail, Hilton complained to his local postmaster. A note within the file says that the interception was discontinued, in order to “allay suspicions”. The following year, however, after he gave a number of radio broadcasts, MI5 wrote to the BBC to inform the corporation that “Hilton has been known to us as an active member of the Communist party since 1937”. Like Thompson, Hilton left the party in 1956."
2016-09-28T08:10:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Camber Sands council 'considering all options' on lifeguard provision,"The council responsible for Camber Sands, where five young men drowned last month, has confirmed it is considering bowing to pressure to employ permanent lifeguards at the beach. Nitharsan Ravi, Inthushan Sriskantharasa, Gurushanth Srithavarajah and brothers Kobi and Ken Nathan, all from London, died after being pulled from the sea during a day trip to the East Sussex resort on 24 August. Relatives of some of the men suggested they might have survived if lifeguards had been deployed. More than 8,000 people have signed a petition calling for lifeguards at Camber Sands during the busy summer months. RNLI lifeguards were posted there temporarily on the August bank holiday weekend, but Rother district council has yet to decide on longer-term provision. The council said all options were being considered. A spokesman said: “In light of recent tragic events and the changing profile of visitors to the beach, we are in the process of reviewing and considering all options for next year, including the provision of a lifeguard service.” The RNLI is negotiating with the council about providing such a service. A spokesman said: “We have been talking to Rother district council but no lifeguard service has been agreed for 2017.” Some local residents said money raised through car parking charges at Camber should fund lifeguards throughout the summer. Council bosses have said summer patrols advise people of potential dangers. They said some people visiting from outside the area were unfamiliar with the sea and the dangers it poses."
2016-09-28T08:35:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Corbyn's defence of immigration splits shadow cabinet,"Jeremy Corbyn has mounted a forceful defence of immigration from the EU and elsewhere before his party conference speech, causing a fresh split in his shadow cabinet. The Labour leader is expected to use his speech to promise a Labour government will not “sow division” by promising to cut immigration. His position suggests Labour will not respond to the Brexit vote by seeking curbs on free movement of people across the EU, but senior shadow cabinet ministers have said there must be controls and the current system is in chaos. Speaking on BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday morning, Corbyn said he understood “the problems that can come in some areas”, which is why he would create a “migrant impact fund” to ease pressure on public services. He added: “Migrants that have come to this country make an enormous contribution to it. Our conference understands that and Tom Watson put that case very well about the work that migrants have done in the NHS and education and other industries ... we should live with that but also understand the number of British people.” Pointing out that numbers vary from year to year, Corbyn said there were many industries such as farming that depended on migrant labour. Asked if people should stop worrying about immigration, he said: “We have to allay people’s concerns about the impact ... and recognise the huge contribution made to our economy and the numbers of people working in the NHS that are pretty crucial to the survival of the NHS.” Corbyn suggested the UK should continue to accept free movement from the EU, while maintaining access to the single market on the same basis as other member states. But some of his frontbench allies were already striking a different tone, including Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, and Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary. In a conference intervention, Burnham will say: “Labour must face up fully to this fact: millions of our lifelong supporters voted to leave the EU and voted for change on immigration.” Rayner told BBC there must be “controls” and described the current system as chaos. “We have to have controls on immigration, that’s quite clear,” she told BBC News. “You have to know who is coming in to your country and who is leaving your country. “We have to got to make sure that our economic situation is good for everybody because immigration is a good thing for us, but what undermines [that] is when people feel that it is unvetted and that we are not able to deal with the issues and the concerns that people have around that.” Corbyn repeatedly said during the referendum campaign that he did not believe Britain should seek to cut immigration. The Labour leader will tell conference on Wednesday: “A Labour government will not offer false promises. We will not sow division or fan the flames of fear. We will instead tackle the real issues of immigration – and make the changes that are needed.” His spokesman told journalists: “He is not concerned about numbers,” adding that rather than seeking controls on immigration, Labour would seek to mitigate its effects on low-paid workers with the reintroduction of a “migrant impact fund”. Gordon Brown introduced a £50m fund to ease the pressure of migration on public services in 2008 but David Cameron’s coalition government scrapped it in the summer of 2010. Corbyn’s spokesman said: “As long as the consequences of immigration are tackled, it is not an objective to reduce the numbers, to reduce immigration.” The prime minister, Theresa May, has made clear she will seek controls on freedom of movement when Brexit negotiations commence, and some Labour MPs believe that message will resonate with working-class voters who feel their wages are under pressure. The Leeds West MP, Rachel Reeves, told a fringe meeting on Tuesday that her constituency was like a “tinder box” and voters’ concerns about immigration and lack of control over their lives could “explode” on to the streets if they remained unaddressed. Reeves is among several prominent backbenchers, including Chuka Umunna, Stephen Kinnock and Emma Reynolds, who have responded to the vote to leave the EU with calls to reopen the debate on freedom of movement. Yvette Cooper, the former shadow home secretary, also called for changes to free movement before the last election."
2016-09-28T10:08:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Why Jeremy Corbyn is right not to promise deep cuts in immigration,"Jeremy Corbyn is right not to promise deep cuts in UK immigration, because the only surefire way to deliver them is not by restricting freedom of movement but by crashing the economy. He is also right to say it was concerns about the impact of migration, rather than the numbers themselves, that drove the leave victory in the EU referendum. Indeed, that lack of public confidence has been partly fuelled by politicians promising to deliver deep cuts in net migration but spectacularly failing to deliver. As a Guardian analysis in the immediate aftermath of June’s vote showed, those who have experienced the highest levels of migration are the least anxious about it. The highest levels of remain voters were in areas of the highest net migration, while some of the strongest leave areas have had the fewest recent new immigrants.
It was no surprise that London, which took 133,000 of the record 333,000 net arrivals in 2015, voted to remain in the EU. But Manchester also voted for remain, and at 13,554 had nearly double the level of net migration seen in Birmingham, which voted leave. The pattern is starkest at the local authority level. Lambeth in London, which recorded the highest remain vote, of 78%, saw a net influx of 4,598, while Castle Point in Essex, which includes Canvey Island, voted 72% for leave, after a net inflow of 81 international migrants in 2015. In Conservative Wandsworth in London, net migration was 6,295 and 75% of voters backed remain, while in Labour Hartlepool there was a net inflow of 113 and 69% of people voted to leave. It is true that areas such as Boston in Lincolnshire and Fenland in Cambridgeshire, which have had high levels of net migration, also feature in the top 10 leave areas. But these are isolated areas that have seen the most rapid population change, in places with little history of overseas migration. They are also the most in need of the kind of flexible rapid response migration impact funding that Labour pioneered in 2008 to help relieve pressure on housing, GP surgeries, policing and schools – funding that was scrapped by the Tories as ineffective. The problem with Labour’s migration impact fund was that Gordon Brown refused to allow any Treasury contributions. Instead a £50-a-head levy was imposed on non-EU migrant visas, and it never raised more than £50m, which did little to ease the pressure points. A new migration impact fund – the Tories have promised a smaller-scale version – needs to be a much more serious effort. But what about that Brexit vote? Won’t leaving the European Union mean deep cuts in immigration can now be delivered? Surely ending free movement to close the door on unskilled labour from the rest of Europe would bring down net migration to the tens of thousands from its near record level of 327,000 in the year to March. Theresa May has tried to pull every lever over the past six years to deliver that promised deep cut in the net migration numbers. Despite her abject failure as home secretary to reduce net migration to less than 100,000, she has made it to No 10. What could she do in a post-Brexit world to make good on that broken pledge? She could, as many of her former cabinet colleagues such as George Osborne have suggested, take overseas students – 163,000 came last year – out of the net migration figures on the grounds that they come to study rather than settle in the UK. But she has repeatedly ruled that out, claiming too many stay on after their studies and dismissing the option as “fiddling the figures”. Restricting the free movement of labour from within the EU is a possibility. Around 179,000 EU citizens arrived in Britain to work last year, of whom 101,000 had a definite job to go to. The other 78,000 came looking for work. Any new work permit system is likely to give a visa to those with a definite job offer, even on a temporary basis for less skilled occupations. The jobseekers could face restrictions, but even if they were all banned it would not deliver the deep cuts sought. It would also probably provoke retaliation, denying the right to work to some of the 1.2 million Britons currently working and living in Europe. A New Economics Foundation analysis on Tuesday goes further and suggests that restrictions on free movement, far from ending undercutting, could actually reduce wages further, because experience shows that if migrants cannot come legally they will try to come illegally. The truth is that Britain’s economy remains relatively buoyant and will continue to attract EU migrants, legally or illegally, while it remains the jobs factory of Europe. In fact, migrant labour is helping to fuel that economic growth. The only sure way to deliver deep cuts in immigration is to crash the economy. Corbyn is wise not to promise that. It would turn Project Fear into Project Fact."
2016-09-28T10:54:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Woman wins right to review of Northern Ireland sex work law,"A sex worker has won the right to have a judicial review over a law that makes it illegal to pay for sexual services in Northern Ireland. Laura Lee, from Dublin, was granted leave for a legal challenge to the Human Trafficking Act at the high court in Belfast on Wednesday. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where people can be convicted for paying for sex. The law, which was championed by the Democratic Unionist party peer and Stormont assembly member Lord Morrow, came into effect in June 2015. A full hearing date for the judicial review will be set in 11 weeks’ time, the high court was told. After the judgment by Mr Justice Maguire, Lee tweeted thanks to her “super lawyers”, adding: “Thank you too to all supporters especially fellow sex workers.”
Lee, a law graduate, had stated previously that she was prepared to go to the European court of human rights to challenge the law, which she and fellow sex workers claims discriminates against their rights to privacy, to earn a living and physical protection. In an interview last year with the Guardian just before the law was passed by the Northern Ireland assembly, Lee said: “I am doing this because I believe that when two consenting adults have sex behind closed doors and if money changes hands then that is none of the state’s business. The law they have introduced has nothing to do with people being trafficked but simply on their, the DUP’s, moral abhorrence of paid sex.” The law in question has not led to any prosecutions in Northern Irish courts to date of people seeking to purchase sex from sex workers operating in the region, according to the Public Prosecution Service in Belfast. Lee, who lives in Edinburgh but also travels to Belfast and Dublin to work, is promising to launch a legal challenge against a potentially similar law that an alliance of feminist groups and members of Catholic nuns’ orders are trying to bring in in the Irish Republic."
2016-09-28T11:54:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Barrister disbarred for dodging train fares,"An Oxfordshire-based barrister has been disbarred after dodging thousands of pounds in railway fares, following a hearing at the Bar Standards Board. Peter Barnett, 45, avoided paying the correct fare for two years from 2012 by claiming he commuted into central London from Wembley in north-west London instead of his home in Thame, Oxfordshire. He was confronted by a suspicious ticket inspector at Marylebone station in November 2014. He ran away from the inspector but handed himself in the following day. He was convicted of six charges of fraud by false representation at the City of London magistrates court last September. During his trial the prosecution alleged he avoided nearly £20,000 in fares but a judge later accepted Barnett’s claim that he evaded only £5,892.70 based on the price of a weekly ticket. Australian-born Barnett has now been disbarred following a hearing at the Bar Standards Board. He was called to the bar at Lincoln’s Inn in London in 2007, but has never held a practising certificate as a barrister in England and Wales. A BSB spokesperson said: “Dishonest conduct is incompatible with membership of the bar. The tribunal’s decision to disbar Dr Barnett reflects this.” Barnett avoided prison when a 16-week jail term was suspended, but he was banned from his profession for 12 months and ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. The Oxford graduate and Rhodes scholar, who had a previous caution for an identical offence, was ordered to pay back £5,892.70 to Chiltern Railways. He was also ordered to pay £85 prosecution costs and an £80 victim surcharge. At the time of the trial Judge Ola Omotosho told him: “It is a shame really, because you had it all and it remains unclear why you acted so badly. “You’ve let yourself down and you’ve also let your family down – especially in your chosen profession as a lawyer.” Defending him at the time, Angus Bunyan said Barnett had been forced to quit his job as a result of the proceedings and was unemployable as a lawyer. “And the real tragedy is that a man with real intellectual gifts as a lawyer and then in the financial service industry, he’s aware this cuts both ways. “As for as his legal career, it’s over. What he hopes to do is complete his sentence and go into charity work – that’s occupied so much of his time in the last 20 years.” Barnett founded an African children’s charity. He was a director of the thinktank the Legatum Institute Foundation, aimed at “promoting prosperity”, but his directorship was terminated in March last year."
2016-09-28T11:58:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Police investigating Christopher Halliwell have lost key document,"The police force investigating whether double murderer Christopher Halliwell is a serial killer has lost an important official diary detailing the early days of the investigation into him, the Guardian can reveal. The senior officer’s “policy book” gives an overview of the initial inquiry into Halliwell, who will spend the rest of his life behind bars for the murders of Swindon women Sian O’Callaghan and Becky Godden. The policy book was kept by the then assistant chief constable of Wiltshire police, Pat Geenty, who oversaw the original inquiry into O’Callaghan’s disappearance in March 2011. Geenty, who later became chief constable, was in charge of key strategic decisions as detectives hunted O’Callaghan and her abductor. Wiltshire police have been accused by the former senior detective who caught Halliwell, Steve Fulcher, of failing to seriously investigate if he is a serial killer in the five years since he was caught. The revelation that the policy book is missing adds to the impression that the inquiry into Halliwell has not been as organised or professional as it should have been. After Halliwell was finally convicted of the murder of Godden last week, Wiltshire police said they would now focus on whether he might be responsible for other murders. Fulcher has argued that the police should have already examined possible links with other killings, including those of NHS worker Melanie Hall, who vanished from Bath in 1996 and chef Claudia Lawrence, who disappeared in 2009. He has called for an inquiry to look at why the force has not done more to establish if Halliwell murdered others. O’Callaghan’s disappearance after leaving a nightclub sparked a “category A” investigation in 2011. As often happens in such cases, a “gold group” was created, chaired by Geenty. While the investigation was led by Fulcher, it was overseen by the gold group. The Guardian has now learned that one of Geenty’s policy books – in effect a diary – is missing. Fulcher, who has left the force, said he had been told it had been stolen. Wiltshire police confirmed it could not be found but said there was no evidence of theft. It insisted that everything in it would have also been recorded elsewhere so no vital information would have been lost. Fulcher, who left the force after being disciplined over the way he handled Halliwell, said the fact the policy book was missing came out during his hearing. He said: “When I asked for the gold policy file to be produced at my disciplinary hearing I was told: ‘It’s gone missing, believed stolen from the chief constable’s office.’ It is ridiculous.” Despite catching him, Fulcher found himself in trouble over how he questioned Halliwell. After the taxi driver became his prime subject for the suspected abduction of O’Callaghan, Fulcher had him taken to a remote hill fort, Barbury Castle. Fulcher believed O’Callaghan was still alive and wanted to give Halliwell one last chance to come clean. Halliwell took Fulcher to O’Callaghan’s body – she was already dead – and from there led him to a field where he had buried Godden’s body eight years before. A judge initially ruled that this “confession” evidence was not admissible in court because Halliwell had been denied basic rights such as access to a lawyer. There was other evidence linking Halliwell to O’Callaghan and he pleaded guilty to her murder in 2012. But he denied having anything to do with Godden’s death and was only convicted last week following a trial at Bristol crown court. Fulcher was keen to see the policy book during the disciplinary process to find out how his actions were judged at the time by his bosses. During legal argument in court in 2012 about the confession Geenty said Fulcher’s tactics were “gutsy” and “brave”. He added: “I would like to think I would make a similar decision in his circumstances.” Geenty has now retired. Wiltshire police insisted the loss of the book would not affect efforts to find out if Halliwell was a serial killer. The force told the Guardian: “During the course of a major investigation such as the investigation into the disappearance of Sian O’Callaghan a number of senior officers will maintain policy books. “Ex-chief constable Pat Geenty, who was the gold commander and the ACC of the force, has been spoken to today and he has confirmed he had two gold policy books, one of which remains missing. “Every effort was made to locate the missing policy book during the investigation and the misconduct process. To date this book has not been located. There is no evidence that the book was stolen. It should also be noted that the governance of the investigation was also recorded through gold groups.”"
2016-09-28T12:47:45Z,uk-news,UK news,"Rising number of guns being smuggled into UK, Metropolitan police say","More guns are being seized in cities across Britain as the number of firearms being smuggled into the country increases, Britain’s most senior police officer has said. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan police commissioner, told a hearing at London’s City Hall that a rise in gun crime in the capital was being put down to an increase in the number of weapons coming into the country. The Met seized a “worrying” record number of weapons in 2015, including semiautomatic guns, Hogan-Howe said. “We’ve seized more firearms than ever before,” he said. “In the previous year [2015] we’ve seized 714 guns – that’s around two per day. In a city this size, that’s a worrying number. This is an increase on previous years. Some of them are semiautomatic weapons, too. “If you look around the big cities of the country, they are seeing a similar profile. Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool – they are seeing big rises as well.”
The main supply route into the UK is across the continent from eastern European countries such as Albania and Lithuania, and significant seizures have recently been made of guns coming in from France. Hogan-Howe said: “We are targeting with the National Crime Agency the supply routes. It’s either from abroad, it’s stealing legally owned weapons in this country, sometimes you’ve got to look at military supplies and also you’ve got to look at licensed dealers.” Officers also monitor potential supply routes from the US, as well as the parcel post. Figures show there were 302 discharges of lethal barrelled weapons in London in the year to the end of August 2016 – 91 more than in the previous year. There was also a leap of one-third in August 2016 compared with June. There were 46 discharges in both July and August.
In May, Hogan-Howe warned that the rise in the number of available guns meant terrorists had a greater chance of getting their hands on lethal weapons. Scotland Yard has launched a crackdown on gun crime hotspots, called Operation Viper, following a “significant” increase in the number of shootings in the capital. In August the force introduced routine armed patrols in London in response to terrorist atrocities in mainland Europe."
2016-09-28T12:57:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Paralympic and Olympic athletes given star treatment in Yorkshire,"Yorkshire’s Olympic and Paralympic stars will receive a heroes’ welcome at a special homecoming parade in Leeds at teatime on Wednesday, but the county could have trumped Pennine rivals Manchester to host the national event. The county was asked to host the main celebration but council leaders said they did not have enough time to pull it together. The responsibility for hosting the event was instead given to Manchester.
Both like to boast about their medal contributions to Britain’s record-breaking Olympic and Paralympic totals. Locals will welcome Leeds triathletes Alistair and Jonny Brownlee, who claimed gold and silver medals respectively in Rio. The brothers will be joined by gold medallists Ed Clancy, Hannah Cockroft, Kadeena Cox, Tom Ransley, Jack Laugher and Adam Duggleby at the parade, which is being organised in partnership with Welcome to Yorkshire. Yorkshire Olympians brought home 14 medals out of an overall medal total of 67 for Team GB. Paralympic athletes from the county also hit the heights, contributing 12 to a total medal haul of 147. Leaders promised a carnival atmosphere in Leeds, with dancers from the West Indian Carnival, the Band of the King’s Division, West Yorkshire Police Band and the Handmade Samba Band. Thousands of people were expected to line the route, which goes through the city centre starting at the Headrow outside Leeds Art Gallery, then on to Park Row, down to City Square, Boar Lane, Briggate, before turning back on to the Headrow and returning outside Leeds Art Gallery. Alistair Brownlee, who also won gold in London four years ago, said: “To be greeted on your home turf by fans will be a real high after Rio. We can’t wait to bring home our medals to Yorkshire and to thank everyone for their overwhelming support.” The council leader, Judith Blake, said the event would give the county’s sportsmen and women the “recognition and appreciation they so fully deserve”. She added: “Yorkshire is immensely proud of all its Olympic and Paralympic athletes and it is fantastic news that we will have the opportunity to congratulate them on their outstanding achievements as part of a special homecoming parade.”
Theresa May announced that Manchester would host the main homecoming parade for Britain’s Olympic and Paralympic athletes. Another event will be held in London. Both parades take place next month. Blake has said Leeds was approached about hosting the national event but there had not been enough time to plan. She told the BBC: “If they had approached us seriously to talk about having a homecoming for the country in Leeds, we would have stepped up to the plate. Good luck to Manchester, that’s fine, but we can put on our own show here for our athletes and coaches and give all of their families and colleagues and friends a chance to come and show how proud they are.” Leeds city council’s chief executive, Tom Riordan, said: “We’ve no problem with Manchester but we’ll be doing a great, fitting homecoming in Leeds that our heroes deserve.” A day of celebrations is also being held in Edinburgh to mark the success of Scottish sports stars. Sportscotland is hosting a homecoming ceremony in the new national performance centre, Oriam, at Heriot-Watt University. It will be followed by a public event in Festival Square and then the inaugural Team Scotland Scottish sports awards on Wednesday evening. About 50 Scottish Olympic and Paralympic athletes are expected to attend. Rio 2016 was Scotland’s most successful overseas Olympics, with Scottish competitors securing 13 medals – four gold, seven silver and two bronze. Cyclists Callum Skinner and Katie Archibald won gold along with rower Heather Stanning and tennis star Andy Murray. Rower Katherine Grainger’s silver medal made her Britain’s most decorated female Olympian. Gordon Reid won gold in the wheelchair tennis men’s singles. There were 33 Scottish athletes on the Paralympics GB team. Between them they won 17 medals – the team’s best performance since 2004. Libby Clegg secured half of the gold haul with her two medals on the track, Jo Butterfield won gold in the F51 club throw, and Karen Darke took gold in the cycling H1-3 time trial."
2016-09-28T13:21:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Man arrested after two Matalan employees fatally stabbed in Cardiff,"Two shopworkers have been stabbed to death outside their high-street store as they left together after a nightshift. Zoe Morgan, 21, and Lee Simmons, 34, who had recently begun a relationship, were found dead on Queen Street in Cardiff shortly before 6am on Wednesday.
South Wales police said a 20-year-old man was in custody in connection with their deaths, and officers were not looking for anyone else. It is believed he was known to the couple. The force said: “He was arrested with the assistance of Gwent police officers at an address in Castleton within an hour of the incident being reported.” Both victims worked at the Cardiff branch of the fashion and homeware retailer Matalan. A colleague said they had been in a relationship for around four months. “This is a terrible tragedy,” said the colleague. “They had only started seeing each other and made a lovely couple. We are all in bits.” Morgan, who lived with her parents in Cardiff, had studied fashion at the University of South Wales before joining Matalan in the summer. A neighbour said: “She was so excited about starting work and everything was going so well for her. Zoe went off to work as normal but never came home. She was a beautiful girl and this is terrible.” Simmons, also of Cardiff, had worked at the store since it opened in October 2014. He had nicknamed Morgan “my Tinkerbell”.
Matalan’s chief executive, Jason Hargreaves, said: “It is with great sadness that we can confirm that there was a fatal stabbing in Queen Street, Cardiff, this morning. Police discovered the bodies of a man and a woman outside the premises at 6am and arrested one man who is currently in police custody. “Both of the victims worked at our Cardiff branch, so understandably all of our colleagues are receiving our full support. We request that they are given the space to deal with this at this difficult time. “That is all we know at this stage and we are working tirelessly with the police in their investigations. We extend our condolences to the families of everyone involved.” The suspect, who has not been named by police, was arrested at a farmhouse. One neighbour said: “The first I knew there were seven police cars in our lane, and then a riot van with a cage on the front turned up. Later I heard a policeman say he’s gone. They took him away and the house was searched and I saw his car being removed.” A police spokesman said: “Both families have been informed. They are being provided with support by South Wales police at this time. Postmortem examinations will be carried out to determine the causes of the deaths. At this stage it is believed that they sustained stab wounds.” A large part of the pedestrianised area of Queen Street was cordoned off. Dozens of businesses had to close and hundreds of office workers were sent home.
People at the scene reported seeing blood on the ground. One man said: “One of the victims was found outside Boots; the other was just over the other side of the road outside Matalan. The police then arrived and sealed off the whole street, and forensics officers set up a tent over the area.” Ch Supt Belinda Davies said: “This incident occurred in the main shopping area in the heart of the city in rush hour and it has no doubt shocked the community of Cardiff. Please be reassured that we have a team of officers investigating what happened, and importantly we have a suspect in custody and we are not looking for anybody else. “We are in the very early stages of the investigation but I would like to add that at this stage we believe the suspect was known to the victims, and it was not a random assault. I would like to dispel speculation circulating as to the motive behind this tragic incident and make it clear that this is not being linked to terrorism, and any links to the homeless community are unfounded.” The flagship Matalan store was opened by Welsh fashion designer Julien Macdonald in 2014. It employs 366 people and is split across four floors, selling budget clothes and homeware. Anybody with information about the incident was urged to contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
2016-09-28T13:37:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Apple moves UK HQ to Battersea power station boiler room in London,"Apple is to move its UK headquarters to Battersea power station in a major boost for the £8bn regeneration of the Grade II-listed building – and a fillip for London following June’s Brexit vote. The technology company has agreed to take 500,000 sq ft of office space across six floors in the power station’s central boiler house. It will move 1,400 Apple employees into the building in 2021 from its eight other London offices. The power station, which was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, has been empty since 1983 when it stopped generating electricity and was decommissioned. Various attempts to redevelop it, including turning it into a theme park, have failed.
It was rescued in 2012 by a Malaysian consortium, which is pressing ahead with a 42-acre development of offices, shops, restaurants and luxury homes. As part of the project, the power station, which is the largest brick building in Europe, will be renovated and offices, apartments and an event space built inside. Apple’s commitment is a major vote of confidence in the project and accounts for 40% of the office space in the power station. The sale of apartments at the site initially went well, but demand for upmarket homes in the area has cooled with a glut of development projects in the surrounding Nine Elms area. The Apple deal is the largest office letting in the West End of London and the surrounding area for 20 years. Apple will keep its main European headquarters in Cork, where it employs 4,000 people, but the Battersea site will be one of its biggest offices outside the US. The deal follows Google and Facebook signing up for similarly large developments in London. Google is building a campus in King’s Cross while Facebook will occupy offices off Oxford Street. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said the deal is “another vote of confidence in the UK economy”. “Apple’s decision further strengthens London’s position as a global technology hub and demonstrates how the UK is at the forefront of the next steps in the tech revolution,” he said. By the time Apple moves into Battersea power station in 2021, a new London Underground station is scheduled to be open at the site, which will connect it to the Northern line. Apple said the deal would allow the company to have its UK team work from one location. It said in a statement: “We are looking forward to opening Apple’s new London campus at the Battersea power station in 2021. “1400 Apple employees from existing offices around London will relocate to this magnificent new development at one of London’s best-known landmarks. It’s a great opportunity to have our entire team working and collaborating in one location while supporting the renovation of a neighbourhood rich with history.” Rob Tincknell, the chief executive of the Battersea Power Station Development Company, said: “We are delighted that Apple has chosen to make Battersea power station its home in 2021. It is testament to our fantastic building and the wider regeneration of the 42-acre site. “It has always been our clear objective to create one of London’s most thriving new communities and this commitment from Apple will undoubtedly help us achieve our goal.”"

2016-09-28T14:07:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Army of rats drives Belfast family from their home,"A plague of rats has driven a family from their home in Belfast. Michael McCann said he caught 19 rats in 24 hours at his house in Rutland Street, off Ormeau Road in the south of the city. McCann, his wife, Paula, and their two young children are staying with family and friends while the Northern Ireland Housing Executive – the body in charge of public housing in the region – tries to find them a new home. The McCanns’ cat, Lady, will stay in a cattery while the family wait to be rehoused, which may not happen until after Christmas. Paula McCann told the website Belfast Live that an environmental health official from Belfast city council visited the property and immediately condemned it as unfit to live in.
“These rats are too much to cope with. They’re disgusting and a danger to the health of my entire family and we just cannot stay there,” she said. “It’s not fit for humans to live in because the rats have moved in. Now they’re happy having a party and wrecking the place and we’ve had to move out with anything we could carry.” She said rats chewed their way through electrical cables while the family were on holiday.
“They’d eaten through the electrical cable on the washing machine, the microwave, the kettle and even the toastie maker,” she said. “They’d used pots and baking trays in my kitchen as a toilet and left a filthy and dangerous mess everywhere. Everything has been contaminated, everything.” Michael McCann told Belfast Live: “I caught eight rats in the first 12 hours of having the traps down, then another four, and over 24 hours I caught a total of 19. They were big, grey rats. The look of them was disgusting and to think they were in our home near our children was awful.” The Northern Ireland Housing Executive said it was discussing housing options with the McCann family, including a possible permanent move away from the property."
2016-09-28T14:51:38Z,uk-news,UK news,EDF and UK government set to sign deal on Hinkley Point C,"The contract giving Hinkley Point C the formal go-ahead is to be signed this week, with the UK government and its commercial partner, EDF, putting pen to paper on the £18bn nuclear power project. EDF will sign a “contract for difference” on Thursday, an agreement governing the amount of money that the French state-owned energy company will receive for electricity produced by Britain’s first new nuclear power station in a generation. The signing will mean that the controversial project, the approval of which was delayed by Theresa May after she became prime minister in July, is all but certain to go ahead.
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy refused to confirm that a signing ceremony would take place on Thursday. But well-placed sources said arrangements were being put in place for an official announcement. Representatives from the government, EDF and China General Nuclear Power (CGN) – the French firm’s 33.5% partner in the mammoth construction project – are expected to attend. The Green party’s co-leader Caroline Lucas has written to business secretary Greg Clark, objecting to the sign-off on the basis that the National Audit Office has said public subsidies for electricity from Hinkley could rise from £6.1bn to £29.7bn. In the letter, Lucas says the change is a “significant deviation” on the cost of the project and that there is a “strong case” for a revised estimate to be put before parliament. The plant, which will meet 7% of the UK’s energy needs, is to be built near the existing Hinkley Point B station in Somerset and will run for 60 years. The project is set to cost £18bn and is scheduled for completion in 2023. EDF will earn a guaranteed price for its energy of £92.50 per megawatt hour, a sum that some opponents of the project say is high compared with other nuclear projects around the world. Security concerns have been raised about the role that CGN, a Chinese state-backed company, will play in the project and future nuclear reactors. Those fears were thought to have been behind a surprise decision by May to delay approval on the project.
Hinkley Point C has faced fierce opposition from EDF union leaders, while the company’s finance director resigned amid fears that the project would cripple it financially. Projects in France and Finland using the same technology – the European pressurised reactor – have also faced cost overruns and lengthy delays. It emerged on Wednesday that Areva, the EDF-owned firm due to build the reactor, was facing court action over the EPR it is building in Finland, which is a decade behind schedule. Finnish utility Teollisuuden Voima said it was seeking legal assurances that the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear reactor would be completed on schedule in 2018. The executive director of Greenpeace UK, John Sauven, said: “On the eve of the official signing of the Hinkley agreement, this is a cautionary tale that should make our government think twice before putting pen to paper. The UK government is about to sign away billions of pounds of billpayers’ money to a project bedevilled by legal, financial and technical hurdles. “Theresa May cannot build a 21st-century industrial strategy around an outdated, dodgy, and ludicrously expensive technology.”"
2016-09-28T14:59:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Care home company fined Â£1.6m for letting woman freeze to death,"A care home that allowed a 91-year-old woman to die of severe hypothermia has been fined £1.6m. Annie Barritt, a resident at Oaklands Country rest home near York, froze to death, with her temperature so cold it would not have registered on a standard thermometer, a court was told. She was found to be 25.3C (77.5F), nearly 10 degrees below the hypothermia threshold of 35C. York crown court heard the resident had not been given any hot food or drink as she spent her last day asleep in her room. The hospital discharge papers for Barritt, who had dementia, stated that she needed to be kept warm at her care home facility. She died of hypothermia despite two nurses checking on her about 10 times on the day of her death. The care home was fined on Wednesday for allowing what the judge described as an “accident waiting to happen”. Following the decision, Barritt’s family said in a statement: “The last four years have been very hard for the family, coming to terms with the tragic circumstances of Mum’s death from hypothermia. “It is hard to believe an elderly lady with dementia could be treated in such an appalling way in a care home that claimed to specialise in care for vulnerable people. “A fine, no matter how large, could never replace a loved one: what price can you put on your mother’s life?” Speaking at the court on Wednesday, Judge Paul Batty QC said there were “systematic, systemic failures” at the care home.
He said that when Barritt was brought into hospital “her body temperature was at a level barely compatible with human life”. The court heard that, about a week before her death, Barritt had been in hospital following a fall, and her discharge papers stated that she needed to be kept warm as her temperature was low. Batty said: “There was in my judgment no amendment to Mrs Barritt’s care plan. Those trusted with her care should have been aware of this cautionary note from the hospital. They were not. “The failure to revise Mrs Barritt’s care plan was indicative to other residents. This was not an isolated occurrence.” Maria Mallaband Care Ltd of Leeds pleaded guilty to a health-and-safety charge relating to Barritt’s death at a hearing in June. At the time, the company ran 30 homes for the elderly across the country, including Oaklands, and cared for 2,600 residents. Batty said: “It can be seen that this case does not involve an isolated and tragic act. The death of this much loved lady, I regret to say in the context of this case, was an accident waiting to happen. “It my judgment it is very serious and there were systematic, systemic failures in that care home.” Barritt was admitted to the home in July 2012 by her “loving and attentive family” because they thought it was the safest place for her. She had suffered from dementia for five years and was unable to make decisions for herself. She died at the home on 4 November 2012. The court heard previously that investigations into her death revealed the radiators in her room and other rooms nearby were never maintained. Staff and relatives of residents had also warned management repeatedly for two years that the oil-fired heating in the home did not work properly – but nothing had been done to rectify the situation. The home had also run out of fuel on several occasions during the two winters before her death, the court heard previously. Speaking at court on Tuesday, David Hercock, prosecuting on behalf of Harrogate district council, said: “By the time a night-shift nurse realised [Barritt] was in trouble at 7.50pm, [Barritt] felt ice cold, she wasn’t breathing and her temperature was so low it couldn’t register on a standard thermometer. She was taken by ambulance to Harrogate district hospital, but died there later the same day.” Maria Mallaband Care has an annual turnover of £50m and has won national awards. However, Oaklands showed losses of £1.75m in 2015, and £4.2m in 2016. Tony Moule, the environmental health officer at Harrogate borough council, said: “Our investigation revealed that there were a number of serious failures with regard to health-and-safety legislation. “No fine can ever compensate the family for the loss of their mother in such shocking circumstances. For an elderly vulnerable person to suffer hypothermia while in bed in her room, under the care of a national care provider, beggars belief. “Care homes must take their responsibilities seriously and Maria Mallaband Care Group Ltd failed in its duty of care. We hope that this case sends out a message which will help to ensure that such events don’t happen in the future.”"
2016-09-28T15:41:59Z,uk-news,UK news,"'Fake Sheikh' conspired to alter witness statement about Tulisa Contostavlos, court told","The undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood conspired to change a witness statement that showed the pop star Tulisa Contostavlos disapproved of hard drugs because he feared it would expose him as a “trickster who tried to lure people into criminal activity”, a jury was told. Evidence that the former N-Dubz singer and X Factor judge disapproved of drugs was “airbrushed out” to protect his “king of the sting” reputation and to ensure Contostavlos’s prosecution – for allegedly arranging for the journalist to be sold £800-worth of cocaine – was not in jeopardy, the Old Bailey heard. Mahmood, 53, and his driver, Alan Smith, 67, are accused of tampering with evidence in the drug trial of Contostavlos, which collapsed in July 2014 after it emerged Smith had allegedly changed his police statement to remove comments that the singer allegedly made expressing her disapproval of hard drugs.
Neither Mahmood nor Smith elected to give evidence in their defence. “The conspiracy to pervert the course of justice is now a conspiracy of silence,” the prosecutor, Sarah Forshaw QC, said in her closing submission. “You may think if they were innocent men with nothing to hide, wouldn’t they be shouting it from the rooftops in front of you,” she told the jury. The court heard that Mahmood, known as the “Fake Sheikh”, posed as a bogus Bollywood film producer and flew Contostavlos first class to Las Vegas to discuss the possibility of a lead role in an “Oscar-winning film” alongside Leonardo DiCaprio and red carpet treatment at Cannes. He then plied her and two associates with cocktails and a drink called Platinum at a further meeting at London’s Metropolitan hotel during which Contostavlos allegedly arranged for Mahmood to be sold half an ounce of cocaine by one of her contacts, the jury heard. As they were being driven home to Hertfordshire by Smith in the early hours, Contostavlos allegedly said she disapproved of hard drugs because a family member had a drug problem, the court was told. Smith, who worked as Mahmood’s driver for 20 years, later put this in a police statement. He changed the statement 24 hours later after a “flurry” of emails and texts to Mahmood, and the comments about her disapproval of drugs were removed, the prosecution alleges. Forshaw said the statement was changed as Mahmood was about to appear at a pre-trial hearing that would shine a spotlight on his methods and he had lied to the pre-trial judge when he said he had not discussed the statement with Smith, she said.
Mahmood “liked to be thought of and lauded as the master of subterfuge”, the court heard. The Contostavlos investigation was one of the first he conducted after the joining the Sun following the closure of the News of the World. He would have “wanted to make his mark, bring in a big story, one that would sell newspapers and show off to his new employers”, said Forshaw. Mahmood knew that at the pre-trial hearing he would have to show “he had not lured her unfairly into doing something she would not otherwise do. She was not to be entrapped,” she claimed. Forshaw added: “He knew his methods would be on trial.” He could not be seen to be “inciting” Contostavlos to commit a criminal offence as, if entrapment could be shown, there was a risk her trial could be stayed, or evidence excluded, she said. Mahmood wanted to be the “swashbucking hero” and would have known “he had to deal with a number of issues if the prosecution was not to fail on the grounds of unfairness”, Forshaw said, adding: “He would be exposed as a trickster who tried to lure people into criminal activity. There was a good deal at stake.” When Smith then “let slip” to Contostavlos’s lawyers that he had emailed his statement to Mahmood, it “threw an unfortunate spanner in the works”, said Forshaw. The content of texts and emails between Mahmood and Smith had been deleted, the jury heard. One of Smith’s mobile phones, containing “potentially incriminating” evidence, was crushed when a car fell off a jack on to it, smashing the handset, said Forshaw. The jury would have to decide what they thought of its “untimely demise”. “You have to get up really, really early in this case to work out what is going on,” Forshaw told the jury. “This is not a case where there are fingerprints and a knife and a trail of blood leading to the defendant. This is a case where you have to look carefully and with common sense at all the strands of evidence if you are really going to find out what is going on. “When you put them all together, they lead you to the compelling inference that these two men put their heads together to change that statement , a compelling inference that demands an explanation and you have had none.” Mahmood and Smith both deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The case continues on Thursday when the defence will make closing speeches."
2016-09-28T15:54:46Z,uk-news,UK news,"Gordon Anglesea trial: police officer was driven to children's home, court told","A police commissioner has told a jury that he used to drive a senior officer accused of sexually abusing boys to a children’s home. Arfon Jones, the police and crime commissioner for north Wales, said he drove Gordon Anglesea to the Bryn Estyn children’s home in Wrexham. Anglesea, 78, a former police officer with North Wales police, denies four charges of sexual assault against two boys between 1982 and 1987, when they were 14 or 15. One of the alleged victims has claimed he was assaulted by Anglesea in the showers and changing room at an attendance centre for young offenders in Wrexham. The second alleges that he was handed around “like a handbag” by a convicted paedophile called John Allen, who owned a children’s home in Wrexham. Called by the prosecution, Jones told the jury at Mold crown court that he used to be a police officer until his retirement in 2008. He said he came across Anglesea professionally in 1982 when he himself was a constable and the defendant was an inspector. Jones said he used to give Anglesea lifts in a police vehicle when asked. He said: “The only place I recall taking him was to Bryn Estyn children’s home. If he wanted to go to Bryn Estyn he would ask me and I would take him.” The commissioner said Anglesea would be in uniform and he was under the impression that he went to administer cautions to the children. Jones said he would not go into the home with Anglesea but just drop him off and carry on with the other duties that he had. He did not know how or when Anglesea would leave. “I have no idea. I have no recollection of collecting him,” he said when questioned by Eleanor Laws QC, prosecuting. Cross-examined by Tania Griffiths QC, defending, he said that he did not know if Anglesea had the consent of the chief inspector at the time to go to the home. Jones agreed that he was a junior officer simply taking him there at the time. The trial continues."
2016-09-29T08:16:57Z,uk-news,UK news,Bernard Hogan-Howe to retire as Met police commissioner,"Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe is to step down as commissioner of the Metropolitan police after a tumultuous period leading Britain’s biggest police force. He completed his full five-year term as commissioner of the Met just over a fortnight ago, but had his contract extended by a year, which would have seen him in the job until September 2017.
Sources in the Met and the mayor of London’s office insisted Hogan-Howe was not forced out but had chosen when to leave. There had been some tension between the new Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the commissioner, who was appointed in 2011 by Khan’s Conservative predecessor, Boris Johnson, and the thenhome secretary, Theresa May. Khan said on Thursday he had nothing to do with Hogan-Howe’s decision. When asked if he had any involvement, he told reporters: “That isn’t true. It’s to do with Bernard’s decision to retire. “I didn’t want him to go, we worked incredibly well together. But I am grateful he gave me and the home secretary sufficient notice.” Hogan-Howe said he had an excellent relationship with Khan. Asked if he was worried that the mayor was not going to reappoint him, he said: “No, not at all, it could have happened at any time over the next two years. “For me, definitely, I had decided it would be in the next year and, as things were falling out in terms of our plans, it just seemed to be a good chance to make this change now and then make sure that we allowed a decent time to select my successor for what is a vital role, an important one.” Hogan-Howe had been understood to be willing to serve longer if needed, but he is the first commissioner in more than a decade to complete his full term. His two immediate predecessors were forced from office. His departure came weeks ahead of a report into the Met’s handling of historical sex abuse cases, which is expected to be critical. The Met is also facing £400m of budget cuts by 2020, on top of large cuts it has already undergone. One police source said the commissioner’s “long-term aim was to go at a time of his own choosing”, and that was exactly what he had done. Hogan-Howe will stay in his post until February 2017, while the mayor and the home secretary choose a successor. Downing Street is expected to have a strong say. The lack of an obvious successor led to speculation Hogan-Howe might have stayed on and been granted a further extension. Senior figures in the mayor’s team thought Hogan-Howe was doing a good job. A week ago, the deputy mayor for policing and crime, Sophie Linden, said she had full confidence in him. Hogan-Howe became commissioner on 12 September 2011, after the force had been hit by the worst riots in modern English history. Crime fell by 18% during most of his time in office, though some categories are now rising. His predecessor, Sir Paul Stephenson, was forced from the job as a result of the phone-hacking scandal, and before him, Sir Ian Blair quit after he was told he had lost Johnson’s confidence. Hogan-Howe’s biggest achievement may well have been to show that the job of Met commissioner is not impossible, even though it is beset by political hurdles. To meet the big reduction in government funding, the Met will soon move out of its current headquarters to a new building. It has cut £600m from its budget and Hogan-Howe, after much deliberation, spoke out against the Conservative government that appointed him. Tensions surfaced recently with Khan, who was elected in May, over the issue of spit hoods, pieces of fabric and mesh placed over detainees’ heads to stop them spitting at or biting officers. Khan put pressure on the Met to reverse a decision to introduce the hoods earlier this month. The Met was planning to deploy them in custody areas, but after the Guardian revealed the decision, the mayor’s team was unhappy because it had not been consulted. Hogan-Howe said last week he accepted there had been a lack of sensitivity over the decision and regretted that Khan had not been told. The mayor is supposed to oversee the Met, shaping its strategic priorities while not interfering in its operations. Hogan-Howe said: “This was our decision prior to the mayor and deputy mayor arriving. “We didn’t raise it with the new mayor or deputy mayor. I’ve already acknowledged that probably, with retrospect, we didn’t anticipate the response because we didn’t think it was such a big issue. But clearly for people it has been.” The official statements announcing his resignation carried no sign of any tension. Hogan-Howe, 58, said: “I came into this job determined to fight crime and make the MPS the best, most professional police service. I wish my successor well as they take on this amazing responsibility. “It has been a great privilege to be the Met’s commissioner. I have loved my time in the role and I have loved being a police officer.” Hogan-Howe was hated by some sections of the media for the pursuit of journalists over phone-hacking and bribery claims. He also faced calls to quit over Operation Midland, an inquiry into claims VIPs had abused children decades ago. The operation is alleged to have spiralled out of control and collapsed without unearthing evidence of guilt. Under his tenure the Met successfully policed the 2012 London Olympics, but the officer who actually oversaw that soon left the organisation because Hogan-Howe had a particular vision of whom he wanted in his top team. The Met is also regarded as having done a good job in the face of the heightened terrorist, although the government has considered passing the responsibility to the relatively new National Crime Agency, an idea the Met has so far successfully resisted. Khan praised Hogan-Howe’s record, saying: “Bernard oversaw the excellent policing of the 2012 Olympic Games and has taken big steps towards making our police service more representative of London. “I will work closely with the home secretary to ensure we find the best possible candidate to appoint as the new commissioner, so that we can continue to keep Londoners safe.” The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said: “I want to thank Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe for the leadership he has shown as commissioner, and his work to keep the communities of London safe and the United Kingdom secure against the backdrop of a heightened terror threat. “Sir Bernard has had a long and distinguished career as a determined crimefighter and an inspirational senior officer. He has shown remarkable and consistent dedication to public service. Among his many achievements in London was the delivery of a safe and successful 2012 Olympics. I am grateful to Sir Bernard for his dedication and support, and look forward to working closely with him until his retirement next year.” Met staff morale hit record lows in 2014 but the force maintained officer numbers at 32,000 as it restructured and tried to adapt to the changing nature of crime, particularly cyber offences. The last commissioner of the Met to complete their term was Sir John Stevens in 2005. Among those who may apply for the commissioner’s job are Sara Thornton, the current head of the National Police Chiefs’ Council and former head of the Thames Valley force, bordering London. She was once described as David Cameron’s favourite police chief. Also in the running is Mark Rowley, an assistant commissioner of the Met who oversees counter-terrorism."
2016-09-29T09:05:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Elsie Frost murder suspect released on police bail,"A 78-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murdering a Yorkshire schoolgirl more than half a century ago has been released on police bail. Elsie Frost, a 14-year-old school prefect, was walking alongside a canal towpath in Wakefield when she was stabbed in the back and head on 9 October 1965. The investigation into Elsie’s murder was relaunched by West Yorkshire police in 2015, when a team of 14 officers examined thousands of pages of written evidence. On Tuesday, officers from the force’s homicide and major inquiry team arrested a 78-year-old man – named locally as Peter Pickering – in Berkshire on suspicion of her murder. He has now been bailed. The senior investigating officer, DS Nick Wallen, said: “We have now bailed a man arrested yesterday, pending further inquiries. Our investigations into Elsie’s murder remain very much ongoing.” Before the case was reopened Elsie’s siblings – 69-year-old Anne Cleave, who was 18 at the time of the murder, and 58-year-old Colin, who was six – had called for a fresh investigation. BBC Radio 4 also aired an investigation into the case. Elsie’s body was found at the bottom of a flight of steps by a dog walker; hundreds of people were interviewed but her killer has evaded justice ever since. In the wake of the fresh police appeal, Colin Frost spoke out about his family’s pain, recalling that his parents, Edith and Arthur, had died “with a huge amount of guilt”. Frost said Elsie had been like a mother to him: “She was just a sweet, sweet person. She was lovely.” In 1966, Ian Bernard Spencer, then aged 33, was charged with Elsie’s murder but was cleared on the orders of the trial judge. Frost told Radio 4’s World At One this week: “As a family we are very pleased. All we wanted was to be taken seriously. We were aware that mistakes were made in 1965, but we’ve been impressed with the commitment of West Yorkshire police in the reinvestigation, the number of officers involved, the number of agencies involved.”"
2016-09-29T09:35:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Police with body cameras receive 93% fewer complaints â€“ study,"Police equipped with body-worn cameras receive 93% fewer complaints from the public, according to a new study that suggests the technology helps to cool down potentially volatile encounters. Academics at Cambridge University, whose research looked at nearly 1.5m beat hours across more than 4,000 shifts by officers in the UK and California, claim their findings suggest the cameras herald a “profound sea change in modern policing”.
Lead author Dr Barak Ariel, from Cambridge’s Institute of Criminology, said: “The cameras create an equilibrium between the account of the officer and the account of the suspect about the same event – increasing accountability on both sides.” Body-worn cameras have been increasingly used in both Britain and the US in recent years in response to a perceived crisis in police legitimacy and disproportionate targeting of ethnic minorities. A report last year called for London’s Metropolitan police to use cameras during all stop and searches, amid persistent complaints that the force disproportionately targets young black men. In the US, the epidemic of police shootings of black people has raised similar concerns. The Cambridge study, conducted during 2014-15 across seven trial sites that covered a population of more than 2 million people, set out to investigate the difference made by the cameras, which are usually attached to the top half of police uniforms. Throughout the year-long experiment, researchers were said to have randomly assigned about half of the officers starting their shifts with cameras. All officers in the forces taking part worked with cameras at some point, the researchers said. During the 12 months before the study, a total of 1,539 complaints were lodged against police in the areas examined, amounting to 1.2 complaints per officer. By the end, the number of complaints had fallen to 133 for the year across all sites – 0.08 per officer. The researchers were surprised to find that there was no statistically significant difference between the number of complaints received by officers wearing cameras and those without, a result they said may be a result of “contagious accountability”. Co-author Dr Alex Sutherland, of Rand Europe, said: “It may be that, by repeated exposure to the surveillance of the cameras, officers changed their reactive behaviour on the streets – changes that proved more effective and so stuck. “With a complaints reduction of nearly 100% across the board, we find it difficult to consider alternatives, to be honest.” The findings come with an important caveat, which is that the behaviour changes appeared to rely on cameras recording throughout encounters with the public, and officers explicitly warning that they were on, the researchers said. Early findings from the study, published earlier this year, suggested that violence actually increased if a camera was switched on in the middle of an interaction, a move that could be interpreted by both sides as an escalation. Ariel said that verbal reminders that encounters were being filmed encouraged participants “to think about their actions more consciously. This might mean that officers begin encounters with more awareness of rules of conduct, and members of the public are less inclined to respond aggressively.” The study’s findings are published in the journal Criminal Justice and Behaviour."
2016-09-29T10:02:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Come pie with me: Wiganer's pork pie sparks airport security alert,"A security alert was sparked at Manchester airport when a pork pie-loving pensioner tried to carry his tasty treat through the scanners. Norman Pearson, 69, from Wigan, expected to breeze through security with a pork pie nestled between his holiday clothes for a flight to Spain. Pearson, said to be meticulous when abiding by airport rules regarding liquids, was mortified when staff started searching his bag for prohibited items.
His brother, Roy, said the juice within the sizeable pie had shown up on security scanners as a liquid. “Seeing the funny side of it, and not being able to extract the juice from the pie and place into a plastic bag, airport security allowed both Norman and his delicacy to continue on their way and wished him ‘bon appetit’,” Roy told the Manchester Evening News. Pearson was on his way to Málaga with a friend when the episode unfolded on Monday. Roy said his brother had purchased the pie the previous evening at his local pub, predicting that he might fancy a mid-flight treat. “Norman and pork pies are regular travelling companions, but it’s the first time that it has caused an issue with airport security,” Roy said.
“It certainly tickled me because he’s so precise. He doesn’t even wear a belt so he can get through security fast. He’s mortified if he gets held up so he’d be very surprised to be held up by a pie. “The people in security said they have never seen that before.

2016-09-29T10:34:50Z,uk-news,UK news,Asylum seekers in UK 'face longest wait for work permit in Europe',"Britain is one of the worst countries in Europe at integrating asylum seekers into the labour market, unnecessarily increasing their dependency on the welfare system, a report has found. Under British law, asylum seekers must wait for 12 months before applying for a work permit – the longest waiting time in Europe, according to research from the Migration Policy Centre (MPC) in Italy, and Bertelsmann Stiftung, a German thinktank. Even after the 12-month threshold, they are often unable to access the labour market because they cannot be self-employed or set up a business. They can also only apply for jobs within a small band of professions for which many lack the qualifications to apply. Even when asylum seekers are granted refugee status, researchers found that they are effectively discouraged from seeking work. The limited 28-day window which they have to find private accommodation is too short for them to find work and then earn the wages they would need to pay for a deposit on a rental contract. “Due to the brevity of this period, there is a strong incentive to secure housing and out-of-work benefits rather than employment,” the report says.
This dynamic means that they are less able to contribute to the British economy, Joscha Schwarzwälder, one of the report’s authors, said in an interview. “One reason for letting asylum seekers work is that they will not have to rely on social benefits and there will be less costs for the budget,” he said. “Another argument is that early access to the labour market is key also for the longer-term labour market integration. In other words, if asylum seekers remain inactive for a prolonged period of time because they are prevented from accessing the jobs market, they will have more difficulties in finding employment once their asylum claim has been settled. Hence, a preventive approach might also create more costs in the longer term.” Moe, a Syrian graduate currently seeking asylum in the UK, agreed that the restrictions made him less likely to be able to contribute to the British economy in the long term. “I was told: ‘Do not work. Do not even do voluntary work,’” he said. Moe, who asked for his surname not to be published, continued: “The problem for me is that I’m a freelancer. If I continue to turn down client requests while I wait for my application, I won’t have any clients by the time my application is processed. It’s been almost six months since I applied, and I haven’t even been assigned a case worker, which is the first step in the process after the initial screening.” Stephen Hale, the CEO of Refugee Action, a charity that helps to integrate refugees in Britain, said a lack of English lessons was also hindering the process (pdf). “English lessons are the first crucial step in enabling refugees to integrate,” he said. “It’s hugely frustrating for many refugees in Britain that there is a severe shortage of English classes. The annual cost of English classes is around £1,600. This is repaid in just six months when refugees gain employment at the national average wage.” The MPC report also suggested that the Swedish and German policy of allowing asylum seekers to work early on in their application process was key to easing them into the formal economy. It also encouraged more training schemes for refugees, which it said led to better employment rates, and found that places that offered more secure housing tended to see higher refugee employment. It also found merit in Scandinavian schemes that provide economic incentives to employers who give jobs to refugees."
2016-09-29T11:08:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Two men sought after Oxford girl abducted and raped on way to school,"Police are searching for two men who raped a 14-year-old girl in a car after abducting her on her way to school in Oxford. Thames Valley police are appealing for witnesses after the victim was found at midday on Wednesday knocking on doors in the Marston area of the city. Police said the girl was extremely traumatised by her ordeal and was unable to provide a description of her attackers, other than they were white men whom she did not know. The victim raised the alarm after she was taken by the two men in the Summertown area and driven away in a silver car, possibly a Volkswagen hatchback. Det Supt Chris Ward, head of the Thames Valley police major crime unit, said the girl was being supported by specialist officers. “It is taking quite a long time to tease the information from her,” he told a press conference in Kidlington. “What we know is that our victim left her house and walked along the Banbury Road, towards the junction of Marston Ferry Lane. Shortly after that she has been abducted and then she sustained a very serious sexual assault … I believe this happened within the vehicle, so it is the vehicle that is the key to this.” Ward appealed for witnesses, including those with dashboard or head cameras, who may have seen or recorded the men or the car between 8.10am and just before midday in north Oxford. “The description of the suspects is very limited. All we are able to tell you is that they were white males,” Ward said. “People who were in that road between those times may have dash-cam footage, or cyclists may have head-cam footage. I would ask them to view that and see if there is anything in that that could assist us. “The victim was wearing school uniform so should be quite distinctive.” More officers have been deployed to the area to reassure the public, and police have advised children to walk to school in groups. “We are not sure she was dragged into the vehicle. I think she was approached and possibly hugged. So it may be that somebody has seen something that looks relatively innocent but actually it wasn’t,” Ward said. “This is a very, very, very unusual offence. It is important we do all we can to catch these people as quickly as possible.” Supt Christian Bunt, the local policing commander for Oxford, said: “We are stepping up patrols in the area to provide reassurance, and there will be a very visible police presence while the investigation continues. “I would ask parents to consider the safety of their children and, if they are walking to school, make sure they try to keep in groups. I would also ask people to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious.”"
2016-09-29T12:09:57Z,uk-news,UK news,Tributes paid to 11-year-old schoolboy found dead in Bradford,"Tributes have been paid to an 11-year-old schoolboy who was found dead by his mother in the bedroom of his home in Bradford. Asad Khan was found in an unresponsive state when police officers and paramedics were called to the home in Tile Street, shortly before 4.20pm on Wednesday. After meeting Asad’s parents on Wednesday night, the Bradford West MP, Naz Shah, said he may have been bullied and killed himself. Shah wrote on Facebook: “This evening 11-year-old Asad took his own life. Asad had just started his new school recently and bullying is something that has been mentioned.” Shah told the Guardian that she was due to visit the family on Thursday afternoon. She said: “Bullying is something that is being looked at. It was something that was mentioned to me by one family member. His parents are distraught and I will be seeing them again today.” Simon Wade, the headteacher at Beckfoot Upper Heaton school, where Asad had been a pupil for three weeks, said in a statement on the school’s website: “It is with great sadness that we learnt last night of the death of Asad Khan, one of the school’s newest students. “The school is united in its grief at this sad time. The school community is working together as students, parents and staff come to terms with these events. All our thoughts are with Asad’s family at this terribly difficult time.” Asad’s aunt, Rehana Bibi, 34, said she had been told by some young boys in the family that her nephew was being bullied. She said: “Asad was was just a very good innocent child, he was so sweet and I just cannot believe he has gone like this.” A spokesperson for West Yorkshire police would not confirm how Asad had died until the results of a postmortem examination were available. The spokesperson added: “The boy was taken to hospital, but sadly died a short time later. Inquiries are continuing, but his death is not believed to be suspicious at this time.”"
2016-09-29T13:35:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Two bodies found in Norfolk estuary,"The deaths of a man and a woman whose bodies were found on the mud banks of a protected wetland in Norfolk are being treated as unexplained, police have said. A birdwatcher using a telescope spotted the two bodies at Breydon Water near Great Yarmouth, according to local reports. Norfolk police said officers were called to the scene shortly after 11.20am on Thursday and were working with colleagues from the coastguard and Norfolk fire and rescue service.
It is understood it could take two or three hours to recover the bodies because of their location. There are reportedly three fire engines in a nearby supermarket car park that backs onto the water. Breydon Water is the gateway to the Norfolk Broads river system and is the UK’s largest protected wetland. In the care of the RSPB, it is a popular area with birdwatchers. DI Chris Burgess, who is overseeing the inquiry, said: “It has taken some time for officers to recover the bodies due to where they were discovered. “The deaths are currently being treated as unexplained. We are in the early stages of the inquiry and it would be inappropriate to speculate any further.” Postmortem examinations will be held in due course to establish the cause of death, police said."
2016-09-29T13:43:57Z,uk-news,UK news,'Tube chat' campaign provokes horror among London commuters,"The perception of the London commuter as an unfriendly curmudgeon has been bolstered by the mixed reaction to a mystery campaign to encourage tube passengers to chat. Badges emblazoned with the question “Tube chat?” have been distributed on the London Underground network, to the horror of some regular users. Transport for London (TfL) said it was not behind the badges, which are identical in font and design to the official “Baby on board” pins given to expectant mothers. Commuters were quick to express their disdain for the idea, for which no individual or group has claimed responsibility.
The badges come attached to a small piece of card, which reads: “Have a chat with your fellow travellers. Wear this badge to let others know you’re interested. You’ll benefit from a daily chat. Start using it today!” But some commuters did react warmly to the badges:
A TfL spokeswoman said: “It’s definitely not something we have created. We are trying to get in touch with the people behind them as we never allow people to use our branding unless they have our permission. “This sort of stuff is quite dangerous; we don’t want people to get confused. “While it is an interesting idea, we don’t want people using our branding.” “Baby on board” badges can be ordered from TfL to help mothers-to-be secure a seat without embarrassment. Badges for people with disabilities or who are less able to stand, saying “Please offer me a seat”, are also being trialled."
2016-09-29T14:02:55Z,uk-news,UK news,TfL accused of fostering 'brutal exploitation' of minicab drivers,"Minicab drivers have accused Transport for London, which licenses their trade, of tacitly encouraging the “brutal exploitation” of drivers by digital private hire firms such as Uber. A report published by United Private Hire Drivers (UPHD), a minicab drivers’ union, and Networked Rights, a non-profit organisation that researches exploitation in the sharing economy, says TfL has failed to get to grips with the emergence of private-hire apps and their implications for drivers’ wellbeing. It claims that four out of five UPHD members can no longer earn enough to support their families despite working full-time, and nearly three out of five have been racially abused while on the job. Nine out of 10 drivers believe TfL does nothing to protect them from exploitation.
Yaseen Aslam, UPHD’s founder, said a combination of low pay and exploitative conditions had left his members facing a winter crisis. Drivers “are telling us their employment and income has never been more insecure and are met by a cruel and indifferent regulator”, he said. “We urgently need change at TfL if we are to protect public safety as well as the rights and welfare of some of London’s poorest workers.” James Farrar of Networked Rights said that virtualisation in the minicab trade was shifting all the risk of the business on to drivers and away from operators, a situation made worse by TfL’s refusal to put a cap on the number of minicab licences issued. There are nearly 112,000 licensed minicab drivers in London, and competition is forcing prices down while operators continue to profit from the commissions levied on the increased number of transactions, Farrar said. “We are seeing a price war going on at the moment, but the cost of that price war is not being borne by the operators, it’s borne by the drivers. And of course, TfL is also collecting a windfall in licence fee income from drivers as well,” he said.
“The number of licences has doubled in London in the past three years or so, and TfL are putting on about 1,000 new licences every month.” The joint report calls on the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to agree to a 10-point plan to solve the problems facing minicab drivers, including the enforcement of “fit and proper” requirements for multinational operators, a cap on the number of private hire licences and an end to proposals to criminalise ply trade, where cab drivers pick up fares from the street. It also calls for an end to plans to introduce “discriminatory” written English tests for drivers. “What’s particularly cruel is that TfL is licensing out of control, and they’re refusing to grandfather rights in for guys,” Farrar said. “That means there are a lot of guys now sweating it out, worried that they will lose their licence at the point of renewal if they can’t pass this damn test. That would leave them not only out of a job, but with stranded assets. What about guys who have invested 60 grand into a Mercedes E Class and now can’t work? That’s a stranded asset.” A TfL spokeswoman said: “Transport for London and the mayor are determined to encourage a vibrant taxi and private hire market in the capital, with space for all providers to flourish. “We recently published a taxi and private hire action plan, which includes a raft of measures to drive up standards and improve safety for every passenger in London.”"
2016-09-29T14:03:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Phonics test results rise again but poorer pupils lag behind,"More than four in five primary school pupils in England passed the government’s check on reading and pronunciation for the first time, although figures showed wide gaps in attainment between pupils based on economic disadvantage and month of birth.
Results from the 2016 phonics check, carried out on five- and six year-olds in year one of primary school, showed 81% met the expected standard, a jump of four percentage points compared with 2015 and a 23 percentage point improvement on the 58% pass rate in 2012, when the test was introduced. The phonics check requires pupils to correctly pronounce a list of 40 words and sounds. It was introduced to reinforce the Department for Education’s (DfE) adoption of synthetic phonics as the mandatory technique for teaching the first stages of literacy, known as decoding. Nick Gibb, the schools minister, hailed the result as “fundamental” to improving reading in England. “Thanks to the hard work of teachers, our continued focus on raising standards and our increased emphasis on phonics‎, there are now an additional 147,000 six-year-olds on track to becoming fluent readers,” he said. “While this is a huge achievement, we know there is more to do. We will work with schools and local authorities to ensure even more young people have the knowledge and skills they need to get on in life.” The figures were published alongside the first results of teacher assessments carried out at the end of key stage one – year two in primary school – showing three in four pupils meeting the tougher standards introduced this year in reading and maths, but just 65% achieving the same in writing. The DfE’s statisticians said that because the reformed teacher assessments involved a new, higher standard, they were not comparable to key stage one results from previous year. The phonics check and the key stage one assessments showed considerable variations in attainment, with boys in most cases lagging behind girls, and children from disadvantaged backgrounds – especially those recorded as white British – well behind their better-off peers. “The data shows attainment gaps remain a challenge. More girls than boys continue to meet the phonics standard but this gap is decreasing, the gap between pupils eligible for free school meals and all other pupils has narrowed again, which is welcome,” said Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers. But Hobby noted that the attainment gap between special needs pupils and others had not changed. The figures also showed schools in inner London outperforming most of the rest of the country, especially in writing at the end of key stage one. The data showed 73% of pupils in inner London schools reached the expected standard in writing, compared with 65% in state schools in England as a whole. The same London areas also got the best pass rates in reading and maths. Outside London, the north-east region – including Northumberland, Middlesbrough and Redcar – was the best performer, with the highest proportion of children meeting expectations in reading, writing and maths. The new system of teacher assessments – which replaced national levels – revealed sharp ethnic and gender divides. Just 58% of white boys reached the expected level in writing, while 72% of white girls did so. Data from phonics checks also showed stark differences in results based on month of birth. Among year one pupils, those born in September, at the start of the school year, had a 87% pass rate, compared with those born in August, who had a 72% pass rate. The gap was more pronounced when gender and birth month were combined. Nine out of 10 girls born in September passed the phonics check, while about seven in 10 boys born in August managed to do the same."

Paramedics called the police after the three-month-old girl was found at 10.20am on the bus at the junction of High Street and Carpenters Road in Stratford, Scotland Yard said. The child was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead. A 27-year-old woman was arrested at the hospital and a 52-year-old man was detained at an address in east London later on Wednesday. They were both arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in custody at separate police stations. A postmortem examination was due to take place on Friday at St Thomas’s hospital. The baby has not been formally identified. DCI Gary Holmes said: “The death of any child is tragic and we would appeal for anyone with information to please come forward as soon as possible to help with our inquiries.”"
2016-09-29T16:21:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Man charged with punching baby says he thought she was a doll,"A man who is charged with punching a five-day-old baby in the face in a branch of Tesco has claimed he thought the infant was a toy doll. David Hardy, 63, from Baguley, Greater Manchester, appeared in court on Thursday. He is accused of approaching Elsie Temple as she lay in her carrycot inside a shopping trolley and punching her as her mother, Amy Duckers, looked on in horror. Elsie was left with a red mark on her face and was taken to hospital, where she was kept for seven hours. Hardy admitted to punching the baby but pleaded not guilty to a charge of common assault because he said he had no intention of hitting a baby. His lawyer, Chris Fallows, is quoted by Manchester Evening News as telling Manchester magistrates court: “This defendant [is] effectively a family man who has young children in the family and does not behave in a way that is suggested to this allegation. The crown suggests Mr Hardy deliberately punched a five-day-old baby to the face in a carrycot in a shopping trolley. The defendant says he believed – and this belief was prior to the incident – that he thought it was a doll.” Fallows said Hardy’s claim that he thought the baby was a doll was supported by witness statements. “After the incident the defendant, who has never been in trouble before, had news reporters arrive at his door,” he said. “He was hung, drawn and quartered on social media and in the comments on news reports. It is conceded by the defendant that what occurred was unusual, bizarre and he acted rather foolishly. But the prosecution, despite evidence to the contrary, say that this was intentional.” Fallows also said that Hardy had been “on the verge of suicide” and wished the case to be dealt with as quickly as possible. A district judge granted him conditional bail and he will face a trial next month."
2016-09-29T16:44:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Hinkley Point: ministers sign go-ahead for nuclear power plant,"The UK has signed its £18bn contract with France and China to build the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, giving the final go-ahead for construction at the site in Somerset. The deal was finalised at a low-key ceremony in London, just two months after Theresa May alarmed her French and Chinese counterparts by putting the entire project under review. EDF, the French nuclear contractor, and its Chinese partners had to cancel their previous plans for a signing ceremony at the last minute when the review was announced in July. The project finally got approval this month, after Greg Clark, the business secretary, announced there would be some new restrictions on future investments in critical infrastructure if there were national security concerns. Clark attended the signing ceremony on behalf of the UK, alongside Jean-Bernard Lévy, the chairman of EDF, and He Yu, chair of China General Nuclear.
The business secretary said it was a “crucial moment in the UK’s first new nuclear power station for a generation and follows new measures put in place by government to strengthen security and ownership”. The event was also attended by Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French foreign minister, and Nur Bekri, a senior official at the National Energy Administration of China. He Yu said it signifies “CGN’s commitment to the UK as one of the world’s leading developers and operators of nuclear power. This flagship programme is a triple win for China, Britain, and France and is a culmination of years of cooperation between the three countries. CGN looks forward to providing UK consumers with safe, reliable and sustainable energy and maximising opportunities for UK suppliers and the UK workforce.” Unions welcomed the development, saying thousands of skilled jobs would now be created, benefiting firms across the UK. It is expected to produce 7GW of electricity when fully operational, enough to power 6m homes and provide 7% of Britain’s electricity needs for 60 years. However, Greenpeace said it was “no wonder the UK government has opted for a ‘champagne-free’ signing ceremony away from public view”. The environmental group said: “With a stroke of the pen ministers are signing away billions of pounds of billpayers’ money to a project they know is plagued by legal, financial and technical problems. In the unlikely event Hinkley is working some time in the second half of the next decade, renewable energy will be much cheaper, yet British consumers will still be forced to pay over the odds for nuclear power. It’ll be like being locked into an expensive fixed-rate mortgage as interest rates plummet.” Under the new controls, EDF will not be able to sell on its stake in Hinkley without permission. For future projects, the UK government will own a “special share” that means it will have a veto over owners if there are national security concerns. In a sign the new requirements do not appear to be overly stringent, both EDF and CGN said they were delighted by the approval, which they claimed would let them proceed with Hinkley and their wider plans for nuclear construction in the UK in future. The government published documents detailing the contractual obligations it has entered into, including a “value for money assessment” that allowed ministers to make the decision to proceed with the project. According to the documents, UK-based businesses would benefit from more than 60% of the cost of the project and 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships would be created during construction and after its opening. Justin Bowden, the GMB union’s national secretary for energy, said: “With collective sighs of relief all round, it is fantastic news that the Hinkley deal is finally signed and work can start on this vital piece of UK infrastructure. “The formal go-ahead for Hinkley is the first serious sign that UK plc is open for business post-Brexit and holding a secret ceremony did not do justice to such a historic event. Attention must now straight away shift to Bradwell B and Sizewell C.”"
2016-09-29T17:28:51Z,uk-news,UK news,"'Fake Sheikh' had no motive to alter witness statement, jury hears","The undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood is “undoubtedly a controversial figure” but his journalistic techniques, though some might find them “distasteful”, are not on trial, an Old Bailey jury has been told. The journalist, known as the “Fake Sheikh”, with a reputation as the “king of the sting”, had no motive to conspire to change a witness statement in the collapsed trial of pop star Tulisa Contostavlos, said his defence lawyer, John Kelsey-Fry QC. Mahmood, 53, and his former driver, Alan Smith, 67, deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by tampering with Smith’s police statement in order to remove anti-drugs comments allegedly made by the former N-Dubz singer. The comments, in which Contostavlos allegedly said she disapproved of hard drugs because a family member had a drug problem, were said to have been made as the former X Factor judge and two associates were driven home after meeting Mahmood, who had posed as a Bollywood film producer offering her the possibility of a lead role. The trial of Contostavlos for allegedly arranging for Mahmood to be sold cocaine worth £800 was subsequently thrown out. In his closing speech, Kelsey-Fry said the case against Mahmood was “fundamentally flawed, illogical and defies common sense”. The prosecution alleged that Mahmood had “manipulated” Smith’s statement because he feared the first version would help Contostavlos at her trial, or at a pre-trial hearing where her lawyers were attempting to get the case against her dismissed. “That, they say, is the motive,” said Kelsey-Fry. The lawyer questioned whether Mahmood would have had anything to fear from that first version. “If the answer to that question is no, then this entire prosecution doesn’t make sense.”
In April 2014, before the singer’s trial, police had asked if there were tape recordings of the car journey, so Mahmood would have known there was a defence focus on what was said in the car, Kelsey-Fry said. Smith did not give his police statement until June 2014. If Mahmood had wanted to pervert the course of justice, he would have discussed it with Smith before the driver gave his police statement, the lawyer said. “He wouldn’t be saying, ‘Send me a copy of what you said’ afterwards, when the damage had been done.” Yet the prosecution alleged “he let the horse bolt”, then tried to cover it up to deny Contostavlos the advantage, said Kelsey-Fry. Smith told police he changed his statement to exclude Contostavlos’s anti-drugs comment because he was not sure he had remembered it correctly one year later. The driver had told police it was a “horrendous journey”, and that Contostavlos and her associates had been drinking. “Drunk, rowing, screaming, someone trying to jump out of the car,” said Kelsey-Fry. “Of course Smith was likely to have an insecure recollection of what was said by whom in the car. Indeed, think about it, it would be impossible to imagine anything else.” He said the evidence showed Mahmood had “absolutely nothing to fear” from Smith’s original statement, and the argument that Mahmood had a “vested” interest in securing the singer’s prosecution was an example of the prosecution case being “fundamentally flawed”.
Kelsey-Fry said of the journalist: “Securing convictions is not actually his job.” If the Contostavlos case had been stopped, because of the argument of entrapment, “would that be the end of the world for Mr Mahmood, if she had done what the newspaper said she had done?” Mahmood had presented himself to the singer as a “party animal” who used cocaine. “Obviously you can’t go and test someone to see if they will supply drugs dressed as a vicar,” the lawyer said. The anti-drugs comments, made when Contostavlos thought she was in public with an unknown driver, rather than in private with Mahmood, were “not earth-shattering” and would not have stopped her trial “in its tracks”, said Kelsey-Fry. The comments did “nothing to displace the evidence volunteered from Tulisa’s own lips”, the lawyer added. “And Mr Mahmood knew that.” When Smith was questioned by Contostavlos’s lawyers ahead of her trial, he readily told them he had sent his draft statement to Mahmood, Kelsey-Fry said. Kelsey-Fry said no evidence was called in Mahmood’s defence because “there is not evidence to challenge by way of cross-examination”. The only reason for giving evidence was “if the prosecution have established a case sufficiently compelling to call for an answer”. The prosecution case was not compelling, he said, and “flies in the face of reason”. Mahmood and Smith both deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The case continues."
2016-09-29T17:30:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Asylum seekers in Scotland at risk of being moved to England,"Vulnerable asylum seekers are at risk of being “funnelled” out of Scotland and away from family, friends and legal representation under detention plans that are being challenged by politicians and campaigners. The Scottish government and local Scottish National party MPs have called for “urgent clarity” about Home Office proposals to build a short-term holding facility near Glasgow airport to replace the controversial Dungavel immigration removal centre. Robert Goodwill, the immigration minister, said at the beginning of September that the centre in Lanarkshire, which has been condemned as “barbaric and inhumane” and has been the focus of numerous protests, will shut towards the end of 2017. The announcement is believed to have taken the Scottish government and the asylum sector by surprise. Groups including the Scottish Refugee Council, Amnesty International and Detention Action said they were worried that the short-term airport facility, where individuals can only be held for a limited period, will result in asylum detainees being taken away from their support networks. There is no long-term centre north of Lincolnshire, so those removed from Scotland will be many hours’ drive away from friends and family. They will also face jurisdictional difficulties as they find themselves under a different legal system. This means they may need to abandon any pending legal challenges in the Scottish courts and find new representation in England. On Thursday evening, Renfrewshire Council will discuss a series of motions noting the lack of consultation over the proposals – which still require planning permission – and expressing similar concerns. Kenny MacLaren, the deputy leader of the council’s SNP group and one of the local councillors for the proposed area of the new centre, said: “Simply moving the centre doesn’t address the concerns of many campaigners about the inhumane treatment that detainees have received at Dungavel.” He said a number of constituents had already approached him with their concerns. “There is a danger that a new centre so close to the airport will result in rapid transfer of detainees, moving them further away from their families, friends and communities and making it harder for them to challenge their deportation.” Naomi McAuliffe, Amnesty’s Scotland programme director, told the Guardian: “The context is the Brexit momentum behind restricting freedom of movement and the implementation of the Immigration Act 2016, which is about finding, reporting and deporting ‘illegal immigrants’. I’m increasingly pessimistic that this new facility is about funnelling people down to England away from their friends, networks and importantly, legal representation in Scotland.” The UK government has argued that the closure of Dungavel would mean “a significant saving for the public purse” because the new facility would provide easy access to London airports, from where most removals occur. Kate Alexander, the director of Scottish Detainee Visitors, said there was little evidence to show that short-term facilities led to people being removed more quickly. The most recent figures for Larne House, Northern Ireland’s short-term holding facility, showed 44% of inmates were moved to another detention centre. She said that, in contrast with longer-term facilities, short-term units operated with no equivalent rules regarding the protection of inmates, resulting in concerns about conditions and, in particular, the treatment of women. The Scottish Refugee Council said a previous guarantee that Dungavel would no longer detain children resulted in families being moved to England. The SNP MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire North, Gavin Newlands, said he was waiting for a meeting with Goodwill to discuss the proposed move to his constituency, which he has noted “raises issues locally as well as on the UK government’s immigration policy”. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has told the Scottish parliament: “I think what all of us would want to see is a system that replaces Dungavel that is more humane than it, not less humane.”"

Gloria Macleod, whose husband Robert grew up in Dingwall, in the Highlands, was refused entry to the UK at Inverness airport on Monday, despite holding a valid visa, and was placed on temporary admission, which expires on Saturday. The couple’s local MP, Ian Blackford, has written to the immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, asking that the removal order be suspended until he and the family receive a full explanation. Last Tuesday Blackford celebrated with another family of constituents, the Brains, who were granted leave to remain after fighting since April against deportation. Gloria’s husband, Robert, whom she married in 2003, is a former Royal Regiment of Scotland lance corporal, and their two daughters are both British citizens. The family, who had been living in Dubai where Robert works as a security manager, returned to Dingwall in July, where 11-year-old Siobhan and 10-year-old Meaghan have been enrolled in primary school Although Gloria, an Indian passport holder, was already in possession of a UK C-Visit passport, which is valid for 10 years, the couple decided that she should apply for permanent residence to allow her to remain in Scotland while the girls attended school and Robert continued working in Dubai. Following advice from the visa office in Dubai, acting on behalf of the UK immigration service, that her application had to be made in person, Gloria briefly left the UK to complete her application process. But when she returned to the UK on Monday she was refused entry. When she pleaded with the authorities that she was due to pick up her children from school that afternoon, she was allowed in on on the condition that she be deported to Dubai on Saturday. The family now faces the prospect of Gloria’s imminent departure, with only Robert’s elderly parents remaining to look after the children. Blackford, who is still awaiting a reply from the Home Office, said: “Mrs Macleod followed exactly the instructions given to her by the immigration service and is now being penalised for this. Her visa is still current and has not been violated in any way. I have yet to fathom any reason why these actions have been taken. “The family clearly wants to live in Mr Macleod’s home town and he intends to return at every opportunity to be with his wife and daughters. He has a good job in Dubai and it is quite understandable that he wants to continue with this to support his family. “What is beyond understanding is the attitude of the Home Office, who are removing a mother from her family, leaving two young girls in the care of elderly and infirm grandparents for no apparent reason. This must not be allowed to happen and I will do all I can to stop this madness immediately.”"
2016-09-30T00:02:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Archbishop of York says EU countries are 'shunting migrants' towards UK,"The archbishop of York has accused European countries of pushing migrants towards Britain and warned that the UK should not be regarded as a “soft touch”. John Sentamu said the refugee camp in Calais only existed because the Schengen free-travel zone allowed migrants to move from the Middle East or Africa through Europe to the edge of the Channel without passport checks. The Church of England’s second-highest cleric told the Henley literary festival that the countries in the Schengen area should “own up to what they have created”. “I think it should be that, wherever the asylum seekers arrive in that particular place, you have a responsibility for their care, their love,” the Daily Mail reported him saying. “Schengen countries have not done that with the ‘Jungle’ and I, for one – as much as I am sympathetic and I feel sorry for the number of people genuinely seeking asylum – I think really the issue lies with the Schengen countries and they cannot see Britain as a soft touch.” Sentamu, who fled Idi Amin’s regime in Uganda in 1973 for the UK, visited the Calais camp in June. He said the UK could not be held responsible for the camp because it had never been part of the visa-free zone. “They have gone from nation to nation which signed up in Europe,” Sentamu told the festival audience. “Those Schengen countries ought to resolve the problem that belongs there because they have entered Europe because of free movement. “Every nation is shunting them and shunting them and shunting them in the hope that they will end up in the UK.” On Monday François Hollande called on the UK to accept some responsibility for solving the refugee problem in Calais and across Europe. The French president said he wanted the camp, which is home to an estimated 10,000 people including 1,000 lone children – to be “completely and definitively dismantled”. Closing down the camp would be an “exceptional operation prompted by exceptional circumstances”, Hollande added. The archbishop praised David Cameron’s policy of giving aid to Middle Eastern nations to help refugees stay in their home countries. In comments that could spark criticism from refugee groups, Sentamu said that Britain should begin naval patrols of the Libyan coast to prevent people smuggling. “What I never understood is, given the ability and the number of British ships we’ve got, why aren’t they patrolling the coast around Libya to stop people getting into boats?” he asked."
2016-09-30T08:18:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Race to succeed Hogan-Howe as Met police chief gets under way,"Britain’s most senior counter-terrorism official and a police leader who was David Cameron’s favourite chief constable have emerged as the most likely candidates to replace Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe as the Met police commissioner. On Thursday Hogan-Howe announced his retirement seven months early, insisting it had nothing to do with tensions with his new political masters.
Hogan-Howe completed a full five-year term this month – the first Metropolitan police commissioner not to be ousted from office in a decade – and was expected to continue for another year. He will now retire in February, halfway through the one-year extension to his original contract. His announcement came ahead of the release next month of a report on the Met’s handling of historical sex abuse cases, which is expected to be critical, though probably not of the commissioner. The Met is facing £400m of budget cuts by 2020, on top of significant cuts it has already undergone. One police source said the commissioner’s “long-term aim was to go at a time of his own choosing”, and that was what he had done. The lack of an obvious successor led to speculation that Hogan-Howe might have stayed on for a year or so longer, and his early departure created speculation that he had a difficult relationship with new mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Among those who may apply for the £276,000-a-year post are Mark Rowley, an assistant commissioner of the Met who oversees counter-terrorism. In that role he has got to know key politicians who will choose the next commissioner, namely the current home secretary, Amber Rudd, Theresa May and Khan.
The other main contender is Sara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council and former head of the Thames Valley force, bordering London. She been described as Cameron’s favourite police chief, with his constituency being in her force area.
Technically the home secretary makes the choice, having only to take regard of the London’s mayor’s views. But the prime minister will have a large if not decisive say, and the choice of the next Met commissioner presents a chance to bring more radical reform to policing and its biggest regional force. Khan, elected for Labour in May, said Hogan-Howe had decided himself to stand down. He said: “I didn’t want him to go, we worked incredibly well together. But I am grateful he gave me and the home secretary sufficient notice.” There had been some tension between the new Labour mayor and the commissioner, who was appointed in 2011 by Khan’s Conservative predecessor, Boris Johnson, and May, then home secretary. They wanted a “crimefighter”, and someone who would not habitually criticise swingeing government changes to policing that officers hated. The outgoing Met commissioner said the force needed a “fresh approach” and a leader with new ideas. Hogan-Howe told LBC Radio: “Five years is quite a long time in this job. I’m not complaining but I work 70-odd hours a week. I love it and I love being at work.” He said the demands “brings its own stress and strains” and he had wanted his departure date to be a surprise. He said: “I don’t think any leader should announce their departure. All that happens is your power fritters away. “So I think those people need new ideas and a new thought. I think I came with certain ideas and I hope they’ve been good ideas. But I think at times you need somebody with fresh ones, and I think if you’re not careful it’s really hard for your own staff to turn round and say, ‘You know, you’re really passionate as I am about things like automatic number plate recognition, but Grandad, things have moved on.’”
Tensions surfaced recently with Khan, who was elected in May, over the issue of spit hoods – pieces of fabric and mesh placed over detainees’ heads to stop them spitting at or biting officers. Khan put pressure on the Met to reverse a decision to introduce the hoods this month. The force was planning to deploy them in custody areas, but after the Guardian revealed the decision, the mayor’s team was unhappy because it had not been consulted. Hogan-Howe said last week he accepted there had been a lack of sensitivity over the decision and regretted that Khan had not been told. The mayor is supposed to oversee the Met, shaping its strategic priorities while not interfering in its operations. Hogan-Howe said: “This was our decision prior to the mayor and deputy mayor arriving. We didn’t raise it with the new mayor or deputy mayor. I’ve already acknowledged that probably, with retrospect, we didn’t anticipate the response because we didn’t think it was such a big issue. But clearly for people it has been.” Hogan-Howe became commissioner on 12 September 2011, after London had been hit by the worst riots in modern English history. Crime fell by 18% during most of his time in office, though some categories are now rising. His predecessor, Sir Paul Stephenson, was forced from the job as a result of the phone-hacking scandal, and before him, Sir Ian Blair quit after he was told he had lost Johnson’s confidence. Hogan-Howe’s biggest achievement may well have been to show that the job of Met commissioner is not impossible, even though it is beset by political hurdles. The last commissioner of the Met to complete their term was Sir John Stevens in 2005. Colleagues say Hogan-Howe is politically astute. To meet the big reduction in government funding, the Met will soon move out of its current headquarters to a new building. It has cut £600m from its budget and Hogan-Howe, after much deliberation, spoke out against the Conservative government that appointed him. Hogan-Howe was unpopular in some sections of the media for the pursuit of journalists over phone-hacking and bribery claims. He also faced calls to quit over Operation Midland, an inquiry into claims VIPs had abused children decades ago. The operation is alleged to have spiralled out of control and collapsed without unearthing evidence of guilt. One of those investigated, the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, said: “He will walk away with a barrow-load of pension funds. I am left destitute. Is there any wonder that I believe Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe should leave in shame and should have left many months ago? “He is a disgrace to the police force of Britain. He has wrought havoc on the Metropolitan Police Service, whose good reputation he and other senior officers have tarnished in the last few years.” Under Hogan-Howe’s tenure, the Met successfully policed the 2012 London Olympics, but the officer who oversaw the Games soon left the organisation because Hogan-Howe had a particular vision of whom he wanted in his top team. The Met is regarded as having done a good job in the face of the heightened terrorist threat, although the government has considered passing the responsibility to the relatively new National Crime Agency, an idea the Met has so far successfully resisted. Met staff morale hit record lows in 2014 but the force maintained officer numbers at 32,000 as it restructured and tried to adapt to the changing nature of crime, particularly cyber offences. Rudd, the home secretary, said: “Sir Bernard has had a long and distinguished career as a determined crimefighter and an inspirational senior officer. He has shown remarkable and consistent dedication to public service.”"
2016-09-30T09:11:11Z,uk-news,UK news,South Yorkshire police chief to take court action over calls to resign,"A legal battle has broken out after a chief constable was told to step down for comments he made after the inquest into the Hillsborough disaster, which some interpreted as continuing to place blame on fans at the match. The South Yorkshire police chief constable, David Crompton, is to challenge in court a decision by the force’s police and crime commissioner, Alan Billings, to remove him. Billings, who says he has the backing of families of those who lost their lives at Hillsborough, has faced criticism from the chief inspector of constabulary, Sir Tom Winsor, who called his decision irrational. The row focuses on a statement by Crompton a day after the conclusion of the inquest into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans on 15 April 1989, in which he accepted criticisms levelled at the force but said the failures had to be put into the context of “other contributory factors”. Some interpreted “other contributory factors” as meaning the behaviour of Liverpool fans, who were exonerated by the inquest jury, while Crompton and Winsor have said this was a reference to other parties involved, such as the ambulance service and local authority, who were also criticised. Billings and Winsor argued from their respective positions on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, during which Winsor told Billings his decision was mistaken and would be overturned in the high court. Billings said: “It’s not just me who read this statement in that way, the families read it in that way, the MPs read it in that way, local councillors read it in that way – on the day the statement was issued I was having phone calls and emails, someone actually came from Liverpool, one of the families, to see me on that day. They’re all reading in the way I read it.” Winsor responded: “He’s mistaken and the high court will correct him. The context was fully understood and taken into consideration. But Dr Billings is not firing the chief constable for anything other than three words in a press release, which could not fairly mean anything other than he was not blaming the fans.” Crompton was suspended in April, and on Thursday Billings called for the chief constable’s immediate resignation, saying the statement sought to justify questioning by the force’s legal team at the inquests “which touched on fan behaviour and caused the families distress”. Crompton issued a statement through his lawyers, which said: “I believe the use of section 38 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, by the police and crime commissioner for South Yorkshire, to be fundamentally wrong and I will shortly be commencing judicial review proceedings in the high court in order to challenge him.” After the Hillsborough inquest verdicts in April, Crompton read out an apology outside his Sheffield HQ. The following day, the chief constable issued a second statement. Billings said: “The chief constable’s statement sought to justify the questions asked at the inquests. This was something that I believed the public had already concluded was wrong.“The second statement made clear that the chief constable simply could not or would not see that the conduct of his legal team had caused distress to the families and that trying to justify the questioning simply added to that. “This was insensitive and it damaged both the force and the chief constable himself. It indicated that the leadership of South Yorkshire police had not learned the lessons of past failures, but was still more concerned with its own reputation than harm done to victims.” Crompton’s suspension in April came as South Yorkshire police found itself at the centre of a range of controversies, including the outcome of the Hillsborough inquest, the child sexual exploitation scandal in Rotherham, calls for a new inquiry into the so-called Battle of Orgreave and its investigation into Sir Cliff Richard. Crompton had already said he would retire in November. Billings has appointed Stephen Watson as his successor. Watson is currently running the force on a temporary basis."
2016-09-30T11:53:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Scotland survey shows greater acceptance of same-sex relationships,"Scotland has undergone a societal shift in its attitudes to same-sex relationships, especially among older people, while substantial pockets of prejudice remain towards the Traveller community and Muslim women who wear the veil. According to the latest tranche of data from the Scottish Social Attitudes survey – the most comprehensive and longest-standing study of its kind in Scotland – one of the most significant shifts was apparent in attitudes to gay and lesbian relationships, with the proportion who held the view that they are “not wrong at all” increasing from 29% in 2000 to 59% in 2015. This is largely influenced by a significant decline in negative attitudes among the over-65s.
By 2015, people reported that they were more unhappy for a close relative to marry or form a long-term relationship with a member of the Traveller community (32%) or someone who experiences depression (19%) than with someone of the same sex (16%). This large scale analysis of public attitudes to prejudice and discrimination, commissioned by the Scottish government and the Equality and Human Rights Commission and carried out by ScotCen Social Research, has been released every four to five years since it was founded in 1999. The proportion of people expressing concerns about the impact of immigration on the Scottish labour market, by those from ethnic minorities and from eastern Europe, saw a significant decline between 2010 and 2015, but just under a third continued to agree or agree strongly that immigration “takes jobs away from people in Scotland”. While only 5% of respondents in 2015 said they would be unhappy if a family member entered a relationship with a black or Asian person, opposition towards certain visible symbols of religion remained entrenched, with 65% agreeing that an employer should be able to insist that a Muslim woman remove her veil while at work, only reducing from 69% in 2010. Likewise, a fifth thought that an employer should be able to insist a Sikh man take off his turban at work, and 15% believed that a Christian woman should take off her crucifix. Although previous evidence from the survey had shown that people who knew someone from a minority ethnic group were less likely to hold discriminatory attitudes towards such people, the 2015 data revealed that one in five Scots still do not know someone from a different ethnic background. A little more than one in 10 do not know someone who is gay or lesbian, and 1% reported that they did not know anyone who is Muslim. The study also found a significant decrease in the proportion of people reporting that they did not know anyone with a mental health problem, down from a quarter in 2010 to 19% in 2015. Higher levels of prejudice remained towards Travellers, with 34% believing that a member of this community would be an unsuitable primary school teacher, compared with 20% who felt the same about someone who had undergone a sex change. Commenting on her findings, Susan Reid, research director at ScotCen Social Research, said: “Today’s findings show a marked decline in levels of prejudice towards lesbian and gay people in Scotland since we last asked in 2010. A large part of this is down to a significant decline in negative attitudes among the over-65s. “Although older people are still more likely to express prejudiced views, the age gap has narrowed since 2010. This is a positive step towards a more inclusive Scotland. However, our research still shows relatively high levels of prejudice towards some groups in society, such as people who cross-dress, those who have undergone gender reassignment and Gypsy/Travellers.”"
2016-09-30T12:46:52Z,uk-news,UK news,"Met commissioner must have police background, federation says","The next Metropolitan police commissioner must have a background in policing to retain the confidence of rank-and-file officers, the chair of the force’s police federation has said. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe announced on Thursday his retirement from the most senior policing role in Britain, triggering the search for a new commissioner. Speculation as to who will fill the position began instantly, with a report in the Times suggesting Sir Charles Montgomery – the head of the Border Force who was the second sea lord when he retired from the navy in 2012 – is being considered as a successor. But Ken Marsh, the chair of the Metropolitan Police Federation, the regional branch of the body that represents thousands of rank-and-file officers, said the next Met chief must have climbed the ranks to succeed in the role. “This isn’t an easy gig that you can just walk into,” Marsh said. “I believe, I firmly believe, you have to have a firm footing, or an understanding of what takes place in the lower ranks all the way through. That’s how you have the opportunity and bring everyone together, which is what you need to do as a commissioner.” Marsh said he did not think the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who are responsible for appointing the commissioner, would recruit from outside policing “in a month of Sundays”. “It would be controversial, but I don’t think they will.” Marsh said it would not be appropriate for the commissioner to be recruited from overseas, which is an option open to all forces after regulations were changed under the previous home secretary, Theresa May. “I would like to see someone internally or close to us because they will understand what they’re talking about,” Marsh said. Hogan-Howe completed a full five-year term earlier this month – the first Metropolitan police commissioner not to be ousted in a decade – and was expected to continue for another year after having his contract extended. He will now retire in February 2017. News of his departure came ahead of the release next month of a report into the Met’s handling of historical sex abuse cases, which is expected to be critical, though probably not of the commissioner. Among those who may apply for the £276,000-a-year post is Mark Rowley, an assistant commissioner of the Met who oversees counter-terrorism.

2016-09-30T13:58:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Ben Needham: Kos dig interrupted after ancient graves found,"The search for toddler Ben Needham on the Greek island of Kos has resumed after the owner of the land being excavated raised concerns about the dig, which has unearthed an ancient burial site. The landowner, Stefanos Troumouhis, was reportedly concerned he would not be able to farm the land if it was deemed a site of archaeological interest. Police said Troumouhis had asked them to stop the dig, but his concerns about the ancient tombs had been resolved and the search would continue as planned. DI Jon Cousins, of South Yorkshire police, said the presence of the tombs would not interfere with the search, which was “back to normal”.
Forensic specialists and an archaeologist have been combing an arid stretch of farmland where 21-month-old Ben was playing a quarter of a century ago, in the hope of finding clues about his disappearance. Masses of soil has been excavated and experts have been working through the soil by hand looking for fragments of Ben’s clothes. The excavation began after information was handed to police suggesting that the Sheffield toddler might have been crushed by a digger near a farmhouse his grandparents were renovating. Konstantinos Barkas, also known as Dino, was clearing land with an excavator close to where Ben was playing on the day he vanished and may have inadvertently caused the death, a friend of the builder told police after a TV appeal in May. Barkas reportedly died of stomach cancer last year. His widow, Varvara, has strongly dismissed any suggestions he might have killed Ben."
2016-09-30T15:01:20Z,uk-news,UK news,New reality for Summertown as hunt continues for schoolgirl's attackers,"Glancing down a leafy residential street in Oxford in the direction of the junction from where a 14-year-old schoolgirl was abducted in broad daylight, the look of dread was all too evident on the face of one local mother. “Of course we’re worried,” said the woman, who happened to have been passing the spot at around the same time on Wednesday. On Thursday evening she had sat down with her own daughter, who is eight, to have the conversation that every parent fears. “We told her that if anyone tries to force you into a car then you should bite, kick, scream … basically just do anything that it takes to raise the alarm.” Such is the new reality on the streets of Oxford’s Summertown area, where the hunt for two men who raped the 14-year-old in a car after abducting her on her way to school entered its third day.
Thames Valley police are appealing for witnesses after the victim was found at midday on Wednesday knocking on doors in the Marston area of the city. Police said the girl was extremely traumatised by her ordeal and was unable to provide a description of her attackers, other than that they were white men whom she did not know. According to police, the key to the investigation is the silver car used in the abduction, possibly a Volkswagen hatchback. Members of the public who were in the Banbury Road area at around 8.25am have been urged to come forward with any footage from car dashcams or cycle helmet cams. A busy road running through one of the city’s most prosperous areas, there would have been no shortage of pedestrians on either side, although early-morning traffic would have been in abundance around the car used by the men, one of whom was said to have hugged the victim before she was dragged inside. An increase in the police presence was palpable on Friday as uniformed officers occasionally cruised by in vans. Schoolchildren have been told to travel in groups.
The street leading to the school involved could not have been calmer on late Friday morning. Save for dog walkers, the only sign of activity was the occasional cleaner or gardener coming out of gated mansions, many of which have CCTV cameras. Chris Price, the headteacher of one local school, the Cherwell school, praised pupils on Thursday for their response to the incident. “Most of you will, by now, be aware of the reports of the abduction of and sexual assault on a schoolgirl in Oxford yesterday morning,” he said in a message to parents. “Given these circumstances I thought it important to write to you again at the end of a day which has been worrying for all of us. I wanted to stress how sensible our students have been – they showed great maturity and made the most of their learning as usual.” Pupils were not in class on Friday, an inset day. Price promised they would receive regular advice in tutor time and assemblies.
Andrew Gant, a local Liberal Democrat councillor, said a strong sense of community was a feature of the area. “We have our fair share of burglaries, and things like bicycle thefts are a perennial problem here in north Oxford, but in general there’s a sense that this is a safe place,” he said. “My own daughter attended a school very near there and has walked up and down that road for the whole of her school life. It’s just one of those moments of the day where you would assume everything is going to be fine. That’s why this is so shocking. “It’s a very busy road between two big schools and this would have taken place at a time when hundreds of children would have been going on their way. At 8.25am in broad daylight, it’s unthinkable.”"
2016-09-30T16:07:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Scotland rushes to plug Â£400m funding gap after projects breach EU rules,"Scottish ministers have cut £400m from their spending plans after four privately financed building projects, including two new hospitals, ran foul of European Union spending rules. Ministers were forced to reclassify the funding of a new children’s hospital in Edinburgh, an acute hospital in Dumfries and a new blood transfusion service headquarters as public projects after the Office of National Statistics said the Scottish government’s private financing model breached EU rules. Ministers shifted the three projects onto the public accounts after the ONS ruled last year that one of the government’s biggest projects, the £1.45bn Aberdeen western peripheral route (AWPR) bypass, was not truly a private project due to the high level of government control. The ONS has yet to rule formally on whether the two hospitals and the blood transfusion service HQ breach the same EU rules. However, they are all built under the same private finance system devised by the Scottish Futures Trust – a government quango – so the Scottish government has pre-empted the anticipated ONS decision. Caroline Gardner, Scotland’s auditor general, said in this year’s Scottish government consolidated accounts that putting these projects onto the public accounts had led to a cut in capital and day-to-day spending of £283m last year and £109m in 2014-15, totaling £392m.
That £283m lost last year effectively wiped out the first tranche of the Scottish government’s new capital borrowing powers, agreed under the Scotland Act 2012. Gardner disclosed that Scottish ministers will need to find further capital funds to cover future capital spending on all four projects, as well as finance the capital projects which were postponed to help balance their overall budget. The full lifetime costs of the three health service projects are expected to reach more than £1bn in capital borrowing, interest and service charges, according to Scottish government forecasts. Their capital costs are put at £395m, plus a capital cost of £469m for the AWPR. Gardner said the unexpected capital charge caused a direct reduction in the cash available to ministers in Edinburgh for other projects. In order to make up for other shortfalls, they also had to: release contingency funds for the new Firth of Forth bridge, currently behind schedule; reduce planned loans to Scottish Water, which is publicly controlled; and postpone uncommitted grants. In a parallel development, the Scottish government is drafting new legislation to prevent future borrowing for new social housing being put on the public accounts after social housing debt also ran foul of the same EU regulations. The ONS said on Thursday that £4.5bn worth of Scottish housing debt counted as public debt, as did such borrowing in Wales and Northern Ireland. The move follows a similar ruling for English social housing borrowing made last year. The Treasury has told Scottish ministers that £4.5bn will not be added to the Scottish government books. Officials in Edinburgh admitted, however, they did not yet know whether the ONS would agree that the new legislation would satisfy the EU regulations. Gardner said that overall the Scottish government’s accounts, which covered total spending of £37bn, were healthy and well-managed. She said ministers were improving the transparency and authority of their budgets now that Holyrood has substantial new tax and welfare powers worth around £15bn. However, she added that ministers had yet to publish the more detailed public sector accounts required under the terms of the fiscal framework deal with the UK government earlier this year. “While recent developments show the Scottish government is heading in the right direction, there’s much still to do to ensure that the Scottish parliament, and the public, have the information they need to fully understand and scrutinise the implementation of the new powers, especially the new tax and spending choices,” she said. Gardner revealed, however, that ministers had lost £14m from the EU after bungling structural funds rules for business growth and skills packages. It also faced further financial penalties after a new £178m IT system for farm subsidies was badly botched."
2016-09-30T16:58:38Z,uk-news,UK news,"UK must protect EU crime prevention links, NCA says","Law enforcement chiefs have urged the government to ensure cross-border crime prevention measures are not jeopardised by Brexit negotiations, it has emerged. The director general and deputy director general of the National Crime Agency said they asked ministers to protect Britain’s arrangements with Europe, including use of the European arrest warrant and membership of Europol, amid concerns about the impact of leaving the union. Membership of the EU gives the NCA and UK police forces access to tools which allow them to share intelligence quickly and efficiently with European counterparts. Lynne Owens, the NCA’s director general, said at a briefing on Friday that the agency had approached the Home Office and Brexit department to raise its concerns. “We’ve been describing what we need to be in place post-Brexit,” she said. “We’re absolutely clear the policy decisions are not for us but we need to be spelling out the operational case. “In bluntest form, we must be able to continue to exchange intelligence and we must be able to understand the movement of criminals and criminal behaviour across international borders. We are supplying that information to the Home Office and it’s for them to make the policy negotiation.” Before the 23 June referendum, Owens said a vote to leave the EU could put efforts to fight crime at risk. Her deputy, David Armond, said on Friday that a “substantial paper” on the current arrangements had been compiled by the NCA, which has a broad remit, to tackle serious and organised crime, cybercrime and child sexual exploitation. “We’re coming up with a strong operational case for why those arrangements are necessary,” he said. “Obviously [Brexit] is a concern and we are all over this and contributing quite significantly.” He said the NCA was considering alternatives measures if the UK was no longer able to use those in Europe. “It won’t be easy. But Europeans need us as much as we need them, probably more so.” Armond said he was confident the negotiations would deliver the right outcome. “I cannot envisage a situation where we cannot continue to do business with our European partners,” he said. “It’s important for all of our security in protecting our citizens.” He said the European arrest warrant, which allows police forces to request the detention and extradition of an offender, would be a particular “tricky” issue. “If we can’t stay in that we’ve got to negotiate a series of new treaties with overseas territories about what extradition will look like.”
Theresa May argued strongly in favour of the European arrest warrant when she was home secretary. Rejoining the warrant, which also allows for swift extradition of foreign offenders in the UK was put to a vote in 2014, ahead of which May said it was a vital tool for keeping Britons safe. Europol, the EU’s law enforcement agency, helps member states fight serious international crime and terrorism. Before the referendum, former security chiefs, including the former head of MI5 Lady Manningham-Buller, and the former head of MI6 Sir John Sawers, said that voting remain was in the best interests of the country’s security. Asked if law enforcement officials did enough before the referendum to argue the case to remain, Owens said there was a concern that security chiefs would be seen as “political animals”."
2016-09-30T17:47:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Giving a big thumbs-up to the lost art of hitchhiking,"Like Anne Perkins, I used to hitch everywhere as a teenager and in my twenties (Hitchhiking has been left by the roadside, 22 September ). That was in the 1960s. I have often wondered why people appear to hitch no more. Is it because no one is willing these days to give a lift, or is it for some other reason? A few years ago I decided on an experiment. I would see if I could travel from Wigan to Lindisfarne on my thumb. So I set off on a slip road to the M6. Within two minutes the police arrived to say this was not allowed. So I took the train to Lancaster to try my luck on the lovely A7 border road towards Berwick. I used to think in terms of, on average, getting a lift within twenty minutes. And I was in luck: two young Australian tourists took me a good part of the journey to Hawick. Then by two more short lifts from local people I got within walking distance of my destination. So, it does not seem as if drivers have changed so much. Maybe if M-way slip roads could be redesigned with a space where it is permitted to thumb and for vehicles to stop and give lifts this would enable a return to this most sociable and humane way of getting about – one that I found to be quite safe. Roger Gibbard Wigan • We hitchhiked around New Zealand for a month in 1978 and experienced incredible kindness from drivers, including food and overnight stays and hardly ever waited very long for lifts. It is sad that this may have changed. On the positive side we have recently hitched in Spain, France and the UK when very tired at the end of long hikes. Having grey hair and being in our 60s means we still get lifts very easily. Alison Griffies Bristol • Most students hitched in the past though it was known to be risky, and slow. Standing by a road near Beziers in July 1968, hitching to Morocco, it was hot and I’d been trying for hours. A big Merc pulled up. Inside were four Spanish monks who, having walked to Rome on pilgrimage, were driving back. They gave me a lift to the monastery of Montserrat near Barcelona where I was given lodging in a small white room, with wine, food and a lift next day to the Malaga road. Chris Hardy London • In the seventies I did my fair share of hitchhiking when it was largely resorted to by youngsters and the odd bloke holding trade plates. A few months ago, en route to Luton airport to catch the last plane to Kraków to attend a funeral, the minicab pulled over, smoke pouring from the engine. Just a few miles up the M1 and desperate, I started walking along the hard shoulder and stuck my thumb out. Within a couple of minutes, a car pulled over and the young man at the wheel said he’d be delighted to take me to the airport. Wonderful and on my 62nd birthday!

Giving evidence in court, Tom Angus recalled how he had produced an internal review in 2007 focused on 38 struggling businesses, each of which had received “irregular” loans and which together owed the bank £375m. All 38 were supervised by senior banker Lynden Scourfield and had a relationship with Quayside Corporate Services, a small turnaround consultancy run by former banker David Mills. Twenty-seven of them were expected to leave the bank with a loss estimated at £266m, while the remaining 11 could add further losses of £22m. After his review, Angus had been left with “the clear impression that Lynden [Scourfield, a senior BoS banker] had been agreeing substantial amounts of credit to distressed companies … completely outwith his authority and without any authorisation from [his bosses] Paul Burnett or Hugh McMillan.” Mills, his wife, and three associates, including Michael Bancroft – together with a second BoS banker, Mark Dobson – have variously pleaded not guilty to charges relating to the alleged corruption between 2003 and 2007. Scourfield, meanwhile, is not on trial and the jury have been instructed not to speculate on the reasons for this. A month after Angus’s 2007 review, Scourfield was confronted with the findings and suspended for gross misconduct. He left Bank of Scotland shortly afterwards. It was not until October 2009, however, that the City regulator, now called the Financial Conduct Authority, ordered detailed explanations from Bank of Scotland, which by then was part of Lloyds Banking Group. In response, Lloyds commissioned an independent investigation to be carried out by accountancy group Deloitte. This resulted in a formal report to the FCA which was, in turn, referred to Thames Valley police for criminal investigation in May 2010. Two months later, Lloyds wrote off £250m from its impaired assets division, which included Scourfield’s loan portfolio. Of that sum, £245m related to bank customers under Scourfield’s management. Setting out the prosecution’s case earlier this week, Brian O’Neill QC told the jury: “Some other employees of the bank do not emerge well from the investigation, most particularly Paul Burnett, who was Scourfield’s immediate line manager. There is little doubt that his lack of oversight was partly responsible for Scourfield’s ability to act in the way that he did and for as long as he did.” He told the court Burnett could have identified concerns earlier had he paid closer attention to loan spreadsheets sent to him. “[He] lost his position at the bank as a result of his failures as a manager. However, there is no evidence that Burnett … was complicit in the corrupt agreement.” O’Neill conceded: “Some of the bank’s systems and processes undoubtedly contributed to Scourfield’s ability to behave dishonestly. This was a case of him exploiting systemic and personnel weaknesses which he knew to exist, not a case of the bank turning a knowing blind eye to his lending excesses.” The trial continues."
