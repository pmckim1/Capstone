2021-03-03T22:00:28Z,uk-news,UK news,"Kremlin agents targeting Russians in UK, MI5 warns ","MI5 has quietly stepped up the security protection offered to potential Kremlin targets living in the UK in the aftermath of the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in 2018. The security agency warned that the Russian state continues to take “quite an active interest” in a handful of individuals in the UK, prompting the need to take more active measures involving the police and other agencies. The disclosure emerged in a rare interview given by two senior MI5 officers to Sky News, one of whom, known only as Tom, is responsible for running the domestic spy agency’s Russian counter-espionage desk. “The reason we have a very developed understanding of the people at risk and the mitigations that I’ve described in place is because we know that the Russian state continues to take an interest in people here who we deem to be at risk,” said Tom, who was speaking off camera. “And that’s not a passive interest. It’s quite an active interest. So we think that they are probably still trying to collect information about people. To what end? It’s not immediately apparent, but we’re not going to take any risks of finding out that the intelligence that they’ve been collecting has been towards some kind of physical attack,” the senior officer added. Both MI5 and Downing Street are under pressure to show they are taking the threat from Russia seriously. Last year it and the other UK spy agencies were accused of taking their “eye off the ball” when it came to the threat posed by the Kremlin in the highly critical Russia report produced by parliament’s intelligence and security committee. Publication of the highly critical report was delayed by Boris Johnson until after the election, partly to avoid negative coverage about whether Kremlin disinformation had an impact on the Brexit vote in 2016. But since then No 10 has sought to ramp up the pressure again, last year sanctioning a group of Kremlin officials accused of being involved in the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The number of people now under enhanced protection runs into double figures and the agency will not list any names. But those deemed to be at risk are likely to include former agents such as Skripal and other formerly well connected Russians, as well as non-Russian nationals who are deemed serious irritants to the Kremlin. Advice given is tailored to each individual and ranges from simple security advice to making physical changes around their property and movements – as well as providing direct police support, the agents added. MI5 believes the Kremlin is eager to rebuild its spying capabilities in the UK – after their agents were expelled from the embassy following the Salisbury attack. But, the agents said, the Russian agencies are particularly interested in developing assets outside the embassy, using individuals posing as “journalists or academics or tourists”. The MI5 officers also admitted that the British agency was at first stunned by the brazenness of the attack on the Skripals. “We probably hadn’t calculated just how determined and ruthless our adversary might be,” Tom said. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with the novichok nerve agent smuggled into the UK in a modified perfume bottle by agents from Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU. It was the agency where Sergei had once worked, although both survived the attack. “This was intended potentially as a message to the UK government. So this was less about carrying out an attack than it was about sending a message both to the individual people in the GRU with whom he would have worked and to the UK government in general,” Tom added. A third person, Dawn Sturgess, died in July 2018 after the discarded bottle was recovered by her partner thinking it would make a gift."
2021-03-03T21:13:27Z,uk-news,UK news,"Spend now, pay later: Sunak flags major tax rises as Covid bill tops ","Rishi Sunak has told Britain’s businesses and millions of middle-earners they will pay the price of the government’s year long fight against Covid-19 with a spend now, pay later budget that combines life-support for the economy with the biggest tax increases since 1993. Delivering his second budget, the chancellor said he would “go long,” extending many economic support measures, including the furlough scheme, until the end of September at a cost to the Treasury of £65bn. But Sunak insisted that two years in which the budget deficit would be the highest in peacetime history meant he had no choice but to freeze personal tax allowances and raise corporation tax from 19% to 25% in one jump in 2023. Repeatedly stressing the devastating financial impact of the pandemic, Sunak used the word “honest” six times, as he underscored the need to “begin fixing the public finances”. “Our economy has shrunk by 10% – the largest fall in over 300 years. Our borrowing is the highest it has been outside wartime. It’s going to take this country – and the whole world – a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation,” he warned. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility, said the economy would bounce back rapidly from its latest pandemic-induced lock down and pencilled in growth of 7.3% next year – the fastest rate of expansion since the second world war. It said output would recover the ground lost during the pandemic by mid-2022 – six months earlier than previously expected – and cut its forecast for the peak in unemployment from 7.5% to 6.5%.
Even so, the long-term damage from Covid-19 would leave the economy 3% smaller in five years’ time than it would otherwise have been, leaving a hole in the public finances for the chancellor to fill. Sunak announced that the personal tax-free allowance and the higher rate threshold will be frozen from April 2022, instead of rising in line with inflation, bringing 1.3m people into the tax system and creating a million higher rate taxpayers by the middle of the decade. In addition, Sunak became the first chancellor since Denis Healey in the 1970s to raise the corporation tax rate – reversing at a stroke most of the cuts made by George Osborne after 2010. Sunak said in the next two years business investment would be boosted by a new “super deduction”, which will allow companies to offset 130% of the cost of capital investment against tax. The £25bn tax break would boost investment by 10%, or £20bn a year, he added. “These are significant decisions to have taken. Decisions no chancellor wants to make. I recognise they might not be popular. But they are honest,” Sunak said. With the OBR noting that tax revenues as a share of economic output were on course to hit 35% – the highest since Roy Jenkins was Labour chancellor in the late 1960s – Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, said the budget represented a new phase in the UK’s economic history.
“Sunak made much of his desire to be honest and to level with the British people” Johnson said. “The fact that he felt constrained to raise taxes by hitting companies and through freezing allowances, rather than through more explicit rises in people’s taxes, suggests there are limits to how far he wants to level with us as he attempts to raise the overall tax burden to its highest sustained level in history.” Tony Danker, the CBI’s director-general said: “The super deduction should be a real catalyst for firms to green light investment decisions. The boldness of the Chancellor on this measure is to be admired. “But moving Corporation Tax to 25% in one leap will cause a sharp intake of breath for many businesses and sends a worrying signal to those planning to invest in the UK.” Although the government’s road map envisages restrictions on the economy being lifted by June, Sunak said he would show caution by extending Treasury support beyond the summer. Businesses in the hospitality, retail and leisure sectors – the most adversely affected by the restrictions – will have a reduced rate of VAT for another year, while the stamp duty holiday will be extended until the end of September. Labour leader Keir Starmer said his party would back the corporation tax increase; but accused Sunak of “papering over the cracks,” by failing to fix many of the problems exposed by the pandemic. Highlighting Sunak’s failure to set out fresh support for social care or the NHS, Starmer told the Commons, “this is a budget that didn’t even attempt to rebuild the foundations of our economy. Or to secure the country’s long-term prosperity. Instead it did the job the chancellor always intended: a quick fix. Papering over the cracks. “The party opposite spent a decade weakening the foundations of our economy,” he added. “Now they pretend they can rebuild it. But the truth is: they won’t confront what went wrong in the past and they have no plan for the future.” LibDem leader Ed Davey echoed Starmer’s criticism of the lack of a plan to tackle the crisis in social care, which Johnson promised to resolve on his first day in Downing Street in 2019. “Of all the holes in the budget possibly the most damaging is the lack of new money and new ideas for the care sector,” said Davey. “Even before the pandemic the social care sector was on its knees – and Tories seem to have no interest whatsoever in fixing the glaring issues. In total, the Treasury now estimates that the government will have spent £407bn over the period of the pandemic – but the independent Office for Budget Responsibility pointed out that there was no allowance for pandemic-related spending after next year despite the road map recognising that annual vaccination programmes and continued testing and tracing were likely to be required. “The government will also need to decide how to catch up on services disrupted by the virus, notably the backlogs in non-urgent procedures in the NHS that have built up and the months of lost or impaired schooling for some pupils,” the OBR added. “Faced with these post-pandemic pressures, the government has so far cut more than £15 billion a year from departmental resource spending from 2022-23 onwards, setting up a challenging Spending Review later this year.” Asked about the issue at a Downing Street press conference, Sunak said he did not, “have a crystal ball”, adding: “Obviously, at this moment, we don’t know exactly the future path of what’s going to happen, but what we do know is that this year there’s an enormous amount of call for extra funding for coronavirus.”"
2021-03-03T20:57:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Rishi Sunak's £65bn budget tax increases are highest in 28 years,"Rishi Sunak has announced the highest tax increases since Norman Lamont 28 years ago, with a £65bn raid on household incomes and company profits. In a budget that reversed more than a decade of tax cuts by successive Tory governments and was even tougher than George Osborne’s post 2010-election austerity package, the chancellor announced tough action to reduce government borrowing. Sunak said he needed to freeze allowances on incomes and pension pots from next year to balance the books, in a move that will mean millions paying more tax.
The increase in corporation tax from 19% to 25% in 2023 would mark the first attack on company profits since the Labour chancellor Denis Healey raised corporation tax in 1974 in the wake of the three-day week. Sunak said the shift to higher corporate taxes was fair because it would only hit those companies that had done well through the pandemic. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said: “It’s right that corporation tax isn’t rising this year or next. Of course, in the long run corporation tax should go up. “The decade-long corporation tax experiment by this government has failed. But no taxes should have been raised in the teeth of this economic crisis.” Starmer said a £2bn council tax rise from April that will add 5% to annual bills was another increase that the government should scrap. Chris Sanger, the head of tax policy at EY, described the budget as “three years of support, followed by three years (and more) of pain”. Sanger added that the chancellor will hope that the recovery in tax receipts is stronger and spending lower, so he can abandon the planned tax increases. “Time [is] the chancellor’s friend in his aim of replenishing the government’s coffers.” The decision to freeze personal income tax allowances from April 2022 until 2026 “represents a clear tax rise for all taxpayers over the coming years,” said the accountants Blick Rothenberg. Sunak said in his speech that he was not hiding the changes, adding: “I am here, explaining it to the House, and it is in the budget document in black and white.” The moves mean the chancellor can argue he has stuck to the 2019 Conservative manifesto pledge of no increases to rates of income tax, national insurance or VAT, and he said of the move to freeze personal tax thresholds: “Nobody’s take-home pay will be less than it is now as a result of this policy.” Under the rules, the first £12,500 of an individual’s income is free of tax, and this is called the personal allowance. Income between £12,500 and £50,000 is taxed at 20%, while above that, each additional pound of income is taxed at 40%, up to earnings of £150,000, when the rate goes up to 45%. Normally the thresholds would be expected to rise by at least inflation, but the government has said the personal allowance will rise as planned to £12,570 from April this year and then stay frozen at that level until April 2026. Similarly, the £50,000 higher-rate threshold will rise to £50,270 from April and then stay there until spring 2026. The Treasury’s budget documents show that these two moves will cost taxpayers more than £8bn a year by 2025-26. The Institute for Fiscal Studies played down the significance of the tax rise, saying the personal allowance had risen by almost 60% in real terms over the past decade, reducing income tax revenue by “an eye-watering £25bn a year”. It meant that 40% of adults do not pay any income tax. “The planned freeze, representing a 7% real-terms cut, undoes only a small share of that rise, and brings another 1.3 million people into the income tax system,” the tax and spending watchdog said. But Laith Khalaf, a financial analyst at the investment firm AJ Bell, said that freezing these allowances “will collectively cost taxpayers £19bn over the next five years. It will slowly but surely mean that from 2022, millions of people will pay more income tax, without the government actually adjusting the headline rate.” Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was a “relatively stealthy way” to suck many hundreds of thousands of people into paying income tax, and then hundreds of thousands more into paying the higher rate. The chancellor also decided to freeze the pensions “lifetime allowance” at its current level of £1,073,100 until April 2026, when it would normally increase every year in line with inflation. An individual will usually pay tax if their pension pot is worth more than the lifetime allowance. Freezing it for five years will raise an estimated total of £1bn for the Treasury.
If an individual’s pension fund is worth more than the allowance, the government will tax everything above that amount at 55% if they take it as a lump sum, or 25% if they take the money another way. PIMFA, a trade association for wealth management and investment firms, said freezing the allowance until 2026 “penalises pension savers looking to secure their future and, in the most extreme cases, sees people left with no choice but to give up work”. The government also froze until 2026 the thresholds for inheritance tax and the annual exempt amount for capital gains tax, which it was predicted would together raise a further £1bn."
2021-03-03T20:20:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Sunak extends support for self-employed but critics say millions miss out,"Government support for self-employed people has been extended until the end of the summer but the chancellor is facing fresh criticism over a scheme that critics say will still leave millions of workers without support. Grants for those whose earnings have been hit by the coronavirus pandemic will last until September, taking the overall cost to more than £32bn. Rishi Sunak announced two more self-employment income support scheme (SEISS) grants in Wednesday’s budget, to follow the three that have been awarded since the start of the pandemic.
Applicants for the fourth SEISS grant – covering the period from February to April – will be able to claim 80% of their average trading profits over a three-month period, paid in one lump sum capped at £7,500. They can claim from the end of April and must have filed a tax return for the 2019-20 tax year to be eligible. The value of a fifth and final grant, to cover the period from May to September, will be determined by a “turnover test”, the chancellor said, on the basis that support should be offered to those who need it most. People whose turnover has fallen by 30% or more will continue to receive the full grant worth 80% of three months’ average trading profits, capped at £7,500. Anyone whose turnover has fallen by less than 30% will receive a 30% grant, capped at £2,850. The final grant can be claimed from late July. The scheme has cost £19.7bn so far, with the nearly £12.8bn cost of the fourth and fifth grants taking the total to £32.5bn. The Treasury said 2.7 million people had received help from SEISS, unveiled in March 2020, adding that 600,000 may be newly eligible, including those who became self-employed just before the first lockdown, during the 2019-20 tax year. Sunak said the scheme was “one of the most generous programmes for self-employed people anywhere in the world”. But critics have said the policy excludes up to 3 million people who do not qualify for support and that the size of the grant scheduled for this summer has been exaggerated. The Resolution Foundation thinktank estimates that two-thirds of self-employed people are not eligible under the SEISS criteria. Mike Clancy, the general secretary of the Prospect trade union, said: “This budget hides yet another sleight of hand for self-employed workers. Despite promising to help freelancers, today’s announcement means that financial help for self-employed workers will run out two months before support to employees. “Throughout the crisis the self-employed have been treated as second-class citizens and this budget continues that approach with less support, more red tape, and the continued exclusion of many thousands.
“Fully backing the self-employed is not only a moral imperative, it makes sound economic sense to secure the recovery. Unfortunately in this budget the chancellor has given with one hand and taken away with the other.” Mubin Haq, the chief executive of the financial wellbeing charity Standard Life Foundation, said: “Whilst it’s welcome more of the self-employed will now be able to claim the SEISS grant […] this still leaves over 3 million people who have experienced a drop in income unsupported by the schemes.” “Too many excluded for the past year, far too many facing severe hardship.”"
2021-03-03T20:09:25Z,uk-news,UK news,EU says plan to extend Brexit grace period breaks international law,"The British government has been accused of breaking international law for a second time by the European commission after ministers said the UK would unilaterally act to give Northern Ireland businesses time to adapt to post-Brexit rules. In a damning statement, Maroš Šefčovič, the vice-president of the commission, said a move announced by Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis to exempt goods coming from Great Britain from checks amounted to a “violation” of the withdrawal agreement. “This is the second time that the UK government is set to breach international law,” the statement said. “This also constitutes a clear departure from the constructive approach that has prevailed up until now.” Lewis announced a “new operation plan” for sending goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland to the Commons on Wednesday. The UK has asked for a two-year extension to all grace periods for Irish Sea border checks including those on food, parcels, plants and medicines, but so far Brussels has resisted. Lewis said the government had to act to protect the interests of Northern Ireland and keep shelves stocked. “We are taking forward a series of further temporary operational steps which reflect the simple reality that there is more time needed to adapt and implement new requirements as we continue our discussions with the EU,” he said. The commission said it had not been informed of the decision in advance of Lewis informing parliament and suggested the move would be a hammer-blow to trust between the two sides after an already bruising period. The two sides have been seeking to rebuild relations on the joint committee responsible for implementing the withdrawal agreement, although Michael Gove has recently been replaced by Lord Frost, the former Brexit trade negotiator, who has a record for upsetting the EU side with his robust stance. It was Lewis who told the Commons last year that the government intended to break international law in a “limited and specific way” in the later ditched internal market bill overriding parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. The decision then drew outcry, including a warning from the then US presidential hopeful Joe Biden about the need to respect the Good Friday Agreement. The commission statement said: “It is equally disappointing that the UK government has resorted to such unilateral action without informing the EU’s co-chair of the joint committee. Issues relating to the Protocol should be dealt with through the structures provided for by the Withdrawal Agreement.
Šefčovič later spoke to Frost on Wednesday evening to inform the British cabinet minister that the EU would “respond to these developments in accordance with the legal means established by the Withdrawal Agreement and the Trade and Cooperation Agreement”. According to a readout issued by Downing Street of the call between the pair, Frost had described the measures as “well precedented” and “entirely consistent with our intention to discharge our obligations under the protocol in good faith”. A UK government spokesperson said: “Lord Frost explained that the measures announced today, following official-level notification to the commission earlier this week, were temporary technical steps, which largely continued measures already in place, to provide more time for businesses such as supermarkets and parcel operators to adapt to and implement the new requirements in the protocol.” The row is a remarkable new battle over the Northern Ireland protocol, the part of the Brexit deal that keeps Northern Ireland a part of the EU’s single market for goods. Boris Johnson threw his weight behind the announcement and told MPs Northern Ireland’s position within the UK internal market was “rock-solid and guaranteed”. He said the government would reinforce that with operational “easings” to protect food supplies and other areas, pending further discussions with the EU. Checks on goods arriving from Great Britain have disrupted supply chains and triggered protests from Northern Ireland’s unionist parties, which say the protocol undermines the region’s status in the UK. EU and British leaders have held talks to ameliorate disruption but failed to break the impasse. Last week, both sides pledged to reach a “pragmatic solution”, with the UK agreeing to develop new plans to respond to problems with supermarket supplies. Lewis’s statement to the Commons made no mention of the EU agreement but later said he would hold an informal meeting with Šefčovič. Grace periods have delayed full application of checks. The first of those periods is to expire at the end of March, which will trigger more stringent checks on food and parcels and probably louder protests from unionists.
The Northern Ireland Retail Consortium welcomed the news. “We welcome the extension of the grace periods in both time and scope, even if it is unilaterally, to allow us to continue to give NI households the choice and affordability.” Disruption to supermarket and parcel deliveries and the continued refusal of some high street chains to deliver in Northern Ireland have heightened tensions among loyalists and unionist parties who have vowed a campaign of peaceful resistance. The DUP agriculture minister, Gordon Lyons, has halted work on permanent post-Brexit border control posts in Northern Ireland. Existing temporary border posts continue to operate."
2021-03-03T20:06:42Z,uk-news,UK news,What do local business leaders think about Liverpool becoming a freeport?,"Liverpool was among eight English locations picked for a new freeport launched by the chancellor at the budget, as part of the government’s levelling-up agenda and to boost the economy after Brexit. The Guardian spoke to local business leaders – brought together by Liverpool Chamber of Commerce on two Zoom meetings – before and after the budget, to gauge reaction on Merseyside to the announcement and other tax and spending measures. Sean Keyes, managing director, Sutcliffe, civil engineers “The freeport is the best news for our region. It’s the opportunities created around the edges, with development sites. It might mean more housing or other types of industry, helping kickstart other projects. It’s a big thumbs up from the construction industry.” “The corporation tax rise is a negative. It works out about £1,000 per person we’re employing, that’s the extra it will cost us.” Sue Weir, chief executive, Medicash Healthcare “I think it was very fair. Some of the concerns for Liverpool city centre as a visitor economy were addressed, with business rates, support for hospitality and furlough.” “The corporation tax rise was fair. To be honest with you I don’t think any of us wouldn’t have expected that rise to come through.” Rob Aitken, partner, RSM, accountants “I’d have liked to see more northern infrastructure investment. Setting up a bank in Leeds is great and £12bn sounds a lot, but it’s a long way before that money starts hitting us in the north-west. I’d have liked more urgency about that. The recovery of the economy is linked to the recovery of the North.” “The investment super deduction should turbocharge investment. ” Liam Jones, founder, Foursquare Group, business consultants “We wanted the excluded 2.5 million individuals to be specifically addressed, which has not happened. There are plenty of freelancers in our network who are very disappointed with what’s been said today. But for the whole economy it feels a pretty fair budget. ” Julie Palmer, regional managing partner, Begbies Traynor, accountants “The nice thing is he’s given a roadmap about where we’re going [on corporation tax]. There’s quite a lot of breathing space to kickstart yourself out of this. In a sense if you start making good profits to pay the tax you can afford to do it by then. It’s a little bit like a wartime situation. It’s difficult, but surviving the period out of the war is twice as difficult. That will be the difficulty for business owners.” Faye Dyer, deputy chief executive, Liverpool Arena and Convention Centre “We very much welcome the extension to the furlough scheme which will enable us to continue to support our talented team. However, we remain dismayed at the lack of any sector specific grant funding for the business events sector. The £200m of economic impact we typically generate for the local economy has been virtually non existent. It’s been a horrendous year of challenge both for the business and the people that we support.” Paul Askew, chef patron, The Art School restaurant “We’ve been slam dunked really. I remember back at the witching hour of 20 March, it was probably darkest day I’ve experienced in a 40-year career. Most important announcement was probably furlough. Personally, I think there will be a floodgate opening effect after lockdown. People are desperate to get back to their way of life and their little bit of civilisation. It is encouraging.” Neil Ashbridge, chairman, Liverpool Chamber of Commerce “Internationally the corporation tax rate keeps us still competitive, certainly with our peers in the EU. We’re not out of kilter there. The worry is the total tax take going up to the highest since the 1970s. Brexit has got a bit swept under the carpet with Covid, but you have to remember we’re being looked at internationally because of the impact of Brexit on the UK economy.” Bill Addy, chief executive, Liverpool BID Company “If he’s talking about levelling up, one thing they can do is change the iniquitous tax on businesses from business rates. It’s like what King John used to do – because sadly he needs to look at some other people to rob from. There is an imbalance between bricks-and-mortar tax and online sales.”"
2021-03-03T20:04:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Bank of England given green remit to aid net zero carbon goal,"The chancellor has changed the remit of the Bank of England’s interest rate-setting monetary policy committee to include a duty to support the government’s net zero carbon ambition alongside its longstanding responsibility to keep inflation in check. Rishi Sunak made the change to reflect the importance of environmental sustainability, he said. Under the green upgrade, the Bank must support the government’s strategy to “level up opportunity in all parts of the UK” and to “transition to an environmentally sustainable and resilient net zero economy”, according to the Treasury. The surprise extension of the remit formed part of an otherwise modest set of Treasury measures to help spur the UK’s burgeoning green economy including plans to issue a £15bn Green Gilt sovereign bond, a £22bn National Infrastructure Bank based in Leeds, and a string of small-scale development funding pledges. The chancellor promised a “real commitment to green growth” in his budget, though environmentalists expressed concern about a lack of detail over how that might be achieved. Analysts said the Bank’s new green mandate means its banking policy decisions would now work in lock-step with the government’s agenda, which together with the National Infrastructure Bank could help channel billions of private capital towards green spending. Karen Ward, a chief strategist at JP Morgan and a former adviser to Philip Hammond when he was chancellor, said investors “should not underestimate the impact this could have on the already strong momentum behind sustainable investing”. “This could tilt the preference of the central bank’s asset purchases and involve considerable regulatory change to encourage private capital to do likewise,” she said. The Treasury also hopes to galvanise the financial might of the City around its £15bn Green Gilt and a new scheme to become a global leader in the burgeoning market for “offsetting” carbon emissions by investing in projects which save or avoid emissions. Sunak has appointed Dame Clara Furse, a former chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, to set up a working group to develop the new markets. Sunak also hopes to harness the saving power of retail investors through a “world first” green bond, to be launched by National Savings & Investments, designed to give UK savers the opportunity to buy bonds which help support green projects while boosting their savings. The cross-party environmental audit committee welcomed the decision to put climate action at the heart of the Bank of England’s work after calling for its remit to be more consistent with the government’s climate ambitions. But it joined the calls of many green investors and campaigners in urging the Treasury to go further. Jeegar Kakkad of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change thinktank said the new infrastructure bank would invest less in the UK each year than the £7bn that used to come from the European Investment Bank before Brexit. “While an infrastructure bank was long overdue, it is baffling why the government has chosen to give it only a fraction of the funding recommended by the National Infrastructure Commission,” said Kakkad. Sunak devoted a scant two minutes of his budget speech to government plans to reach net zero emissions, in which he promised “green” growth, innovation or jobs seven times. However, there was no mention of measures to accelerate the take up of electric vehicles or the green homes grant, a scheme to subsidise insulation and low-carbon heating with grants of up to £10,000 per household. Sunak also kept fuel duty frozen for the 11th year in a row, which is likely to raise emissions by 300,000 tonnes this year. The freeze is also estimated to have cost the Treasury at least £50bn in revenue so far. Carbon dioxide from transport, which makes up more than a third of the UK’s emissions, has barely budged in the past decade as gains from people switching to electric vehicles have been more than wiped out by increasing numbers of people driving SUVs. Green experts said the budget failed to bolster the UK’s green reputation ahead of the presidency of the G7 summit this summer and as host of vital UN climate talks, called Cop26, this November, and showed little sign of the “muscular interventionism” needed to spur a green recovery. Nick Mabey, the chief executive of the environmental thinktank E3G, said: “Ahead of Cop26, this budget was a missed opportunity by failing to set out an unequivocal direction of travel towards a green zero carbon future. The chancellor has dropped the green recovery ball before the try line.”"
2021-03-03T20:02:40Z,uk-news,UK news,‘Open hostility’: an extraordinary episode in the Sussexes’ royal drama,"In another age, it is likely claims of bullying within the royal household would never have emerged into public view. On Wednesday, they were not just publicised, but were the subject of an extraordinary conflict between the royal family and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – with the early-evening intervention from Buckingham Palace on Wednesday likely to ensure maximum prominence in Thursday’s newspapers. While the nature of the incidents that led to the bullying claims against Meghan that emerged on Wednesday is hotly contested – and described by her lawyers as a “a wholly false narrative” – the palace’s on-the-record statement made the seriousness of the issue indisputable, and suggested it would not go away.
If anything, it has upped the ante. “I’ve covered the royals for a decade and I can’t remember a time when we’ve seen such open hostility,” said Victoria Murphy, a longtime royal correspondent formerly of the Daily Mirror. The genesis of the story is not in dispute: the division that dragged such a painful matter into the open began years ago. After Meghan and Harry married in 2018, they and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had a shared staff, serving both of their interests – and, for a while, spoke with a unified voice. But a culture clash was quickly in evidence, said Omid Scobie, co-author of Finding Freedom, a well-sourced and sympathetic biography of Harry and Meghan. Scobie said: “She has this American work ethic. We heard about 5am emails rubbing people up the wrong way, and some of that was briefed at the time. “I would say that where we are today is the crescendo of that – and of people who are frustrated that they haven’t been able to share their side of the story.” Also central to understanding the fallout from the story is the changing role of Jason Knauf, who handled media relations for both couples but, the Times reported, handed in his notice in 2018, a month after he made a complaint about Meghan’s alleged behaviour, claiming it had driven two personal assistants out of the household and had undermined a third member of staff. The Times’s story drew a stinging response from the Sussexes. “Let’s just call this what it is: a calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful information,” a spokesperson was quoted as saying. Knauf is now chief executive of the Cambridges’ Royal Foundation, their primary charitable vehicle – a change in role that echoed a broader division between the two camps as relations soured. One source close to the Sussexes reflected on Wednesday that as well as the difficulty of the tensions between the two sides for the families and the monarchy as an institution, an upsetting professional divide had also been thrown into public view. In the short term, it has been suggested one explanation for the story’s emergence now could be the summary judgment in Meghan’s favour in her privacy and copyright case against Associated Newspapers, a legal victory which prevented a trial in which courtiers would have given evidence. A recent Sunday Times story suggested senior royal sources were “shocked” by the outcome. All of those tensions are reflected in the language used on behalf of the Sussexes in the original story, including a response from their lawyers that the Times was “being used by Buckingham Palace to peddle a wholly false narrative”. It is understood that some in the Sussexes’ camp now view that language as clumsy without evidence the palace itself was responsible for the leak – but stand by the fundamental claim that the emergence of the news now is the result of a coordinated attempt to undermine Meghan before next week’s interview with Oprah Winfrey. Either way, few expect that a strongly worded legal letter would have been sent without the couple’s express agreement to the language. On the other side, said the former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt, it is unlikely that those around the Duke of Cambridge would brief the media without his consent, tacit or otherwise. “William in particular has his people on a very tight leash,” he said. “You remain a friend of his as long as you don’t say that which he would find disagreeable. And so when you do read these comments now they feel very believable.” The allegations themselves are difficult – and legally contentious – for outsiders to parse. A source in the Sussexes’ camp said that they did not challenge the veracity of the emails or the reality of the specific experiences related in the story, but suggested that they had been framed in a way that presented an unfair picture. Against that is the recollection of sources quoted in the original story, one of whom said: “There were a lot of broken people. Young women were broken by their behaviour.” A wider question is why the allegations have arisen now, shortly before the Oprah interview. “They would argue that it is their attempt to ensure that when we sit down and watch, and if the programme doesn’t contain self-reflection, we are minded of the fact that their account may not be the whole truth,” said Hunt. After this week’s excavation of a matter which is rooted, as well as in a potentially legitimate HR complaint, in a painful familial division, the comments given by Meghan and Harry in their Oprah interview will be watched more closely than ever. And the war of words is unlikely to abate. “This is an institution that is meant to live by the motto ‘never complain, never explain’,” said Scobie. “But it spends its whole time complaining and explaining, and doing even more damage in the process.”"
2021-03-03T19:55:03Z,uk-news,UK news,"UK economic growth next year will be fastest since 1948, says OBR","Britain’s economic growth will accelerate next year at the fastest rate since official records began as the economy rebounds by 7.3%, according to the government’s independent economic forecaster. With Covid restrictions set to remain until the summer, delaying the start of the recovery, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the economy would surge ahead in 2022 at the fastest pace since 1948. But the OBR warned that debts from the pandemic will cost the equivalent of £14,000 for every household as government borrowing hits a postwar high, according to figures that lay bare the impact of Covid-19 on the public finances. It said borrowing of £355bn in this financial year would push the annual spending deficit to 16.9% of GDP, its highest level since 1944-45. A further £243bn of borrowing next year will take the total to almost £600bn over two years. Outlining the full impact of the pandemic on the public finances, the OBR said the increase in borrowing would also send the UK’s total debt as a share of the economy to more than 100% and keep it there for the rest of the parliament. Not since 1958 has Britain’s debt-to-GDP level been at such a high level, though the cost of financing government borrowing was at a “historic low”, it added. The increase in debt was lower than the 19% the OBR was forecasting in November after tax receipts were higher than expected and government spending slightly lower. But the costs of the pandemic, which were expected to ease in the 2021-22 financial year, will continue to put pressure on the Treasury’s finances after third lockdown and restrictions until at least June forced the chancellor to maintain extra support for businesses and households until the autumn. A £59bn fiscal stimulus for 2021-22, equal to nearly 3% of last year’s GDP, and the chancellor’s determination to maintain the highest level of public infrastructure spending in a generation, also raised borrowing levels. The stimulus package, mainly comprising support for businesses, allied to a return of consumer spending, gave rise to a forecast increase next year in GDP growth of 7.3%, which would be the highest for 74 years. This dramatic rebound would follow a 4% increase in GDP during 2021, downgraded from last November’s forecast of 5.4%. Growth is expected to moderate to 1.7% in 2023, 1.6% in 2024 and 1.7% in 2025. Jonathan Gillham, the chief economist at the accountants PwC, said households will feel the impact of a weaker than expected recovery in 2021. “GDP per capita is expected to be 1.4% lower, which is roughly equivalent to £450 for each person in the UK,” he said. “In two years from the start of the pandemic, the expectation is that the economic cost will equate to around £2,200 per person. Government debt has increased by around £14,000 for each UK household. “The scale of these impacts are unprecedented and have not been felt by the UK economy for 300 years, meaning that the economic outlook remains uncertain.” The OBR emphasised that the uncertain outlook meant its forecasts remained speculative and highly sensitive to changes in the course of the pandemic and the successful rollout of the vaccine programme. Richard Hughes, the OBR chair, said there were also risks to the outlook from the chancellor’s spending decisions, which may not reap the dividends the Treasury expects. He said that while the Treasury has given Whitehall departments more than £150bn this year and next to pay for the costs of the pandemic, “it makes no provision thereafter for any Covid-related costs” even though there will need to be extra spending on education, health and public transport subsidies with reduced income from passengers. “The government’s own roadmap discusses the potential need for an annual revaccination programme and standing test and trace capacity to keep what is expected to become an endemic virus in check.
“And the pandemic has left behind a backlog of postponed procedures in hospitals and a generation of pupils who have missed out on up to six months of schooling. “And having taken the railways back into public ownership and filled the holes in their fare boxes, it is not clear when and if passenger numbers will ever return to levels that will allow this public support to be fully withdrawn.” Hughes said cuts of more than £10bn from Whitehall budgets in last year’s spending review and a further £4bn in the budget might not be sustainable should the after effects of the pandemic need to be tackled with higher spending on staff and resources."
2021-03-03T19:52:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Sunak's £1bn of 'town deals' will nearly all go to Tory constituencies ,"Rishi Sunak has denied that funds intended to boost struggling towns are biased towards Conservative-held areas after it emerged that 40 of the 45 places to receive a share of the first £1bn in funding are represented by Tory MPs. Labour accused the government of using public money “to serve their own party’s needs” after Sunak’s own constituency of Richmond in Yorkshire, and those of other cabinet ministers, were put in the top tier to receive money from a new fund. The allocations from what are officially called the towns fund and the levelling up fund, unveiled as part of the budget, highlight the government’s intention to focus spending on areas outside major cities, particularly in northern England and the Midlands. Separately, Sunak used the budget to announce that two new economic hubs will open in the north, in Darlington and Leeds, in another apparent attempt to strengthen the Conservatives’ support outside their traditional heartlands. But in his post-budget press conference, Sunak was accused of “pork barrel politics” given that 40 of the 45 towns in the first tranche of towns fund spending were represented by Conservative MPs, while his constituency is in tier 1 of the levelling up fund, while less prosperous neighbouring areas are not. The chancellor rejected this, saying: “The formula for the grant payment for the new fund is based on an index of economic need, which is transparently published by MHCLG [the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government], and based on a bunch of objective measures.” He said that the tier 1 areas were only receiving extra capacity funding to bid for support as they “might need a bit of extra help” and that this did not mean other places would lose out. Sunak added: “If you look at things we’re doing, they’re benefiting people in every corner of the country.” Neither the Treasury or MHCLG said where the formula was published. Labour has tabled a parliamentary question to seek the information. Labour said the levelling up fund not only now had Sunak’s local authority in tier 1, but also areas represented by the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, the Welsh secretary, Simon Hart, the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, and the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis. Labour said ministers needed to be more open about the metrics used. Steve Reed, the shadow communities secretary, said: “This research raises big questions marks over the fairness of the government’s regeneration funding schemes. “This government should be investing to rebuild the foundations of our economy, but they’re pulling the country further apart by pitting regions and nations against each other for crucial funding, then diverting the money to serve their own party’s needs.”
Announcing the new northern hubs in his speech, Sunak said a Treasury campus will be set up in Darlington and a national infrastructure bank will be situated in Leeds. Sunak announced plans for a regional Treasury site in last year’s budget and, after an extensive scoping exercise, revealed on Wednesday that Darlington in Tees Valley would be the location. Sunak promised that the infrastructure bank in Leeds would be up and running “in an interim form” by the spring. Its role will be to dole out £13bn of equity and debt capital, and to issue up to £10bn of guarantees, as well as offering loans to local authorities from the summer. “Redrawing our economic map means rebalancing our economic investment,” said Sunak. Details about how many civil servants could be relocated to Darlington and how many jobs could be created in the region have yet to be clarified, but the government plans to move 22,000 civil servants out of London by 2030. The policy mirrors a pledge in Labour’s 2019 manifesto when the then shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, pledged to “break up No 11” and move it “to the north”."
2021-03-03T19:31:37Z,uk-news,UK news,Birmingham residents ask: will it be open for business again,"Birmingham, with its proud manufacturing heritage, has been hit hard by the Covid jobs crisis and is in the unhappy position of being among one of the areas with the highest unemployment rates in the country at 7.8%. Five of the 10 constituencies with the highest level of unemployment in the country are in Britain’s second city, and average gross weekly pay currently sits at £548.60 – below the averages for the wider West Midlands region and for Great Britain. In a scene repeated up and down the country, lockdown has left the city centre deserted – a particular blow for Birmingham. The city had bet big on high street retail in recent years with the redevelopment of the Bullring, known for the undulating silver facade of the Selfridges department store at its heart, and a shopping centre built as part of the overhaul of New Street station, featuring a vast new John Lewis . The announcement that the shop would not reopen following the first lockdown in 2020 was a blow to both the city and to Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands region, who was previously managing director of the retailer. The Guardian asked local residents and businesses what they thought of Rishi Sunak’s budget, and whether it would be enough to help Birmingham recover from the damage wrought by coronavirus. Zafar Hussain, 35, restaurant owner, Sparkbrook Shababs restaurant in the heart of Birmingham’s Balti triangle has been in the Hussain family for 33 years, but the Covid crisis is its biggest challenge yet. “We’ve been through recessions and we’ve come out the other side, but this has been really, really tough,” said Hussain.
While he welcomed some of the budget announcements, such as the extension of the 5% reduced rate of VAT for six months, he felt other measures didn’t go far enough. “I’m still a bit disappointed with the business rates because after June we’ve got to pay a third and I thought, as a minimum, small businesses should at least have this next year free,” he said. The restaurant has been making some income by operating as a takeaway, but Hussain still had to furlough a number of staff. “The furlough extension is welcome because we don’t know how quick or how soon we’re going to get to normal capacity again. The cap on fuel duty is good news for us as well, because the cost of delivering food is expensive as it is.” He said the budget had made him optimistic about the months ahead but he was also preparing for the worst. “There’s just far too much uncertainty, I’m still very wary about the future.” Ulfat Begum, 49, Market trader, Hall Green “We are in debt with the wholesaler,” said Ulfat Begum, as she helped out on her husband’s fruit and vegetable stall at the Bullring open market, where their trade has slumped 60% during the pandemic. “We are not selling out, but if we don’t buy each day we don’t have enough to put on the stall”.
The Begums have four stalls at the market, usually staffed by four workers. However Ulfat has started occasionally helping out at the stall, working alongside three members of staff while they can’t afford to pay a fourth wage. The market’s city centre location had previously guaranteed high footfall and plenty of custom from office workers and shoppers, but multiple lockdowns have kept clients away. Rising unemployment in the city and consumers’ concerns about job security have also impacted trade, Begum said. “Customers are spending less, they are more careful about what they buy now”. The mother-of-seven feels that Birmingham can sometimes be overlooked by Westminster, despite its size. She believes the city council, which is the landlord of the market, needs to be given a bigger budget. “Government needs to give more to Birmingham,” she said, “It is forgotten about sometimes”. Liam Byrne, Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill Byrne’s Hodge Hill constituency has the highest unemployment rate of any constituency in the UK at 14.1%, roughly one in seven, so he was desperate to hear the government announce some measures designed to create new jobs.
“Some of the short-term help for businesses is welcome, extra help for business rates, the extension of furlough and help for the self-employed,” he said. “But there wasn’t a big picture strategy to basically re-industrialise, create the jobs of the future and deal with the unemployment emergency.” Byrne felt the chancellor missed a major opportunity to use a green jobs programme to address both the climate emergency and rising unemployment rates. “He needed to set out a strategy that took us from the pandemic to the Paris agreements. For the West Midlands, the big hole was no announcement about a gigafactory which we need to kickstart the green automotive industry for the future and there was nothing about retrofitting, nothing about green homes,” he said. He added the budget would lead to £66bn in tax rises in the three years from 2022 which the public should brace themselves for. “We got some tactical short term measures, which are important but which are going to cost us a fortune in the medium term.” Alex Smith, 74, Estate agent and chartered surveyor, Hodge Hill Alex Smith’s estate agency is currently enjoying record numbers of property sales, exchanges and instructions in the east of the Birmingham. The local property market has been booming since it reopened last spring, much of which Smith attributes to pent-up demand from the first lockdown.
Smith welcomed the extension to the stamp duty holiday until the end of June. “I am not sure how much effect it will have on new business but should clear the backlog,” he said. “There are a large number of properties which are sold subject to contract as the process is taking four to five months.” “I think confidence is a big thing,” he said, adding that he felt the chancellor had sounded “fairly upbeat”. Smith was unsure how the government’s new mortgage guarantee scheme will work, which is designed to offer 95% loans to buyers, but believes it will help prospective house owners. “Raising a deposit has always been the most difficult part of the transaction,” Edward Harper, 21, history and politics student, Aston University With five universities, Birmingham has a greater proportion of young people than anywhere else, and almost half its 1.1m population is under 30. But Harper, from Walsall, felt young people were distinctly lacking from the chancellor’s announcement. “I don’t think students were even mentioned at all. I think there’s a lot of frustration among students and young people about it all, we kind of feel ignored,” he said. He said the numbers showing national debt will peak at 97% of GDP in 2023/24 and will take decades to tackle is “scary” for young people about to embark on their careers. “It’s quite staggering compared to the financial crash in 2007/08 and that was bad.” However, he was pleased by the announcement of government-backed 5% deposit mortgages, which should make the prospect of owning a home more achievable. “I think it will give people, especially young people and students coming out of university, optimism and hope that maybe they can actually afford a house and that it’s actually doable,” he said. Sarah Ventre, 32, newly self-employed, Stirchley
When the catering company she worked for went under after the pandemic hit last year, Sarah Ventre was made redundant and decided to become self-employed – but because she doesn’t have a 2019/20 tax return, she doesn’t qualify for the new self-employed support announced by the chancellor. “Last year there were 3 million self-employed people who fell through the cracks; the government might be able to bridge that a little but there will still be many people like myself who don’t qualify for support,” she said. Working in mobile catering, she hasn’t been able to earn any money with events and weddings cancelled, and said she has received just £2,000 in support since the crisis began.
She welcomed the £5bn restart grants, with up to £18,000 for hospitality businesses, but said since many people have struggled to access previous financial support packages, she won’t be getting her hopes up. “The devil is always in the detail with these things and we’re still waiting for payouts from the last grants that were announced. It’s quite hard to get excited about anything when you’re still waiting on the last promise.” Over the past few months she has been putting her skills to use as part of Northfield Food Service, providing meals to local schoolchildren and a growing number of struggling families. She said while the extension of the £20 universal credit uplift is welcome, it won’t go far for many people. “We’ve had a cold winter, so bills have gone up and I think the situation will just get worse to be honest. A lot of our local charities are planning the crisis year to hit next year because that’s when we’ll feel the full effect of what’s happened.” Jean Ensell, 62, business owner, city centre With the benefit of hindsight, Jean Ensell wouldn’t have opted to set up a new textile design business at the end of 2019. Her company, Ensell Taylor, which has a studio in the city’s Jewellery Quarter, had only been trading for a matter of months at the start of the first lockdown last spring, leaving her unable to access most government support.
“I couldn’t prove it was a viable business,” Ensell said. “It has been really upsetting. If I hadn’t set up a new business, I would have been on furlough.” The American, who has lived in the Midlands for four decades, said she had also applied for the government’s kickstart scheme, but had not heard whether she was successful. As a result, Ensell has been forced to rely on her family for some financial support during the past 12 months. Ensell, who was walking past the closed Bull Ring shopping centre on the way to her Covid vaccination appointment, said she had spent the pandemic creating original patterns for fabrics to sell to customers, and making sure her company website was up-to-date. The former teacher at Birmingham City University welcomed the chancellor’s announcement of further support for the self-employed, through grants from the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS), and hoped she would be eligible as she had already filed her 2019/20 tax return."
2021-03-03T19:27:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Rishi Sunak's budget brings first corporation tax rise since 1974,"Rishi Sunak has announced the first corporation tax rise in 47 years, but sought to soften the blow with £25bn in investment incentives for British businesses. The headline rate of corporation tax, the tax businesses pay on their profits, will rise to 25% for company profits over £250,000 from April 2023, the chancellor told parliament in Wednesday’s budget. The tax increase will raise £47.8bn by April 2026, the Treasury said, representing the single biggest tax rise in the budget. Businesses with profits of less than £50,000 will continue to pay the current corporation tax rate of 19%, although the rate will be tapered up for businesses as they get closer to the £250,000 profit level. Sunak’s announcement is the first increase in the main rate of corporation tax since 1974 under Denis Healey, a Labour chancellor. The hike came as a shock to the Conservative party’s traditional allies in big business. Successive Conservative chancellors had steadily cut corporation tax from 28% when the party first came to power in 2010 to an all-time low. Sunak said it was “fair and necessary to ask [businesses] to contribute to our recovery” in light of spending of more than £100bn on emergency support for companies during the coronavirus pandemic. However, Sunak also announced a new two-year tax “super deduction” for businesses who invest in new plant or machinery, in an attempt to improve the UK’s historically weak productivity growth. Companies will receive a tax cut worth 130% of investments made between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2023, meaning the government will effectively pay for companies to invest their capital. The deduction will be worth £25bn over two years to businesses. Analysts said the investment subsidy could prove to be a boon to large companies with pre-existing investment plans. Telecoms group BT, which has a significant broadband investment programme, recorded a share price gain of 6.8% on Wednesday.
Keir Starmer, the Labour party leader, said the super deductions policy was “unlikely to make up for the 10 years when the levels of investment growth have trailed other countries.” He added that the corporation tax rise, backed by the party, showed that “the decade-long corporation tax experiment by this government has failed.” Plans to raise corporation tax had been leaked to the media before the budget, but the size of the planned increase took many by surprise. EY, the accountancy group, said it meant that businesses would pay for 60% of the tax rises announced by Sunak. The 25% top rate will be higher than the average headline rate of corporation tax in the EU, which was 22.2% in 2020, or the 21% headline corporation tax rate in the US. It is also similar to the 26% advocated by the Labour party under the previous leader, Jeremy Corbyn. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said the budget “leaves open the question of UK competitiveness long-term”. The UK’s largest corporate lobby group is generally in favour of lower taxes on businesses. Tony Danker, the CBI’s director-general, said: “The super deduction should be a real catalyst for firms to greenlight investment decisions. The boldness of the chancellor on this measure is to be admired. “But moving corporation tax to 25% in one leap will cause a sharp intake of breath for many businesses and sends a worrying signal to those planning to invest in the UK.” The delay to the implementation of the corporate tax increase left the door open to lobbying before it is imposed. Jonathan Geldart, director-general of the Institute of Directors, another business lobby group, said adjustments to the plan should be considered if the economy recovers faster than expected. Sunak’s attempt to sweeten the pill for businesses also temporarily extended the ability to “carry back” losses from one year to three years. The rule change will mean that for the next two years companies who have swung to losses can gain refunds of up to £760,000 for tax payments made in the previous three years. The policy is expected to cost about £1bn over two years. Sunak said that his tax rises were “decisions no chancellor wants to make”, but said they were necessary to reduce the amount the government is borrowing. “I recognise they might not be popular, but they are honest,” he said."
2021-03-03T19:19:38Z,uk-news,UK news,NHS worker arrested on suspicion of murder and rape at hospital,"A healthcare professional has been arrested on suspicion of murder, rape and sexual assault as part of a police investigations into the stroke unit at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. Lancashire constabulary said the man was arrested on Wednesday as part of the murder investigation into the death of a 75-year-old at the hospital on 16 November 2018. A spokesperson for the force said the man was in being held in custody on suspicion of murder, two offences of rape and one offence of sexual assault and had been suspended by the Blackpool teaching hospitals NHS trust. The force began looking into allegations of mistreatment and neglect on the hospital’s stroke unit in November 2018 and a number of postmortem examinations were conducted. These included one on Valerie Kneale, 75, from Blackpool. A murder investigation was launched when it was revealed she died from a non-medical related internal injury. The force said that as a result of their inquiries, information related to other allegations of serious sexual assaults against two patients has also been received, as well as the sexual assault of a healthcare professional working on the stroke unit. A separate investigation into suspected poisoning of patients on the unit is ongoing, during which seven healthcare professionals have previously been arrested. DCI Jill Johnston said the force recognise the arrest and the nature of the allegations would cause some alarm, but sought to reassure the public a major investigation was ongoing. She said: “We have today arrested a man in connection with a number of serious offences. We understand this will cause some significant concern in the community but please be reassured we have a dedicated team of officers conducting a number of inquiries. “These are complicated and sensitive allegations which we are committed to investigating thoroughly. We are offering support to those involved and they are being updated throughout the process by trained officers. “Our priority and the priority of Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS foundation trust is to ensure the safety of patients. We are working closely with the trust as well as HM coroner for Blackpool and Fylde as part of the investigation. “If you have any information or have worked on the stroke unit and can assist with our inquiries, please come forward and speak to police immediately.”"
2021-03-03T19:10:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Business rates holiday extended until end of June in England,"The business rates holiday aimed at high street businesses forced to close during the pandemic has been extended for another three months, with big supermarkets heading off any criticism by promising to shun the new £3bn tax break. The year-long business rates holiday, which was due to finish in England at the end of this month, has been extended by the government until 30 June. After that only businesses forced to shut this year would be eligible for a big reduction in their bills for the commercial equivalent of council tax. The relief is being capped at £2m, which will be a blow for non-essential retailers and pub companies with large property estates. Last year Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons were among the big names who committed to repaying £2.2bn of the emergency taxpayer support. They were heavily criticised for accepting business rates relief while simultaneously paying big dividends to shareholders after their stores stayed open. The rates relief was a blunt instrument deployed by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to prop up retailers barred from trading during the first lockdown. The rates holiday has already been extended for a full year in Scotland, with Wales yet to set out its plans. The government said businesses in England could “choose to opt out of the relief”. The real estate adviser Altus Group put the cost of the three-month extension at £3bn. The lifeline would save hard-hit pubs, restaurants and hotels more than £600m but that would be less than the £760m of relief essential retailers such as supermarkets and DIY stores are entitled to. Tesco, one of the biggest payers of business rates, said that when it returned £585m of rates relief for 2020 it had done so because it “was the right thing to do”. “Those same reasons still stand today and so we will not take advantage of the relief,” it added. Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons said they would do the same."
2021-03-03T18:57:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Budget 2021: devolved nations receive £2.4bn in additional funding,"Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are to receive an additional £2.4bn in the next financial year under the Barnett formula as Rishi Sunak increased funding to the devolved administrations. Holyrood will receive an additional £1.2bn, the Welsh government £740m, and the Northern Ireland executive £410m. The Barnett formula determines that the devolved governments automatically get a share of increased spending in England. As a consequence of the England-only spending commitments in the budget, which includes spending on coronavirus, the three areas will get more money. The chancellor also announced that the devolved administrations would receive £1.4bn in funding for 2021-22 outside the Barnett formula. He announced a £27m investment in renewable energy in Aberdeen, £5m for a “global underwater hub” in Scotland, £4.8m to support the development of a demonstration hydrogen hub in Holyhead, Anglesey, and as much as £30m for a “global centre for rail excellence” in Neath Port Talbot in south Wales. “Our future economy depends on being a United Kingdom. Businesses in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have contributed to and benefited from our coronavirus response,” Sunak said. “Central to that has been a Treasury that acts for the whole United Kingdom. That it not a political point, that is an undeniable truth. The majority of today’s budget measures will apply directly to people in all four nations of the United Kingdom. “I am taking further specific steps with three city and growth Scottish city deals, three more in north Wales, in mid-Wales and Swansea Bay, and funding for the Holyhead hydrogen hub, and a centre of rail excellence in Neath Port Talbot.” He told Scottish voters: “The UK government has protected millions of jobs and livelihoods across Scotland, and the strength and stability of our economic union will ensure we bounce back from this pandemic together. “This budget will ensure the people of Scotland continue to be supported through our plan for jobs, committing more than £1bn in extra investment and funding to help fuel the UK’s recovery.” The SNP accused Sunak of overseeing “a return to Tory austerity cuts”. To the people of Wales the chancellor said: “Throughout the pandemic, the UK government has stepped in to support millions of lives and livelihoods across Wales. We are also investing millions in Welsh towns and cities, key infrastructure and green industries that will be vital to long-lasting economic growth.” He also said Downing Street would continue to work with the Welsh government to establish at least one freeport in Wales as part of the aim “to make Wales a premier destination for trade and investment”. The Welsh government finance minister, Rebecca Evans, said: “The chancellor has splashed the cash, but none of it on capital investment by the government. The Welsh government will get precisely nothing in terms of additions to our capital budget.”"
2021-03-03T18:52:15Z,uk-news,UK news,Sunak goes long on support for jobs – but says little about NHS or inequality,"Rishi Sunak both is, and isn’t, a typical Tory: he’s an extravagantly rich, public school-educated former hedge fund manager; but also a coke-swigging Star Wars fan with a slick Twitter game who works from home in a hoodie. And his budget on Wednesday was, and wasn’t, a typical Tory budget. Labour has repeatedly accused the Conservatives in recent weeks of wanting to return to “business as usual”. But the political and economic terrain has been changed dramatically by the past 12 months, in ways that are likely to be long-lasting. Sunak’s statement was shot through with reminders of the extraordinary support the government has put in place during the Covid crisis. Once you’ve promised to do “whatever it takes,” to support businesses and subsidise jobs, it’s politically all but impossible to “pull out the rug”, as the prime minister put it recently. When the chancellor tried to turn off the furlough scheme last autumn, it was the resurgence of Covid that stopped him – but also the expectations of millions of workers whose jobs had been kept afloat by the taxpayer. Perhaps stung by that experience, the chancellor has now decided to “go long,” as he called it, extending many of the support schemes for months, well beyond the end of the government’s planned “roadmap”. The Treasury now puts the total cost of emergency Covid measures at a historically extraordinary £352bn. And even once the worst of the pandemic is over, while Sunak is very keen to redraw exactly the political dividing line that served George Osborne so well in 2010 and 2015 – sensible Tories vs spendthrift Labour – he is doing so in a different way. While public sector spending cuts, many of them hitting welfare claimants who could ill bear them, were Osborne’s weapon of choice for balancing the books, Sunak claimed the Tories are now the party of public services. So big businesses will pay, through higher corporation taxes, with smaller firms carefully excluded to dampen the backlash from Tory MPs, and middle-earners will be caught up in what economists call “fiscal drag” – paying more tax because thresholds are not moving up in line with inflation. Cutting corporation tax was a trademark policy for the Osborne-Cameron government, symbolising what was then the Conservatives’ ideal of global competition. Increasing it back to 2010 levels has been a Labour policy for years – and once Sunak’s increases are implemented, the overall tax burden in the UK will be back at levels last seen when Roy Jenkins was chancellor in the 1960s. Hardly the “same old Tories”. Indeed, the relatively muted reaction from the Tory back benches underlined the fact that it’s not just the economic context that has changed, but the shape of the Conservative party. Philip Hammond and many of his fellow fiscal hawks have either been swept out of parliament or relegated to the very back benches – and many of the noisiest voices in the parliamentary party are those of the new MPs from the red wall seats, for whom small-c fiscal conservatism is less of a cherished cause. Many of them were buoyed by the announcement that they may receive a handout from the new “levelling-up fund”. Labour dismisses this as pork barrel spending, shovelled out to favoured constituencies – but also privately concede it is hard to counter. Yet there were aspects to Sunak’s approach that were depressingly familiar from the past decade of Conservative governments. The £20-a week universal credit increase has been retained, but only until September, when removing it will still increase child poverty and hit cash-strapped households hard. Overseas aid is still being cut; unspecified cuts in departmental public spending of up to £4bn are now pencilled in for future years; and public sector pay is being frozen for many workers, as Sunak announced last autumn. And as Keir Starmer rightly identified in his response to Sunak’s statement – one of the toughest gigs for an opposition leader – many pressing issues were completely missing from the chancellor’s statement – social care, the NHS, inequality, insecure work. Johnson and Sunak have a specific, and narrow idea of what “levelling up” and “building back better” means: infrastructure projects, business investment, low-tax buccaneering freeports. To counter it, rather than caricature them as textbook Tories, Starmer will need to fill out his own, as yet rather thin, picture of what post-pandemic Britain could look like."
2021-03-03T18:51:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Sunak says mortgage and stamp duty measures will create 'generation buy',"A phased end to the stamp duty holiday and a government guarantee for 95% mortgages will turn “generation rent” into “generation buy”, the chancellor claimed on Wednesday. Rishi Sunak said the stamp duty holiday he announced last summer had “helped hundreds of thousands of people buy a home and supported the economy at a critical time”, but that many purchases would not complete before the original deadline of 31 March. Responding to calls from the industry for a tapered extension to prevent buyers facing unexpected bills, he said that in England and Northern Ireland the threshold for the tax to start would remain at £500,000 until 30 June.
After that, it will be reduced to £250,000 until 30 September, before returning to its original level of £125,000. The changes gave a boost to the share prices of housebuilders, with Barratt Developments and Persimmon ending the day as the biggest gainers in the FTSE 100 with 7% rises. Taylor Wimpey closed up 6%, while in the FTSE 250 Crest Nicholson, Countryside and Bellway were all up more than 6%. The phased change will mean that buyers who miss the June deadline will not face as big a bill as if the tax returned to normal straight away. However, there will still be an incentive for those buying expensive homes to compete their sales as soon as possible – someone paying £500,000 for a property will see the bill rise from £0 to £12,500 if they complete after June but before the end of October. First-time buyers previously benefited from not having to pay stamp duty on properties costing up to £300,000, but Sunak said that even with no tax to pay raising a deposit presented a “significant barrier” to getting on to the housing ladder. In the early days of the pandemic lenders pulled 95% mortgages, and many are still capping borrowing below 90%. Home loans for those with a 10% deposit have been reappearing, but many have strict terms and conditions for borrowers. Sunak said the government would offer a guarantee for lenders to encourage them to offer 95% mortgages again, with the scheme in place from April until the end of 2022. He said Lloyds, NatWest, Santander, Barclays and HSBC had already signed up, and that more, including Virgin Money, planned to follow. Lloyd Cochrane, the head of mortgages at NatWest Group, said: “For those customers with smaller deposits looking for a mortgage, particular younger or first time buyers, saving up for a big deposit can often be difficult, and we know people in these groups are some of the hardest hit by the effects of the pandemic. “A government-backed mortgage guarantee scheme will help segments of the market for whom home ownership has felt far out of reach in recent months.” The scheme will apply to homes costing up to £600,000 and is not restricted to first-time buyers, or people who are moving. Lenders will be obliged to offer a five-year fixed-rate mortgage as part of the scheme, to give borrowers the chance to opt to secure their monthly repayments. The announcements were welcomed by the property industry, with many describing the stamp duty extension as bringing “relief” to buyers. Property firm Hamptons said dropping the threshold to £250,000 until September meant that more than half of buyers in England would pay no stamp duty, compared with 94% now and 16% from October. Some said buy-to-let investors would be keen to use the extension to increase their portfolios. Law firm Wilsons said in the fourth quarter of 2020 61,800 buy-to-let properties, the highest quarterly figure since 2017, and that the tax break had been a “significant contributor” to the rise. Imogen Lea, a tax consultant at Wilsons, said: “The welcome three-month extension to the SDLT holiday gives potential property investors a second chance to purchase with no SDLT up to £500,000.” “The extension to properties valued at £250,000 or less, which will be introduced in July and run to 30 September, could see more sustained growth in buy-to-let investments in parts of the country where property prices are lower, or in smaller dwellings.”
The Social Market Foundation thinktank said the Treasury’s interventions were “not what the UK economy needs” and failed to support some of the country’s most vulnerable households. Jake Shepherd, a researcher at the SMF, said: “Instead of rolling out more measures that risk inflating house prices further, the chancellor should have done more for people who rent, too many of whom are in arrears. “He should also pay more attention to the hundreds of thousands of existing mortgageholders who have had to use up savings during the crisis and risk repossession if their incomes suddenly fall”"
2021-03-03T18:25:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Eight freeports with low-tax zones to be created in England ,"Eight English ports are to become freeports under plans announced by the chancellor, who said his policy for the controversial low-tax zones would “exemplify the future economy” and “unlock billions” in investment, trade and jobs. Businesses located within the freeports will benefit from tax breaks including no stamp duty, full rebates for construction and machinery investment, five years of zero business rates, and lower tariffs and customs obligations. Most of the zones will be based around England’s biggest coastal cargo ports, including Felixstowe, Liverpool, Hull, Southampton and London Gateway. Plymouth, Teesside and a zone around East Midlands airport will also be designated areas. While freeports existed, without great impact, in the UK until 2012, Rishi Sunak said the plan was “on a scale we’ve never done before”, creating special economic zones that he said were long established internationally but with “a unique approach” for the UK. The chancellor said discussions were continuing with the devolved administrations for further freeports elsewhere in the UK, although Scotland is modifying the plan to introduce “green ports”, while Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit status may not allow the same model. The freeport plan has been championed by Sunak and Conservative politicians in the north of England, where it is seen as a vital tool in the “levelling up” agenda to attract money and jobs to deprived regions. Sunak told the Commons it was a policy the UK could only pursue now it was outside the EU. There are in fact about 80 freeports within the EU, but the European commission has been clamping down on the zones, which have been linked with money laundering, corruption, tax evasion and organised crime. Sunak, however, unveiled the policy as the final flourish of his budget speech, setting out his vision for the future of one of the new freeports, in Teesside. “In the past, it was known for its success in industries like steel,” he said. “Now, when I look to the future of Teesside, I see old industrial sites being used to capture and store carbon; vaccines being manufactured; offshore wind turbines creating clean energy.” He said the freeport would “see innovative, fast-growing businesses hiring local people into decent, well-paid, green jobs”. The full list of eight English freeports will incorporate East Midlands airport; Freeport East – Felixstowe with Harwich; Humber – including Hull, Grimsby, Immingham and Goole; Liverpool City Region; Plymouth and South Devon: Solent – including Southampton; Thames – combining London Gateway and Tilbury ports; and Teesside. Each zone includes a port, as the customs and tariffs benefits are designed to allow raw goods to be processed and re-exported more efficiently and cheaply, while legally avoiding normal import duties. However, the zones can stretch as far as 25 miles (40km) and link other areas in new designated “tax sites”. Spokespeople for winning bidders including Solent and Plymouth said the news would provide massive investment and thousands of new jobs in their regions. Teesside and Humber will also benefit from a port upgrade fund to develop facilities for offshore wind. the trade association RenewableUK said the combination with freeports was “a big bang moment for offshore wind manufacturing”. The UK Major Ports Group – some of whose members, including Bristol, did not succeed in bids to gain freeport status – said it looked forward to helping make them a reality. Tim Morris, its chief executive, added: “However, freeports alone are not a silver bullet for addressing deprivation in coastal communities. The government should look at extending some of the low-cost, pro-investment measures in the freeports ‘tool box’ to port areas more widely.” While the government and ports have said freeports should remain tightly controlled and comply with UK labour, environment and safety laws, there remain concerns over regulation and governance. Details of how the ports and tax sites will be run have yet to be established, with successful bidders expected to draw up detailed plans for their zones. Owners of ports who are likely to benefit include Dubai’s DP World, which owns London Gateway and Dubai’s Jebel Ali free-trade zone, the Hong Kong-based Hutchison, which owns the terminals at Felixstowe and Harwich, and Peel Group, established by Isle of Man resident John Whittaker – one of Britain’s biggest landowners – which owns the port of Liverpool. Some critics have questioned whether the tax breaks could be regarded as potentially illegal state aid and breach trade agreements, not least with the EU and the cooperation agreement signed in December. Another proposal, which the Treasury says will be subject to parliamentary approval, is that firms within the zones will not pay employees’ national insurance contributions for new jobs, potentially until 2031. Unions have expressed concern over that plan. The Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union general secretary, Mick Cash, said it would “create a two-tier workforce and turn these regions into bargain basements for multinational companies to enjoy increased profits at the expense of workers’ safety, employment rights and public services”. He added: “This is no model for sustainable economic growth and handing control of ports to international conglomerates is casino economics.” The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, said: “Freeports are simply not the silver bullet for our economy that the chancellor claims. There’s a real risk that free ports simply move existing economic activity around, rather than increase it. “With the UK’s low global tariff, experts say the only sector well positioned to benefit is making dog food.”"
2021-03-03T18:22:11Z,uk-news,UK news,UK pub bosses 'disappointed' by budget help for hospitality industry,"Beer bosses branded measures to prop up the ailing hospitality industry “disappointing”, saying drinks-focused pubs and breweries have been left out and pressing concerns such as mounting rent bills have not been addressed. Sector-specific policies unveiled in the budget include a six-month extension to the reduced 5% VAT rate for hospitality and leisure businesses, at a cost of £5bn to the Treasury. The reduction from the usual 20% rate, introduced by Rishi Sunak last July, will now last until September, followed by an interim rate of 12.5% until April 2022.
Hospitality and leisure firms can also apply for “restart” grants of up to £18,000, worth £400m to the pubs sector. A moratorium on payment of business rates will be extended until the end of June, while Sunak also confirmed that alcohol duty will be frozen for the second year running. Trade bodies and pub bosses welcomed industry-specific measures, as well as the extension of the furlough job support scheme until September, with UK Hospitality boss Kate Nicholls calling the support “crucial”. But leading pub industry figures pointed to a failure to tackle long-term threats including a looming crisis facing thousands of pubs facing rent demands despite long-term closure. Greene King boss Nick Mackenzie said rules preventing landlords from throwing out tenants for non-payment of rent expire this month. “There’s a big cliff edge for the hospitality sector on rent that hasn’t been addressed at government level,” he said. The Campaign for Pubs said rent bills from commercial landlords and some large pub companies was “the biggest threat to [pubs’] survival”. Dawn Hopkins, the group’s vice-chair and licensee of the Rose Inn in Norwich, also took aim at Sunak’s refusal to include alcohol sales in the VAT cut, a policy that has hit “wet-led” pubs hard. She said the policy ignored classic community pubs and instead “funnels millions to the likes of McDonald’s and KFC who don’t need it.” Admiral Taverns boss Chris Jowsey said the exclusion of alcohol meant that about 80% of his 1000 pubs had seen no benefit from the policy. He also questioned the decision to restart business rates – albeit at a reduced rate – at the end of June, nine days after the earliest point at which pubs can fully reopen. “It feels tough to be reopening and be hit with rates immediately,” he said. “There was nothing in there about taxing the winners out of the pandemic, such as online businesses, but we’re going straight back to business rates.” “There’s some support and I’m grateful for that but overall I’m disappointed.” Craft beer trade body Siba criticised a lack of support for the UK’s once thriving brewery scene, which misses out on cuts to VAT, targeted grants and business rates relief. Its chief executive, James Calder, said: “What is the point in helping hospitality if there aren’t vibrant, diverse and local beers on offer when the economy reopens?” At the Parkers Arms in rural Lancashire, landlady Stosie Madi welcomed sector-specific support but said the VAT cut and business rates holiday should have been extended until April 2022. “Some of us have not traded since October so to start paying VAT just as you’re going into your low trading period – when we’ve not had a chance to capitalise on spring – is a bit worrying,” she said. Madi said restrictions on indoor custom meant the pub would not be able to open on weekdays at first, even after outdoor service is permitted to resume on 12 April. “We’re in rural Lancashire, facing a big moor. We’ve got driving rain and UK weather conditions to deal with,” she said. “We might have to have people run out with food under umbrellas,” she said.
One budget measure that could help neighbourhoods save struggling community pubs is a £150m fund to help them buy their local rather than risk losing it. While trade bodies and businesses welcomed the freeze in alcohol taxes, ale enthusiasts’ group Camra called it a “missed opportunity” to cut beer duty. The government is in the midst of a review of alcohol duty, which is higher in the UK than in most of Europe."
2021-03-03T17:55:15Z,uk-news,UK news,Budget means tax rises ahead – and little new for first-time buyers,"We can hardly call them “stealth tax rises” this time around, as the chancellor was at pains to spell out the impact of his decision to freeze both personal allowances and the amount you can put in your pension over your working life. But for many people in the UK the increases outlined in the budget may remain under the radar for a while. Personal allowances will rise as planned in April. The first £12,750 of income will still be tax-free, while the 40% rate will kick in at £50,270. But after that there will be no change until 2026. Any inflation-linked increase in pay or benefits will therefore be eroded by the extra tax you will pay. On pensions, it is only those with the biggest pots that will rub against the limit, which will be just over £1m.
Freezing income tax thresholds does not mean taking home less, but more people move into paying tax, or pay the higher rate – so much so that Treasury expects to make £19bn from this move over four years. By 2026, the OBR reckons 1.3 million more people could become taxpayers and another 1 million could be pushed in to the 40% bracket. The upside is that this has all been put off by at least a year, and if things go better than expected a future budget might even see plans change. But family budgets already need to stretch further. Unmentioned in the budget, but coming down the track, are big rises in council tax, with some local authorities planning to increase bills by the maximum 4.99% they are allowed. Energy bills have started to tick upwards, and other services are also getting more expensive. If inflation takes off, the chill of those freezes will be felt. As is often the case with Tory budgets, the housing market played an important part in Sunak’s speech with confirmation of the heavily trailed return of 95% mortgages, and an extension of the stamp duty holiday. It was all good news for those who can afford to buy or are almost there, but is unlikely to be enough to turn “generation rent” into “generation buy” as billed. In England and Northern Ireland, the stamp duty threshold will remain at £500,000 until the end of June, which means it is likely that the scramble for bigger homes could continue throughout the spring. After that it will drop to £250,000 until the end of September – and we can expect an autumn of calls for it to stay that way, rather than reverting to the previous level of £125,000. So far the stamp duty holiday has driven up prices, creating almost as many problems for would-be buyers as the withdrawal of 95% mortgages. With the announcement of a government guarantee to get large loans going again, Sunak will help some thwarted buyers. But as well as pulling those large loans since the crisis hit, lenders have also spent the last year fiddling with criteria and more closely scrutinising the would-be borrowers who come through their doors. Some have limited the loans they will give to the self-employed, others have ruled out mortgages for those on furlough. Until the country is on a more even keel generally, it seems likely many people will still be locked out of large loans. And Sunak’s fixes are all at the demand side: there is nothing new to stimulate supply. That 5% buyers need to save as a deposit will keep getting bigger as long as prices go up, so homebuying will still remain outside the grasp of many. • This article was amended on 4 March 2021 to clarify that the stamp duty decisions apply only in England and Northern Ireland."
2021-03-03T17:52:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Culture sector cautiously welcomes budget but says further support needed,"The chancellor’s budget was cautiously welcomed by the culture sector but industry figures said it lacks detail in key areas and does not do enough to support those who have missed out on government support, such as freelancers. The extra £300m investment into the £1.57bn culture recovery fund was praised, as was the continuation of the lower VAT rate until September, but lack of a more substantial package for freelancers was criticised as “insulting”. Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, said the extension of furlough, self-employed support, business rates and VAT remaining at 5%, was hugely welcome and would “help ensure our industry can reopen with additional financial security”. Bird also welcomed the extension of the self-employment income support scheme (SEISS) to cover those filing in the 2019-20 tax year, but urged the government to “look at the plight of other individuals who have fallen through the gaps of furlough and self-employed support”. Philippa Childs, head of the creative industry union Bectu, said that the government had “grossly exaggerated” the difference the inclusion of the newly self-employed in the SEISS scheme would make. She said: “The changes do nothing to address the £50k cliff edge, fails to address the cut-off dates for accessing the schemes and in a final insult – the scheme will be winding up two months before the end of the furlough scheme.” Sir Cameron Mackintosh, best known for his West End productions of Cats and Les Miserables, said theatre producers would welcome any help the government is able to give but wanted more detail as he aims toward reopening on 17 May. He said: “The next crucial signpost for us in the commercial theatre will be early April when the government hopes to confirm the 12 April as their next step, leading to socially distanced shows being able to return on 17 May 2021.” Others were critical the lack of a government-backed insurance plan for music venues and festivals. There had been reports that the government is considering giving grants to event organisers affected by Covid-19, and underwriting an insurance scheme for major festivals, but the Treasury is reportedly concerned about the cost. The digital, culture, media and sport committee chair Julian Knight MP said it was “greatly disappointing” that the government has not backed cancellation insurance schemes for festivals, which he said “would provide a safety net should organisers need to cancel plans and enable more to go ahead with confidence this summer”. Nathan Clark, the owner of the Brudenell Social Club in Leeds, said he was buoyant about the future and the government support, but added the lack of insurance cover in the budget could impact smaller venues around the country. Clark said: “If festivals can’t go ahead securely without insurance then we’re going to lose the warm-up and auxiliary gigs that we live on. It’s a connected ecosphere.” Bird also said theatres were also calling for insurance cover in order to be able to reopen. “We call upon the government to put this in place as for other sectors,” he added. The University of Exeter professor Pascale Aebischer, who is leading research into how theatre has adapted to the pandemic in the past year, said that the budget meant that “key venues” were being protected at the expense of freelance staff. She said that institutions may well survive into the summer, but “they will struggle to reopen and produce the high-quality work which, in 2019, contributed an estimated £10.8bn to the UK economy,” without more support for freelancers. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, said: “It’s such a relief we can look ahead now so this funding is not just about survival but for planning and preparing for the reopening of theatres, galleries and gigs.”"
2021-03-03T17:40:22Z,uk-news,UK news,What did we learn from Nicola Sturgeon on Wednesday?,"When did Nicola Sturgeon first know of complaints against Alex Salmond? Sturgeon rebutted Salmond’s claim that she was first told about the allegations at a meeting on 29 March at Holyrood with his former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein. Sturgeon said that while Aberdein had indicated Salmond wanted to speak to her about a “harassment-type incident”, this was “in general terms”, and that what she remembered most were his concerns for the mental state of the former first minister. She says she accepts that people find it “hard to believe” that she initially forgot about that meeting. “But it was reading the permanent secretary’s letter, that he showed me on 2 April, that gave me the knowledge and the detail behind that knowledge.” “Reading that letter is a moment in my life I will never forget,” she told the committee. She said Salmond went on to tell her his version of what happened with one of the complainers, which he said he had apologised for at the time. “What he described constituted, in my view, deeply inappropriate behaviour on his part – perhaps another reason why that moment is embedded so strongly in my mind.” Sturgeon later said that she believed this meeting, and one in July, were “in a personal/party space”, rather than being government business, and that she had been warned by Aberdein that Salmond was considering resigning from the SNP. Salmond has denied this. She said that she had not discussed this with her husband, the SNP chief executive, Peter Murrell, because she “wanted to speak to [Salmond] before I set hares running with anyone else” in a confidential setting. Murrell previously told the inquiry he believed that the meeting was Scottish government business. Pressed on why she had not notified the civil service about the meeting – which Salmond and committee members suggest is a breach of the ministerial code – Sturgeon said: “In terms of notification under the ministerial code, it was not down to my classification of whether it was party or government. I agreed to the meeting on party/personal grounds, clearly what he came to discuss with me was a government investigation. What I decided to do then was based on my view that by telling people in the government that I know would potentially compromise the independence and confidentiality.”
Did Sturgeon offer to intervene in the original harassment inquiry on Salmond’s behalf? Evidence from Salmond’s lawyer Duncan Hamilton, released on Tuesday evening, stated that he had heard Sturgeon assure Salmond at that meeting that she would intervene in the inquiry on his behalf, telling him: “If it comes to it, I will.” But Sturgeon told MSPs: “I believe I did make it clear that I would not intervene. I also know I was trying to let a longstanding friend and colleague down gently and maybe I did it too gently and he left with an impression I did not intend to give.” She said: “I had no intention of intervening and crucially I did not intervene.” Sturgeon added that, during the meeting, her head was “spinning”. She said: “I was experiencing a maelstrom of emotions. I had been told something pretty shocking by Alex Salmond.” She went on to suggest that her refusal to intervene was “at the root” of Salmond’s anger towards her. Did Sturgeon’s official leak the name of a complainer to Salmond’s camp? Sturgeon said she believed there was an “alternative explanation” to the claim by Aberdein that he had been given the name of a complainer by a senior government official, which Duncan Hamilton and former party strategist Kevin Pringle have confirmed he told them about. She said that Aberdein and the official were willing to give private evidence to the committee, and had spoken to James Hamilton, a former director of public prosecutions in Ireland who is investigating her alleged breaches of the ministerial code. Asked who could corroborate her official’s denial, she reiterated that she was not a party to this conversation, nor were Hamilton or Pringle at the meeting themselves. She added that Salmond knew the identity of the two complainers, because he had apologised to one of them previously and had identified the other by going through the Scottish government’s Flickr account. Did Sturgeon address the allegations of a SNP conspiracy against Salmond? Sturgeon said she had seen “nothing that comes within a million miles” of Salmond’s central assertion that there was a “malicious plan” among those close to Sturgeon to destroy his reputation. Referring to text messages sent by a senior party figure – which Salmond has described as “shocking” and which the inquiry will have sight of later on Wednesday – she said they showed “people who were upset, at times angry, and cooperating with police inquiries”. Why did she keep talking to him about the case, by phone and in person, after she knew about the allegations? Asked this directly, Sturgeon responded: “I was dealing with a situation that involved somebody who was the former first minister facing a government investigation, the former leader of my party where this has had huge implication for my party and somebody that was a really close friend of mine, that I cared about. And all of these things led me to make these decisions and try to balance them overall in a way that I thought was appropriate.” She admitted she had asked herself: “Why did I do that?” about meeting him at her home a second time on 14 July, adding: “I still had this worry that it might be about to erupt and I was still concerned about him. I still felt a loyalty to him.” Did she go against legal advice to abandon the case against Salmond? Asked about Salmond’s allegation that the government was considering the sisting, or pausing, of the judicial review so that the criminal case could run its course, Sturgeon said: “The idea that we were gaming the timing of the judicial review to allow a police investigation to overtake it is absurd and bizarre and just completely without foundation.” Sturgeon also insisted that she was acting in accordance with the views of the law officers. Asked about advice in early December that Salmond was “more likely than not to succeed” and that “the least worst option would be to concede the petition”, she said the lord advocate was still clear it should be heard. She says this changed later in the month when further information emerged about the extent of the contact between the investigating officer and the complainers."
2021-03-03T17:37:57Z,uk-news,UK news,"NHS, social care and most vulnerable 'betrayed' by Sunak's budget ","A lack of support for care homes, the NHS and people on benefits led to claims that Rishi Sunak’s budget had left the country’s most vulnerable people “betrayed”. In his statement to the Commons, the chancellor ignored the social care system and set out only a temporary extension of the universal credit boost, potentially plunging 500,000 people into poverty next winter. The budget did not include any detailed plans for the NHS, and unions complained it was “strangely silent” on public services. The red book published alongside Sunak’s statement showed the NHS England budget will fall from £148bn in 2020-21 to £139bn in 2021-22. Health experts said the failure to give the NHS any extra cash, apart from the £1.65bn for the vaccine rollout, would leave it struggling to cope with the pandemic’s “challenging legacy” of a big backlog of surgery and increased mental illness. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which speaks for hospital trusts in England, said the decision showed that the chancellor needed to reaffirm his commitment to giving the NHS “whatever it needs” to deal with Covid. Labour accused Sunak of hiding a £30.1bn cut to the Department of Health and Social Care’s budget in his statement. The DHSC’s total spending was due to be £199.2bn this year, but was forecast in the budget to fall to £169.1bn in 2021-22. The difference is because the department received £58.9bn this year to cover the extra costs of tackling Covid-19, such as personal protective equipment, but is due to get much less next year – £22bn – for those purposes.
“Rishi Sunak promised to be ‘open and honest’ with the British public. But buried in the small print of his budget is a cut to frontline NHS services that will increase pressure on staff and do nothing for patients stuck on growing waiting lists,” said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary. Dr Charmaine Griffiths, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, warned that the NHS would be unable to tackle the “vast backlogs of treatment and care caused by the pandemic”. The IPPR thinktank said the budget showed a “shocking lack of health foresight” neither pre-empting likely rises in Covid infection this winter nor helping clear NHS backlogs. In a statement that left the social care sector “dismayed”, the chancellor failed to offer fresh support for care homes or their staff after more than 40,000 care residents died due to Covid. It also emerged the Treasury has said promised reforms of social care will not start until next year. The Relatives and Residents Association, which represents social care users, said the lack of support was “an insult to older people”. Campaigners warned that Sunak’s decision to end the £20-a-week uplift for universal credit in October risked creating “a perfect storm for the end of this year”. At that point unemployment benefit levels are estimated to fall to a 30-year low as furlough ends and job losses soar. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, accused the chancellor of failing to address inequality in the UK and said his budget “papered over the cracks rather than rebuilding the foundations”. He said it showed the government “doesn’t understand what went wrong in the last decade”. He said his party would have put the NHS and care homes “front and centre” adding “the chancellor may have forgotten it, but the Labour party never will”. Joseph Rowntree Foundation said the impact of the universal credit cut would be greatest in areas of the north of England, Wales and the West Midlands with already high levels of poverty, including so called “red wall” areas, which the government has pledged to support economically. Action for Children’s director of policy, Imran Hussain, said: “There’s no faster way to push more children into poverty than by snatching £20 a week out of the pockets of our country’s poorest families.” Alison Garnham, the chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: “Extending the £20 uplift is vital because struggling families cannot keep afloat without it, but … This decision only postpones the pain”. The Treasury was opposed to extending the universal credit top-up, worth £1,050 a year to universal credit and tax credit claimants, but has come under intense pressure to retain it in recent months from campaigners and opposition parties, as well as several back bench Tory MPs and even the Department for Work and Pensions. Starmer said Sunak had been “dragged kicking and screaming to increase universal credit”. It also emerged on Wednesday that the government appeared to have delayed social care reforms until 2022, with the Treasury secretary Steve Barclay telling campaigners plans for a “sustainable improvement” will only come next year. In January the prime minister told parliament “we will be bringing forward plans later this year”. The DHSC said it believed Barclay’s mention of next year was “a typo” and that its intention was to launch reforms this year. Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England which represents private care chains, said he was “disappointed that social care, the real frontline, hadn’t received the support that it so needs so badly”. His group has called for a £7bn 10-year cash injection into the sector, which has more than 100,000 staff vacancies. “The reform of care has once again been ignored at a time when the sector is in crisis after Covid-19 and with 1.4 million people not getting the care they need,” said the Independent Care Group industry body. Its chairman, Mike Padgham, added: “Social care and the vulnerable people who rely upon it have been betrayed. We have been left short-changed once again.” Christina McAnea, the general secretary of Unison which represents care workers, said there was nothing to “raise the morale of exhausted NHS workers and grant the pay rise they’ve more than earned”. The chancellor announced no extra support for nearly 2 million low income claimants of older disability and unemployment benefits. This group did not receive a £20 Covid top-up last year, prompting criticism the government had in effect created a two-tier benefit system. Health unions decried the absence of a pay rise for NHS staff, despite their dedication and hard work during the pandemic. “The chancellor had a golden opportunity to show the government values exhausted health staff with the pay rise they deserve. He has let them down, and the public”, said Unison’s head of health Sara Gorton, who chairs a group of 14 NHS unions which campaign on pay, terms and conditions."
2021-03-03T17:20:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Rishi Sunak digs in for battle against financial cost of Covid,"A last push for victory. Wartime metaphors have abounded since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and Rishi Sunak stuck closely to the martial theme in his second budget. The government would use the “full fiscal firepower” of the state to defeat the invisible enemy, he said. Comparisons with previous conflicts are appropriate if not always flattering. The government’s complacency and lack of preparation a year ago was a throwback to the Boer war. There were times when the damning judgment of the generals sending men to their deaths on the western front – lions led by donkeys – has seemed apposite. And, of course, there have been similarities with the second world war: the initial setbacks, the harnessing of science, the record peacetime borrowing, the “whatever it takes” mentality that has reduced the chancellor of the exchequer to the man who simply writes the cheques. Forget the freezing of personal tax allowances and the big jump in corporation tax, which are both post-dated. The package of measures the chancellor announced will inject £65bn into the economy, mostly in the next financial year. This was a giveaway package – and a big one at that.
There was an extension to the furlough until the end of September. An additional 600,000 self-employed workers will receive grants to cover loss of earnings. The business rates holiday will continue, while the hospitality, leisure and tourism sectors will pay a lower rate of VAT for another year. That measure alone costs the exchequer £5bn. Over the past 12 months Sunak has appeared 15 times on the Covid-19 battlefield and each engagement has involved him spending more money. In truth, he has had no choice. Failure to increase spending on the NHS would have led to even more deaths. The alternative to wage subsidies, business support and the patching up of an inadequate welfare safety net would have been economic Armageddon. Unsurprisingly, he has the highest approval ratings of any chancellor in recent decades and is comfortably the most popular member of the cabinet with the public. He has made mistakes but gone unpunished for them. What is more, the £352bn Treasury stimulus has – despite the wastage and the fraud – been money well spent. A year ago, there were fears the unemployment rate would shoot up to 1930s levels as a result of the enforced closure of much the economy. The latest forecast from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility put the peak in joblessness at 6.5%, down from 7.5% three months ago, and half the level that might have been expected given the economy has contracted by 11% in a year. Throughout the crisis Sunak has talked tough about the eventual need to get to grips with the deficit. Until now, though, the only similarity between him and Sir Stafford Cripps – the original austerity chancellor – has been their teetotalism. But here were the first signs of Sunak unleashing his inner Cripps. Corporation tax is to rise from 19% to 25% for bigger companies in one hit in 2023, with the personal allowance and the higher rate threshold frozen for four years from April 2022. Business was prepared to pay more corporation tax but expected the increase to be incremental and capped at 23%. As one business leader noted, the idea that the government is planning a post-Brexit, low-tax Singapore-on-Thames looks misplaced. But Sunak will be hoping his investment incentives – especially the 130% super-deduction for the next two years – leads to stronger, less consumer-dependent growth and a more rapid reduction in the budget deficit than the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is forecasting. That would certainly be welcome. Without the attempts to boost the supply-side capacity of the economy, there is clearly the risk that the recovery will be almost entirely the result of individuals going on a massive spending binge once restrictions are lifted. The Treasury accepts that much of the investment that will take place in the next two years will be brought forward from the future to take advantage of the generous tax break but says there will be some additional capital spending totalling £10bn by the middle of the decade. Even assuming Sunak is right, that is still relatively small beer in the context of a £2tn-plus economy. The OBR is clearly not expecting any dramatic improvement in the economy’s underlying performance. The economy is expected to grow by 4% this year and by more than 7% in 2022, but this is simply the result of making up the ground lost over the past 12 months. In 2023 – the year when the corporation tax increase kicks in – growth reverts to its trend of just over 1.5% a year.
There are those who think the economy may perform a bit better than that. Gerard Lyons, who was Boris Johnson’s chief economic adviser when the prime minister was mayor of London, said: “I expect the economy to recover strongly over the next two years and today’s investment super-deductor will give investment a further boost. As growth rebounds the deficit numbers will improve and the chancellor may decide then not to raise corporation tax so far.” The thought that he may be able to reverse some of Wednesday’s tax increases will have occurred to Sunak too. This was a budget partly about winning a war. It was also a budget with one eye firmly on winning the election after pandemic victory is assured."
2021-03-03T16:59:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Northern Ireland council withdraws plan to honour Hercules Mulligan,"A Northern Ireland borough council has withdrawn a plan to honour a Northern Ireland emigrant who played a key role in the American revolution after discovering he had owned a slave. The Causeway Coast and Glens borough council decided last month to recognise Hercules Mulligan, who was born in Coleraine, County Derry, for his exploits during America’s war of independence. The tailor spied on British officers in New York, reputedly saved the life of George Washington and mentored Alexander Hamilton, one of the founding fathers. He was also a founder of the New York Manumission Society, which promoted the abolition of slavery, The actor Okieriete Onaodowan played Mulligan in the Broadway musical Hamilton. However, the council’s plan to recognise the Mulligan in heritage trails prompted swift criticism from a Derry historian, Stephen McCracken, and community groups on the grounds that Mulligan had owned slaves. The North West Migrants’ Forum sent an open letter, endorsed by other groups, condemning the planned honour. “Hercules Mulligan subscribed to and practised the ideology of holding people in enslavement. Portraying him as a hero when he was still a slave owner five years after he helped set up the New York Manumission Society is glorifying slavery and that is disgraceful.” Yvonne Boyle, an Alliance party councillor who had made the original proposal, withdrew it this week, saying history was a “messy business”. Mulligan was a boy when he moved to New York. In the 1770s he sided with those resisting British rule and used his job as a tailor to gather intelligence from British officers who discussed military operations while being fitted for uniforms. Some historians credit Mulligan with twice saving Washington from capture and execution and with helping the rebel forces to defeat the troops of King George III. Mulligan is said to have toppled a statue of the king that was melted down to make 40,000 bullets. He is buried close to Hamilton in a Manhattan church cemetery."
2021-03-03T16:23:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Police won't be prosecuted over WhatsApp remarks about black actor,"The Crown Prosecution Service has decided not to prosecute three police officers for allegedly racist remarks about a black British actor. The police force had sought authorisation from the CPS to charge their own officers over the incident. Last year one police officer from Cambridgeshire constabulary was suspended and two others were placed on restricted duties after allegedly racist remarks were exchanged on a WhatsApp group under an image of the British actor and writer Kayode Ewumi. In the exchange on the social media app, one of the officers posted a meme of Ewumi, 27, which went viral in 2017. The image shows Ewumi as his character Reece Simpson, also known as Roll Safe, in the BBC Three comedy #HoodDocumentary, where he taps his finger to the side of his head having just thought of something. Underneath the image of Ewumi, a second police officer wrote the word “monkey” then posted an image of a baby monkey hanging on to a tree branch. A third officer wrote “lol” underneath the image of the monkey. The team of police officers in the WhatsApp group at the time the messages were exchanged were mainly white. But one minority ethnic officer in the team made an official complaint after receiving the messages on his family mobile phone, where it was seen by his three children. The incident was referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which asked the police force’s professional standards department to investigate. Initially, gross misconduct proceedings against the officers were considered, but these proceedings have now been reduced to misconduct and the suspension of one of the three officers has been lifted. Attiq Malik of Liberty Law Solicitors, who is representing the officer who said he believed the exchanges were racist and made a complaint, said that the Cambridgeshire constabulary update on the case was “disappointing”. “Even if the CPS has taken the decision not to prosecute it doesn’t automatically follow that gross misconduct proceedings against police officers should be changed to misconduct proceedings,” Malik said. A spokesperson for Cambridgeshire constabulary said: “In early May 2020 a complaint was made about an allegedly racist exchange on WhatsApp between officers in Peterborough. Following this complaint, a referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct who directed an investigation should be conducted by our professional standards department. Two officers were placed on restricted duties and a third suspended while a thorough investigation took place. A file was submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service seeking authorisation to charge the officers with malicious communications. “This file was reviewed by a senior prosecutor and a hate crime specialist who, with the entire history of the group conversation available, concluded that no further action should be taken. In light of this decision, gross misconduct proceedings were reduced to misconduct and the suspension was lifted. “The behaviour and practice of officers involved in this matter were assessed by the professional standards department as requiring improvement, and work on this is under way.”"

2021-03-03T16:11:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Rishi Sunak flags tax rises in budget as total Covid spending tops Â£400bn,"Rishi Sunak has outlined tax rises on companies and workers to pay for an additional £65bn of financial support to see Britain through the coronavirus pandemic, taking total government spending on the crisis to more than £400bn. The chancellor trailed before the budget that he would extend the furlough scheme until September, and allocated billions of pounds in business grants and tax cuts to help employers while lockdown restrictions remain and the economy takes time to recover from the worst recession in 300 years. Giving his budget speech in the Commons, Sunak said he would continue to do “whatever it takes” while it took time for growth to bounce back after restrictions have been lifted. “It’s going to take this country, and the whole world, a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover,” he said.
However, he said the rate of corporation tax would need to go up to 25% for the most profitable companies in Britain from April 2023, in a major reversal of Conservative economic policy of recent decades, to pay for the damage to the exchequer inflicted by Covid-19. Aiming to raise £17bn a year by the middle of the decade, Sunak’s plan to increase the rate of corporation tax for the first time since Denis Healey in 1974 will, however, threaten a backlash from backbench Tory MPs more typically in favour of lower tax policies. Plans to raise billions more from income taxes through a freeze in the threshold at which workers start paying them is also politically delicate ground for the Tories after promising in the 2019 election to keep taxes low. Although committing not to raise income tax, national insurance and VAT at the election, he set out plans for a stealth raid – holding the threshold for basic and higher rate earners steady until 2026, in a move that should raise about £8bn a year within five years.
Making his 15th crisis-related announcement in a year when the pandemic crashed Britain’s economy into the deepest recession for more than 300 years, the chancellor said his priority was to see the economy emerge from the third lockdown without triggering mass unemployment and a wave of business failures. Official figures announced by the chancellor forecast the British economy to grow by 4% this year, recovering from an almost 10% drop in 2020, with rapid progress on the vaccination programme enabling the economy to return to its pre-pandemic level by the middle of next year – six months earlier than expected. Sunak said the budget deficit – the gap between spending and receipts – would, however, soar to a peacetime record of £355bn this year, or 17% of GDP, in a reflection of the scale of the government response to Covid-19. But because of his actions to raise taxes, the deficit is expected to shrink to less than 3% of GDP by the time of the next election in the middle of the 2020s.
Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said the budget “papered over the cracks” rather than setting out concrete plans to rebuild the foundations of Britain’s economy in stronger form than before the pandemic. “I’m afraid this budget won’t feel so good for the millions of key workers who are having their pay frozen, for the businesses swamped by debt and the families paying more in council tax and the millions of people who are out of work or worried about losing their job,” he said. Seeking to pin personal responsibility on Sunak for other government decisions about tackling the pandemic, Starmer said “after 11 months in this job it’s nice to finally be standing opposite the person actually making decisions in this government”.
He also blamed “the chancellor’s decisions” for Britain facing a “worse economic crisis than any major economy”, accusing him of having blocked a “circuit-breaker” in September 2020 to clamp down earlier on rising Covid cases. On policy, the Labour leader said the budget was “almost silent” on the NHS and social care, and that the measures announced on Wednesday “stop way short of what was needed” to tackle the climate emergency. The government’s plan to offer 5% mortgages was also a “failed policy” “lifted” from the former chancellor George Obsorne, Starmer said, and new support for approximately 600,000 self-employed people “fell far short of what’s needed”.
Crucially, Starmer seemed to lend his support to corporation tax rising “in the long run”, but he said Sunak was “itching to get back to his free-market principles and pull away support as quickly as he can”. “One day we’ll all be able to take our masks off and so will the chancellor and then you’ll see who he really is,” the Labour leader added.
Conservatives broadly rallied round Sunak, though the Tory chair of the Treasury select committee, Mel Stride, admitted concern that no plan was revealed to help small and medium-sized companies manage high levels of debt they may have built up to stay afloat. “Many of those businesses will struggle with the level of debt they have and will not be growing when we want them to be creating the jobs of the future,” he said. And Julian Knight, a Tory MP who chairs the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, added it was “greatly disappointing” no cancellation insurance scheme for festivals was promised, to give a “safety net” to organisers hoping to hold events this summer."
2021-03-03T16:08:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Thalidomide scandal: Sunak pledges lifetime support for survivors,"Thalidomide campaigners have reacted with relief and joy after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, pledged a “lifetime commitment” of funding to support survivors of the scandal. Announcing the budget on Wednesday, Sunak said funding to support survivors of the thalidomide scandal was due to run out in 2023, adding: “They deserve better than to have constant uncertainty about the future costs of their care. So not only will I extend this funding with an initial downpayment of around £40m, I am today announcing a lifetime commitment, guaranteeing funding for ever.” Sunak also announced £19m to tackle domestic abuse in England and Wales, with funding for a network of “respite rooms” to support homeless women, and £10m to support veterans with mental health needs across the UK. “We’re all so happy, relieved and grateful,” said Nick Dobrik, a thalidomide survivor who has long campaigned for the victims’ compensation funding to continue past 2023. “These funds are vital to ensure that we have dignity and independence in old age. I’m 61 but feel like I’m in my 80s. Because of my disabilities, I’ve had to use my body in ways it wasn’t meant to be used. As a result, I have constant pain in my shoulders and my fingers, which means that finding gainful employment is very difficult.” The Tory MP Simon Hoare, the vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for thalidomide, also welcomed the announcement. “I am incredibly grateful to Rishi for hearing our case and responding so warmly and fully. The relief that the thalidomide community feels in the knowledge that this is an issue resolved for life is incalculable.” The thalidomide scandal was one of the world’s worst drug disasters. Caused by a medicine prescribed to pregnant women as a treatment for morning sickness in the late 1950s and early 1960s, about 10,000 babies worldwide were born with severe and life-changing deformities before the drug was withdrawn in 1961.
There are 312 remaining survivors in the UK. Their disabilities range from the mildly affected to those who have severely disfigured hands and feet, or have no arms or legs, and who are dependent on others in every aspect of daily living. As this community ages – the average age is now 59 – their mental and physical health needs were growing, said Deborah Jack, the chief executive of the Thalidomide Trust. “The worry that the surviving thalidomiders have had looming over them in recent years is that the funding would run out just as they were facing increased health issues as a direct result of their disabilities,” she said. The trust has been working closely with the Department of Health and Social Care and the Treasury to get the funding extended. Data collected by the trust and submitted to the government shows that thalidomide survivors live with significantly worse physical and mental health than the general population of the same age and that there has been a marked deterioration in recent years. The research found that in addition to poorer physical health, they experienced a greater prevalence of poor mental health than the general population. “As they age, it is becoming increasingly clear that the normal deterioration in health associated with ageing has a disproportionate impact on thalidomide survivors because of their disabilities,” said Jack. “Many beneficiaries have been reliant on informal family care throughout their lives and in recent years this support has been disrupted by children leaving home, parents sadly becoming infirm and passing away, and relationships breaking down or partners becoming unwell and needing care themselves. “As a result, an increasing number now require paid professional care.”"
2021-03-03T15:47:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Budget 2021: Keir Starmer backs delay in raising corporation tax,"Keir Starmer has signalled that Labour will back plans to increase corporation tax from 2023, reiterating the party’s opposition to immediate tax rises that caused a backlash from the left. The delay in the rise in corporation tax allowed Starmer to swerve a row that might have split the party had Rishi Sunak announced immediate rises which Labour said it would oppose. It is understood that some in the party believe the pre-briefings on tax were a trap for Labour to call for immediate tax rises – which the chancellor would have then insisted on delaying. The Guardian has seen briefings to Labour MPs before the budget of “lines to take” if asked to do media appearances – which say the party would oppose immediate rises in corporation tax, as well any immediate rise in capital gains tax, which was not in Sunak’s budget. Party sources said they would now turn their fire on Sunak’s lack of focus on the public sector – especially any roadmap for the reform of social care, which had been hit hard by the pandemic. Sources also highlighted the fine print in the budget which reveals billions in departmental spending cuts. Labour will focus its attention on these in the coming days. “It is the key signal we were looking for that the Tories plan to return to their old ways,” one senior adviser said. “Buried in this is a return to smaller public services, cutting public sector budgets, cutting hospital budgets, freezing pay.” Speaking in the House of Commons, Starmer said a Labour chancellor would have put NHS investment and social care reform “front and centre”. Starmer and the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, had voiced strong opposition to tax rises in the week leading up to the budget, including when pressed on a proposed increase to corporation tax. Dodds later said the party was prepared to back a rise later in the parliament. Responding to Sunak’s announcement that the tax on company profits would rise from 19% to 25% from 2023, Starmer signalled that the delay was sufficient for the party’s backing. “The IMF and the OECD have said now isn’t the time for tax rises. We’re in the middle of a once-in-300-year crisis. Our economy is still shut. Our businesses are on life support,” he said. “So it’s right that corporation tax isn’t rising this year or next. Of course in the long run corporation tax should go up. The decade-long corporation tax experiment by this government has failed.” At the last election under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, Labour planned to raise corporation tax to 26%, staggered over three years. The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell tweeted that Sunak “steals my rhetoric but no substance” and said working people would be hit hard by the freeze to the income tax threshold and the cliff-edge cut to the universal credit uplift, which Sunak said would end in the spring.
Labour sources said there were key holes in the budget that the party could exploit, including the absence of a plan for social care reform and the chancellor’s own role in creating the economic crisis. In the detail of the budget, NHS England core resource spending, including Covid spending, will fall from £147.7bn this year to £139.1bn next year. “How are they going to address backlogs and waiting lists?” a Labour source said. Starmer said the chancellor was yet again deferring decisions on social care. “We heard nothing about a long-term plan to fix social care. The chancellor may have forgotten about it but the Labour party never will.” Attacking the government’s Covid response, Starmer said: “This is the chancellor who bought who blocked a circuit breaker in September, ignoring the science. He told the British people to live with coronavirus and live without fear.” Starmer said the budget offered little to address inequality and help people in left-behind northern towns, and he said his party would extend the £20-a-week universal credit uplift indefinitely until the welfare system could be reformed, as Labour has pledged to do. “For the chancellor, ‘levelling up’ seems to mean moving some parts of the Treasury to Darlington, creating a few freeports and re-announcing funding,” he said. “That isn’t levelling up, it’s giving up.” Labour MPs said they were mollified by the party’s decision to back longer-term rises in corporation tax, though some expressed alarm that the party had also planned to oppose a rise in capital gains tax. “Labour being all over the shop on business taxes allows the Tories to get away with the income tax [threshold] freeze which is particularly bad,” one MP said. Ben Bradshaw, a former Labour shadow cabinet minister, said he backed the approach to taxation. “He [Starmer] and Anneliese clearly won the argument that it would have been economically illiterate to raise taxes now.” Another Labour MP also said they had been heartened by a new focus by Starmer on Brexit, as the Labour leader pointed out flaws in the trade deal that would hit manufacturing. Richard Burgon, a former shadow cabinet minister, said Labour needed to lay out a bolder plan in response – akin to that seen across the Atlantic. “There was a real failure to announce a stimulus on the level that Biden is planning for the US which could have boosted jobs, incomes and equality,” he said. “That offers a real space for Labour to spell out a vision for a huge programme of public investment in a green new deal, public services and social care.”"
2021-03-03T14:49:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Ex-Tory MP fails in bid to appeal against jail term for sexual assault,"The former Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke has failed in an attempt to seek leave to appeal against his two-year sentence for sexual assaults against two women. The judge who oversaw his trial was right to conclude that the former politician was someone prepared to exploit women for sexual purposes, judges at the court of appeal ruled. Elphicke, who represented the constituency of Dover in Kent from 2010 until 2019, was convicted in July last year of the charges, two in relation to a parliamentary worker in 2016 and one in relation to a woman at his family’s central London home in 2007. His barrister advanced an application at the Royal Courts of Justice for leave to appeal on a number of the grounds of harm, culpability, mitigation and suspension. The judge had not fully taken the impact of Covid-19 into account in imposing a custodial sentence, argued Rachna Gokani, who added that Elphicke had not seen his 13-year-old son for six months. Conditions in prison due to the pandemic had been such that the 49-year-old had spent 47 hours inside his cell on one occasion and had also caught Covid-19. However, the court of appeal judges rejected her arguments, including the contention that the trial judge should have categorised harm caused by Elphicke’s actions in a different way and that one of the two women he assaulted should not have been categorised as vulnerable at the time. In the case of one of the women, who was assaulted by him in 2007, the judges said he had perpetrated a “hard, deliberate grope” involving a mixture of contact with her bra and breast. It was an “aggressive” assault while she was vulnerable and she had to push him off. Delivering the ruling, Lady Justice Carr said Mrs Justice Whipple’s description of Elphicke as a “sexual predator” was an emotive phrase but it did not affect the sentencing. “We asked ourselves whether, standing back, there is any arguable basis to contend that the overall sentence of two years’ immediate imprisonment is manifestly excessive,” she said in the judges’ conclusion, which found the original trial judge was right to pass consecutive sentences for offences that involved separate victims and that took place years apart. There was no realistic basis for impugning the custodial terms that were arrived at, the judges said, which reflected the “undoubted seriousness of the offences”."
2021-03-03T13:19:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Nicola Sturgeon apologises to women failed by Alex Salmond investigation,"Nicola Sturgeon has apologised directly to the two women who were failed by the Scottish government’s investigation into their sexual harassment complaints against Alex Salmond, but denied there was any plot against the former first minister. Sturgeon is under intense pressure to answer multiple allegations that she misled parliament as she gives evidence to the inquiry into her government’s handling of the complaints, after previously secret legal advice and new witness evidence released on Tuesday evening led to calls for her resignation as first minister. Giving evidence to the inquiry last Friday, Salmond said there was “no doubt” that Sturgeon had broken the ministerial code on multiple occasions. Commencing her evidence session under oath on Wednesday morning, Sturgeon accepted her government had made a “very serious mistake” in appointing as the investigating officer into the allegations a senior official who had previously met and briefed the two complainers. She said her government had “tried to do the right thing”, and that it was an “absurd suggestion that anyone acted with malice or as part of a plot against Alex Salmond”. She told MSPs: “As first minister, I refused to follow the age-old pattern of allowing a powerful man to use his status and connection to get what he wants.” Sturgeon also told the inquiry that while his acquittal on 13 sexual assault charges in March 2020 was “beyond question”, she knew from her own conversations with Salmond that “his behaviour was not always appropriate”. She said she had searched his testimony on Friday for “any sign at all that he recognised how difficult this has been for others too. First and foremost for women who believed his behaviour towards them was inappropriate. And yet across six hours of testimony, there was not a single word of regret, reflection or even simple acknowledgement of that. I can only hope that in private the reality might be different.” She also addressed in her early remarks one of the key charges levelled against her by her former mentor, about when she first learned about the allegations. Salmond, supported by two other witnesses, claimed she was told about them by his former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein in her office on 29 March 2018. Sturgeon had previously told Holyrood and the media she first learned of them from Salmond himself, at their meeting at her home on 2 April. Sturgeon said that while Aberdein had indicated Salmond wanted to speak to her about a “harassment-type incident”, this was “in general terms”, and what she recalled most from the conversation was how concerned Aberdein had been about Salmond’s wellbeing. She said the meeting with Salmond at her home on 2 April was when she fully grasped the nature of the allegations. She said Salmond asked her to read a letter he had been sent by the head of the civil service, Leslie Evans, which detailed the accusations. “Reading that letter is a moment in my life I will never forget,” she told the committee. She said Salmond went on the tell her his version of what happened with one of the complainers: “What he described constituted in my view was deeply inappropriate on his part.” However, she also said had she been fully informed of the allegation at the 29 March meeting, her actions would not necessarily have been different. She said: “Given what I was told about the distress Alex was in, and how it was suggested to me that he might be intending to handle matters, it is likely that I would have still agreed to meet him – as his friend and as his party leader.” She added: “My decision not to record the meeting on 2 April immediately wasn’t about the classification I gave it, not about it being a party rather than a government meeting, it was because I did not want to compromise the independence of the confidentiality of the process under way.” Sturgeon also denied the new sexual harassment policy was “bespoke” and designed to apply to Alex Salmond because it was drafted to include complaints about former ministers: “To see it in that way really ignores what was happening globally [with the #MeToo movement].” In her opening statement, Sturgeon also told the committee she did not intervene in the process of the Scottish government’s investigation into harassment complaints against Salmond as doing so would have been an “abuse” of her role. In a letter to a Holyrood committee, also released on Tuesday evening, one of Salmond’s lawyers, Duncan Hamilton, backed the former first minister’s claim that Sturgeon had offered to intervene in the initial investigation on Salmond’s behalf in a private meeting at her home on 2 April 2018."
2021-03-03T12:41:16Z,uk-news,UK news,Budget 2021: key points at a glance,"Sunak’s opening remarks The chancellor says he would do “whatever it takes” during the pandemic, and that he has done and will continue to do so. He says there has been acute damage to the economy, with more than 700,000 people losing their jobs, the economy shrinking by 10% – the largest fall in 300 years, and borrowing is highest it has been outside of wartime. “It’s going to take this country, and the whole world, a long time to recover from this extraordinary situation,” he says. Sunak also says he wants to be honest about the government’s plans for fixing the public finances, and set out plans for the future. Peter Walker, political correspondent: Two likely repeated tropes make an early appearance. First, Sunak stresses the “acute” damage that coronavirus has done to the economy, a not-very-coded warning of difficult decisions to come. There is also an outing for a Brand Sunak buzz phrase – that he will do “whatever it takes” to protect people from the economic impact of Covid. Growth The chancellor says the economy will recover more quickly from the pandemic than previously thought, with the economy returning to its pre-pandemic size six months earlier, by the middle of next year. He says that in five years’ time the economy will still be 3% smaller than it otherwise would have been without Covid. GDP will grow by 4% this year, according to official forecasts made by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). GDP will grow by 7.3% next year. In November, the OBR said its “central scenario” was for GDP growth of 5.5% in 2021. It comes after the economy shrank by 9.9% in 2020, the biggest fall since 1709. PW: Yet more caution-and-context from Sunak, who stresses that coronavirus has done “profound damage” to the UK economy. Again, this is a warning to MPs and the public to expect tax rises, if not immediately then in the near future.
Furlough The chancellor says unemployment will peak at 6.5%, down from a forecasted peak of 11.9% last July. That means 1.8 million fewer people are expected to be out of work than previously thought, he says. Sunak confirms the extension of the furlough scheme until the end of September, as previously announced late on Tuesday. Employees will continue to receive 80% of their wages until the scheme ends, but firms will be asked to contribute 10% in July and 20% in August and September as the scheme is gradually phased out. Sunak also confirms the self-employment income support scheme has also been extended. The fourth grant will cover February to April, worth 80% of average trading profits up to £7,500. The £20-a-week increase in universal credit is extended for six months. PW: The extension of furlough and the extension of support to self-employed people are among the many pre-trailed elements of this budget, and none of this is a surprise. Similarly, the six-month extension of the universal credit increase was also briefed in advance. Politically, this is still the (relatively) easy part of Sunak’s job. By the time of the next budget, he – or another chancellor – could be facing a significant jobs crisis.
Business support The chancellor confirms the £5bn restart grant for businesses to help companies get going after lockdown. He says total direct cash support to businesses has reached £25bn. As the government-backed bounce back loan (BBL) and coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) come to an end, the Treasury is launching a new loan scheme to run until the end of the year. Loans can be between £25,000 and £10m. Hospitality and leisure businesses pay no business rates for three months, then rates will be discounted for the remaining nine months of the year by two-thirds, in a £6bn tax cut. 5% reduced rate of VAT will be extended until the end of September. Then it will be gradually increased, at 12.5% for six months, before returning to the standard rate from April 2022. Sunak says this is a cut worth £5bn. PW: Yet more money being sprayed around to support businesses recovering from Covid. Once more, a fair bit of this was known in advance. We are almost 15 minutes into the speech, without any big surprises. We are a long way from the era when every detail in a budget was kept locked away until announced in the Commons. Housing Sunak announces the stamp duty holiday will be extended. As expected, stamp duty holiday on properties up to £500,000 continues until the end of June. It will be kept at double its standard level until the end of September, and then return to usual levels from 1 October. The chancellor confirms a mortgage guarantee to help first-time buyers access 95% mortgages. PW: Without wishing to sound like a broken record, the extension of stamp duty cut and help for 95% mortgages were both widely trailed. It is more or less an annual feature of recent budgets that they promise to extend the ability of people to buy properties, but very little seems to change, as prices rise ever more. Spending Total Covid support package this year and next is £352bn, the chancellor says. Sunak says the response to the pandemic has been one of the largest and most sustained the country has ever seen. PW: It is not the norm for Conservative chancellors to boast about how much money they have spent. But these are very much not normal times. Borrowing Sunak says the budget deficit will be £355bn this year, or 17% of GDP – the highest level in peacetime. He says that without corrective action, borrowing would continue at very high levels, leaving underlying debt rising indefinitely. Because of the actions he is taking, he says borrowing will fall to 4.5% of GDP in 2022-23, then to 3.5% in 2023-24, then 2.9 and 2.8% in the following two years. The national debt – the sum total of every budget deficit – will rise from 88.8% of GDP this year to 93.8% next year, it will peak at 97.1% in 2023-24, before stabilising and falling slightly to 97% and 96.8% in the final two years of the forecast. In November, the OBR estimated a budget deficit – the gap between spending and receipts – of £394bn for 2020-21. The chancellor says this matters because the amount borrowed is only comparable to the two world wars. “It’s going to be the work of many governments over many decades to pay it back, just as it would be irresponsible to withdraw support too soon, it would also be irresponsible to allow our future borrowing and debt to rise unchecked,” he says. PW: If anyone listening might have briefly forgotten that Sunak is in fact a Tory chancellor, the grave tone he takes in talking about borrowing serves as a reminder. We are still, politically, some way from the Cameron/Osborne austerity era, but Sunak gives this an approving shout-out – something more for the Conservative backbenchers than the watching public.
Fixing the public finances The chancellor says the government will take a “fair” approach to “fixing the public finances”. The government will not raise national insurance, income tax or VAT, but will freeze personal tax thresholds – as anticipated. The personal allowance will remain at £12,750 until 2026. The higher-rate threshold will increase to £50,270 next year, and also remain at that level. The inheritance tax threshold, pensions lifetime allowance, annual exempt allowance from capital gains tax and VAT exemption threshold will also be frozen.
Corporation tax In April 2023, the rate of corporation tax will increase to 25%. Sunak says this will be the lowest rate in the G7. Sunak says businesses will only be impacted if they are making profits, and the change will only come in once the OBR forecasts the economy will be recovering. The rate will be tapered so that only businesses with profits of more than £250,000 will be taxed at the full 25% rate; that means only 10% of companies will pay the full higher rate. Companies with profits of less than £50,000 will remain at 19%. “It’s a tax rise on company profits, but only on the larger more profitable companies, and only in two years’ time,” Sunak says. The government is investing £25bn by allowing a 130% super-deduction on tax for investments made by companies. This means firms can cut their taxes by up to 25p for every pound they invest. PW: This is a pretty big rise, but the deferment to 2023 and other measures are calculated to muffle business protests. Labour – which has only said it will oppose immediate tax increases – will now have to decide whether it will back it. For the other measure, in political terms, freezing personal tax thresholds is something of a stealth tax – it’s a benefit deferred, not a penalty imposed, even if Sunak says he is being very open about this. In Brand Sunak terms, “super-deduction” isn’t quite as snappy as “eat out to help out”, and the chancellor has to use an example to better explain exactly what he means, but it will be seen as a countermeasure to the corporation tax increase, and wins some cheers from his MPs. Duties Alcohol duties will be frozen for the second year in a row. Fuel duty will also be frozen. PW: The freeze to fuel duty was, once again, widely expected, and is a testament to the astonishingly strong lobbying efforts by Tory backbenchers on this front, which continue to reap success, year after year, whatever other green measures or targets. Low-carbon investment The chancellor announces the new national infrastructure bank will open in Leeds with £12bn capitalisation from the government. Green projects will be supported through a green recovery bond. The chancellor says the Treasury will reform the Bank of England’s mandate to include targeting net zero emissions, in addition to the existing 2% inflation target. PW: The green announcements – also now more or less obligatory in budgets – are fairly modest, and you can expect Labour, especially the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, to argue this is an opportunity missed for a post-Covid green revolution. Levelling up The chancellor confirms the Treasury will establish an economic campus in Darlington, alongside the business, international trade, and housing and communities departments among others. Sunak announces more than £1bn funding for 45 new “town deals” across the UK. Freeports – special economic zones with different rules to make it easier and cheaper to do business – will be launched. They will include infrastructure planning, customs and favourable duties and taxes. Sunak announces eight locations in England: East Midlands airport, Felixstowe and Harwich, Humber, Liverpool city region, Plymouth, Solent, Thames and Teesside. PW: The idea of shunting government departments to non-London locations has long been a popular one, but can seem symbolic, and as ever, the idea of “levelling up” still feels slightly nebulous. Much of the Conservatives’ 2024 election chances will depend on being able to make it feel to voters like it is something genuine."
2021-03-03T11:59:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Rishi Sunak says scale of borrowing cannot be ignored,"Rishi Sunak has kicked off budget day with a dire warning to his cabinet colleagues that it would not be “right or responsible” for a Conservative government to ignore the scale of government borrowing caused by the Covid crisis. Giving the cabinet a preview of his budget plans on Wednesday morning, the chancellor stressed that the cost of supporting the economy and the NHS through the pandemic had taken borrowing to levels usually only seen in wartime.
According to a readout issued by No 10, the chancellor said “we must be honest with ourselves and the country about what that has meant. We are borrowing on an extraordinary scale – equivalent only to wartime levels.” “He said that, as a Conservative government, we know that we cannot ignore this problem and it wouldn’t be right or responsible to do so.” With Keir Starmer – along with many economists – warning against immediate tax increases because of the risks of choking off the recovery, Sunak is keen to draw a political dividing line with Labour, portraying the opposition as irresponsible. Starmer’s caution has alarmed some in his own party, who would like Labour to back some tax increases – on businesses that have performed well during the crisis, for example. The chancellor is widely expected to set out a package of tax increases in Wednesday’s statement, alongside confirming that key economic support measures, including the furlough scheme, will be extended. Some Conservative backbenchers have joined Labour in warning against tax increases, fearing they will hit businesses and consumers already struggling to emerge from the crisis. Sunak told the cabinet that despite the deep downturn caused by shuttering many sectors of the economy for months on end, he was “optimistic” about the future, and would set out investment plans aimed at making the UK a “science superpower”. And he claimed the government’s costly rescue measures were possible only because of “the prudence of the Conservative government over a long period of time, which meant the country had gone into the crisis with strong public finances”. Sunak told his colleagues the budget would “begin the work of building our future economy”, by investing in skills and infrastructure, and contribute to the government’s aim of “levelling up” the UK."
2021-03-03T11:48:22Z,uk-news,UK news,Body of man killed in Greece in 2018 is returned home to UK,"The body of a man who was murdered in Greece has arrived back home in Manchester after a two-and-a-half-year legal battle. Lee Robinson, 41, was stabbed to death on the streets of Athens in December 2018. His family in Manchester were only told of his murder 16 months later after a DNA match on the Interpol database. By then he had been buried in an unmarked grave, as the Greek authorities had been unable to identify him. The family had lost touch with him three years before his death. Before he went to Greece he had been sleeping in hostels and on the streets of Manchester on and off after a breakdown. In August 2015, he was found living in a hostel and brought home, but by October he had gone missing again. In December 2015, the family opened his bank statements and learned that he had bought a ticket to fly to Corfu. They alerted the police and were told that despite him being on the missing persons register, he had been able to board the flight. They never saw him again. In May 2020, British police turned up at his sister Shelley’s house to tell her that they had found him. He had been stabbed to death in a random attack as he slept in an abandoned building used by homeless people. A 32-year-old man confessed to the killing and is now in a psychiatric hospital. Shelley said finding out how her brother had died was devastating. “The worst thing was finding out that it had happened so long ago, knowing that he had passed away all that time and we had been getting on with our lives oblivious.” Victim Support helped the family find a solicitor to bring his body home. It was not an easy task. Getting a new death certificate issued was just one of a number of legal hurdles that had to be overcome by Mike Hagan, a travel litigation solicitor at Fletchers in the UK, and his Greek counterpart George Moschos, of Pavlakis Moschos Associates. The certificate has been issued and Robinson’s body was repatriated this week and is in a funeral home in Manchester. Hagan said: “This is a tragic case, and the family have been left utterly bereft by Lee’s murder. The fact that he was buried in an unmarked grave only made their already terrible loss more painful. We are glad to be assisting the family to obtain some measure of comfort, in being able to bring Lee home and have a burial for him in his homeland, at which his friends and family can properly grieve and say goodbye.”"
2021-03-03T11:11:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Home Office delays leave Sri Lankan man in immigration limbo,"A man who came to the UK to train as an accountant almost 40 years ago has been left homeless after a catalogue of Home Office delays. Ponnampalam Jothibala, 69, a Sri Lankan Tamil, came to the UK in 1983 to take up a place on a course at the London School of Accountancy with hopes of forging a professional career. He was granted periods of temporary leave to remain by the Home Office in the 1980s but halted his studies after experiencing trauma as a victim of an arson attack in which three people died. He survived the fire by jumping out of a first-floor window. He was convicted of fraud and theft in 2003, and the Home Office planned to deport him, but he lodged an appeal and an immigration judge ruled in his favour in May 2006. The judge found that Jothibala had been pressured and intimidated by criminals into committing the crime, from which he had derived no benefit himself.
The Home Office wrongly recorded on Jothibala’s file that he had lost rather than won his appeal, although officials took no steps to remove him from the UK, nor did they appeal against the judge’s ruling. When Jothibala obtained a copy of his internal Home Office file, he saw an entry made in February 2014 – eight years after the judge had ruled that he had the right to remain in the UK – saying that he would not qualify for a grant of leave and that “referral for removal should now be considered”. Another note in July 2014 stated that Home Office officials, having spoken to the courts and tribunal service, now knew that the appeal had been upheld rather than dismissed. The note stated that “in light of the mishandling of the case following the determination of 2006”, the case would now be reconsidered. But nothing was done. In 2015 Jothibala’s then MP, Mike Gapes, wrote to the Home Office about the case and was advised that Jothibala had no basis of stay in the UK and should make arrangements to leave as soon as possible. The letter to Gapes provided information about voluntary return to Sri Lanka. Jothibala’s immigration limbo continued. In 2019 a note on his file said a complaint had been received, to which officials needed to respond. “If we do not meet the deadline there is a risk that the complainant may escalate the matter to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman for a formal investigation,” the note said. Still nothing was done. Last week Jothibala’s solicitor, Naga Kandiah of MTC Solicitors, sent a letter before action to the Home Office informing officials that he would be lodging judicial review proceedings if the Home Office did not speedily resolve the matter. He said the Home Office’s failure to implement the 2006 immigration tribunal decision was unlawful and unreasonable. Kandiah said: “This case is a sobering reminder of how a historic injustice can devastate a person’s life. My client has lost out on so many opportunities to progress in life because the Home Office failed to implement the 2006 judgment.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Home Office will be defending its approach in this case. It would be inappropriate to comment further on potential legal proceedings.” When Jothibala came to the UK in 1983 he had hopes of a professional career. Education was highly valued in his family – both his parents were teachers, and close relatives are lawyers, doctors and accountants. Instead he has spent decades homeless and sofa surfing, sometimes sleeping on a mat at London Sree Ayyappan Temple in Harrow where he helped out as a volunteer cook before the pandemic struck. Suntharampillai Kirubahar, a founder and trustee at the temple, said: “He’s a fantastic person, a very nice chap and very entertaining, but he has been hiding so much sorrow.” Jothibala said he hoped his case would finally be resolved. “I have been waiting, waiting, waiting for my case to be sorted out. I’ve been sleeping here and there for a long time, sometimes sleeping on a mat at the temple and cooking vegetarian food like biriyanis for people who come to the temple. “The one thing I am longing for is a holiday. I would love to be somewhere by the sea in the sunshine.”"
2021-03-03T06:00:10Z,uk-news,UK news,HS2 to 'rewild' 127 hectares around its 10-mile Chilterns tunnel,"A “rewilding” of arable fields by HS2 will create 127 hectares (314 acres) of wood pasture, wetlands and flower-rich grassland using chalk taken from tunnelling under the Chilterns. The new wildlife haven will be founded upon all 3m tonnes of chalk that are to be excavated from the high-speed railway’s 10-mile Chilterns tunnel, with construction starting in May. The Colne Valley Western Slopes will be seeded with 70 grass and flower species and planted with 32 species of native trees and shrubs including Chiltern specialities juniper, box, wayfaring tree and hornbeam.
Alongside two miles of new hedges on the site close to the M25 on the north-western edge of London will be nearly three miles of new footpaths, cycling and horse-riding routes. Some areas will protected from people for wildlife such as ground-nesting birds. Matt Hobbs, the lead ecologist from Jacobs, one of the HS2 contractors designing the site, said his team had been inspired by a visit to the rewilded Knepp estate in West Sussex. “This is broadly a rewilding project,” he said, citing the creation of new wood pasture – a mosaic of scrub, meadow and grazed woodland – and fenced areas where natural regeneration of trees and scrub will take place. The scheme includes wildlife ponds which also provide water for livestock and cattle grids on the lane running through the site to enable free-roaming animals to undertake conservation grazing of the area in a similar way to rewilding projects.
“The Colne Valley Western Slopes is a unique opportunity to give something back for wildlife by creating a large new reserve dedicated to nature in the Colne Valley,” added Hobbs. “The design will deliver habitats that are the biggest and best possible, and those that will succeed and thrive over the long term with minimal human input.” The Western Slopes will help HS2 meet its carbon emissions reduction targets by sequestering carbon and reducing construction road journeys. Concrete and limestone aggregate used in HS2’s construction will be recycled to add to the calcareous grassland, minimising HS2’s carbon footprint by reducing the removal of materials by truck. Chalk and construction materials will be sculpted to replicate the area’s dry valleys and deliver a range of microclimates including hot, dry banks loved by reptiles and invertebrates. Species that are expected to rapidly colonise the site include grass snakes, slow worms and butterflies, such as the small blue and marbled white. Rarer butterflies such as the Adonis and chalkhill blue are also likely to eventually thrive on the chalk grassland. Simon Railton, the landscape architecture lead from LDA Design, said he hoped the site would provide a “meaningful legacy and benefit” for wildlife and people. “We aim to create a landscape which is both rich in biodiversity and a place for people to explore and connect with the natural environment,” he said. “Our design team is passionate about achieving an enduring environmental legacy for the project and playing our part in addressing some of the biggest issues of our time around climate change and biodiversity loss.” HS2 has attracted huge opposition from environmental activists and charities such as the Woodland Trust for destroying parts of 32 ancient woodlands along its first phase from London to Birmingham. Environmentalists have criticised its commitment to “no net loss of biodiversity” along the whole route when new road and housing developments are now asked to provide measurable improvements for wildlife. According to HS2 Ltd, the Western Slopes will ensure that the high-speed line delivers a “net gain” in biodiversity in the Colne Valley. The site’s 90 hectares (222 acres) of calcareous grassland is a significant addition to the estimated 700 hectares (1,730 acres) of this scarce floral habitat within the adjacent Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust said it offered unpaid informal advice and expertise on the Colne Valley Western Slopes project to try to ensure the best outcome for nature. Josh Kubale of Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust said: “This project is part of HS2’s requirement for no net loss of biodiversity and we are very keen to ensure that it delivers all the benefits it is required to do. While we’re pleased it will create new habitat for wildlife it can never make up for even a small part of the nature and wild places that have and will continue to be lost to HS2. “The trust’s opinion of the HS2 project remains unchanged – we believe that the ecological cost is too high and the mitigation too small and we believe that the government should stop and re-think HS2.” HS2 says it is creating a “green corridor” along the route with 33km/sq of new woodland and wildlife habitats and the planting of 7m new trees on the 109-mile London to Birmingham stretch. Asked whether the new site may win round HS2 sceptics, Hobbs said: “I hope that protesters and others who have a negative view of the project will look at this and at least respect what we’re trying to do and give us some credit for coming up with something that we are very passionate about.” All the chalk removed from the twin tunnels under the Chilterns will be placed on the site over three years from this May. During the tunnel’s construction, HS2-contracted ecologists will conduct further laboratory and field trials of the best soil profiles for supporting biodiverse grassland. Parts of the Western Slopes are likely to open to the public before the end of the decade. HS2 will initially manage the site but ownership and management could eventually be transferred to local authorities or wildlife charities."
2021-03-03T06:00:09Z,uk-news,UK news,From forecasts to furlough: what to expect in the budget,"Rishi Sunak will use the budget on Wednesday to set out further government support before lockdown ends, alongside steps to reboot Britain’s economy from the worst recession in 300 years. The chancellor is expected to extend spending measures, tax breaks and government grants to help soften the blow from Covid-19 for businesses and their workers before restrictions are eased in-line with the government’s roadmap over the coming months. Sunak will also aim to lay the foundations for a post-Covid recovery, while addressing the impact of the pandemic on the public finances. Economy Forecasts Gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by 9.9% in 2020 – the worst performance since 1709 – and the economy remains under pressure. However, official forecasts due on Wednesday from the Office for Budget Responsibility could paint a rosier picture, as progress administering the vaccine paves the way for a swift recovery later this year. Public finances The budget is expected to pave the way for higher taxes or spending cuts in future as government borrowing hits a peacetime record this year. The budget deficit – the gap between spending and income – is expected to come in at about £370bn for the 2020-21 financial year. Business support Grants The chancellor will offer £5bn in government grants to businesses in retail, hospitality, accommodation, leisure and personal care. Grants of up to £18,000 each for 700,000 firms will be made available to prevent mass bankruptcies during the latest lockdown. Rates relief An extension in the temporary 100% tax cut for hospitality, retail and leisure is expected. A fundamental review is rumoured to have been delayed until the autumn, possibly to allow time for an online sales tax to be developed. Hospitality sector VAT Already extended once, the temporary reduction from 20% to 5% is likely to be extended to the summer, possibly for three months beyond the current 31 March cutoff. A delay could add £800m to the estimated £3.3bn cost so far. Support for workers Furlough extension Sunak will announce an extension until the end of September to support the economic recovery from Covid. Employees will continue to receive 80% of their wages until the scheme ends, but firms will be asked to contribute 10% in July and 20% in August and September as the scheme is gradually phased out. Self-employed Grants of up to £7,500 will be available from next month for three months, including an expansion in the scheme to allow those who started working for themselves in the 2019-20 financial year to make claims. Benefits Universal credit The temporary £20 per week uplift in universal credit benefits is earmarked for a six-month extension. Due to be cut at the end of March, charities warn that a limited extension is insufficient for tackling rising poverty. Housing Stamp duty A three-month extension until the end of June is expected at a cost of about £1bn to the exchequer. It is designed to avoid a cliff-edge in the property market in March before the economy has recovered. The government will also launch a scheme to bring back 95% mortgages, which are mainly used by first-time buyers and in short supply due to the pandemic. Taxation Corporation tax A gradual increase has been widely touted, reversing cuts instigated by George Osborne to the current rate of 19%. Among the lowest rates in the wealthy world, it is expected to be raised by anywhere up to 25%. With the US planning a rise from 21% to 28%, the UK would remain the lowest in the G7. Each percentage point rise would provide an extra £3bn in annual receipts. Income tax Although the Tories promised not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT before the 2019 election, Sunak is expected to freeze the threshold for the 20% basic rate of income tax at £12,500 and £50,000 level for the 40% rate for three years. It would bring 1.6 million people into a higher bracket by 2024, raising about £11bn. Pension tax A restriction on the amount wealthier people can put into their pensions to £1m over their lifetime could save £250m in tax relief. About 1.2 million people are projected to exceed the threshold by the time they start drawing on their private or occupational pension. Environment Green bonds Sunak will unveil what is expected to be the world’s first government green bond. Offered through NS&I it will allow savers to invest in a product that will contribute towards green projects. Electric cars The budget is expected to roll out further measures to bring down carbon emissions, including a more extensive electric vehicle-charging network. However, fuel duty is set to be frozen. Arts and sport Arts and culture Funding worth £410m will be earmarked, including support for museums, theatres and galleries. Sport Sunak will announce £300m of funding for sport to help the sector through lockdown and into the summer, including for cricket. Funding of £2.8m for a UK and Ireland bid for the 2030 World Cup will also come alongside £25m for grassroots football. Other Freeports More than 30 bids were received for 10 freeports – areas with lower tax or customs requirements – to be created around the UK. Sunak is expected to announce the winners in the budget. The chancellor could also reveal a location for the Treasury’s new economic campus – with Darlington thought to be among frontrunners. National infrastructure bank Plans for a launch this spring will include £12bn of capital funding and £10bn of state guarantees in the budget. The government will also invest £375m more into its Future Fund for fast-growing high-tech companies. Vaccine rollout A further £1.65bn will be made available to help meet the government’s target for every adult to be offered a Covid jab by the end of July."
2021-03-02T22:00:04Z,uk-news,UK news,UK budget to extend furlough until end of September,"Rishi Sunak will announce on Wednesday that the Treasury is extending its furlough scheme until the end of September in an attempt to safeguard jobs as a fragile economy emerges from the Covid-19 emergency. In an unexpected move, the chancellor will say that workers will continue to be guaranteed 80% of their salary for a further three months after the government envisages all restrictions on activity will be removed in June. Sunak will also seek to fend off accusations that too many people have slipped through the government’s salary safety net by saying that an additional 600,000 of the newly self-employed will now be eligible for state financial help. Labour said the extension should have been announced months earlier – rather than allowing struggling business owners to suffer uncertainty – and that it showed the chancellor was only focused on his “moment in the sun”. Before his second budget – but the 15th crisis-related announcement in a year when pandemic-related spending has already reached £280bn – Sunak will say that the priority is to see the economy emerge from its third lockdown without triggering mass unemployment and a wave of business failures. In recent days, there had been hints from the Treasury that the furlough would be extended until the end of June, but Tuesday night’s surprise move will provide continuing support for sectors – such as hospitality and retailing – where recovery could prove slow and patchy. “Our Covid support schemes have been a lifeline to millions, protecting jobs and incomes across the UK,” the chancellor said last night. “There’s now light at the end of the tunnel with a roadmap for reopening, so it’s only right that we continue to help business and individuals through the challenging months ahead – and beyond.”
Under the new plan, employers will be expected to pay for 10% of a furloughed worker’s wages in July, rising to 20% in August and September. Sunak said firms were being asked to make a “small contribution” to the hours not worked by their staff but employees will continue to receive 80% of their wages up to a £2,500 limit until September. In addition, cash grants under the self-employment income support scheme (SEISS) will now be available to those who became self-employed during 2019-20. When the self-employment scheme was launched it was based on tax returns for 2018-2019, the most recent year for which data was available. The Treasury said that had resulted in many people failing to qualify. Business groups said the extension would be a relief to many. Rain Newton-Smith, the chief economist of the CBI, said: “Extending the scheme will keep millions more in work and give businesses the chance to catch their breath as we carefully exit lockdown.”
But the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, said assurances should have been given many months ago – not used as a PR stunt for the budget. “Businesses and workers have been pleading with the chancellor to give them certainty – but they have had to wait because he said it wouldn’t be appropriate until the budget,” she said. “Announcing it the night before shows the focus is on Rishi Sunak getting his moment in the sun rather than protecting jobs and livelihoods.” In addition to the furlough and the SEISS, Sunak is expected to announce: An extension of the £20 a week boost to universal credit. Extra measures to support the long-term unemployed through the Kickstart scheme for the under 25s and the Restart scheme for older workers. An extension to the stamp duty holiday for properties under £500,000. Sunak will say: “We’re using the full measure of our fiscal firepower to protect the jobs and livelihoods of the British people”. But the chancellor also made it clear last night that he would take measures to repair the damage caused to the public finances by the pandemic once the immediate threat was over and the economy was recovering. Sunak has been strongly rumoured to be preparing for a rise in corporation tax from 19%. The Treasury will announce a series of tax consultations on 23 March, which some have described as a ploy to allow the chancellor to announce the “good news” about extensions of support on budget day while delaying decisions on tax rises until later in the year. A number of senior Tories have said moderate tax rises are inevitable – with some warning they must come along with spending cuts – a narrative seized on by Labour. Two former cabinet ministers sounded warnings about rises in corporation tax. The former chancellor Philip Hammond warned Sunak not to impose a sharp immediate rise in corporation tax – a move Labour has also said it would oppose – but said a longer-term “sensible, proportional” rise would be better. David Gauke, a former justice secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury, said Sunak should raise income tax, rather than corporation tax. “The chancellor is right to think that taxes will – eventually – have to go up. But if he relies heavily on corporation tax, he will unnecessarily make the UK a less attractive and dynamic place in which to invest,” he told the Evening Standard. Nicky Morgan, a former Conservative chair of the Treasury select committee, said she expected decisions on balancing the books to be deferred until the autumn when the Treasury could assess the state of the recovery in a new budget. “It’s counter-intuitive for the Treasury to wait but when you look at how the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] forecasts are moving, it’s not possible to make decisions yet about what the balance can be between tax rises, economic growth and reprioritising spending,” she said. “Undoubtedly there are people on the government benches who think the tax burden is already too high. But a lot of MPs are hearing from their constituents that they understand there are bills to be paid. The argument will be where that falls, whether it’s incomes rising slower or taxes rising – rather than whether they should come at all.” In a trail of his Commons appearance today, the Treasury said the budget would have three themes: “Support, honesty and building the UK’s future economy.” The chancellor is expected to say: “First, we will continue doing whatever it takes to support the British people and businesses through this moment of crisis. “Second, once we are on the way to recovery, we will need to begin fixing the public finances – and I want to be honest today about our plans to do that. And, third, in today’s budget we begin the work of building our future economy.”"
2021-03-02T19:04:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Bristol council calls for parliamentary inquiry on slavery reparations,"Councillors in Bristol have called for a parliamentary commission of inquiry to be set up to investigate reparations for the UK’s part in the slave trade. A motion approved at an extraordinary full council meeting on Tuesday evening said that the experiences, voices and perspectives of African heritage groups were needed to help develop a “reparations plan” for the city, which is the first authority outside London to approve such a measure. The champions of the motion, which comes eight months after Black Lives Matter protesters toppled a statue of the Bristol slave trader Edward Colston into the city’s harbour, said reparations could include financial compensation but was about much more than money. The Green party councillor Cleo Lake, who proposed the motion, said: “This is about equity and understanding. Reparation does include but goes beyond monetary compensation.” She added: “It is of international significance that this cross party motion has passed. History is made. Bristol is now the first core city in the UK to give our support to the growing campaign for reparations.”
Bristol council also agreed that more local initiatives to help communities still suffering from systemic poverty many years after the trafficking of African people should be introduced. Speaking outside the chamber, Lake said: “Bristol merchants grew rich through African enslavement and this legacy is still with us – not only in the buildings that surround us, but also in the rife inequalities of wealth, power and opportunity across our city.” Lake said reparations were not a “paycheque” to the descendants of enslaved people. “Reparation is actually a legal concept defined by the UN which calls for holistic repair,” she said. “It can include public apologies, social justice initiatives, education, cultural projects, commemorative ceremonies, affirmative action and much more.” She added: “We do not have the answers as to exactly what reparations should look like – that’s why what we are calling for is a process of repair which hears from many of the voices in our communities that have been impacted and are often not heard.” During the debate, the city mayor, Marvin Rees, said: “The thing that really appeals to me is the chance to have a national and international discussion.”
He added: “As the first directly elected black mayor in Europe, I can also tell you I’m not just the mayor. I still experience the world as a black man and even within this organisation I experience the consequences of having a black skin. Race is an ever-present reality that does not disappear just because we would like to wish it away.” Deputy mayor Asher Craig added: “The toppling of the statue of Edward Colston in June was a symbolic demonstration of our city’s complex relationship with race. It highlights the long shadows cast by slavery and racism in Bristol and how this shapes our city’s discourse about inequality and exclusion.” It came as the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said that museums and cultural institutions should not allow themselves to be “pushed around by the zeitgeist of the day”. Speaking at the Policy Exchange UK thinktank’s History Matters conference on Tuesday, Dowden said some cultural organisations feel they are being “bullied by leftwing campaigns”. He added that museums and other institutions in the UK should act as “custodians” of cultural heritage and not seek to erase certain aspects of it. Discussing his advice to museums and cultural institutions, he said: “Don’t allow yourself to be pushed around by the zeitgeist of the day.”"
2021-03-02T18:21:01Z,uk-news,UK news,"Manchester firefighters were criticised for 'standing around', attack inquiry told","A crying paramedic asked firefighters why they were “stood around” instead of helping casualties a mile away at the Manchester Arena bombing, the public inquiry into the attack has heard. The first fire engine did not arrive at the scene until two hours after the explosion that killed 22 people and injured hundreds at an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017. On Tuesday, the inquiry heard evidence from firefighters involved in the emergency response. Alan Topping, a retired fire officer who was a duty command support officer on the night, said in the aftermath of the attack he “felt ashamed to be a firefighter”. Topping told the hearing that, by the time of their arrival, specialist teams who could have treated and moved casualties were “not really going to offer that much help” and said they needed to be there “within five to 10 minutes”. The inquiry has heard previously that Greater Manchester police declared Operation Plato, codename for a marauding terrorist firearms attack, amid erroneous reports of gunfire. However, police failed to inform the fire and ambulance services, and none of the emergency services met at the rendezvous point to discuss a planned response. Counsel to the inquiry Paul Greaney QC read the account of one fire officer who recalled that a distressed paramedic “came over crying, pleading with us to go over and help … Her exact words were, ‘What are you doing just stood around here? There are people dying, we need your help. I have just taken an 18-year-old girl in the back of an ambulance who died en route to hospital and you lot are just stood around.’” Topping admitted he had little understanding of the reasons for the inaction and told the inquiry that there was “a lot of anger, upset, confusion” among the crews who were impatient at being kept away from the scene. Topping agreed with John Cooper QC, representing the bereaved families, that the scene at Thompson Street station – where fire crews were being held – “felt wrong” because important resources and services his colleagues could have provided were “simply wasted”. “I felt ashamed to be a firefighter and I felt like we had let the people of Greater Manchester down. We were there to help and we didn’t do our job. I just feel so sad we didn’t attend for the families.”"
2021-03-02T18:11:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Northern Ireland’s five steps out of Covid lockdown: key points,"Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill, has unveiled a cautious five-step plan to ease the region’s Covid-19 lockdown. The plan has no hard dates and will be led by data, notably the reproductive rate of the virus, O’Neill told the Stormont assembly on Tuesday. The 28-page plan, titled Moving Forward: the Executive’s Pathway out of Restrictions, envisages a five-stage process moving from lockdown to relaxation of restrictions for nine different sectors. There will be reviews on 16 March, 15 April, 13 May and 10 June but these do not represent dates when restrictions will ease. “Rather, they are appropriate dates … to examine all relevant indicators,” said O’Neill. “We do not want to set potentially unachievable dates which will only disappoint.” Scotland’s plan, unveiled last month, also eschewed a timetable, unlike England’s, which included dates. Northern Ireland’s five-step plan: Step 1: lockdown restrictions In this current stage, contact is limited to one household and support bubble and schools are closed except for vulnerable and key workers’ children. All non-essential retail, hospitality and indoor seated venues are closed. Non-essential travel is prohibited and and marriages and funerals are capped at 25 people. Step 2: cautious first steps Up to six people from two households can meet outdoors at a private dwelling. A partial return to classroom teaching. All outdoor visitors attractions reopen and outdoor competitive sports can resume with no spectators. Return to services in places of worship with risk assessment. Click and collect for non-essential retail permitted. Step 3: gradual easing Up to six people from two households can meet indoors at a private dwelling and full return to classroom teaching. Indoor visitors attractions reopen including libraries, heritage sites, gyms and swimming pools. All non-essential retail reopens and close contact services with mitigations resume. Hotels and B&Bs reopen with mitigations and public transport back to full service with mitigations. Phased return to on-site work and offices. Step 4: further easing Up to 10 people from two households can meet indoors and outdoors in private dwellings and inter-school sports are allowed. Theatres, cinemas and concert venues reopen. Limited numbers of indoor and outdoor spectators allowed. Any limit on gatherings for funerals, marriages and civil partnerships determined by venue risk assessment. Work conferences can resume. Close contact services without appointments permitted. Wet pubs open with table service. Step 5: preparing for the future Household limits in private dwellings lifted. Full face-to-face teaching in colleges and universities. Spectators allowed at school performance events. Bigger outdoor festivals and concerts allowed. Live music and entertainment at receptions. Work places fully reopen. Preparations for the full return of leisure travel."
2021-03-02T18:00:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Budget 2021: Rishi Sunak to pledge more government firepower to save jobs and businesses,"Rishi Sunak will use tomorrow’s budget to signal that the government’s unprecedented and continuing support for jobs and businesses must end once the economy has emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. The chancellor will pledge to use all the tax and spending firepower at the government’s disposal to limit joblessness and business failures as the UK gradually lifts the restrictions that have left the economy almost 10% smaller than it was a year ago. But Sunak is also expected to announce that the period of doing “whatever it takes” will be relatively short lived and that action will be needed to repair the public finances once the crisis is over and recovery is underway.
In a budget delayed from late last year due to the pandemic, Sunak will say: “We’re using the full measure of our fiscal firepower to protect the jobs and livelihoods of the British people.” He is expected to extend the furlough scheme, the business rates and stamp duty holidays, and maintain the £20 a week uplift in universal credit for six months. But the chancellor will say that even the relatively rapid recovery in the economy expected by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility won’t be enough to repair all the damage to the public finances caused by the biggest one-year fall in output for more than three centuries. Business groups are braced for the announcement that corporation tax will be raised from its current rate of 19%. In a trail of Sunak’s appearance in the House of Commons tomorrow, the Treasury said the budget would have three themes: “Support, honesty and building the UK’s future economy.” The chancellor is expected to say: “First, we will continue doing whatever it takes to support the British people and businesses through this moment of crisis.
“Second, once we are on the way to recovery, we will need to begin fixing the public finances – and I want to be honest today about our plans to do that. And, third, in today’s budget we begin the work of building our future economy.” Sunak is expected to say the budget will add to the £280bn package of support that has subsidised wages for millions of workers and helped businesses with their costs. The OBR is likely to forecast weaker growth in 2021 than it expected three months ago due to the slump in activity in the first three months of the year. But it will also predict a rapid recovery in the second half of the year as the opening up of businesses releases pent-up demand."
2021-03-02T17:44:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Northern Ireland announces cautious five-step plan for Covid lockdown easing,"Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill, has announced a cautious five-step plan to ease the region’s Covid-19 lockdown. She told the Stormont assembly on Tuesday that the plan has no hard dates and will be led by data, notably the reproductive rate of the virus. The power-sharing executive signed off on the strategy earlier on Tuesday after days of intensive talks between party leaders and health officials. The 28-page plan, titled Moving Forward: The Executive’s Pathway out of Restrictions, is a “careful, cautious and hopeful approach”, O’Neill told the chamber. “Our aim is to find a safe, secure and sustainable way forward for our citizens and businesses.”
The plan envisages a five-stage process moving from lockdown to relaxation of restrictions for nine different sectors. There will be regular reviews in the middle of March, April, May and June but no set timetable for progressing to each stage, said O’Neill. “These should not be viewed as dates on which we will move to lift certain restrictions; rather, they are appropriate dates … to examine all relevant indicators. We do not want to set potentially unachievable dates which will only disappoint.” Scotland’s plan, unveiled last month, also eschewed a timetable, unlike England’s, which included dates. O’Neill, who is Sinn Féin’s Northern Ireland leader, said the plan would protect the health service. “We must do everything we can to try to make this one the last lockdown.” Each week government departments will pool and analyse information, she said. “After each step we take, we will pause and reflect, look at the data and the impacts, engage with key sectors and enable them to reopen only if it is the right thing to do.” The first step in the plan represents the current lockdown, with ensuing steps permitting progressive relaxations in household mixing and the economy. The plan is a compromise between the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), which has chafed at lockdowns, and Sinn Féin, Alliance, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist party. The DUP last week sought to accelerate the reopening of schools in line with England’s plan for all pupils to return on 8 March, prompting a veiled rebuke from Northern Ireland’s chief medical officer, Michael McBride. “There is a significant risk at this point in time if we move back … too quickly or too rapidly that we will see a resurgence in cases that could result in a further wave of infection which could be even greater than the numbers we saw back in January,” he said."
2021-03-02T17:43:01Z,uk-news,UK news,What questions will Nicola Sturgeon be asked on Wednesday?,"On Wednesday, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is due to give evidence under oath to a committee of Holyrood MSPs investigating the Scottish government’s botched inquiry into complaints against Alex Salmond. Here are some of the questions she is likely to face: When did she first learn of concerns about Alex Salmond’s alleged behaviour? Nicola Sturgeon has been accused of misleading parliament about what she knew and when, a potential breach of the ministerial code. She originally told Holyrood and the media she first learned Salmond faced allegations of sexual misconduct directly from him, when they met at her home on 2 April 2018. In August 2018, the day after news leaked that two internal complaints against him had been upheld, she told the BBC: “I heard about the fact of the investigation initially from Alex Salmond himself in April.” She added: “I have had no prior knowledge of complaints having been made.” The day Salmond won his judicial review on 8 January 2019, the first minister told Holyrood: “I was informed about the investigation, yes, by Alex Salmond.” She repeated that in parliament on 10 January. Sturgeon has also admitted she knew in November 2018 that Sky News had made inquiries about alleged incidents involving Salmond at Edinburgh airport. She spoke to Salmond about it and he denied any incident took place. That month she agreed her government’s new policy on sexual harassment should include historic complaints involving former ministers. Scrutiny over who knew what and when heightened in October 2020, when she admitted in evidence to the Holyrood inquiry she had met Geoff Aberdein, Salmond’s former chief of staff, in her Holyrood office on 29 March 2018. “I think it did cover the suggestion that the matter might relate to allegations of a sexual nature,” she said.
Aberdein alleges the inquiry was discussed at that meeting – four days earlier than she claimed. He also alleges a complainer was named to him by someone in her office. Why did she agree to meet Salmond and to continue talking to him? Sturgeon told parliament on 8 January 2019 she spoke to Salmond about the case five times during 2018: in person at her home on 2 April, by phone on 23 April, in person at SNP conference on 7 June, at her home on 14 July and lastly by phone on 18 July. She also exchanged WhatsApp messages with him. She told parliament she did so as SNP leader, suggesting later in evidence she thought he might be about to resign from the party. Her husband, Peter Murrell, the chief executive of the SNP, told MSPs they met in her role as first minister. Murrell was not told why they were meeting on 2 April. If it was party business of that significance, why was he excluded? Salmond alleges Sturgeon knew when she met Aberdein on 29 March the inquiry was under way, and they organised the 2 April meeting that day. Aberdein alleges the name of a complainer was leaked to him before 29 March. Salmond also turned up at Sturgeon’s house with his lawyer, Duncan Hamilton, a respected advocate. If it was SNP business and about his resignation, why would he take a lawyer? Did she offer to intervene on Salmond’s behalf at the first meeting? The first minister had consistently stated in parliament and to the media she made no offer or attempt to intervene in the government inquiry, as she knew that was inappropriate. Salmond alleged last week Sturgeon did offer to put forward his concerns to officials on 2 April, although she later retracted that offer. If Sturgeon knew it was wrong to intervene or offer to help Salmond, why then did she agree to meet him at all? If she made no offer to intervene, why discuss it with him five times and exchange a number of WhatsApp messages? Why did Sturgeon take so long to inform the civil service? Sturgeon said she first told Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary, she knew about the internal inquiry and had been discussing it with Salmond on 6 June – roughly 11 weeks after meeting Salmond and 12 weeks after meeting Aberdein. This raises a number of further questions: doesn’t that mean Sturgeon realised it was government business? If it was, why did she continue to meet Salmond and discuss it with him without civil service involvement and minutes being taken? What did Evans say to her? Did Evans authorise her to continue discussing it with Salmond? Did she tell Evans she had also met Aberdein? Did she go against legal advice to abandon the case against Salmond? If so, why? In October 2018 it emerged the senior civil servant who had investigated Salmond had had prior contact with both complainers – while they were deciding whether to formally complain and before the government harassment policy had been signed. The Scottish government released its private legal advice on Tuesday showing the government’s external counsel, Roddy Dunlop QC, had warned this seriously damaged the government’s case and could be unlawful. Salmond claims Sturgeon was told this in November yet the government refused to concede defeat. Dunlop then allegedly threatened to resign, and it took until late December before Evans agreed to concede. Opposition MSPs said that delay greatly increased the legal costs, which exceed £600,000. Salmond says that delay was a breach of the ministerial code. Did Sturgeon agree to continue fighting the case, despite Dunlop’s warnings? If so, why?"
2021-03-02T17:08:53Z,uk-news,UK news,"Senior army officer court martialed for alleged £48,000 fraud","The most senior army officer to face a court martial for more than two centuries has been accused of defrauding the taxpayer out of almost £50,000 to pay for private school fees. Maj Gen Nick Welch allegedly abused army allowances when he took on a senior role at the Ministry of Defence in London. The two-star general is said to have claimed that his wife, Charlotte, would be living at his new London home – which meant he could claim an allowance for two of his children’s education, who attended private schools in Dorset. In fact she spent most of her time at their £800,000 country cottage, complete with swimming pool, in Dorset while they boarded at schools nearby, the prosecution claimed. Welch, 57, becomes the most senior British officer to face a court martial since 1815, when a lieutenant general was convicted of abandoning his siege guns in the Napoleonic wars. He is accused of fraud amounting to just over £48,000 from December 2015 to February 2017. On the first day of his four-week trial at Bulford military court in Wiltshire, the court heard Welch relocated to London when he began the job at the MoD. Continuity of education allowance (CEA) is offered to soldiers to help fund children’s education when they relocate on assignment. But the court heard that rather than living in London as she needed to for him to be eligible for the allowance, his wife stayed at their cottage in Dorset, close to the two schools where their children were sent. Opening the case, prosecutor Sarah Clarke QC said: “He should not have been claiming the allowance. He dishonestly wanted to continue to keep the privilege of having his two children in private education.” Clarke said Welch first claimed CEA in 2007. She said: “He has been signing up to CEA repeatedly since 2007 so there can’t be any doubt that he’s not fully familiar with the rules.” The court was told that in February 2017, when Welch heard there had been a complaint about the alleged fraud, he had his wife hurry to London. Clarke said: “She cancelled her plans, drove up and spent the week going out and about being seen and being visible in the local area.” The barrister added: “He had an obligation not only with the army, but the public too to comply with the regulations. And, let’s face it, who is really going to question the word of a major general?” Welch denies one charge of fraud. The court martial continues."
2021-03-02T16:00:39Z,uk-news,UK news,Meghan granted £450k interim payment in Mail on Sunday privacy case,"The Duchess of Sussex has been granted an interim £450,000 downpayment towards her £1.5m legal costs in her privacy case against the Mail on Sunday. The payment follows her victory last month against Associated Newspapers Ltd, publisher of the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online, over extracts published from a private handwritten letter she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. Meghan had asked for an interim payment of £750,000. She is also demanding a front-page apology, and a high court order forcing the newspaper to hand over any copies it has made of the letter, and destroy any copies of it or notes made about it. Meghan, 39, sued ANL over five articles published in February 2019. She was granted summary judgment in relation to her privacy claim, and part of her copyright claim, Lord Justice Warby refused ANL permission to appeal against his judgment. The publishers have the right to appeal for permission directly to the court of appeal. At a remote hearing on Tuesday, ANL argued that Meghan’s “extremely large costs bill” of about £1.5m was disproportionate. Full costs will be decided at future hearings in the case. Ian Mill QC, representing Meghan, argued in written submissions that ANL had “failed to deliver up copies it has of the letter such that the threat to infringe and further misuse her private information remains real and, inexplicably, the defendant has still not removed the infringing articles from Mail Online”. He argued this was despite the judge’s ruling that found publication of the articles had infringed Meghan’s rights. “Accordingly, at the time of writing, the defendant defiantly continues to do the very acts which the court has held are unlawful.” He also sought an order requiring ANL to publish a front-page statement in the MoS about Meghan’s legal victory, as well as on the home page of Mail Online “to act as a deterrent to future infringers”. A decision will be made at a late date. Meghan has indicated she is willing to cap her damages to a “nominal award” – a token sum – for misuse of private information to save time and cost debating the issue, the court heard. She had asked for ANL to pay £750,000 within two weeks as “an interim payment on account” to cover legal costs of bringing the claim. Antony White QC representing ANL, said his client planned to appeal against the summary judgment ruling, arguing that it “would have a real prospect of success”. ANL had resolved to take down the articles pending any appeal, the judge heard. The publisher said the declaration Meghan wanted it to publish was not accurate, and erroneously stated she had won her whole claim rather than the fact that summary judgment had been given on parts of her claim, with other parts still to be determined. There had been worldwide reporting of the duchess’s success in her privacy claim and it did not need a declaration as suggested, White said. Any order requiring ANL to hand over any copies of Meghan’s letter to her father should be put on hold until any appeal against last month’s judgment could be determined, added White. Warby ruled that any “financial remedies’’ to be granted to Meghan for misuse of private information would be considered at a further hearing in late April or early May. The judge said that hearing would also deal with Meghan’s claim under the Data Protection Act, as well as “the issue of copyright ownership’’. Last month, Warby ruled that the publication of Meghan’s letter to her father was “manifestly excessive and hence unlawful”. He said: “It was, in short, a personal and private letter” and these were “inherently private and personal matters”. The handwritten letter was sent to her estranged father, 76-year-old Thomas Markle, in August 2018. The duchess claimed the five articles published in February 2019 involved a misuse of her private information, breached her copyright and breached the Data Protection Act. The judge has said the issue of whether Meghan was “the sole author” – or whether Jason Knauf, formerly communications secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, was a “co-author” – should be determined at a trial, despite being one “of minor significance in the overall context”."
2021-03-02T15:50:05Z,uk-news,UK news,"All Scottish pupils to return to school after Easter, Sturgeon says","Nicola Sturgeon has said it may be possible to accelerate Scotland’s exit from the coronavirus lockdown, as she confirmed that all school pupils would return to the classroom after the Easter break. Scotland’s first minister told the Holyrood chamber the next phase of school reopening would begin from 15 March, when all children in primary 4 to 7 will go back full time as well as secondary pupils preparing for exams, while all secondary school pupils should be back in class after Easter. She added that, while older pupils remained the priority, she expected all secondary pupils to receive some in-school education each week before the Easter break at the beginning of April. Last week, Sturgeon said that the stay-at-home rule would remain in force until 5 April at the earliest and that she did not expect non-essential shops, or outdoor bars and restaurants, to reopen until late April, the date when the Scottish government expects to move to regional lockdown levels.
But on Tuesday afternoon Sturgeon said she hoped to be able to confirm changes to the framework for leaving lockdown next week, telling MSPs: “We will be considering if it might be possible to accelerate the exit from lockdown in any way.” She said that recent data strongly suggested case numbers were declining to the lowest level since the first week of October last year, adding that the average test positivity rate had fallen below 5% and that hospital admissions were also falling. Education Scotland will publish guidance for local authorities on the phased return of secondary schools in the coming week, and Sturgeon said that local authorities would have flexibility in how they implement the phased return. Opposition leaders raised concerns about schools’ ability to welcome all pupils back while sticking to social distancing – which is required in secondary schools at least until Easter – as well as how teachers would manage both remote and in-person learning at the same time. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader at Holyrood, said the announcement was “typically vague and only prolongs uncertainty”. Sturgeon also said face coverings would need to be worn at all times when secondary schools returned, while ventilation remained important. She said many local authorities were using some of the £375m education recovery funding to monitor and improve ventilation in schools. She emphasised that twice-weekly lateral flow testing would remain available for all school staff in primary, secondary and special schools, and all secondary school pupils in years 4, 5 and 6, adding: “It is a further important way in which we can ensure schools remain as safe as possible.”"
2021-03-02T15:15:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Coventry announces UK city of culture programme,"A global sound systems competition and the announcement of the International Booker prize winner will take place in Coventry this year as part of its UK city of culture events, one of the biggest cultural programmes to take place since the start of the pandemic. A further set of events were announced on Tuesday as the year-long programme, delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic, gears up to start on 15 May. Event organisers said the city would be ready to welcome visitors as soon as rules allowed and could be a model for how cultural activities and live music events can be put on as restrictions begin to ease. After a “dawn until dusk” Coventry Moves opening event, the city will host a “summer of surprises”, including a collaboration with its twin city Kingston in Jamaica for an international sound systems competition running across the summer and culminating in October. The music project will showcase the city’s roots in reggae and West Indian sounds to audiences, live and digitally. The International Booker prize will also be announced virtually from the city in June, the first time the winner has been revealed outside of London. The prize, the younger sibling of the original Booker prize, is awarded annually for a single book translated into English. Gaby Wood, the director of The Booker Prize Foundation, said: “What better place to begin the regeneration of shared stories after the world has been kept physically apart than Coventry, that diversely populated home of global understanding.” The event will also feature the Coventry Big Booker Read, bringing readers together to read the winning book, and will host the shortlisted author event for the 2021 Booker prize for fiction later in the year. Other newly announced events included The Walk, a 3.5-metre-tall puppet of a young refugee arriving in the city on 27 October after a journey that will begin on the Syria-Turkey border in July. A week-long Coventry Welcomes event will feature music, dance, drama, food, literature, poetry and workshops to mark national Refugee Week, while the UK’s first Theatre Company of Sanctuary, Stand and Be Counted, will launch an outdoor production created with people seeking sanctuary in the city. The Show Windows will involve artists and architects creating artworks for shop windows across the city, In Paint We Trust will bring a street art festival to the city’s streets, and later in the year artists will reimagine a broken window in Coventry Cathedral, which was smashed during a burglary last year. “This has been the most challenging of environments in which to create a festival programme,” said Chenine Bhathena, the creative director of Coventry UK City of Culture Trust. “We’re so excited to be setting out some of the ways in which we are bringing about a return of the live to our city. Coventry city of culture year will be at the forefront of the recovery and renewal of the city and will demonstrate the important role arts and culture offers our communities and our struggling economies.” Previously announced city of culture events include the Turner prize 2021, to be held at the Herbert art gallery and museum. The BBC also announced its commitment to highlight Coventry through special events and programming throughout the year. The BBC director general, Tim Davie, said: “Coventry is a wonderful mix of cultures, with many diverse communities steeped in heritage. We will be drawing on this rich history to connect with audiences through the joy and celebration of music, arts, poetry, film, comedy and much, much more.” This includes an upcoming episode of Antiques Roadshow filmed at Kenilworth Castle, followed by a range of new BBC Arts programmes, including a film looking at the life and work of Delia Derbyshire, a Coventry-born composer who was a pioneer of electronic music and helped create the famous Doctor Who theme music. In September, the BBC Arts annual poetry and spoken word festival, Contains Strong Language, will also take place in the city."
2021-03-02T13:27:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Forest of Dean: small businesses counting on further help from UK budget ,"For the moment, the narrow gauge locomotives of the Perrygrove Railway in the Forest of Dean are tucked away in their engine shed but over the next few weeks the team will bring them out, check they are in working order and from 12 April, the hope is that it will be full steam ahead for the visitor attraction again. “We’re very excited,” said Katherine Nelson-Brown, who runs the heritage railway on the edge of the market town of Coleford with her husband, David. “The lockdowns have been very hard. It’s been a difficult year but we’ve survived.” The Forest of Dean, famed for its walking and biking trails and its wild boar, feels a long way from Westminster but Nelson-Brown said local people would be watching Wednesday’s budget with keener interest than usual. For the Nelson-Browns the continuation of the reduction of VAT from 20% to 5% is vital. “It will be massive for us if that stays,” she said. “That’s the biggest thing on our radar. There’s an end in sight to the Covid crisis but the help can’t suddenly stop. We need a cushion to get through the next 12 months.” In the town centre, the florist Claire Weston is still throwing away plants she had bought to sell over Christmas before Covid restrictions emptied the town. “It’s very sad.” She is also having to deal with an increase in the cost of flowers coming from mainland Europe. “They have gone up by 30%. That isn’t helping.”
Weston said her turnover had dropped by £50,000 over the last 12 months and called for the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to continue backing small businesses – and supporting the high street. “A lot of businesses will go under if the help vanishes,” she said. Pat Scott, who runs the fruit and veg shop in Market Place, said Brexit had caused her prices to rise. “Not so long ago we were charging £1.20 for four large Spanish oranges. Now it’s £2 for three.” She, too, called for help for town centres. “The town is so quiet. It’s going to take a long time for it to recover.” The Forest of Dean is the constituency of Mark Harper, the Tory MP who chairs the Covid Recovery Group, which is campaigning for an earlier exit from lockdown. In Coleford, one business, the Spa Rituals salon, planned a lockdown-breaking “wellness day” at the end of January, inviting people along for meditation and yoga sessions. The police made it clear people would be breaking the law if they attended and stationed a car outside to stop the event taking place. But most business people seemed to favour a more cautious approach. Greg Daniel and Vicky Irwin, who run the Dog House pub and Scoff’s coffee shop, said they were happy to be a bit more patient.
“For us, the worst thing has been the stop-start,” said Daniel. “If we reopen too quickly and have to lockdown again that would be terrible for consumer confidence. Let’s just wait a little longer.” “When we reopen, it will be a bit like starting from scratch,” said Irwin. “We’ll be re-marketing ourself, building up our customer base again.” An extension of the furlough scheme for them was a must. “Small businesses need ongoing help,” said Irwin. “We need schemes and funding for the next 12 months to get us back on our feet.” Arron Mitchell, the director of Platinum World Travel in Coleford, said many people were desperate to book holidays. “We’re having to carefully manage their expectations. People aren’t going to be jetting all over the world on 17 May. I think we have to go slowly and carefully.”
There are some who argue the government has to rein in spending quickly. Steve Jones, 22, a furloughed hospitality worker, said he worried that his generation would be paying extra taxes for the rest of his life. “The government seem to be intent on propping up every business. At some time they have to pull the plug and let business people sink or swim.” Brian Robinson, a Gloucestershire county councillor who resigned from the leadership of the Forest of Dean Conservative group and left the party in protest at its management of the Covid crisis and Brexit, called on the chancellor to tell the difficult truths about the economy. “The problems we have got are going to be long-term ones.” he said. “We’re not going to snap back as if nothing has happened.” Robinson said he feared the government was still chasing popularity rather than taking difficult decisions about the economy. “What we are spending isn’t sustainable.” Ben Cunningham and his wife, Carys, are juggling caring for a newborn and running a walking holiday business, Celtic Trails. One of their headaches is that their most popular route, Offa’s Dyke Path, weaves in and out of England and Wales, which have different lockdown restrictions and exit plans. “That makes it even more complicated,” he said. The Cunninghams believe their business won’t be back to full power before spring 2022. They hope the chancellor will extend furlough, the VAT cut for hospitality and perhaps instigate some form of UK holiday scheme along the lines of the “eat out to help out” campaign. “It’s been incredibly challenging. We need bit more support to get through.”"
2021-03-02T09:54:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Business secretary plays down prospect of major tax rises in budget,"The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has played down the prospect of significant tax increases to start reducing the deficit in the public finances in Wednesday’s budget. While the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said the country cannot not “go on spending money for ever”, Kwarteng said the priority for now was to support the economy. “For now, what we have to do is support businesses, individuals, families, through what has been an extremely difficult time,” he told BBC Breakfast. “We have got another three years to run in the parliament and the chancellor will be looking to reduce the deficit. For now, I think the real emphasis is on trying to provide critical support.” The chancellor is said to be considering raising corporation tax to as much as 25% from 19%. Kwarteng told BBC Breakfast that Sunak had “already indicated” that he would be extending the furlough scheme. On Monday, the former Tory leader William Hague said taxes would “have to go up”. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said: “It pains me to say, after spending much of my life arguing for lower taxes, that we have reached the point where at least some business and personal taxes have to go up.” He added that those who opposed some form of tax rises in the current climate were buying into “dangerous illusions”. Asked about whether he thought there would be higher taxes on companies that had “done well” out of the pandemic, Kwarteng said: “I am a Conservative, and I’ve always been a low-tax Conservative. I think that the best way to grow an economy, generally, is to promote enterprise, small business and larger businesses as well, but at a time like this, our focus has been on trying to keep things going and providing vital support to families and businesses, at a very difficult time.” He told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he was sure in the future there would be a “debate about the right level of taxation”, but for now the focus was on providing support. Kwarteng would not be drawn on whether businesses could expect an extension of the business rates holiday, saying only: “I think there will be continued support. I think that will be perhaps an extension of the VAT holiday.” It comes as Sunak is expected to provide more than £400m of additional support for the culture sector to help museums, theatres and galleries in England to reopen once coronavirus restrictions start to ease in the coming months. Sunak is expected to put an extra £300m into the £1.57bn culture recovery fund as part of the measures. In teasers before the budget, Treasury officials also said Sunak was preparing to give a “significant chunk” of a £300m sports recovery package to help cricket fans return to stadiums this summer. He will also announce a £150m community ownership fund to allow pubgoers to bid for up to £250,000 to save their favourite local. National museums and cultural bodies will also receive £90m to help keep them going until they can open their doors on 17 May at the earliest. Another £18.8m will be provided for community cultural projects, while an additional £77m will be given to the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to provide their culture sectors with similar support. Sunak said: “This industry is a significant driver of economic activity, employing more than 700,000 people in jobs across the UK, and I am committed to ensuring the arts are equipped to captivate audiences in the months and years to come.”"
2021-03-02T07:00:41Z,uk-news,UK news,‘He's a sharp cookie’: new owner ready to reopen world's oldest sweet shop,"A 24-year-old entrepreneur in the Yorkshire Dales is gearing up to reopen the doors of the world’s oldest sweet shop after becoming the new owner. Ben Howie has taken over the Oldest Sweet Shop in the World, a Guinness World Record-holding tourist attraction in Pateley Bridge, but is yet to scoop a single pound of pear drops at the counter because of lockdown restrictions. Howie will be manning the shop alone from 12 April, or as soon as non-essential shops are allowed to reopen, and he has had a seven-week crash course from the previous owners, Keith and Gloria Tordoff. He said: “I remember it from my childhood, even though that wasn’t such a long time ago, and my mum remembers that from her childhood. We saw it and we just thought we can really grow this business into some kind of a heritage brand that is loved by everyone.” Howie, who grew up in North Yorkshire and studied business management and marketing at Harper Adams, has started to build up the online side of the business, which has thrived during lockdown. “I guess people are just seeking a bit of solace in sweets. It’s a kind of comfort blanket for a lot of people, and most people can afford half a pound of sweets at a pound or two,” he said. “And the enjoyment that one pound or two pounds gives them – it can remind them of their childhood, it can remind them of better times.” He has had a steep learning curve when it comes to the products, as the rows and rows of vintage jars include sweets that Howie had never encountered before, from suppliers that are decades if not centuries old. He said: “I’m learning all the time and obviously some of them predate myself. But the heritage behind each of those sweets is fascinating really. Probably one of our best sellers is the sweet peanut, which I find strange, but some of the older generations before me absolutely love them. It’s a boiled sweet in the shape of a peanut. Obviously, there are not many places that sell those kinds of sweets any more. “Meanwhile, the younger customers all like to try the super sour fizz bombs. Anyone who can hold that in their mouth for 10 seconds is brave in my book. I’m not very good at sour, I’m much more a sweet tooth.” Keith Tordoff, who owned the shop for more than 20 years and built it into the tourist attraction it is now, said Howie was a safe pair of hands. “He’s very bright, a sharp cookie. It’s fantastic that we’ve sold it and we’re really excited to move on to the next chapter,” he said. They are not moving far. Gloria is opening a vintage film poster gallery in the old HSBC bank on the high street, while Keith will be standing as an independent candidate in May’s election for the North Yorkshire police, fire and crime commissioner."
2021-03-01T22:30:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Rishi Sunak to offer 'help to grow' training for SME managers,"The bosses of small businesses are to be invited back to school to brush up on their management skills, under plans to be announced in the budget designed to help close Britain’s productivity gap with rival nations. As part of the attempt to speed up the UK’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will unveil a “help to grow” scheme that will offer the leaders of up to 130,000 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) the chance of MBA-style management training. The £520m plan to spur innovation and growth will also provide SMEs with the chance to get expert technology advice and discounted digital software. Sunak will say he expects tens of thousands of small businesses to take advantage of the sort of high-class management training that bigger companies can more easily afford. The chancellor said: “Our brilliant SMEs are the backbone of our economy, creating jobs and generating prosperity – so it’s vital they can access the tools they need to succeed. Help to Grow will ensure they are embracing the latest technology and management training, fuelling our plan for jobs by boosting productivity in all corners of the UK.” The Treasury said studies had shown that improving the performance of SMEs to match that of competitor countries such as Germany could add £100bn to the UK economy. International comparisons show that on one measure of productivity – output per hour worked – the UK has a deficit of 16% compared with the other members of the G7 (the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada). Compared with the US and Germany, the gap is more than 20%. Andy Haldane, the chief economist of the Bank of England, has said the productivity gap between the top and bottom-performing companies is materially larger in the UK than in France, Germany or the US. In the services sector, the gap between the top and bottom-performing 10% of companies is 80% larger in the UK than in its international competitors. Sunak will say on Wednesday that he wants to focus on innovation, skills and investment as the economy emerges from the lockdown restrictions imposed to lower Covid-19 infection rates.
Under the Treasury scheme, leading business schools will offer 50 hours of tuition with one-to-one support from a business mentor. The UK ranks fifth in the G7 for the use of good management practices, and Sunak believes the 12-week programme will build more profitable, resilient and productive businesses. Evidence from the ONS suggests that even small improvements in management practices can lead to 10% increase in productivity. In addition to management training, the government will create a new online platform to offer free advice on technology that will help businesses to save time, reduce costs, and reach more customers. Eligible SMEs will be given vouchers to get up to 50% off the purchase of new productivity-enhancing software, up to £5,000 each. The Treasury says technologies such as customer relationship management (CRM) software can increase sales by around 18% per employee over the course of three years."
2021-03-01T21:29:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Meteorites from sky fireball 'may have fallen near Cheltenham',"The yellow-green fireball that pierced Earth’s atmosphere on Sunday night, delighting observers from the UK to the Netherlands, is thought to have partially survived the journey in the form of meteorites, most likely landing just north of Cheltenham. Fireballs are particularly bright meteors – space matter that burns up as it enters Earth’s atmosphere. Whatever is left of it when it reaches the surface of the Earth is known as a meteorite. They are of particular interest to scientists as they can offer crucial clues about the history of the solar system. Richard Kacerek, founder of the UK meteor network, a group of amateur astronomers who have been using cameras to record sightings across the UK since 2012, said computer modelling suggested the probable site of the meteor’s impact was just north of the Gloucestershire town. Roughly 50 tonnes of extraterrestrial material enters the Earth’s atmosphere each year, mainly in the form of sand-sized particles called space dust. In the UK, about 20 meteorites – barely the size of sugar cubes – are estimated to land each year. The last recovered meteorite fall was in 1991 in the village of Glatton near Peterborough.
Brighter fireballs have been sighted in the past, said Kacerek. “What makes this particular fireball really special is that we think that something has actually survived.” Ashley King, of the Natural History Museum in London, said in a statement: “The video recordings tell us its speed was about 30,000mph, which is too fast for it to be human-made ‘space junk’, so it’s not an old rocket or satellite. “The videos also allowed us to reconstruct its original orbit around the sun. In this case, the orbit was like an asteroid’s. This particular piece of asteroid spent most of its orbit between Mars and Jupiter, though sometimes got closer to the sun than Earth is.” Basing their predictions on footage from multiple specialised fireball cameras, the observers concluded that smaller-than-golf-ball sized pieces of dark-coloured fragmented rock pieces would be found, Kacerek said, adding that it was still unclear to which comet the meteor belonged. “We have already received a few emails from people in the area, saying that they found something interesting,” he added, noting that those sightings still needed to be verified by scientists from the Natural History Museum. If people come across pieces of meteorite, scientists said, they should first photograph it in place and note the location using their phone’s GPS, but avoid touching it directly. Meteorites are usually rich in iron, but using a magnet could damage the sample – Kacerek suggested picking it up using a clean plastic bag.
The UK public should remember that the lockdown was still in place, and people should not break restrictions to look for meteorites, he cautioned. One of the biggest draws of examining meteorites is a theory called panspermia: that the chemistry of life exists in space. Astronomical research has found the building blocks of life in the atmospheres of distant planets and interstellar clouds, and even more complicated compounds in meteorites. Given that life on Earth began at least 3.8bn years ago and the leap from organic chemistry to self-replicating organisms is so vast, some astronomers propose that life might have been delivered by a passing comet. “It is certainly a theory, but I think it is a very likely theory,” said Kacerek. “We don’t know much about it [the meteor from Sunday] yet. But certainly … setting up a meteor camera, recording the meteorite and then going and pick it up will help answer those questions.” On Sunday night, Kacerek’s own three cameras did not detect the fireball. “But when I saw the pictures, I said, ‘Holy …’ I knew what it meant,” he said. “Because it meant … that I have to get up at 6 o’clock and talk to media all day.”"
2021-03-01T15:56:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Prince Philip moves hospital two weeks after admission,"The Duke of Edinburgh has been transferred to St Bartholomew’s hospital in London where doctors will continue to treat him for an infection and a pre-existing heart condition, Buckingham Palace has said. Prince Philip was moved after almost two weeks in the private King Edward VII’s hospital in central London, where he was admitted as a “precautionary measure” on 16 February. In a statement, Buckingham Palace said: “The Duke of Edinburgh was today transferred from King Edward VII’s hospital to St Bartholomew’s hospital where doctors will continue to treat him for an infection, as well as undertake testing and observation for a pre-existing heart condition. “The duke remains comfortable and is responding to treatment but is expected to remain in hospital until at least the end of the week.” Philip left the King Edward VII private hospital in central London after 13 nights at about 10am by a back exit. Reports at the scene said he was shielded by umbrellas as he climbed into the back of a waiting ambulance as police officers stood nearby behind barricades keeping back photographers.
He had been admitted after falling ill at Windsor Castle, where he and the Queen had been shielding during the pandemic. It is his longest stay in hospital. In June 2013, he spent 11 days after surgery to his abdomen. Philip underwent angioplasty and stenting in 2011 for a blocked coronary artery after being admitted to Papworth hospital in Cambridgeshire over the Christmas period following chest pains. The Queen, their children and grandchildren visited him during his four-night stay, as he spent Christmas and Boxing Day in hospital. Last Tuesday the Earl of Wessex said his father was feeling “a lot better” when it was announced the duke would spend several more days in hospital. Prince Edward said Philip was “looking forward to getting out” and his family were “keeping their fingers crossed”. Prince Charles has been the only family member to visit, spending about 30 minutes at the hospital four days after Philip was admitted. Meanwhile for the Queen it was business, but not quite as usual, for the Queen as her husband of 73 years continued hospital treatment. She unveiled a statue of herself – virtually. In a video call with the governor of South Australia, Hieu Van Le, and premier, Steven Marshall, she saw the statue, by sculptor Robert Hannaford, which has been installed in the grounds of Government House. “It must be quite alarming to suddenly see it out of the window – you’d think, gracious, has she arrived unexpectedly,” remarked the Queen during the call. A “maquette”, or scale model, of the original had been dispatched to the Queen. “I’m glad it’s not quite as big as the original statue,” she said. The royal biographer Penny Junor told PA Media Prince Philip’s demeanour in hospital would be important. “Let’s hope he’s not resigned, let’s hope he’s not being a good patient because I think that would probably be a bad sign – a cantankerous duke is a healthy one,” she said. The author highlighted how the Queen appeared at ease when she encouraged those who were vaccine hesitant to “think about other people rather than themselves” during a video call last week. Junor said: “I think the Queen looked very jolly in a message that she put out the other day about having the vaccine. She doesn’t look to me like someone who is desperately worried and waiting for the phone to ring.”"
2021-03-01T15:34:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Why has Prince Philip been transferred to St Bartholomew's hospital?,"The Duke of Edinburgh has been transferred to St Bartholomew’s hospital in London, and Buckingham Palace has announced that the 99-year-old required observation for an existing heart condition. It is not known if his earlier admission to King Edward VII’s hospital in central London was as a result of this condition, or unrelated. The only details previously given were that he was treated for a non-Covid-19-related infection and was responding to medication. But his transfer may indicate that his heart condition now necessitates more specialist treatment than is possibly available at the King Edward VII, the hospital of choice for senior royals. Philip was given a stent in 2011 for a blocked coronary artery after being admitted to Papworth hospital in Cambridgeshire over the Christmas period after having chest pains. The minimally invasive procedure involves pushing a balloon into the artery and blowing it up to remove the blockage. The duke remained in hospital for a short while for observation. St Bartholomew’s hospital is Britain’s oldest hospital, and will celebrate its 900th anniversary in 2023. It is part of the Barts Health NHS trust in the City of London. It is a centre of excellence in cardiac care, and, according to the NHS website, has Europe’s largest specialised cardiovascular centre. Barts Heart Centre is based in the hospital’s state-of-the-art King George V building. It has 10 theatres, and 10 cath labs, where tests and procedures including ablation, angiograms, angioplasty and implantation of pacemakers are carried out. In total it has more than 300 general, cardiac and critical care beds. The NHS has said that the centre aspires to perform more heart surgery, MRI and CT scans than any other service in the world, and boosts survival rates well above the national average. In January 2020, the service was rated No 1 for cardiac arrest survival rates in London. The Barts Health NHS trust website says it provides cardiovascular services from Barts Heart Centre, Newham University hospital, the Royal London hospital and Whipps Cross University hospital.

2021-03-01T15:15:21Z,uk-news,UK news,When could Wales ease its Covid lockdown measures?,"While Boris Johnson has announced his phased plan for easing lockdown restrictions in England, Wales currently lacks an equivalent roadmap. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said: “We need you to stay at home for a bit longer.” For now, all of Wales will remains at alert level 4 until at least 12 March, meaning people must stay at home except for very limited purposes and are prohibited from meeting others from outside their household. Children aged three to seven returned to school on 22 February, and from Monday 1 March licensed venues can perform wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, with the number of permitted guests dictated by the venues’ ability to enforce social distancing measures. However, Drakeford has said there are no imminent plans to reopen pubs, restaurants or gyms. 12 March Next review of “stay at home” restrictions, with a possibility of more changes if coronavirus cases continue to fall. 15 March Possible reopening date for non-essential shops, including salons and hairdressers. Primary schools to reopen to remaining pupils. Secondary school pupils in exam years 11 and 13, and some pupils in years 10 and 12 who are due to sit exams, may also be allowed to return from this date. Easter (4 April) Target date for reopening of tourism businesses. 12 April The education minister, Kirsty Williams, has said she hopes remaining secondary school pupils will be back in school from 12 April."
2021-03-01T14:31:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Budget is vital test of UK government's green credentials ,"The budget this week will be a vital test of Boris Johnson’s green credentials, with campaigners watching keenly to see whether plans match up to the government’s repeated claims to be creating a “green industrial revolution”. After this week, there are no more formal budgets to come before the UK hosts the vital UN Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow later this year. Meanwhile several of the government’s flagship green policies are in difficulties. The measures to be unveiled by Rishi Sunak, chancellor of the exchequer, include boosting cash for the national infrastructure bank, some of which will be invested in low-carbon projects, and a government-backed green savings bond for retail investors. Sunak said: “The UK is a global leader on tackling climate change, with a clear target to reach net zero by 2050, and a 10-point plan to create green jobs. We’re also launching new competitions that will unlock innovation in renewable energy, and help us develop the cutting-edge technology we need to reach net zero.” Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace, said many more measures were needed for a genuinely green budget that would galvanise Cop26. “The climate requires zero-carbon investment, the economy requires zero-carbon investment, and because of Cop26, diplomacy requires zero-carbon investment,” she said. “This budget is the government’s opportunity to finally show it can walk the walk, and is willing to implement change as well as call for it.” So far, the government has disappointed green experts by freezing fuel duty and axing funding for home insulation, while investing in roads and giving the go-ahead to a new coal mine. The Treasury has started to prepare for potential carbon taxes, but these are controversial, as poorly designed taxes could penalise poor people. Sam Alvis, of the thinktank Green Alliance, said: “The prime minister has called for a green recovery, but his vision hasn’t yet been backed up by the big immediate investment needed from the Treasury. There has been a lot of support for future technology, such as carbon capture and hydrogen, rather than the proven projects that will create green jobs and tackle the environmental crisis.” Johnson is under pressure from an unlikely combination of forces. His father, Stanley Johnson, international ambassador for the Conservative Environment Network, told the Times his son must “practise what he preaches” by funding nature protection. Meanwhile David Cameron, former prime minister, told the Guardian Johnson must forge a green recovery from the Covid-19 crisis. “You have to roll up your sleeves and be quite muscular in your interventionism … with active assistance and helping with key green investments that can make a difference,” he urged. Most importantly, world governments will be watching the UK carefully as they prepare their own national plans on carbon emissions, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to be presented at Glasgow this November. Without stringent national plans, the Cop26 summit will fail, but an assessment by the UN published late last week showed how far off track most countries are: current NDCs, submitted by nearly half of countries under the Paris agreement, would result in only a 1% reduction in carbon by 2030, compared with the 45% cut required. Patricia Espinosa, the UN’s top climate official, said: “What we need is [countries] to put on the table much more radical, much more transformative plans than they have been doing up to now.” If the UK is to persuade other countries to come up with stronger NDCs, it must show it has plans to fulfil its own pledges. “The budget is the chancellor’s moment to show he means business ahead of the G7 and COP later this year,” said Alvis. While the demand for UK leadership has never been greater, green campaigners told the Guardian that ministers’ recent actions would need to be reversed. The government’s flagship green recovery policy, the green homes grant, has fallen into disarray, with fewer than 3,000 low-carbon measures installed after nearly six months, despite 100,000 people applying for grants. The scheme was intended to bring about 600,000 homes up to green standards. Sunak now plans to withdraw £1bn in unspent funding for this year, and to provide only £320m next year or axe the scheme altogether. Plans to bring forward a requirement for housing developers to build new homes to low-carbon standards have also been put back, to 2025. MPs have urged Sunak to at least reduce VAT on green home improvements, but even that may be denied. Housing accounts for about 40% of the UK’s emissions. Transport policy is also a concern, as the National Audit Office found last week that emissions from the sector were only 1% lower than in 2011, as SUV sales had outstripped those of electric cars. The government plans a £27bn road scheme, but has said little on boosting the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. Last December, Johnson assured heads of state gathered for a virtual conference to mark five years of the Paris agreement that the UK would stop funding fossil fuel development overseas. However, funding for a controversial gas project is Mozambique looks set to go ahead, and other projects are still on the table. Ministers also provoked the wrath of James Hansen, the former Nasa scientist known as the godfather of climate change, as well as other prominent scientists and experts, by backing the first new deep coal mine in the UK in 30 years. The Cumbrian mine is now under review by the local council, but the cabinet’s support for it was viewed as a troubling signal. Airport expansion is also poised to be waved through by ministers, along with a potential new fleet of gas-fired power stations. Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said the budget, and ministers’ decisions in the next few months, would be the acid test of the UK’s leadership on the global stage. “If the prime minister’s pledge to build back greener is to be more than just empty words, Rishi Sunak must make green jobs and infrastructure the centrepiece of this year’s budget,” he said. “Unless the government delivers on its green pledges in the near future, Boris Johnson will go into [Cop26] crucial climate talks later this year looking like the emperor with no clothes.”"
2021-03-01T06:00:15Z,uk-news,UK news,Becontree centenary: residents mark century of London estate,"When it was built after the first world war, Becontree in Dagenham was billed as the world’s largest ever housing estate – a modern utopia where more than 100,000 war veterans and workers from Dagenham in east London would have an inside toilet, a proper bathroom and gardens front and back. A hundred years after the first “home for heroes” was completed in 1921, Becontree’s centenary is being marked by a series of events and public realm investments, including two fantastical playgrounds and a range of street furniture produced from upcycled rubble. About 85,000 people still live on Becontree, with about a third of homes rented as social housing and three-bed terraces now selling for about £350,000. Many residents have been involved in the Becontree Forever project, which promises to “celebrate the radical past of the estate and reimagine its future anew”. The Irish artist Eva Rothschild will build a playground in Parsloes Park called the Becontree Pyramids, referencing ancient architecture and the modular formats of Minecraft and Lego. It will open in July, marked by a dance performance with teenage Becontree Estate residents working with the world-renowned Studio Wayne McGregor.
The British-Nigerian designer Yinka Ilori will build a second playground in the same park, remaking an out-of-use play area with structures inspired by the park’s original pink flamingos, whose wings were clipped so they could not fly away. He will collaborate with residents of different ages and cultures to produce accessible equipment including tall totems, slides, birdwatching and bird-nesting structures and a basketball court. The artist duo Studio Morison will make a range of terrazzo street furniture from upcycled rubble from the estate. They will activate five shopping parades, again working closely with estate residents. The architects nimtim and the artist Katie Schwab, commissioned in partnership with the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), will co-design three new public squares with local residents, reimagining green spaces at the end of terraces as places for people to meet and play.
The Portuguese artist Leonor Antunes will work with fabricators on the estate to produce a series of modernist commemorative plaques to celebrate residents from the estate’s past – both famous names as well as unsung heroes. Those who grew up on Becontree include Alf Ramsey, Terry Venables, Max Bygraves, Dudley Moore, and the former archbishop of Canterbury George Carey. Other projects include an audio work by the former Dagenham resident Larry Achiampong and a major exhibition at RIBA in September 2021. The commissions are produced and curated by Create London, an arts organisation which led the east London cultural programme for the 2012 Olympics, in addition to other local and national partners. The programme is supported by the London borough of Barking and Dagenham using its Community Infrastructure Levy, a charge paid by developers to help mitigate the impact of their developments on the local community, as well as the National Lottery Heritage Fund. The council hopes the schemes will bring together a community which has fragmented as major local employers have closed (such as the May & Baker chemical plant) or, as in the case of Ford, scaled back significantly. As a result, in recent years, many residents must travel outside the borough for employment. Habda Rashid, a senior curator from Create London, said Becontree was much more diverse now than when it was built, with almost half of residents coming from black or minority ethnic backgrounds – many from Nigeria and Ghana. Becontree Forever would tell their stories as well as those of the original inhabitants, Rashid said. “It’s really important that we shift that lens, so that we are not just telling the same stories, we incorporate the histories of other people.” • This article was amended on 1 March 2021 to clarify that other organisations besides Create London are involved in the commissioning and curation process; and to correct a misnaming of Becontree Forever as Becontree Together."
2021-03-01T00:03:11Z,uk-news,UK news,"People smugglers could get life sentences under new rules, says Home Office","People smugglers could be handed life sentences under plans to ramp up penalties in an effort to stop migrants crossing the Channel. At present, the maximum sentence for people smuggling is 14 years in prison. The Times reported that Priti Patel wants to lengthen jail terms because of her concerns that the average sentence received is three years. The Home Office said ministers would set out further details “in the coming weeks”. A spokesman said: “Whilst criminal gangs continue to put lives at risk it is right we consider every option to stop their exploitation of people.” It comes as 87 people arrived in Dover on Saturday, after making the dangerous journey in four small boats. All were tested for Covid-19, with one receiving a positive result, the Home Office said. French authorities also prevented two attempted crossings involving a further 51 people on the same day. It means 531 people have made the crossing this year, 40% more than the same point in 2020, when there was a record of 8,417 crossings in the year. The home secretary has come under fire in recent weeks after it was revealed that former military barracks being used to house asylum seekers had been badly affected by coronavirus outbreaks. The barracks did not “meet acceptable standards of accommodation” when it was surveyed seven years ago. Napier barracks near Folkestone, Kent had at least 197 positive cases of Covid-19 this year alone – more than 50% of its resident population at its peak of 380. Asylum seekers claimed facilities had been dirty or broken for months. The Home Office has also been urged to investigate the network of hotels holding thousands of asylum seekers following allegations of sexual harassment, intimidation and claims that staff have been paid significantly below the minimum wage. Yvette Cooper, who chairs the home affairs select committee, has called on the Home Office to investigate the private firms running the hotels. A joint investigation by the Observer and ITV News found asylum seekers have been unlawfully threatened by private contractor staff that the police will be called if they leave their hotel. There are also allegations that women have been sexually exploited inside hotels, with others complaining they feel unsafe. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We have raised these serious allegations with our accommodation provider and will investigate them fully. “Asylum seekers are not detained – they are free to come and go as they please in line with Covid restrictions. “The Home Office takes the wellbeing of asylum seekers incredibly seriously and they have 24/7 access to a migrant helpline if they need any assistance.”"
2021-03-01T00:00:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Rail fares rise by 2.6% in England and Wales,"Rail fares in England and Wales will increase by 2.6% on Monday, the first time the government has chosen to put up prices above RPI inflation since 2013, in a move that has been criticised for further pricing middle income earners out of rail travel and undermining the government’s green credentials. The price rise comes despite calls for freezes or even discounts to help attract passengers back to the railways. The government said the additional 1% rise above inflation came on the back of extraordinary public spending to prop up rail services during the pandemic when revenues fell away. The annual fare increase was delayed for two months by the Department for Transport – partly to allow season ticket holders to renew at a lower price before returning to work, officials said. And relatively few commuters are likely to be immediately affected this year: passenger numbers on trains are now around 14% of normal levels, largely due to coronavirus travel restrictions. However, critics have said the move would deter passengers from taking public transport again and potentially lead to more road congestion. Car use has declined only slightly in the last year, despite home working and curbs on travel. The TUC warned that it would slow urban recovery where commuters rely on the trains. General secretary Frances O’Grady said: “This inflation-busting rise will not help commuters and city centres recover from the pandemic. The government needs a credible plan for the future of rail that gives passengers better value. “We need the railways back in public hands.” Following the fare increase, the average commuter will pay £3,144 for their season ticket, which equates to a 43% or £950 increase in the last decade, according to research from Labour. It has analysed costs on more than 180 train routes since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, and found that average fares have risen two-and-a-half times faster than wages over the period. Labour has projected the highest fare rise to be on a Avanti West Coast season ticket between Birmingham and London Euston, which will have risen by £3,467 since 2010, to a total cost of £11,204. Meanwhile it identified the largest percentage increase to have occurred between Tame Bridge Parkway near Walsall and Nuneaton, where the cost of an annual season ticket will have risen by 63% since 2010. Jim McMahon MP, Labour’s shadow transport secretary, said rail passengers will have to pay even more to use the services they rely on, after the worst economic slump in 300 years. “This fare hike will make rail unaffordable for many and discourage people from getting back on to the network when lockdown restrictions ease in the coming months,” McMahon said. The Campaign for Better Transport has also warned that the fare rise could deter commuters from returning to workplaces in the coming months, further delaying the economic recovery. It said flexible tickets were needed for part-time workers – and called on the government to increase fuel duty on cars in Wednesday’s budget instead of raising fares. Transport workers’ union the TSSA called the hike in fares “lamentable” and criticised the government’s “utterly misguided approach” towards getting passengers back on to trains. Industry body the Rail Delivery Group said it wants to work with government to recast how train passengers buy their fares. “We want the whole country to benefit from a new, more flexible system where people pay-as-they-go and automatically get the best deal at the end of the week or month, similar to London,” said Robert Nisbet, director of nations and regions at the Rail Delivery Group. “This would deliver a system which incentivises more people back to the network”. The government’s power to set rail fares should be scrapped, according to the Liberal Democrats. Sarah Olney, Lib Dem spokesperson for transport said it was a “grossly unfair hike” and called for “an independent agency with real teeth to give a fair deal to passengers”. The rail industry has called on government to reform fares and ticketing to cut costs and simplify the system. Changes were expected under the Williams Review, but the government-commissioned report by Keith Williams and ensuing white paper have yet to be published. However, it is understood that all rail operators will be asked to bring in some form of flexible season tickets this year, to make journeys more affordable for regular commuters working only a few days a week. A DfT spokesperson said the government would set out further plans to offer cheaper, more flexible tickets for commuters in due course. They added: “Passengers returning to the railway deserve punctual and reliable journeys at a fair price. This is the lowest increase in four years – despite unprecedented taxpayer support for the rail industry during the pandemic of around £10bn, and billions more being spent on new infrastructure.” Fares within Scotland will rise by a maximum of 1.6%, in line with last July’s RPI figure, with some fares capped at just 0.6%."
2021-02-28T22:30:05Z,uk-news,UK news,'Red wall' Tory MPs urge Sunak to cut business rates for shops,"Rishi Sunak is under increasing pressure from Conservative “red wall” MPs to go beyond existing support for the UK economy in Wednesday’s budget and cut taxes for thousands of retailers. MPs across the political spectrum are increasingly uneasy that he may introduce income tax rises for middle earners, and the chancellor is facing calls from 45 northern Tories to make “a bold move to reduce business rates”. The calls come as Sunak prepares for a major test on Wednesday as he seeks to find an extra £43bn to plug a hole in the UK’s post-pandemic finances while allowing the economy to recover from a third lengthy coronavirus lockdown.
It comes after he indicated in interviews on Sunday that emergency support measures such as the furlough scheme will be extended beyond the end of April and ruled out speeding up the easing of lockdown. Members of the influential Northern Research Group of Conservative backbenchers, which is led by the former minister Jake Berry, have written to the chancellor saying there is a need for “levelling the playing field between bricks and mortar and online retail”. They are demanding that business rates are reduced from about 50% of market rent to around 35% to help achieve this. “With many of our town centres hit particularly hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, now is the time for a bold move to reduce business rates nationally,” the MPs have written in a letter to Sunak. “We need to make sure that once people can go shopping again, they have high streets to go back to.” The chancellor is expected to announce on Wednesday that he is freezing for at least three years the point at which people start paying the basic rate of income tax – £12,500 – and the £50,000 threshold at which they begin paying the higher 40p rate. Separate from the budget, Sunak has confirmed he is considering targeting online retail giants like Amazon with a sales tax but said it would be introduced as part of a business rates review expected later in the year. Tory MPs are believed to be deeply uncomfortable with the idea of increasing taxes on middle earners. One former minister said Sunak should bring forward a tax on Amazon and other online retailers instead: “You have to wonder how many small businessmen, NHS doctors and other public sector workers will be hit by this income tax proposal. Why let Amazon off the hook while the people who worked through the pandemic go to the wall?” Business leaders are also dismayed that tax rises, including vital VAT cuts for the hospitality industry, will end before firms have been given a chance to recover. Adam Marshall, the head of the British Chambers of Commerce, warning of the potential for a lifeless recovery, said: “Confidence is important and if the government is saying that considerable tax rises are coming down the track then entrepreneurs and businesses hearing that will take heed and cut back their ambitions.” In a major shift in policy from Labour’s last manifesto, the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, will demand on Monday that Sunak does not increase taxes and ensure that key workers are not left out of any recovery. Speaking to Bloomberg in central London, she will describe the Covid crisis as a “wake-up call” after a year of “last-minute scrambles, of U-turns, waste and mismanagement”. “The chancellor’s message to our key workers – our teachers, our police officers, our armed forces personnel – at the end of one of the hardest years in living memory, is to say: you deserve a real-terms pay cut. That is spectacularly unjust. It’s also economically illiterate. “From the IMF and the World Bank to the OECD, every major international economic organisation is in agreement: now is not the time for tax rises on struggling businesses or families.” On Sunday Sunak implied he will extend the furlough scheme. Asked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News, he said: “I said at the beginning of this crisis that I would do whatever it took to protect people, families and businesses through this crisis and I remain completely committed to that. The PM in the roadmap set out a path for us to recover and reopen and I want to support people and businesses along that path. “I’m not going to comment on specific policies but I want to make sure people realise that we are going to be there to support them and if you look at our track record we went big, we went early and there’s more to come next week.” In the interview, Sunak ruled out speeding up the easing of lockdown even if data showed an improvement in the situation. “What we want is a cautious but irreversible approach. That’s why we’ve taken the approach that we have and those will be the earliest dates that we think we can do the various things we’ve laid out. But we’re doing everything we can to make sure that it is hopefully irreversible; that’s what we want to see. “What businesses don’t want is a stop-start approach to this,” he said. Economists and business leaders expect a surge in redundancies if the chancellor cancels pandemic subsidies before firms in the hardest hit sectors have found their feet. Marshall said large companies will already be thinking about notifying staff about mass redundancies after the government refused to signal that support will remain place for the rest of the year. The Night Time Industries Association said the announcement before the budget of £5bn to support nightclubs, theatres and restaurants remained vague. “There is still concern over how much impact the budget will have for specific sectors and a built-in anxiety as we await the full communication from the chancellor on Wednesday,” said chief executive Michael Kill. The budget will also outline a series of large spending commitments including a £5bn fund to provide grants to high street shops, pubs, restaurants and personal service firms such as hairdressers, which have been hit hardest by the pandemic. The government has also allocated £22bn – £12bn of capital and £10bn of guarantees – to fund a national infrastructure bank, which, with private sector investors, will fund £40bn of infrastructure projects. In a further development, Sunak will allocate £1.65bn to the coronavirus vaccine rollout to meet the target of offering a dose to every adult by 31 July and will divert £22m to fund a “world first” trial to test if different vaccines can be used together, or if a third dose is effective, the Treasury said. Former prime minister Gordon Brown is urging the chancellor to extend job support schemes in his budget this week or risk “betraying a generation of unemployed”. A report by the Alliance For Full Employment, set up by Brown, estimated there are at least 1,000 under-25s in every constituency in Britain now classed as long-term unemployed – without a job for at least six months. “The pandemic hit a year ago but the government’s failure to move quickly is condemning a whole generation of young people to joblessness and rejection and many to mental depression,” he said."
2021-02-28T22:00:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Gordon Brown says unemployed could be 'betrayed' in budget,"Rishi Sunak will be betraying a generation of unemployed people unless he uses Wednesday’s budget to scale up support for the growing ranks of the long-term jobless people, the former prime minister Gordon Brown has warned. Brown accused the government of complacency over the unemployment threat and said it was scandalous that not a single worker had been helped by the Restart scheme for the long-term adult jobless. Sunak’s Kickstart scheme to tackle long-term unemployment among the under-25 age group had helped only three out of every 1,000 young people, the former prime minister added. The chancellor said on Sunday that 100,000 places were lined up for young people under Kickstart, although the Treasury accepts that there is a lag between positions being found and placements starting. “Government complacency is betraying a generation of unemployed,” Brown said. “The pandemic hit a year ago but the government’s failure to move quickly is condemning a whole generation of young people to joblessness and rejection and many to mental depression.” The former prime minster said the government would not release regional data to show what was happening at a local level but the research suggested that in cities the size of Liverpool, Bristol or Manchester the numbers in the work programmes under Kickstart were little more than 20 and at best 30 in each place. “And worse even than this shocking blow to young people, is the scandalous failure so far to place just one adult on the government’s programme for the long term unemployed.” Brown’s comments accompanied a report from the Alliance For Full Employment which estimated there were at least 1,000 under-25s in every constituency in Britain who have not had a job for at least six months – the official definition of long-term youth unemployment. The Restart scheme for adult long-term unemployment – those out of work for more than a year – does not begin until the summer. Brown said Office for National Statistics data showed there were 470,000 people of all ages who were long-term jobless. The report called for a 10-point plan to tackle unemployment, including: Targeting new job creation in industries that are either understaffed, such as social care or expanding, such as renewable energy. Temporary cuts in national insurance contributions for employers to create hiring incentives. Advancing parts of the £100bn capital investment programme that would lead to immediate job creation, offering skills support for potential employees on infrastructure projects. Bringing forward the date for the start of Restart and providing help to public authorities to take on the unemployed. Increasing the scale and reach of Kickstart to provide work based training for the 1 million young unemployed; ensure adequate support and training is given to find long term employment. Extend the length of Kickstart beyond December 2021. Brown said: “The Restart programme was supposed to offer a job to those have been out of work for 12 months. By the time men and women are offered places this summer and autumn, thousands will have been out of work for 18 months. “The time for the chancellor to act is this Wednesday. His budget must kickstart Kickstart and restart Restart. He has to deliver a budget with the impetus, ambition and money to out match the scale of the looming unemployment tragedy.”"
2021-02-28T18:18:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Two adults and child warned after camping on Yorkshire cliff edge,"A couple and a child have been visited by emergency services after pitching a tent on a cliff edge in a stretch of the North York Moors known for landslips. Police officers were alerted as the family’s trip breached Covid-19 regulations, the coastguard said on Saturday, but it is unclear whether they were fined.
Rescue teams from Staithes and Whitby coastguards responded to reports of two adults and a child camping on the Cleveland Way section of the coastline. In a statement posted on social media, Staithes coastguard said they had issued “safety advice to two adults and a child camping on the cliff edge … due to the dangerous location of their tent, especially with recent landslips”. The coastguard added: “An officer from North Yorkshire police also attended due to breach of coronavirus restrictions.” Overnight stays away from home, other than for essential reasons, are illegal under the rules of the national lockdown. Under the coronavirus restrictions, holidays in the UK and abroad are not allowed. This includes staying in a second home, caravan or boat, unless it is a primary residence. The coastguard asks that those walking along the Cleveland Way stay on designated footpaths.
Last month, coastguard rescue teams responded to landslides and cliff falls at Runswick Bay, when a section of cliff weighing more than 200 tonnes fell on to the beach below. Another landslip followed, leaving an overhang, according to the Yorkshire Post. Staithes coastguard advised that people avoid walking under the cliffs or close to the edge as teams were receiving daily reports of collapses. “The cliff fall comes with no warning and being on the receiving end of even a small avalanche can be fatal,” it warned."
2021-02-28T13:19:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Liverpool Labour councillors fail to abolish role of city mayor,"Labour councillors in Liverpool have failed in an attempt to abolish the city mayoral role in protest against a decision by the party to scrap its all-female mayoral shortlist and bar three senior local politicians from standing. The move means the party must scrabble around to find a plausible candidate for May’s elections, following the arrest of the incumbent, Joe Anderson. Several frontrunners have already ruled themselves out, including the former MEP Theresa Griffin and Frank McKenna, a local business leader. Applying would be “like crossing the picket line”, said one Labour councillor, arguing it would show disrespect to the three women removed from the original shortlist: Wendy Simon, the acting mayor; Ann O’Byrne, Anderson’s former deputy; and Anna Rothery, the lord mayor.
Some in the local party fear the controversy could lead the way for an independent candidate to win in Liverpool, a Labour stronghold. At the last election in 2016, Anderson won 52.6% of votes, with the Liberal Democrats second on 21.1%. Under the mayoral model, if no candidate receives more than half of first preference votes, second preferences come into play. Last week, Stephen Yip, the founder of the Liverpool children’s charity Kind, announced his candidature. Frances Molloy, who last year won a campaign to ban old tyres after her son was killed in a coach crash, ruled herself out as a Labour candidate but said: “The role may now be better served by an independent candidate going forward as the political fallout and in-house fighting would be a serious distraction from the role.” At an emergency meeting of Liverpool Labour party on Saturday night, councillors voted 39 to 20 against ditching the mayoral position altogether and moving back to a leader and cabinet model. The idea was controversial for several reasons, not least because Labour had voted against the idea in January, after it was proposed by the Liberal Democrats. Instead, it voted to hold a referendum on the matter in 2023. According to the Liverpool Echo, legal advice was circulated around the Labour group before Saturday’s meeting, which warned that while technically the group could push through a vote to remove the mayoralty, it could leave the council open to a legal challenge. Lena Simic, a councillor who voted against the motion, said she felt it would “undermine democracy” to scrap the role of mayor without giving Liverpudlians a say. “We as elected representatives need to uphold democracy at every step, both internally in the Labour party, but also most importantly for the people of Liverpool. There are also legal issues around the motion,” she said. She supported a second motion from the Liverpool MP Ian Bryne that demanded transparency regarding the decision to remove the three women from the ballot. “In my personal opinion applying for this position before we know what has happened and we get some answers is uncomradely and like crossing a picket line,” she said."
2021-02-28T10:00:10Z,uk-news,UK news,"More than 50,000 people call for inquiry into use of Queen's consent","More than 50,000 people have called for a parliamentary investigation into an “unfathomable” mechanism that allows the Queen to vet draft laws before they are approved by the UK’s elected representatives. They have signed a petition supporting an urgent investigation by a House of Commons committee as they are concerned that the “royal family has a worrying and undemocratic ability to influence the government behind closed doors”. The petition was launched following an investigation by the Guardian into an arcane mechanism known as Queen’s consent. Under the procedure, ministers are required to notify the Queen of draft laws that affect her personal property, such as her private estates in Balmoral and Sandringham, and potentially anything deemed to affect her personally.
The Guardian revealed how the Queen used the opaque mechanism to lobby for changes in proposed laws that affected her estates and pressed for government policy to be altered. The paper also unearthed documents disclosing how the Queen’s representatives lobbied Edward Heath’s government to alter a proposed transparency law, enabling her to hide her private wealth from the public. The Queen’s representatives declined to say how many times she had requested alterations to legislation since she came to the throne in 1952. The Guardian compiled a database of at least 1,062 parliamentary bills that had been subjected to the archaic mechanism during the current monarch’s reign. It highlighted how the procedure had been exercised far more extensively than was previously believed. The petition, organised by the campaigning group 38 Degrees, urges MPs on the public administration and constitutional affairs committee to examine how “laws cannot be made” without her formal consent. It was delivered to the committee on Sunday. “It is unfathomable that in the 21st century, in a democracy, the Queen and the Prince of Wales hold such great power,” the petition says. “It may well be a constitutional monarchy in theory, but it seems that the monarchy has a lot more power than many previously thought.” The call for an investigation has been backed by a Labour MP who sits on the committee, Lloyd Russell-Moyle. He said it was wrong that the mechanism operated in semi-secrecy. “If the royal household say it is innocuous, then let the public see that.” The petition has also been signed by the Labour peer Lord Berkeley, one of the few politicians to have questioned the mechanism in the past.
He said: “It is high time that the Queen and the Duke of Cornwall [Prince Charles] gave up their right to change new legislation if it adversely affects their private interests – without parliament or the public even knowing about it. Nobody else has this privilege … For the royals, we don’t even know what changes they have asked to be made and whether ministers have agreed, as it is all done secretly without any paper trail.” The monarch and the government maintain that Queen’s consent is a “purely formal” part of the parliamentary process and is granted by the monarch as a matter of course. A spokeswoman for the Queen has previously said: “Whether Queen’s consent is required is decided by parliament, independently from the royal household, in matters that would affect crown interests, including personal property and personal interests of the monarch.”"
2021-02-28T07:10:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Don’t let pandemic losers slide further in a K-shaped recovery,"It’s time we talked about “K”. Britain, it’s now commonly agreed, will be climbing out of our economic nadir in the months ahead even if the rate of recovery is unclear – but what worries thoughtful economists, notably but not only the new US treasury secretary Janet Yellen, is its Covid-dominated K character. Essentially winners from the pandemic – the better-off, hi-tech companies, leading brands, the healthy, those whose work held up over lockdown and live in prosperous neighbourhoods – are going to do even better, moving up the upward-sloping part of the K. At the same time others – the disadvantaged, small- and medium-sized companies, the digitally challenged, those working in stricken sectors such as hospitality and who live in less well-off neighbourhoods, the young – are going to have it tough, sliding down the downward slope of the K. To put it at its most graphic, some will be partying while simultaneously the numbers sleeping rough and using food banks will reach epidemic proportions. On some estimates destitution is set to double. Yellen worries this threatened K recovery would be superimposed on an already vicious K economy and society, and is the chief reason for both the size and character of the US’s $1.9tn stimulus package – trying to transform the country’s K recovery into a more normal one by injecting greater resilience and income security to those on the lower slope of the K, and as a building block thereafter for less K generally. The EU’s ambitious recovery plan is also aimed at mitigating the K. In Wednesday’s budget the British government, instead of its politicised preoccupation with creating dividing lines over tax and fiscal responsibility four years from a general election – trying to catch the Labour party out over proposed corporation tax increases – should be doing the same. For as matters stand Covid and Brexit together will turn Britain into even more of a K economy and society – reducing the size of our economy by as much 8% in the medium term while deepening stark inequalities. No chancellor wants anything other than sustainable public finances, but they result from a healthy, resilient economy and society. Build that, and sound public finance will follow, aided and abetted by a well-designed broad tax base. We are far from that now. Far too many conservatives are neuralgic about public debt and not about the condition of the society in which we live. Public activism to create public goods – great training, less child poverty, more innovation, liveable affordable housing – is to be avoided as far as possible; instead the instinct is to use tax breaks to incentivise the private sector to achieve public ends, one of the reasons the UK tax code is among the most riddled with loopholes in the world – and most abused.
So the schemes supporting work and society during the pandemic – from furlough to the £20 a week increase in universal credit – must be extended. The question is what follows. It should be to reduce, if not end, the K. At least another £100bn should be earmarked for major investment in “building back bolder” – in turning round disadvantaged children’s early years where the paybacks are remarkable, for a proper system of lifelong learning, for Rooseveltian job creation programmes, for massive housebuilding focused on Covid blackspots, for supporting innovation modelled on how vaccine production has been magicked into being, for vouchers to be spent in ailing high streets. Tax increases should be introduced only as recovery takes hold and as part of a root and branch reform of our addled tax system. Welfare must be designed to end the scandals of malnutrition, systemic overcrowding and disease. Determined government can make a difference. In the quest to end the K, Britain should not be the west’s odd one out."
2021-02-28T05:29:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Suspected second world war bomb detonated in Exeter after homes evacuated,"Thousands of people have been forced to spend a second night out of their homes after a suspected second world war bomb discovered in Exeter was detonated. The noise of the explosion heard for miles around and left a crater the size of a double-decker bus, police said on Saturday night, as well as sending debris up to 250 metres away from the site of the blast. Devon and Cornwall Police were alerted after the device was discovered on a building site on private land to the west of the University of Exeter campus at about 9.20am on Friday.
Initially, a 100m cordon was erected, but this was extended to 400m on Saturday at the request of the Royal Navy bomb disposal team. Around 2,600 properties in the vicinity of Glenthorne Road, including 1,400 university students, were evacuated on Friday and Saturday. Police warned that a “loud bang” was expected when the bomb was detonated at 6.10pm on Saturday, but said there was no cause for alarm as the cordon meant there were no health risks to anyone beyond its perimeter. Residents had been expected to return to their homes on Saturday night but, speaking after the blast, a force spokesman said: “The 400m cordon will remain until further notice, so residents should not return home this evening. “Devon County Council and Exeter Council have been working to support evacuated residents.” He added: “Around 400-tonnes of sand was transported to the site of the device, which is at a building site on private land, and walls were erected, initially by the Royal Navy bomb disposal experts, followed by Army personnel from the Royal Logistics Corps, to mitigate the impact of the detonation. “Trenches were also dug to prevent ground shock. Despite these mitigation measures, the impact of the blast has been significant and debris has been thrown at least 250-metres away. The crater is around the size of a double decker bus.” Twelve university halls of residence buildings were among the locations evacuated, forcing 1,400 university students to leave their dorms. The University of Exeter confirmed that students were being relocated to hotels and provided with “personal care items and details of food allowances”. Examination of the device, thought to be about 2.5 metres x 70cm in size, began at 10am on Saturday, Insp Sean Roper of Devon and Cornwall police said. After the discovery of the device, road closures were put in place between Cowley Bridge and the Exe bridges, with diversions in place and motorists advised to avoid the area. Exeter city council said it had set up a rapid response hub to help assist those who had been evacuated in conjunction with Devon county council. The majority of residents evacuated are staying with family and friends, police said. A spokesperson for Devon and Cornwall police confirmed that the examination and detonation of the device had been passed to the army. “Residents should be reassured that military, police and partners are working to maintain public safety. Exemptions in Covid-19 social distancing rules exist for matters of public safety such as this.”"
2021-02-27T11:00:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Sunak's budget expected to offer first-time buyers mortgage guarantee,"The chancellor is expected to unveil a mortgage guarantee scheme that aims to help first-time buyers get their foot on the property ladder in next week’s budget. Rishi Sunak is attempting to incentivise lenders to provide mortgages to first-time buyers, along with current homeowners, with deposits as low as 5% on properties worth up to £600,000. The government will offer lenders the guarantee they need to provide mortgages covering the remaining 95%, with details set to be unveiled on Wednesday. The scheme will be subject to standard affordability checks, and is expected to launch in April. Low-deposit mortgages have virtually disappeared due to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the Treasury said as Boris Johnson announced he wanted “generation rent to become generation buy”. “Young people shouldn’t feel excluded from the chance of owning their own home and now it will be easier than ever to get on to the property ladder,” the prime minister said. Sunak’s mortgage guarantee scheme is based on the help-to-buy mortgage programme introduced by David Cameron and George Osborne, which ran until June 2017. The scheme was an attempt to kickstart the housing market following the 2008 financial crisis, and was estimated to have helped sell more than 100,000 homes in the UK.
Sunak said: “Owning a home is a dream for millions across the UK and we want to help as many people as possible. “Saving up for a big deposit can often be difficult, and the pandemic has meant there are fewer low deposit mortgages available.” However, in an interview with the Financial Times, the chancellor said there was a need to “level with people” over the state of the UK economy, which was under enormous strain. “There are some people who think you can ignore the problem. And worse, there are some people who think there isn’t a problem at all. I don’t think that,” he said. “We now have far more debt than we used to and because interest rates … at least a month or two ago were exceptionally low, that means we remain exposed to changes in those rates.” In an attempt to support the UK’s economic recovery from the pandemic, Sunak has also announced measures to tackle unemployment as the furlough scheme comes to an end, including new funding and cash incentives for apprenticeship schemes. The temporary £20-a-week rise in universal credit payments is expected to be extended after its planned end in April, but it is not clear how long this will be in place. Meanwhile, corporation tax is expected to be increased from 19% to about 23%, and capital gains tax will also rise. These changes will be phased in after lockdown has lifted, but are likely to rile some Conservative backbenchers. Speaking on Saturday, the former chancellor Ken Clarke urged Sunak not to end emergency economic packages yet, but to prepare to tackle spiralling debt. “[Sunak] has to keep in place things like the furlough scheme, the successful parts of the package that stopped the economy collapsing and kept alive good business, good jobs, that will revive if we can get ourselves through the end of this Covid crisis,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “That means more spending, more debt piling up. What he also has to do is start actually preparing for how he’s going to get that debt under control, how he’s going to return the burden of debt to normality, how he’s going to raise taxation, and I think he’s set out his intention to do that.”"
2021-02-27T06:00:16Z,uk-news,UK news,What will be in Rishi Sunak's 2021 budget?,"Rishi Sunak’s budget on 3 March is set to unveil a range of measures to help support the recovery of the UK economy, but tax rises are in the offing too. Here is what we can expect. Economic support measures Stamp duty The threshold at which buyers start paying stamp duty increased last July from £125,000 to £500,000 in England and Northern Ireland, exempting almost nine in 10 transactions. A backlog of sales means an extension for three months beyond the 31 March deadline is expected, costing around £1bn. Hospitality sector VAT Already extended once, the temporary reduction from 20% to 5% is likely to be pushed back to the summer, possibly for three months beyond the current 31 March cut-off. A delay could add £800m to the estimated £3.3bn cost so far. Business rates relief An extension in the temporary 100% tax cut for hospitality, retail and leisure is expected. Last year, larger firms paid back £2bn of unused relief on the tax, which is levied on commercial properties, and it could help fund a continuation of the subsidy. A more fundamental review of business rates and a potential online sales tax to help boost bricks and mortar retailers have been delayed until an autumn budget.
Business grants £600m of funds made available in January for the hardest hit firms, many of them in the hospitality, leisure and tourism sectors, could be topped up. Universal credit A £20-a-week uplift will run out in April but an extension for six months is likely after calls from all sides of the political spectrum for poorer families to receive support while restrictions remain in place. Investment for ‘levelling up’ The chancellor is expected to accelerate investments in transport, infrastructure spending and top-up pots for regenerating town centres. Investment in net-zero carbon Last month, the green homes grant for insulating homes was cut back to save around £1bn. The budget is expected to roll out further measures to bring down carbon emissions, including a more extensive electric vehicle-charging network.
Budget tax measures Corporation tax The chancellor is considering an increase in the headline corporation tax rate from 19% to 20% or even 21% from the autumn. Each percentage point rise gives him an extra £3bn in annual receipts. It could reach 25% by 2024. Pension tax A restriction on the amount wealthier people can put into their pensions to £1m over their lifetime could save £250m in tax relief. Around 1.2 million people are projected to exceed the threshold by the time they start drawing on their private or occupational pension. Capital gains tax The Office of Tax Simplification has recommended the government set the main tax on asset sales at the same rate it uses on income. That would mean increasing the CGT rate of 10% to 18% on company share sale profits and the 20% to 28% tax on property gains to match levels for income tax, which are levied at between 20% and 45%."
2021-02-26T22:34:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Sunak to use budget to start repairing UK's public finances,"Rishi Sunak will use the volatility in global financial markets to ram home a budget message next week that immediate action is needed to repair the damage to the public finances caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the deep downturn caused by the third nationwide lockdown in England, the chancellor – who has been closely monitoring market moves – will announce the first steps towards reducing the biggest peacetime deficit in Britain’s history. Measures to reduce the gap between government tax income and spending are expected to include lifting the corporation tax rate to 23% from the current rate of 19% over the parliament, and increasing capital gains tax.
Tax increases will be phased in after the lockdown has been lifted, and focused on higher earners and corporations – but they are likely to infuriate some Conservative backbenchers, many of whom have cautioned against clobbering the recovery by hitting businesses. Conservative grandees have waded into the debate in recent days, with the former chancellor Philip Hammond urging Boris Johnson to drop some of his populist spending pledges in the face of the pandemic, and the former prime minister David Cameron telling CNN that immediate tax increases “wouldn’t make any sense at all”. Whitehall sources said Sunak’s determination to start the work of fiscal consolidation had been strengthened by recent moves on financial markets. Investors have had a jittery week amid fears that effective vaccines and Joe Biden’s $1.8tn stimulus plan will lead to a rapid global recovery and a pickup in inflation. That fear has led to yields – or interest rates – on government bonds rising. As well as allowing Sunak to burnish his credentials as a responsible steward of the public finances after the Covid splurge, increasing taxes on businesses will throw down the gauntlet to Labour, which will have to decide whether to support the measures. Keir Starmer has insisted that “now is not the time for tax rises on families and businesses”, and Labour is urging Sunak to focus on boosting growth and supporting businesses in the short term. But the chancellor is likely to seek to capitalise on that stance. “Anyone who is suggesting that there isn’t a problem with the public finances, or ignoring it, is just not being honest with the British people, and that’s what Rishi is going to do next week,” said a Treasury source.
Sunak will say that every percentage point rise in market interest rates adds around £25bn a year to servicing the huge borrowing required to pay for furloughing millions of workers, supporting business and funding higher spending for the NHS over the past year. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility is expected to revise down its forecasts for economic growth in 2021 due to the weak start to the year. Borrowing in the 2021-22 financial year will be higher as a result of the continuation of emergency support for the economy, which will be one of the three themes of Sunak’s second budget speech. The short-term stimulus package will include an extension of wage subsidies until June, a targeted and tapered extension of the business rates holiday, and an extra three months for homebuyers to take advantage of zero stamp duty on properties worth less than £500,000. Sunak also plans to incentivise lenders to provide mortgages to first-time buyers and current homeowners, with just 5% deposits to buy properties worth up to £600,000. The government will offer lenders the guarantee they require to provide mortgages covering the remaining 95% The temporary £20-a-week increase in universal credit is also likely to be extended beyond its end-date at the start of April, but perhaps only for three months, until the end of the government’s roadmap out of lockdown.
The chancellor’s second theme will be the need to accelerate the economic recovery, with investment, infrastructure and R&D measures designed to make Britain more entrepreneurial. Sunak will say that even after rising from 19% to 23%, UK corporation tax will be lower than the average for the G7 group of industrial nations. Businesses have been told to expect more generous investment allowances and tax credits to compensate for higher corporation tax. “Having worked in the private sector, having invested in businesses, he will do everything to ensure that the UK remains an attractive place to come and invest,” said the Treasury source. Honesty is expected to be the third theme of the budget, with Sunak intending to come clean with the public about the challenges the pandemic poses to the public finances. In an interview with the Financial Times, the chancellor said there was a need to “level with people” over Britain’s public finances, which he said are under “enormous strains”. “There are some people who think you can ignore the problem,” Sunak said. “And, worse, there are some people who think there isn’t a problem at all. I don’t think that. “We now have far more debt than we used to and because interest rates … at least a month or two ago were exceptionally low, that means we remain exposed to changes in those rates.” Sunak has announced an expansion of Treasury support in anticipation of rising unemployment as the furlough ends. A new flexi-apprenticeship scheme will allow people to work for more than one employer in a sector, cash incentives will be increased for firms taking on apprentices and there will be an extra £126m of funding for traineeships. Sunak said: “Our Plan for Jobs has spread opportunity and hope throughout the crisis – helping people back into work and harnessing their talents for the future. We know there’s more to do and it’s vital this continues throughout the next stage of our recovery, which is why I’m boosting support for these programmes, helping jobseekers and employers alike.”"
2021-02-26T18:21:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Alex Salmond: weak leadership could hurt case for Scottish independence,"Alex Salmond has suggested that weak and incompetent leadership of Scotland’s institutions could undermine the case for independence, in a bitter attack on his former allies and party. The former first minister said huge deficiencies had been exposed in the running of the Scottish government and the Crown Office, as he blamed both institutions for forcing him to live through a “nightmare” during the last three years. Salmond told a Holyrood inquiry he had sought independence “all my political life”. But that must be “accompanied by institutions whose leadership is strong and robust and capable of protecting each and every citizen from arbitrary authority”, he added.
In one extraordinary allegation, Salmond said the Scottish government had failed to disclose to the police that Leslie Evans, Scotland’s chief civil servant, had spoken to two women who had indicated they could accuse him of sexual harassment before their complaints were formally made. Salmond said the police had served a warrant on the government seeking disclosure of that kind of evidence, but it was not given to them; the Crown Office had not been told, nor had his criminal trial. “That’s obstruction of justice,” he told the committee. Salmond also asserted that the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had broken the ministerial code – a charge she has repeatedly rejected. He claimed that she had failed to stop her government spending some £600,000 on a policy he had warned her from the start was unlawful. “I believe the first minister has broken the ministerial code. It is not the case that every minister who breaks the code must resign – it depends on what is found,” he said. Before being closely questioned over six hours of testimony, Salmond told the committee he did not agree with those who claimed Scotland was “in danger of becoming a failed state”. He said its institutions were “absolutely sound”. Even so, he said, “we can’t turn that page nor move on” until crises in its institutions were resolved. That meant Evans and the lord advocate, James Wolffe QC, should resign, he said. “The competence and professionalism of the civil service matters. The independence of the Crown Office acting in the public interest matters. Acting in accordance with legal advice matters,” he said. “Concealing evidence from the courts matters. The duty of candour of public authorities matters. Democratic accountability through parliament matters. Suppressing evidence from parliamentary committees matters. And yes, ministers telling the truth to parliament matters.” During hours of evidence that deepened his bitter feud with Nicola Sturgeon, once his protege and close friend, and his erstwhile allies in the Scottish National party, Salmond made a series of allegations about the conduct of senior civil servants and former colleagues. He also refused to be questioned by several MSPs on whether his past conduct towards women was wrong, and would not confirm whether he had apologised to one official he was accused of misconduct towards. Sturgeon accused Salmond on Wednesday of using this inquiry to deflect questions about his behaviour. Salmond retorted he had been cleared of any criminal offence: “After two court cases, two judges and a jury, I’m entitled to rest on the verdicts and particularly the verdict of the jury.” Giving evidence under oath, he also claimed: Sturgeon knew on 29 March 2018 Salmond was under investigation for sexual harassment by her government, four days earlier than the date she first gave to parliament, because she had agreed to meet Geoff Aberdein, his former chief of staff, to discuss it in her Holyrood office. Three witnesses could confirm that Aberdein, who at the time was not a government official, was told the name of one of the complainers and that one had sworn a statement to that effect. Sturgeon and he mentioned that complainer by name when they met at her home four days later, on 2 April 2018, contradicting Sturgeon’s statement in Holyrood on Thursday she did not believe the name had been passed to Aberdein. In an exchange witnessed by his lawyer, Duncan Hamilton, Sturgeon also “offered to assist” in his quest to influence the Scottish government harassment inquiry during that meeting – a claim which Sturgeon has repeatedly rejected. The Crown Office had inexplicably failed to order a police investigation into the leak of the government’s findings he had sexually harassed two officials to the Record newspaper, even though police were investigating the leak of SNP text messages to an ally of his, the former Scottish justice secretary Kenny MacAskill. Salmond made these allegations before the cross-party Holyrood inquiry investigating the Scottish government’s internal inquiry into misconduct complaints against him in 2018. In January 2019, he won a civil action and significant legal costs of £512,000 after the government admitted procedural irregularities in that inquiry meant it was unlawful, unfair and tainted by apparent bias. Salmond was then prosecuted for 14 alleged sexual offences, including one of attempted rape, but acquitted of every one during a high court trial in March 2020. He castigated newspapers that described the government inquiry as botched. “The policy wasn’t botched. The policy was unlawful. The policy was unfair and tainted by apparent bias. Botched doesn’t cover it.” Salmond was pressed by several MSPs to accept it was justified and lawful for a government and parliament to pass retrospective legislation that meant retired politicians could be investigated for historical offences. Andy Wightman, an independent MSP on the committee, said that next week Holyrood was voting on a bill to authorise retrospective inquiries into MSPs dating back to the start of devolution in 1999. Alasdair Allan, for the SNP, said the Welsh Senedd and Westminster parliament were looking at similar laws. Salmond said that was materially different than the civil service rushing through the internal rules used to investigate him in 2018. No one outside a small group of senior civil servants was consulted about that decision, he said: it was not discussed at cabinet and John Swinney, the deputy first minister, failed to tell parliament that was being considered. His court victory meant the policy “ended in abject, total, complete disaster”. Salmond added: “There’s a huge difference between considered legislation and a spatchcock development of policy delivering in a matter of days.” As he began giving evidence, he said over the past three years he had refused hundreds of media requests, given no interviews nor published any articles about the “shock and hurt” he had experienced. He said he had also remained silent when Sturgeon appeared to question the high court jury’s not guilty verdicts. “Still I said nothing. Well today, that changes.”"
2021-02-26T18:09:57Z,uk-news,UK news,"Britain risks creating new Guantánamo in Syria, says rights group","Britain risks creating “a new Guantánamo” in Syria by leaving Shamima Begum and others like her stranded in Syrian detention camps, it has been claimed, after the supreme court rejected Begum’s appeal against a decision to revoke her UK citizenship. A key figure who has been involved with Begum’s case said the judgment left the 21-year-old in a legal limbo, unable to return to the UK or mount an effective challenge to the deprivation decision remotely. Maya Foa, the director of the human rights charity Reprieve, said the supreme court had said Begum could in theory still challenge a decision to take away her citizenship, if she could find a way of instructing her lawyers.
“The court has said she can appeal [against] the citizenship decision, but they do not say how it can be done. It leaves her in the hands of the British government, which is unwilling to assist. That is less of a policy and more of an abdication of responsibility – unless the policy is to create a new Guantánamo in Syria,” Foa said. Begum is understood to have been told of the court judgment, although very little of her personal story featured during the case. Supporters say she regrets her decision to leave the UK and is remorseful about her actions. They argue that she was a minor when she was a victim of trafficking and was unable to leave Syria after she arrived in 2015, until she was detained by Kurdish fighters as the last of Islamic State’s territory was captured. Her legal team has yet to decide what it might do next, including whether it will appeal to the European court of human rights. An estimated 24 adults and 35 children who left Britain to join Isis are still detained in Syria at one of several camps run by Syrian Kurds, where conditions have been described as dire. Many of them have had their UK citizenship removed. On Friday the supreme court decided unanimously to rule in favour of the home secretary and against Begum on all counts, in the latest stage of a long-running legal battle. It means the 21-year-old will not be allowed to re-enter the UK to fight her case in person and cannot have her citizenship restored while she is detained in her current conditions, where she is unable to access a lawyer. Lord Reed, the president of the supreme court, concluded that the lower court of appeal had substituted its own reasoning in place of the home secretary’s when deciding that Begum should be allowed to return to the UK to challenge the loss of her citizenship last July. “Its approach did not give the home secretary’s assessment the respect which it should have received, given that it is the home secretary who has been charged by parliament with responsibility for making such assessments,” he said. A two-day oral hearing in the case in November heard that Begum was still considered by MI5 as a national security risk because although she had travelled out as a minor, she had “aligned” herself with Isis. But Reed’s judgment held out one remaining hope for Begum, concluding that the only fair response was for any final appeal against the decision to revoke her British citizenship to be held over until “Begum is in a position to play an effective part in it without the safety of the public being compromised”. “That is not a perfect solution, as it is not known how long it may be before that is possible,” Reed said. The conditions of Begum’s detention in a camp where she has been threatened with violence if she uses a mobile phone makes that unlikely without political intervention from the UK or elsewhere. Begum was 15 when she left east London with two schoolfriends to join Isis in Syria six years ago. Although born and raised in the UK, Begum’s British citizenship was removed in 2019 by the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, shortly after she was found by a journalist in a prison camp. British nationality law allows the home secretary to remove a person’s UK citizenship if doing so is deemed to be “conducive to the public good”. However, it is illegal to revoke a person’s nationality if doing so would leave them stateless. Javid argued that she was eligible for Bangladeshi citizenship, the birth country of her parents. Priti Patel, the home secretary, said ministerial authority had been affirmed by the court. “The government will always take the strongest possible action to protect our national security and our priority remains maintaining the safety and security of our citizens,” she said. As a teenager, Begum was married to an Isis fighter while she was embroiled in the Syrian conflict and had three children, all of whom have died. As Isis was defeated, she was captured by the Syrian Kurds in 2019 and has remained in detention without trial ever since. Intelligence agencies estimate that 900 Britons travelled to Syria or Iraq to join Isis. Of these about 20% were killed and 40% returned home. The remainder are either missing or held in Kurdish camps, their UK citizenship often having been removed."
2021-02-26T16:00:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Grenfell Tower council apologises for putting profits before people in borough,"The flagship Conservative council that owned Grenfell Tower has said sorry for putting profits before people in a series of deals, struck before the 2017 fire, that leased out public property for commercial gain. The apology, issued by Elizabeth Campbell, the leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC), related to the sale of leases on a public library, a teacher training centre used by council staff working in family, children and educational services, and a building housing a Citizens Advice bureau, to private school operators including Notting Hill preparatory school, which charges £21,000 a year per pupil. The prep school sublet part of the Citizens Advice building to the Pret a Manger sandwich chain. The assets were all in the more deprived north of the borough close to Grenfell and part of a wider property strategy for the area aimed partly at boosting revenues to the council. A fourth transaction related to the council’s £25m purchase of an adult education centre that it planned to turn into a mixed use development including private housing. After a local campaign against the move the council sold it to the Department for Education for £10m. “Before 2017 the council did not find the right balance between financial benefits, and social benefits,” Campbell said. “Too often the council put the narrow goal of generating commercial income above the broader aim of delivering benefits to our wider community. We fell below the bar on consultation, transparency, scrutiny, and policy. We cannot say hand on heart that residents were involved every step of the way, or that the council put their interests first and foremost, and for that we apologise.” Later this year council leaders and officials involved in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower will face cross-examination at the public inquiry into the fire on 14 June 2017, which claimed 72 lives. It has already heard how cost-cutting on the refurbishment between 2012 and 2016, resulted in cheaper, more combustible cladding being used. It heard how the council’s builders treated residents who objected like “rebels” and accused them of being “vocal and aggressive”. Just weeks after the fire RBKC halted property development projects and key councillors in charge of the schemes resigned, including the cabinet member in charge of housing, Rock Feilding-Mellen, and the leader, Nick Paget-Brown. Campbell’s apology came as the council released an independent report into the transactions that found shortcomings with scrutiny of decisions but concluded there had been no wrongdoing. Campbell said “no wrongdoing does not mean you were doing everything right”. She said there was is a “depth of feeling and mistrust that still exists between the council and parts of our communities”. “We will continue to shift our focus so that, wherever possible, we put social value and community interests first, beyond property, and in all we do,” she said. Ed Daffarn, a Grenfell survivor who questioned several of the property deals before the fire, said: “It is high time that RBKC started taking ownership of its past misdemeanours as there can be no recovery for the Grenfell community without truth. “This report goes some way in capturing the culture of a local authority that had metamorphosed into an agent for property development; an organisation that treated the North Kensington community with contempt while playing it’s perverse game of monopoly with our public assets. This callous indifference of resident’s views must never be repeated.” A response to the independent report by the council’s chief executive, Barry Quirk, set the council’s failures in the context of the 2010 austerity policies of David Cameron’s coalition government, which required local authorities across the country to find new ways of raising funds. “The period from 2010 established new orthodoxies in local government as the then government’s approach to fiscal consolidation led to substantial reductions in central government or national taxpayer-financed support for local government,” he wrote. “In the period from 2010 to 2017, councils’ ‘core spending power’ was dramatically reduced. Across London, the ‘spending power’ of councils was reduced by an average of 32%.”"

London’s second airport reported a £526m pre-tax loss last year, compared with a £211m profit in 2019. Passenger numbers dropped 78% in 2020 as the pandemic hit, forcing the airport to lay off 40% of staff and mothball one of its two terminals in an effort to cut costs. However, Stewart Wingate, the airport’s chief executive, said he was optimistic Gatwick would recover, pointing to a big increase in bookings as well as the number of flights on sale for the summer.
Wingate said a Covid-certification system seemed inevitable, adding: “It needs to replace testing and quarantine and reduce the restrictions on people to travel. If that were to happen, Gatwick is well poised to react and respond to the pent-up demand that it undoubtedly there.” About four-fifths of Gthe airport’s flights serve Europe, and Wingate said airlines such as easyJet, BA, and Tui all now had “significant number of seats” on sale for Gatwick flights for June and July, equating to about 80% of the numbers flown in the same period in 2019. “The rollout of vaccinations coupled with some form of digital Covid certificate could be the key to success that would unlock travel,” he said. Wingate said until recovery could begin, Gatwick would need UK government support through an extension of the furlough scheme and business rates relief."
2021-02-26T14:17:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Anti-HS2 tunnel protest at Euston ends as final activist leaves,"The anti-HS2 tunnel protest close to Euston station in central London has finally ended after the ninth climate activist emerged from underground. The subterranean environmental protest has lasted for 31 days, one of the longest in UK protest history, although not quite breaking the record of the 40-day tunnel protest in Essex in 2000. The nine activists involved ranged in age from 16 to 48 and came from diverse backgrounds. All say that the HS2 project is causing environmental damage including to 108 ancient woodlands. HS2 disputes this and says that according to its assessments, 43 of the country’s 52,000 ancient woodlands will be affected by HS2’s route between London and Crewe, with 80% of the total area of these remaining untouched, meaning just 0.005% of ancient woodland will be lost, a fraction of comparable road projects. HS2 said that despite the tunnel protest, its work on the controversial high-speed rail link had continued.
Three of the activists who emerged from the tunnel on Thursday – Isla Sandford, 18, known as Blue; Dan Hooper, known as Swampy; and a third, 22-year-old protester – were to appear at Westminster magistrates court on Friday morning charged with aggravated trespass. Several of the protesters who previously emerged from the tunnel face similar charges. During the protest there have been four high court hearings, which resulted in HS2 being granted a possession order for the Euston site and injunctions against protesters in the tunnel. An HS2 spokesperson said: “HS2 has now successfully taken full possession of Euston Square Gardens removing all nine illegal trespassers in the underground tunnels safely. From the outset HS2 staff, our agents and the emergency service personnel have acted with safety as their utmost priority, risking their own lives in order to ensure the wellbeing of those who placed themselves in such a dangerous situation underground. “HS2 accepts the right to peaceful protest, but when the UK is dealing with the pandemic, the actions of these individuals have put additional pressure on public services, including the NHS, Metropolitan police and the London fire brigade. Additionally, HS2 staff and our agents were subject to numerous incidences of violence and criminal activity during this operation, including alleged theft and assault.” The anti-HS2 protesters said the departure of the final protester from the tunnel marked a key moment in the struggle to stop HS2. A spokesperson for the HS2 Rebellion campaign said: “We hope the increased awareness raised at Euston will help to save hundreds of other green spaces, ancient woodlands, wildlife habitats, homes and businesses between London and Birmingham and Manchester and Leeds. “Our question to Boris Johnson is: when will he act to end ecocide projects which are not in line with the government’s own commitment to being carbon neutral by 2050? HS2 will never be carbon neutral in its 120-year lifespan. If he doesn’t act now to stop HS2 and other mega-projects such as Heathrow’s third runway, open coalmines and mass road building, when will he?”"
2021-02-26T13:51:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Morecambe pins hope on Sunak to give Â£70m for Eden Project North,"When Rishi Sunak stands up to deliver the budget on Wednesday, the chancellor’s speech will be watched with particular interest in one northern English seaside town. For several years, plans have been under way to build Eden Project North on Morecambe’s somewhat doleful seafront, a sister to the eco-friendly original in Cornwall, which has brought in more than £2bn to its local economy. Construction could start later this year – if Sunak is feeling generous enough to chip in £70m of the £125m set-up costs. The Eden Project team, along with businesses, schools and politicians of all parties in the local area, sent a letter to the chancellor before the budget arguing that Eden Project North is a “once in a generation opportunity” to reverse Morecambe’s deprivation, poor health and low educational attainment. Last week, the local Conservative MP, David Morris, secured a parliamentary debate dedicated to the scheme, telling ministers: “If Morecambe is not part of [the government’s] levelling-up agenda, there will be very little faith among the public.” Giving it the green light would “signal very strongly that the government mean business, because this is a shovel-ready project, ready to be implemented and open by 2024,” he added. Luke Hall, a junior minister, seemed sympathetic, saying that while he could not pre-empt the budget, “this project has the potential to give a real boost to the world-class tourist industry across the lakes and the dales, thanks to its infrastructure and location”. While Sunak works out how to pay for the pandemic and simultaneously demonstrate tangible commitments to “left behind” towns such as Morecambe, Eden Project architects are busy designing their Lancastrian outpost, which is based around five biodomes shaped like mussels. The original idea was to build on Morecambe’s motto during its tourism heyday: “Beauty surrounds and health abounds.” The project has since evolved to focus on “today’s possibilities and challenges”, said Dave Harland, Eden’s chief executive. Inspired by Morecambe Bay – its powerful tides, its sublime sunsets and everything that lurks beneath the surface – Eden Project North aims to take visitors through “four seasons in one day”, said Harland. “They might arrive in the morning to a blooming hyperreal forest, only for it to then snow before lunch.” One of the five mussel shells will be blacked out, allowing visitors to dip their toes in a giant rock pool as a moon rises overhead. Another, with the working title of the “green eternal spring”, will feature orange pods hanging from trees, where people can relax up high. There will also be a bar, where people can sip cocktails while watching the sun set out to sea. “We’re trying to combine absolutely world-class, brilliant horticulture, art, performance, education, large mechanical installations and immersive experience. And we’re doing that in order to reveal the world around us like never before and explore how the rhythms of people and the planet are completely intertwined,” said Harland. “Part of the problem that we have today is that when our rhythms are not intertwined, when they’re out of rhythm, that’s when things go wrong.” He said he appreciated the pressure on public finances, but that the original Eden had brought back £20 for every £1 invested. “The vast majority of the budget is going to be about the pandemic,” he said. “But if Rishi Sunak wants to focus on a few glimmers of light, of showing the recovery, then this would be a very good way of doing it.” “And if not, what we do know is that we’re well-positioned with government for when that conversation can happen. And that would probably be the next fiscal event, the comprehensive spending review.”"
2021-02-26T13:23:47Z,uk-news,UK news,"Shamima Begum ruling sets dangerous precedent, say legal experts","In ruling that Shamima Begum should not be allowed to return to the UK, the supreme court justices say a home secretary’s assessment should be “respected”. The home secretary, they say, is privy to intelligence materials from the security services, which in the case of Begum would have informed their decision to strip her of her British citizenship, a privilege that bolsters their authority. The former home secretary who took the original decision, Sajid Javid, and his successor, Priti Patel, have seized on this, celebrating the ruling as confirmation of the home secretary’s authority in making decisions related to national security. But the justices add that the home secretary’s decision should also be respected because they are ultimately “democratically accountable” – and if the electorate disagree with them, they can be re-elected or removed. In presenting their ruling, the justices cite the views of a former lord justice of appeal, Lord Hoffmann: “It is not only that the executive has access to special information and expertise in these matters. “It is also that such decisions, with serious potential results for the community, require a legitimacy which can be conferred only by entrusting them to persons responsible to the community through the democratic process. If the people are to accept the consequences of such decisions, they must be made by persons whom the people have elected and whom they can remove.” In other words, the electorate can decide if they thought the home secretary got it right – and reflect that in the way they vote. In depriving Begum of her citizenship, Javid as home secretary was accused of being “populist”, exploiting for political gain the deep anger and disgust many held against Begum for her support of the violent terrorist group Islamic State, and ignoring fundamental human rights protections, specifically the right to a fair trial. The rage against Begum is palpable. A YouGov survey in November found 70% of the public did not want her to return. Social media is awash with vitriol directed at her. The Conservative government, Javid and his successor, Patel, are unlikely to suffer at the ballot box based on their decision to keep Begum out of the UK. So, politically, it was not a bad call. But in matters of law and the fundamental human rights designed to protect all of us, legal experts say the ruling sets a dangerous precedent. Rosie Brighouse, a lawyer with Liberty, said: “The right to a fair trial is not something democratic governments should take away on a whim, and nor is someone’s British citizenship. “If a government is allowed to wield extreme powers like banishment without the basic safeguards of a fair trial it sets an extremely dangerous precedent. “The security services have safely managed the returns of hundreds of people from Syria but the government has chosen to target Shamima Begum.” Devyani Prabhat, a professor of law at the University of Bristol, said the supreme court’s judgment was “a classic instance of deference to the powers of the home secretary in matters of national security”. Prabhat added: “From a human rights perspective, this is a very disappointing decision as it seems to offer complete and whole discretion to the home secretary and has an unsatisfying view on fair trial rights and how people can be kept ‘in limbo’.” The supreme court justices argue that the right to a fair hearing does not trump all other considerations, such as the safety of the public. But this only stands if the decision was based solely on national security concerns, and not politics. So if, as the justices suggest, it is ultimately for the electorate to judge these decisions, then voters might ask: do they trust the home secretary to impartially balance human rights considerations with national security concerns and not let politics interfere?"
2021-02-26T13:22:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Shamima Begum loses fight to restore UK citizenship after supreme court ruling,"Shamima Begum, who fled Britain as a schoolgirl to join Islamic State in Syria, has failed to restore her British citizenship after the supreme court ruled she had lost her case. The judgment on Friday from the UK’s highest court is a critical – and controversial – test case of the UK’s policy to strip the citizenship of Britons who went to join Isis and are being detained by Syrian Kurdish groups without trial. Lord Reed, the president of the court, said its judges had decided unanimously to rule in favour of the home secretary and against Begum on all counts before it. That means the 21-year-old will not be able to re-enter the UK to fight her case in person and will not be able to have her citizenship restored while she is being detained in Syria. “The supreme court unanimously allows the home secretary’s appeals and dismisses Ms Begum’s cross-appeal,” Reed said.
But the court did hold out the slender hope that Begum could have a final appeal against the decision to revoke her citizenship if she were ever to be in a position where she could properly instruct lawyers. However, her detention in a Syrian camp, where she is not able to communicate with her legal team, makes that unlikely. Begum was 15 when she fled east London with two other school friends to join Isis in Syria six years ago. Although born and raised in the UK, Begum’s British citizenship was removed in 2019 by the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, shortly after she had been found by a journalist in a prison camp. British nationality law allows the home secretary to remove a person’s UK citizenship if doing so is deemed to be “conducive to the public good”. However, it is illegal to revoke a person’s nationality if doing so would leave them stateless. The then Conservative minister argued she was eligible for Bangladeshi citizenship, the birth country of her parents. Priti Patel, the current home secretary, said ministerial authority had been affirmed by the court. “The government will always take the strongest possible action to protect our national security and our priority remains maintaining the safety and security of our citizens,” she added. Maya Foa, the director of Reprieve, said barring Begum allowed the UK to avoid responsibility. She said: “Like many of its European counterparts, the UK is more than capable of bringing home British detainees in Syria, many of whom left as teenagers after being trafficked or groomed online. The government should bring the British families back to the UK so that children can be provided with support they need, and adults can be prosecuted where there are charges to answer.” Begum wanted to be allowed to return to the UK to pursue her legal challenge in person in a test case about the status of Britons who joined Isis and also had their citizenship revoked. A two-day hearing in the case in November heard that Begum was still considered by MI5 as a national security risk because although she had travelled out as a minor, she had “aligned” with the terror group. Lord Pannick QC, representing Begum, said she was unable to put her side of the case properly from al-Roj detention camp where she was being held. He told the court she would be at risk of physical harm if she spoke by mobile phone to her British lawyers. Last July, the court of appeal unexpectedly ruled that Begum, who is being held by Syrian Kurds, could return home to challenge the British government – prompting the Home Office to appeal to the supreme court. In a 47-page ruling, the supreme court said the court of appeal had been wrong to conclude that Begum should be allowed to enter the UK and fight her case in person by substituting its own reasoning in place of the home secretary. “It made its own assessment of the requirements of national security, and preferred it to that of the home secretary, despite the absence of any relevant evidence before it,” the judgment said. “Its approach did not give the home secretary’s assessment the respect which it should have received, given that it is the home secretary who has been charged by parliament with responsibility for making such assessments.” Britain’s highest court also concluded that the court of appeal had mistakenly believed that “when an individual’s right to have a fair hearing of an appeal came into conflict with the requirements of national security, her right to a fair hearing must prevail”. But it held out one remaining hope for Begum, concluding that the only fair response was for any final appeal against the decision to revoke her British citizenship to be held over until “Begum is in a position to play an effective part in it without the safety of the public being compromised”. However, given her detention, it was unclear when that would be the case. “That is not a perfect solution, as it is not known how long it may be before that is possible,” the judgment said. Javid, who is no longer a minister, welcomed the ruling on Friday. He said: “There are no simple solutions, but any restriction of rights and freedoms faced by this individual are a direct consequence of the extreme actions that she and others have taken.” As a teenager, Begum was married to an Isis fighter while she was embroiled in the Syrian conflict and had three children, all of whom have since died. As Isis was defeated, she was captured by the Syrian Kurds in 2019 and has been in their detention ever since at camps whose condition has been described as “dire”. Intelligence agencies estimate that 900 Britons travelled to Syria or Iraq to join Isis. Of these about 20% were killed and 40% returned home. The remainder are either missing or held in Kurdish camps, their UK citizenship often having been removed. Rosie Brighouse, a lawyer with the human rights group Liberty, said ministers had chosen to target Begum despite allowing hundreds of others to return from Syria. “This approach does not serve justice. It’s a cynical distraction from a failed counter-terror strategy and another example of this government’s disregard for access to justice and the rule of law.”"
2021-02-26T12:36:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Prince Harry defends Netflix's The Crown in James Corden interview,"The Duke of Sussex has defended the Netflix series The Crown, saying that – while it was not “strictly accurate” – it portrayed the pressures of royal life. In an interview with James Corden for the US programme The Late Late Show, Prince Harry said he minded the intrusions of the media into his family’s life much more than the miniseries, which was “obviously fiction”. He said the British press created a “difficult environment” that was destroying his mental health, but insisted he “didn’t walk away” from the royal family. “It was stepping back rather than stepping down.” He said: “So I did what any husband, what any father would do. It’s like: ‘I need to get my family out of here.’ But we never walked away.” He added: “I will never walk away. I will always be contributing.” Of The Crown, which has been criticised for blurring fact and fiction, Harry said: “It’s fictional. But it’s loosely based on the truth. Of course it’s not strictly accurate.” But it gave a “rough idea” of the pressures of “putting duty and service above family and everything else”, he said. “I am way more comfortable with The Crown than I am seeing stories written about my family or my wife. That [The Crown] is obviously fiction, take it how you will. But this is being reported on as fact because you’re supposedly news. I have a real issue with that,” he said. Harry also revealed how his and Meghan’s relationship went from “zero to 60” in the first two months because they were forced to spend so much time alone together. On dating, Harry said: “It’s kind of flipped upside down. All the dates become dinners or watching the TV and chatting at home, then eventually once you become a couple, then you venture out for dinners, the cinema, and everything else. “Everything was done back to front with us. So we got to spend an enormous amount of time just the two of us … And that was great, an amazing thing.” Archie’s first word was “crocodile – three syllables”, he told Corden, and his son was already “putting three/four words together” and singing songs. When the Queen asked what Archie wanted for Christmas, Meghan said a waffle-maker, which her Majesty dutifully sent. The Queen and Prince Philip regularly see Archie over Zoom, he added. A regular night in for the couple is bathing Archie, reading a book, after which Meghan might cook, or they order a takeaway, before watching TV in bed. His comments were recorded before last week’s announcement the couple would not be returning as working royals, and their statement that “service is universal”, which angered critics who felt it was disrespectful to the Queen. But Harry told Corden: “My life is always going to be about public service. Meghan signed up to that, and the two of us enjoy doing that, trying to bring compassion, trying to make people happy and trying to change the world in the small way that we can.” Meghan pops up on a videocall during the interview, calling him “Haz” as he calls her “Meg”. Harry and Corden view the mansion used in the 1990s sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and Corden says it would be the “perfect house” for the couple. Meghan laughs: “I think we’ve done enough moving.”"

As I am an extreme night owl writing this at nine o’clock in some morning or other, I dismiss the findings utterly and assume the researchers have to be in the pay of Big Lark. According to their (corrupt) findings, morning people have a lower body mass index, procrastinate less, are more proactive, less depressive, more cooperative, are all concert pianists, are unassailable recyclers and have never use the word “holibobs” in their lives. Most of that, anyway. Well, a) don’t they sound like a barrel of laughs? And b) of course they are better adjusted – the whole world is built around them. Getting up at dawn used to be vital – if you didn’t get your farming in during daylight hours, you and your family starved to death – and natural larks have been living off these past glories ever since, pushing their false narrative that it is still the only way to get things done and that getting up at stupid o’clock, if not earlier, is still some kind of moral good. Let us hope that one good thing emerges from the pandemic. The enforced shift to homeworking with no apparent drop in productivity has surely proved that the larks lie. Work done 6-4 looks just the same as work done 9-5. Cometh the (late) hour, cometh the night owls. Let us take wing and soar. Tuesday Since our leader – do we still use that without quotation marks around it? It feels wrong – announced the Roadmap Out of Lockdown, I have spent most of my time counselling my teacher friends who now know for certain (“certain”) that they are returning to their classrooms on 8 March. It’s quite … tricky. One has to get increasingly inventive, y’know? So when they say things like: “I wish the government considered us important enough to vaccinate as a matter of some urgency,” you say: “Have you thought about being Grant Shapps and receiving cancer treatment 20 years ago that makes you eligible for a jab now?” When they say: “The idea of that press of bodies, often upwards of 30 diseases vectors crammed into an unventilated room with me, is making me very, very anxious,” you have to dig deep and say: “Well, what’s the worst that can happen!” And when they say: “I could die from a novel zoonotic virus that is running rampant across the globe except in countries where they’re doing something about it, which is not this one, we’re doing nothing, dear GOD, why are we doing NOTHING?” you have to say: “Pull yourself together! This isn’t how we won the war!” And when they say: “Fighting a virus is not like fighting a German – that is the most unhelpful analogy you could possibly evoke,” you say … Well, I’m still working on that one.
Wednesday “Over 31,000 women will be offered kits to carry out smear tests in the privacy & convenience of their own homes in a trial. Cervical screening is life-saving, so this is a great step forward,” tweets Matt Hancock. “I … have questions,” says every woman who read it without recently graduating from circus contortionist school. “Many, many questions.” Most of these, fortunately, were answered by the simple expedient of helpful entities like Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust and doctors pointing out that the health secretary was using the wrong words, thereby conveying – as so often happens in such cases – the wrong thing. It’s not a smear test (which requires a crank, a definite second-party POV and a steady, steady hand) but an HPV sampling test. The latter is a swab that gathers, much more easily, matter that can be tested for the virus (good LORD, is the world is nothing more than viruses at the moment?) that causes more than 99% of cervical cancer cases. Women’s and reproductive health groups laud HPV tests as a good way of prioritising further investigation and resources. But they are not smear tests. It may help to think of our health secretary as a kind of Eric Morecambe playing all the right notes for André Previn but not necessarily in the right order. But with massive public responsibility and consequences as a result. The other major question – when will men be offered kits enabling them to stick swabs up their jacksies and test for prostate cancer in the privacy and convenience of their own homes, or are we still going to insist on qualified professionals for that job? – remains unanswered.
Thursday Celebrations! And jubilations! 17 years after the original series came to a much-lamented close, the Frasier reboot is officially in development, at Paramount Plus, and coming to a streaming service near you just as soon as ever it can. Kelsey Grammer will return to his greatest role as the endlessly pompous yet endearing psychiatrist (David Hyde Pierce – Niles, part-Frasier, part-Lladró figurine – is not yet attached to the project, as they say, but surely … surely) and with any luck we will be able to reimmerse ourselves in a series of exquisitely timed, precision-tooled and masterfully executed episodes again. If we squint and drink hard enough, perhaps we can pretend for at least 22 minutes plus adverts that the last few years never happened. The only downside is that the surrounding publicity and social media attention has disinterred a fact I had known but consigned to the very darkest, rankest oubliette of memory – that Grammer has the name of his wife tattooed on his crotch to prevent him from cheating on her. Truly, the television gods giveth and the television gods taketh away. I shall do as doubtless any good psychiatrist would recommend and try to repress this unwanted knowledge as fast as possible once again.
Friday Once all this – I am gesturing widely here – is all over, we really need to hand out some awards for tempers kept under duress. We’ll call it The Fauci. Most of them will go to the nation’s homeschoolers (I will keep one for myself, as I recently sat through a nine-year-old’s violin practice during which he rejected all my offers of help on the grounds that “not all the scales are supposed to sound nice”) and another load to retail staff dealing with anti-maskers. But the top category will of course be for hospital medical professionals, especially those who have treated Covid-deniers for Covid instead of pressing pillows over their faces. A special commendation, however, to the national medical director for NHS England, Prof Stephen Powis, for urging people not to follow the post-Covid regime advice proffered by Gwyneth Paltrow. She recommends – God, I can’t even be bothered to list it. She recommends a load of bobbins, beginning with “intuitive fasting” and ending with “infrared saunas”. Equally, it hardly matters what Prof Powis said in response, except that it managed not to be: “Shut your absolute piehole, you absolute imbecile”. Awards. Must. Be. Given."
2021-02-26T09:45:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Counter-terror training may be enforced for some UK venues,"The UK government has launched a consultation to develop plans to make it a legal requirement for public places to improve security measures following a campaign by the mother of a Manchester Arena attack victim. The 18-week long consultation into the Protect Duty, which begins on Friday, will work with counter-terror police and seek contributions over which type of venue should be bound by the law, and what measures of compliance will be required. It will build upon “Martyn’s law”, which calls for venues and local authorities to have action plans against terror attacks. Martyn Hett was one of 22 people killed in the Manchester Arena terror attack in 2017, and his mother, Figen Murray, had campaigned for the law. Private and public owners of venues have no obligation to act on free advice from specialist counter-terrorism officers about threats of a terror attack and how to reduce the risk. The proposals included within Protect Duty include free counter-terror training events for staff, and more thorough security checks for the public when entering these premises. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Murray said she was delighted the consultation had been launched. “The whole purpose of Martyn’s law is that there isn’t a repetition of what happened. Hopefully, Martyn’s law will save lives. “We’ve worked so hard and so many people have contributed to this and worked alongside me. I just hope this gives some form of meaning to Martyn and the other people’s deaths so I know that they haven’t died for nothing. Hopefully, something positive will come out of this in the end and prevent deaths in the future,” she said. The consultation was originally planned to go ahead last spring but because of the coronavirus pandemic, plans to canvass opinion from the leisure, entertainment and hospitality sectors were paused.
The home secretary, Priti Patel, said the government had already taken steps to strengthen legislation in regards to preventing terror attacks. She said: “I have heard first-hand from those who have sadly lost loved ones in horrific terror attacks and thank them for their tireless work to ensure others do not share their tragedy. “This government has already taken significant steps to amend our powers and strengthen the tools for dealing with the developing terrorist threats we face, and we will always take the strongest possible action to protect our national security. “That is why we want all organisations responsible for public venues and spaces to put public safety and security first.” The public inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing is due to resume next week."
2021-02-25T22:00:38Z,uk-news,UK news,Queen urges Britons to 'think about others' and get vaccine jab,"The Queen has encouraged people to “think about other people rather than themselves” and get the Covid-19 jab in a video call with health officials leading the deployment of the vaccine across the UK. Describing her own coronavirus vaccination, she said: “It was very quick, and I’ve had lots of letters from people who have been very surprised at how easy it was to get the vaccine. And the jab – it didn’t hurt at all.” The monarch praised the vaccine programme, describing its rapid progress as “remarkable”, and told the health leaders to “keep up the good work”. She said: “Once you’ve had the vaccine, you have a feeling of, you know, you’re protected, which is I think very important. I think the other thing is, that it is obviously difficult for people if they’ve never had a vaccine … but they ought to think about other people rather than themselves.” She added: “I think it is remarkable how quickly the whole thing has been done and so many people have had the vaccine already.” The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh received their vaccinations in January at Windsor Castle, where they had been shielding together until Prince Philip’s admission to hospital as a precautionary measure on 16 February. He is being treated for a non-Covid infection at the King Edward VII hospital in central London. The Queen was speaking to the four senior officials overseeing the delivery of the vaccine in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. More than 18 million people have received their first jabs.
Dr Emily Lawson, who is leading the NHS England programme, told the Queen it was her hope that everyone offered the vaccination in coming months would accept it. In Wales, 100 GPs are operating vaccination clinics, and in Scotland 1.5 million people have been vaccinated. Derek Grieve, the head of the Scottish government’s vaccine division, spoke about the challenge of ensuring that people in remote areas are not excluded. Cold storage facilities had been secured in Shetland, Orkney and the Western Isles, he said, and coastguards had been instrumental in reaching some of the more remote settlements. Praising the sense of community spirit during the pandemic, Grieve said: “If I could bottle this community spirit and use it not just for the vaccination programme but for other things, the job would be done.” The Queen’s video call was part of a recent drive by members of the royal family to meet and thank key workers and volunteers involved in the vaccination programme. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall met volunteers who were undertaking clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccinations at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham last week, and Prince William visited a vaccination centre in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, this week."
2021-02-25T19:39:43Z,uk-news,UK news,British athlete Sarah McDonald reveals assault while training  ,"An athlete who competes for Great Britain has spoken of her shock after she was assaulted on a canal towpath in Birmingham while training for the Olympics. Sarah McDonald, a middle-distance runner, tweeted that a man on a moped had “grabbed her bum” as she was warming up for a training session. She said she would be reporting the incident to the police. McDonald, 27, said she had received an “overwhelming response” after sharing the experience. Her tweet prompted other women to share their own stories of harassment and assault while out running and cycling. The athlete, who has represented Britain at world, Commonwealth and European championship level and reached the world championships 1500m semi-finals in 2019, was out with a training partner when the assault took place on Wednesday. In preparation for the 1500m at the Tokyo Olympics, she had been using a quiet stretch of canal to train during lockdowns. She said she had been heckled and had things shouted at her, but this incident was different. When her training partner shouted to her to “watch out for a bike”, she stepped to the left. “I wasn’t even looking, but the [moped] slowed down and the man on the back grabbed my bum before zooming off into the distance,” she told the BBC. If she had gone to the right, she might have ended up in the canal, McDonald added. The incident comes after a group of female Welsh sprinters unable to access training facilities due to lockdown and forced to train in public said they had been verbally abused by strangers. McDonald said she was grateful she had not been alone when it had happened “as this situation could have been worse”, and she urged others to be on their guard. Up until then she had felt comfortable being on her own, she said, but “this has been a wake-up call – be vigilant and look after each other”."
2021-02-25T18:33:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Keir Starmer unites his Labour critics with 'no tax rises' stance,"When Keir Starmer chose to make taxation one of the dividing lines with the Tories at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, he was returning to a familiar recent theme. Keen to underline their pro-business credentials, he and the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, have both been making the point for weeks that this is not the time to raise taxes, including on companies. But with reports suggesting the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, may announce increases in corporation tax and capital gains tax at next week’s budget, the possibility opened up of a Tory chancellor proposing to tax big business to pay for the crisis – and Labour opposing it.
That united Starmer’s two groups of internal critics: those who worry that he is too centrist, and those who broadly back his politics but would like him to be bolder in setting out his stall. Starmer wants to make tackling social and economic inequalities a central theme of his leadership, as he set out in a speech last week. A more progressive tax system will inevitably have to be part of that, and it is highly likely to involve increasing the UK’s internationally low corporation tax rates, a policy that Labour supported both in 2015 and 2019. During his leadership campaign, as fellow Labour MPs were quick to point out, Starmer said he would “reverse the Tories’ cuts in corporation tax”. But for now, Starmer’s team are wary of being saddled with the old caricature of Labour being the party of tax and spend, spend, spend – and keen not to say too much about policy at all, so far away from a general election. And Starmer’s team believe that economically, now is the wrong time to increase taxes. Just as George Osborne’s spending cuts clobbered demand following the global financial crisis, the argument goes, mid-pandemic is not the time to weigh down struggling businesses and consumers with higher tax bills. They’re not alone in that. The global consensus on tax-and-spend has changed radically in the decade since Osborne accused Labour of failing to “fix the roof while the sun was shining”. Across developed economies, there is an acceptance that the height of a pandemic is not the time to “pull the rug out”, as the prime minister phrased it earlier this week. But the party’s coyness about future policy meant Wednesday’s argument against tax increases was easily read – including by some irritated Labour frontbenchers – as a repudiation of the plan to increase corporation tax. Some shadow cabinet sources complained that the policy had been set out before it had been fully worked through. Labour leftwingers with long memories feared the influence of Peter Mandelson, who helped repair Labour’s relationship with business in the early 1990s, and whom Starmer’s team concede they have been talking to. It may also have opened the door for an opportunist No 10 to say it is prepared to force businesses that have done well out of the crisis to chip in, while Labour is not. Corporation tax is paid only on profits, so the firms hardest hit by the crisis would be unlikely to be affected. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, was sent out to flesh out Labour’s position on BBC Two’s Politics Live on Thursday. She said that for some businesses an increased corporation tax bill could be the difference between survival and going under, but also conceded that Labour was not against future hikes in corporation tax. “There will be a time for raising taxes, doing it fairly, and paying down the debt – but that time is not now,” she said. That carefully calibrated position – increase business taxes, but not now – appeared to have smoothed over the worst of the ructions over Labour’s approach. But if Sunak does opt for a package of immediate tax increases on businesses, selling it as the few winners from the past grim year paying their fair share for the costs of the pandemic, Starmer could come under internal pressure to back it."
2021-02-25T17:20:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Nicola Sturgeon challenged over alleged naming of Salmond complainer,"Nicola Sturgeon has come under intense pressure to explain what action she took over allegations that a complainer against Alex Salmond was named to one of his former aides. During fiery exchanges in the Scottish parliament, Sturgeon was challenged by opposition leaders about claims that the woman’s identity was revealed to Geoff Aberdein, Salmond’s former chief of staff, in a “gross breach of confidentiality”. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s interim leader, pressed Sturgeon on whether that was authorised and if so, by whom. “That action was certainly not about protecting the interests of the women involved,” Baillie said. “Did the first minister authorise the contact, and if not, who did?” Salmond, who is due to finally give evidence about his claims under oath in Holyrood on Friday, alleges in a submission to MSPs that Aberdein was given the information in early March 2018 by one of Sturgeon’s aides. The first minister accused Baillie of allying herself with Salmond, but deflected the Labour leader’s questions. Sturgeon said she would answer them when she gives evidence next Wednesday to the committee investigating her government’s botched handling of two internal complaints against Salmond.
“Accepting at face value the conspiracy theories and the account of the man that the women accuse of harassing them seems to me to be quite a strange way of supporting and standing up for those women,” Sturgeon said, to applause from SNP MSPs. She was then pressed by Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, on whether she believed the allegations were true. She replied: “To the very best of my knowledge, I do not think that happened.” Rennie asked her whether she had investigated the claims when they surfaced. “Because an absence of action on this, first minister, would be negligence,” he said. “There is corroborating evidence that this did happen, so is the first minister saying that they are lying?”
Sturgeon declined to say whether she had investigated the claims herself. She said the Holyrood investigation and a separate inquiry by James Hamilton, Ireland’s former director of public prosecution, into whether she had broken the ministerial code should be allowed to look at that. “It is not my belief that that happened,” Sturgeon reiterated. The exchanges follow a week of claims and counter-claims between Salmond and Sturgeon after the former first minister accused her and other senior figures in the Scottish government and the SNP of “a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort” to destroy his career and reputation. Sturgeon retaliated on Wednesday by accusing Salmond of alleging a “wild conspiracy” and “alternative reality” to deflect questions about his past behaviour towards women. Opposition leaders were furious after the Crown Office, Scotland’s prosecution service, issued a legal warning to Holyrood urging it to redact or remove key parts of one of Salmond’s submissions. That led to accusations that the Crown Office was protecting Sturgeon and the SNP, allegations the lord advocate, James Wolffe QC, rejected in an emergency statement at Holyrood on Wednesday. Baillie said the feud between Salmond and Sturgeon was destroying public trust. “We have seen this week that there is something rotten at the core of the SNP, and it’s poisoning our democratic institutions,” she said. “This isn’t just about Alex Salmond; this isn’t even just about the internal problems in the SNP. This is about the treatment of women in the future.”
An Ipsos Mori opinion poll published on Thursday found that support for the SNP and Sturgeon had fallen. It suggested that was linked to the Salmond controversy; 21% of SNP voters said it had worsened their opinion of the party, while 73% said it made no difference. The SNP’s projected vote also fell by six points, as too did support for independence, but the party still enjoys a hefty lead over the Tories of 52% to 23%, with Labour trailing in third on 15%. Voter satisfaction in Sturgeon’s leadership had fallen too, from a net positive rating of +48 last October to +32 this month. Pressed by Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader in Holyrood, over the redactions to Salmond’s evidence, Sturgeon said her former mentor had yet to produce any evidence to justify his allegations. She hit back at party leaders criticising the Crown Office. “What is not legitimate is to pursue a conspiracy theory, a scorched-earth policy, that threatens the reputation and the integrity of Scotland’s independent justice institutions just because they happen to dislike this government, and to sacrifice all of that on the altar of the ego of one man,” she said."
2021-02-25T16:36:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Killings of black people in England and Wales at highest level since 2002,"The number of black victims of homicide in England and Wales has climbed to its highest level in nearly two decades, official figures have revealed. A total of 105 black victims of murder and manslaughter were recorded in the 12 months to March 2020, up from 96 the previous year, and the highest since the 12 months to March 2002, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Black people are more likely to be victims of homicide, the figures show. About 15% of all victims in the period were black, but only 3% of the general population are black. Sixty-four per cent of victims were white, while white people make up 85% of the general population. In the three years to March last year, the average homicide rate per million population, at 49.5, was about five times higher for black people than white people, at 9.4. The rate of victimisation for black people has soared, a 70% increase when compared with the three years to March 2014. The figures also show black people are more likely to be perpetrators of homicide and murder. Approximately one in five – or 21% – of convicted suspects were black. About 67% of suspects convicted of homicide were identified as white. The ONS said the figures showed “clear differences” in the age profile of victims across different ethnic groups. Approximately half (49%) of black victims in the year to March 2020 were in the 16 to 24 age group, compared with 25% for Asian people and 12% for white victims. The most common method of killing, for both male and female victims of all ethnicities, was by a knife or other sharp instrument. There were 275 homicides committed using a sharp instrument recorded in the year ending March 2020, 40% of all killings and up 6% year on year. The ONS said the rise in this type of homicides was driven by a 12% jump in the number of male victims, rising from 199 to 223, 68 of whom were men aged 18 to 24. Seventy-five sharp instrument homicide victims, or just over a quarter (27%), were identified as black, an increase of 15 on the previous year and the highest annual total since 1996-97 when ethnicity started to be recorded. Overall, the total number of victims of homicide in England and Wales in the year to March 2020 was 695 – 39 of whom were victims of human trafficking whose bodies were found in a lorry in Grays, Essex, in October 2019. Excluding these victims, the number of homicides increased year on year by eight, or 1%. The ONS said the incidence rate for homicide remained very low, with 11.7 homicides per million population in 2019-20, a similar rate to the previous three years."
2021-02-25T15:00:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Government under pressure to stop Leeds Bradford airport expansion,"The government is under growing pressure to halt a proposed expansion of Leeds Bradford airport, which critics say would wreck efforts to tackle the ecological crisis and undermine the government’s credibility ahead of a key climate conference later this year. The expansion plans, which would support an increase in passengers from 4 to 7 million people a year by 2030, were given conditional approval by Leeds city council earlier this month despite widespread opposition from local MPs, residents and environmental groups. Now the same lawyers who are taking on the government over a proposed new coalmine in Cumbria have written to the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, Robert Jenrick, on behalf of campaigners asking him to “call in” the decision. “[The] expansion would commit the UK to decades of increased carbon emissions, against the Climate Change Committee’s advice,” said barrister Estelle Dehon, who is acting on behalf of the Group for Action on Leeds Bradford Airport (Galba). “As with the proposed Cumbrian coalmine, allowing this in the year we host Cop26 undermines the UK’s ambition to lead on the climate crisis.” Dehon said the “call-in” process would allow the national and international ramifications of granting permission for both the airport to be considered. Supporters of the project say the airport expansion would boost the local economy by hundreds of millions of pounds and support thousands of new jobs. However, critics dispute the figures and say it would lock the region into a diminishing carbon intensive economic future. A report from the New Economics Foundation, commissioned by campaigners, found that there would be little if any economic benefit, adding that if the impact of more people holidaying abroad rather than in the UK was factored in, the expansion would actually be a drain on the economy. Leeds Bradford is one of several airports – including Stansted, Southampton and Bristol – that are attempting to get backing for expansion proposals in the coming months. A spokesperson for Leeds Bradford airport said the planned increase in passengers at the airport was not dependent on the expansion, but would ensure it was able to “deliver the level of passenger experience it aspires to”. They added: “We are pleased with the support for a replacement terminal and the recognition by Leeds city council that our proposals are compliant with local, national planning policy and national aviation policy.” Leeds city council said it had looked at all aspects of the plans, adding: “Current government policy points to these emissions being something that should be primarily tackled at a national level – and addressed through international agreements and protocols – rather than by suppressing growth at individual airports in a way that could simply export passengers to other nearby airports at a higher financial cost to them and increase surface transport emissions.” But green groups say the government must get a grip on high carbon infrastructure schemes – being given the go-ahead by local councils – if it is to have any credibility in the fight against climate breakdown. Ariana Densham from Greenpeace said: “From new coalmines to expanding airports, the government has a deeply concerning, but growing habit of recklessly passing the buck on the signoff of polluting mega-projects. These are local decisions that will have global consequences.” The scheme has also been criticised by local MPs, five of whom signed a letter alongside councillors, environmental groups and climate scientists calling for the plans to be scrapped. “Expansion would mean health damaging increases in noise, traffic and air pollution for thousands of people in our local communities,” it stated.” Above all, it would mean a huge increase in greenhouse gas emissions exactly when we need to cut them to prevent the worst effects of the climate crisis.” A spokesperson for the Department for Local Communities and Government said that because of the scale of the proposed development and its green belt location the application, if given final approval by the council, “will be referred to the secretary of state”. However, Dehon said this did not answer campaigners’ climate concerns. “[The government’s] response has been to put off any decision about call-in, because at some future point the council is obliged to refer the green belt impact to Mr Jenrick so he can consider call-in on that basis. This delay is unjustified. And green belt referral is no guarantee that the decision will be called in.”"
2021-02-25T14:58:37Z,uk-news,UK news,Network Rail chair says weekend engineering works may soon end,"The pain of holiday weekend rail engineering works may soon be over, a top UK rail executive has signalled, as leisure passengers grow to rival the weekday commuter. Sir Peter Hendy, the chairman of Network Rail, suggested it may be better to close tracks on weekdays for maintenance: “A lot of leisure travel is going to be within Great Britain. Last year we saw a lot of really packed trains going to [seaside resorts] … It wouldn’t surprise me if on summer Saturdays we have more demand than in the working week. “The railway might have to get used to that. If Saturday and Sunday get busy in summer, we should do engineering works at another time.” He added: “We’ve got to be dextrous. There’s no point in us saying: we planned these engineering works on a Sunday 18 weeks ago. We should be prepared this summer to say: they want to come and we’ll take them.” He said the coronavirus pandemic was accelerating changing commuting patterns. Season ticket sales had dropped significantly even before Covid-19, and passenger numbers had slackened off on Fridays and even Mondays. Numbers on national rail are now about 14% of 2019 levels, and Hendy forecast that rail use would not return to more than 80% of normal for several years. Hendy’s comments came at the National Rail Recovery conference as the industry awaits the imminent publication of the Williams review, the inquiry commissioned by the government that will set out how the railway should be reformed.
The Network Rail chairman said he hoped to see his own organisation at least rebranded in the shake-up: “We wouldn’t want the name continued, and we certainly don’t want some of its reputation or history or costs … maybe it’s easier to turn it into something different than start afresh. We don’t want some of the bad reputation the place had for failing to listen and being very expensive.” The industry has called for reform of fares and ticketing – although it has been left disappointed by the government decision to raise fares from Monday by 2.6%, the biggest rise above inflation since 2013, despite calls for discounts to lure passengers back. The review chair, Keith Williams, has previously spoken of the need for fares reform but on Thursday defended government inaction on the system during the pandemic, saying the circumstances meant “you need to look longer term, and make short-term steps”."
2021-02-25T14:50:54Z,uk-news,UK news,Man accused of email threats to MPs will face crown court trial,"A man accused of sending threatening emails to a number of current and former politicians has had his case sent to the crown court. Paul Ritchie, 34, from Dolphinton in Lanarkshire, is accused of 28 counts of sending a letter, communication or article conveying a threatening message against a number of prominent political figures including the former home secretary Amber Rudd and the Jeremy Corbyn. Court documents show Ritchie is accused of sending the former Labour leader an email in March 2019 containing the message: “You should be hung for treason you fucking terrorist.” Other alleged victims include the former Commons Speaker John Bercow, the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, the former Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson and the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford. Ritchie entered no pleas during a brief appearance by video link at Westminster magistrates court on Thursday. In a brief administrative hearing he spoke to state his name, address and date of birth, and to confirm that the Conservative former cabinet minister David Mundell was his local MP. Mundell is not one of the alleged victims. The deputy chief magistrate, Tan Ikram, said the case would be heard at Southwark crown court in London on 25 March. The alleged offences relate to a series of emails sent over spring and summer 2019. In March that year he allegedly sent an email to Bercow, who was Speaker at the time, saying “1 in 17 million is bad odds for some nutter to pull a Jo Cox on you and your staff”. A week later, Ritchie allegedly added in another email: “Be careful ... [y]ou wouldn’t want to get run over.” In an email on May 2019 to the former politician Chuka Umunna, Ritchie is alleged to have written: “You have been warned ... shut your fucking mouth boy.” In July that year he is said to have followed up with: “If you kill brexit ... [w]e will kill you and your entire family.” Ritchie is also accused of sending an email to the House of Lords on 26 June 2019 saying: “You have been warned.” He was released on bail."
2021-02-25T13:51:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Number of UK workers on Covid furlough scheme rose to 4.7m in January,"The number of furloughed workers in the UK rose by 700,000 to 4.7 million in January, during the third Covid lockdown, according to official figures showing employees in hospitality, women and young adults were most likely to be away from their jobs. The figures from HM Revenue and Customs show a sharp increase from 4 million at the end of December, as the toughest measures since the first wave of the pandemic sent Britain’s economy into reverse. The data comes days before the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announces plans for the job retention scheme at next week’s budget, amid speculation it will be extended beyond April to reflect the government’s roadmap for exiting lockdown.
With a gradual easing of controls expected from March to late June, business leaders, unions and Labour have warned that failure to extend the scheme would lead to a surge in unemployment within months. The cost of the scheme has risen to £54bn so far. The latest snapshot indicated the heaviest impact on the jobs market was being felt in the Lake District and north-east London. More than a fifth of the local workforce was furloughed in the local authorities of South Lakeland and Eden, where tourism is key to the local economy. There were similar rates in the London boroughs of Newham and Haringey, home to workers in hospitality and retail jobs suffering as office staff and tourists largely stay away from central areas.
Across the UK, there were 2.32 million women and 2.18 million men on furlough at the end of January, with the highest take-up rates for those aged 18 to 24. As many as 68% of firms in the accommodation and food services sector were furloughing staff, while arts, entertainment and recreation had the second highest rate at 64%. Although the figures represent a rise from the November lockdown, when 3.9 million staff were furloughed, they suggest the latest restrictions are having less impact than during the first wave of the pandemic, when 9 million jobs were furloughed. Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the scheme was playing a crucial role in preventing unemployment from rising further. Official figures earlier this week showed the jobless rate increased to 5.1% in the three months to December, representing 1.74 million unemployed. “But with almost 5 million workers still on furlough in the most recent data, our biggest labour market challenges may be ahead of, rather than behind, us,” McCurdy said."
2021-02-25T13:12:13Z,uk-news,UK news,"IOPC investigates five Thames Valley police officers over death of man, 24","Five police officers are under investigation for manslaughter after the death of a 24-year-old man in police custody earlier this month. Brian Ringrose, from Milton Keynes, was placed in an induced coma and died in hospital days after he was arrested by Thames Valley police on 27 January. The Independent Office for Police Conduct said it was investigating the use of a “flexible lift and carry system” (Flacs) used to transport Ringrose to a police van when he was restrained using handcuffs and limb restraints. The Guardian has requested more information from the National Police Chiefs Council on what Flacs is and how it is used. The IOPC said officers had medical concerns for Ringrose when he was initially arrested and requested an ambulance, which took him to Milton Keynes University hospital. After Ringrose was discharged officers restrained him in the hospital before taking him into custody in a police van, but his health deteriorated en route and he was returned to hospital. There he was placed in an induced coma and died on 2 February. A postmortem recorded the cause of death as inconclusive pending further investigation. Thames Valley has suspended its use of Flacs equipment while the investigation is carried out, and the IOPC is working with the National Police Chiefs Council to establish how it is used by other police forces. The five officers from Thames Valley Police are under investigation for suspected gross negligence manslaughter and unlawful act manslaughter, and one is also being investigated for suspected common assault. They have also been served with gross misconduct notices for potential breaches of professional behaviour related to use of force. The IOPC said: “The decision to inform officers they are under criminal investigation means evidence indicates a criminal offence may have been committed. This does not necessarily mean criminal charges will follow.” Its investigation will determine whether the matter is referred to the Crown Prosecution Services. Graham Beesley, IOPC regional director for the south-east, said: “Our thoughts are with Mr Ringrose’s family and all of those affected by his tragic death. This is a significant development in our investigation and is based on evidence we have gathered to date. We have updated Mr Ringrose’s family and will now seek to interview the officers under criminal caution. “It is our role to independently investigate all of the circumstances when someone dies in police custody.” Thames Valley police said: “We have been fully co-operating with the IOPC from the outset and will continue to do so. Support is being given to the officers involved.”"
2021-02-25T12:33:44Z,uk-news,UK news,"Woman killed herself after mental health worsened in lockdown, inquest hears","The death of a woman who killed herself after her mental health issues worsened during the Covid pandemic, has been described as a “tragedy” at an inquest. In recent years, Julie Sharrock, 59, had struggled with depression, which was exacerbated by the coronavirus lockdown. On 18 September, Sharrock wrote that she could not cope with the isolation and was afraid of going outside. The mother of two had worked in the accident and emergency department of the Royal Albert Edward infirmary in Wigan, having previously worked in retail. Following the breakdown of a relationship in 2015, Sharrock’s mental health struggles became apparent. Following a suicide attempt in 2016, Sharrock was diagnosed with clinical depression, and did not work again after that. The inquest heard that Sharrock’s sister became worried that she “was not looking after herself as she did before the Covid-19 lockdown because it added to her anxiety levels”. Bolton coroners court heard that Sharrock found it hard to do routine grocery shopping, as it would leave her in an “agitated state”. Her family continued to stay in contact with Sharrock every day to support her. A little over a week before her death, Sharrock told her mother and sister that she was “struggling”. Her sister said that her mental health has deteriorated to the extent that she was “struggling to go to to the bins and do household chores”, which was not her “normal behaviour”. The coroner, Alan Walsh, concluded that her death was a result of suicide. He said: “From the time of lockdown, her isolation became a great problem. “Although she did have contact with her family available on a daily basis, and when lockdown restrictions lifted somewhat her family took her out, she felt she was isolated and then she became in fear of the outside. “It is extremely sad that she felt lonely, isolated and in fear of the outside. I find it a great tragedy that a lady of her age should end her life in these circumstances.” In a statement read to the court, Sharrock’s sister Karen said: “We all miss Julie, she was loved by her family and friends and she will be greatly missed.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

2021-02-25T11:00:24Z,uk-news,UK news,Cumbrian campaigners warn minister of legal action over coalmine,"A Cumbrian campaign group has given notice to the communities secretary that it intends to seek a legal challenge of his controversial decision to allow a new deep coalmine in the west of the county to go ahead. Legal representatives acting on behalf of the South Lakes Action on Climate Change (SLACC) group have written to Robert Jenrick’s office to notify him of the group’s intention to contest his “ongoing refusal” to call in the mining plans. The pre-action protocol letter states that, if the secretary of state does not respond to the group’s arguments by 4 March, the campaigners will file for judicial review proceedings. Jenrick decided not to challenge West Cumbria Mining’s plans to extract coking coal off the coast of St Bees, in what would be the first new deep mine in the UK for more than three decades, arguing that the dispute would be “best determined locally” and that he would only be likely to intervene “if planning issues of more than local importance are involved”. Environmental campaigners contend that the mining scheme is of clear national and international importance. “We hope that Robert Jenrick will issue a ‘holding direction’ to prevent Cumbria county council approving the application, and then properly act on SLACC’s request that the decision be called in by considering the information that SLACC and the Committee on Climate Change has drawn to his attention,” said Maggie Mason, a spokesperson for SLACC. “We are confident that, once the secretary of state actually engages with that information, he will see that the application is of national and international importance, and will appoint a planning inspector to consider the issues.” The threat of legal action adds to growing national pressure on Jenrick both within and outside the government to call in the mining plans. The county council announced earlier this month that it would reconsider the decision after the publication of new government guidance by the Climate Change Committee. Campaigners in the area had feared that local election purdah rules could mean the council’s reconsideration decision would not be made until the early summer. The elections were, however, cancelled on Tuesday – bringing forward the prospect of an earlier council verdict. Mason added: “Cumbria CC have claimed this is a ‘broadly carbon neutral’ coalmine, based on an assumption that ‘the need for coking coal in the UK will not significantly decrease over the coming decades prior to 2050’. “This is not compatible with the latest expert evidence provided by the Climate Change Committee in its sixth carbon budget, or with Lord Deben’s January letter to the secretary of state. Yet it seems that Jenrick has declined to consider exercising his call-in power.” Another legal challenge, meanwhile, is being prepared over concerns a separate local campaign group holds relating to the planned mining activity’s proximity to the Sellafield nuclear site. The group, which has already delayed the project’s start date through pursuing judicial review, says it will await the council’s decision before making its next move. A government spokesperson said: “As this is a live litigation matter, it would not be appropriate to comment.”"
2021-02-25T07:01:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Welsh watchdog criticises lack of action since home-school scurvy death,"The Welsh government is failing in its legal duty to protect the rights of home-educated children a decade after a boy who was being taught by his parents slipped under the radar of education and health officials and died of scurvy, an official report has concluded. Eight-year-old Dylan Seabridge lived in a secluded rural community in Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales, where he had not been seen by any agencies or services for seven years. Since his death in 2011 there have been repeated calls for the Welsh government to introduce tighter regulation of home education, and successive administrations have said changes will be made. But the children’s commissioner for Wales, Sally Holland, said moves by ministers had been “too tentative, have lacked pace, and ultimately been ineffective in creating meaningful reform”. Holland said: “It is absolutely vital for children in Wales that these issues are tackled with determination, clarity and transparency. We cannot look back in another decade to find that we as a country still have not moved forward.” An official review of Dylan’s case published in 2016 concluded that the boy was “invisible” to the authorities and at that point called for changes to the law. Dylan’s parents called 999 after he collapsed at home in December 2011. He had a cardiac arrest in an ambulance as he was taken to hospital and could not be saved. A postmortem report said he had anaemia and some of his teeth were loose. It concluded that “these findings together are explicable through the effects of longstanding vitamin C deficiency (scurvy)”. According to the children’s commissioner, other cases have emerged since Dylan’s death, including that of a group of home-schooled siblings from mid Wales who were subjected to severe physical and emotional abuse. A report on their case published last year noted that the parents had been able to manipulate the rules to keep control over access to the children by outsiders. One of the children told investigators: “Education officers should come to the house.” The commissioner concluded that the Welsh government “has not complied with its legal duties related to children’s rights” and made a series of recommendations including introducing legislation to ensure that all children in Wales can be seen and spoken to about their education by officials. In addition the report called on the government to introduce tighter rules around safeguarding in independent schools in Wales. There is no requirement for independent school staff to be registered with the Education Workforce Council (EWC) for Wales, the independent regulator for education staff. This means the EWC cannot intervene if concerns are raised about independent school teachers or learning support staff. Last summer the government announced it had dropped plans for new legislation around home schooling, including plans to introduce a database of those educated at home, citing the impact of coronavirus on its workload. A Welsh government spokesperson said: “We take the responsibility for protecting the rights of children receiving home education and those in independent schools extremely seriously. “Both the first minister [Mark Drakeford] and the minister for education [Kirsty Williams] have expressed their disappointment that the government has been unable to progress this important planned work. In normal circumstances, work would have by now been nearing completion. However, we are not in normal circumstances and the government has had to fundamentally shift its focus. “We have noted the findings in the review and will consider the report in detail before responding more formally.”"
2021-02-24T19:54:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Keir Starmer under pressure to back plans for corporation tax rise,"Keir Starmer is under pressure to back future rises in corporation tax after a backlash when the Labour leader said he would oppose any new tax on business in next week’s budget. Treasury officials are believed to be looking at increasing the tax on company profits from the current rate of 19% to up to 25% as the government tries to recoup some of the massive debts incurred during the pandemic, though the rise may be delayed until later in the parliament. During prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Starmer said: “Now is not the time for tax rises on families and businesses.”
The shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, has previously backed moves to increase UK corporation tax – which is the fourth lowest among the 37 member countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Labour appeared to soften its position on Wednesday night, suggesting the party would back a steady minimal increase later in the parliament. A source said: “Let’s look at what the chancellor brings forward: if he’s talking about corporation tax going up gradually across the parliament to an OECD average, that’s one thing, but we don’t think there should be tax rises right now where the focus should be supporting business investment and growth.” The stance prompted some unease within the shadow cabinet. One Labour frontbencher said they believed it would change, saying: “Not totally convinced … This is a pretty progressive tax policy that I don’t know if we should be opposing. I’m not sure the position today will be the one we end up with.” But another shadow cabinet source said they thought the expected rise in the budget was “kite flying”. Labour’s line was that tax rises were wrong “right now”, the source said, with any rise in corporation tax likely to come into force later in the parliament. Three other shadow cabinet sources confirmed to the Guardian that they backed the approach to oppose a corporation tax hike next week. One said: “We’ve said for months we will oppose any rise in this budget and it’s consistent with what we’ve been saying that tax rises now will stifle our recovery. The Tories are turning their backs on business and under new leadership there is a new relationship with business.” A source close to Miliband said he backed Starmer’s caution. On Wednesday Starmer pushed the prime minister to act on council tax rises and businesses rates relief, saying: “Now is not the time for tax rises on families and businesses.” The exchange was likely aimed to drive a wedge between Boris Johnson and his MPs, many of whom are likely to oppose a rise in corporation tax. The shadow Treasury minister James Murray, appearing on the BBC on Wednesday afternoon, said the party would not back any tax rises. “We’re in the middle of an economic crisis, and this is not the time to do it,” he said. “If you have a country where businesses are closing, where people don’t have money to spend in the economy and where you haven’t got investment going into public services and infrastructure, that is no way to get the country back on its feet.” A number of Labour MPs expressed alarm at the position, including backers of Starmer. Stella Creasy said Labour should always back ways to make the system fairer. “A fairer tax system was our ambition before the pandemic, and will be critical to our recovery after as we pick up the pieces,” she said. “We’ve seen several major corporations make substantial profits as a direct consequence of the pandemic – the same companies who will also benefit from the impact of government support getting those who have been hit by redundancy and debt back on their feet. “But for that to happen those schemes need to be funded now to stop any more families and small businesses from going under. It’s right that we look at our corporation tax rates and capital gains taxes and ask how and when those with the broadest shoulders can contribute a bit more to the task of rebuilding our nation.” Another former minister said the party should be actively talking up the creation of a windfall tax for businesses that had profited from the pandemic. “Increasing corporation tax does not affect hard-up firms,” they said. “It’s economically illiterate.” Starmer’s comments prompted more explicit criticism from the party’s left. A spokesman for the grassroots group Momentum, which championed the former leader Jeremy Corbyn and has been critical of Starmer, said: “During the pandemic big corporations like Amazon have cashed in while working people struggle to get by. Labour should support both raising corporation tax and a special Covid-19 windfall tax for sectors that have made super profits.” Richard Burgon, the former shadow justice secretary who is secretary of the Socialist Campaign Group of MPs, said: “The question facing all politicians now is: who is going to pay for this crisis? And if we don’t have an answer for that, then we are in a position where Labour doesn’t have an answer to one of the biggest questions facing us. The prime minister rejected my call for a windfall tax. But Labour has to make clear that the super-rich corporations who have increased profits pay their fair share to bringing the end to this crisis.”"
2021-02-24T15:09:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Covid cases among asylum seekers at Napier barracks higher than thought ,"A former military barracks being used to house asylum seekers has had at least 197 positive cases of Covid-19 this year alone, far higher than previously thought, the most senior civil servant at the Home Office has revealed. The total number of cases at Napier barracks near Folkestone, Kent, is equal to more than 50% of its resident population at its peak of 380. Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, told MPs that in January there were 178 positive coronavirus cases returned at the former Ministry of Defence site, and a further 19 recorded in February. The asylum seekers at Napier were housed in blocks of up to 28 men and there have been repeated warnings from healthcare professionals and humanitarian groups that the site was not Covid-secure. Despite the outbreak and legal challenges to the site, the home secretary, Priti Patel, suggested the government intended to continue using former military sites as accommodation for asylum seekers. The chair of the home affairs select committee, Yvette Cooper, struggled to contain her shock when Rycroft revealed the numbers. “On what planet did you think in the middle of a Covid crisis it was safe or sensible to put over 20 people in a dorm so they are sleeping together in the same room with the same air overnight each night?” she asked. Patel was asked if the department’s handling of the former Ministry of Defence (MoD) site fitted with the pledge made in the wake of the Windrush review to “see the face behind every case”. She said: “The answer is yes, absolutely. Every single individual who comes into the care and estate of the Home Office has personalised support.” Patel instead blamed the asylum seekers for not following social distancing rules. “People do mingle, and it is a fact when we looked at what happened at Napier people were not following the rules,” she said.
Cooper said her response was “astonishing”. Patel and Rycroft insisted that the Home Office had been following Public Health England advice. Last week, the high court heard that PHE advised the Home Office on 7 September last year that dormitories were not suitable accommodation during a pandemic. The judge, Martin Chamberlain, told the court: “This advice was apparently not followed.” The Guardian understands this was based on disclosure provided to the judge by Home Office officials. A full judicial review of the use of the sites is expected in April. Patel said: “Public Health England advice is not static.” Asked if the military sites would be closed, Patel said: “This isn’t about closing military barracks, we should look at this within the context of the government estate and government accommodation. It’s right we look at the government estate and government accommodation as potential contingency accommodation for asylum seekers.” Later in the hearing, Paul Lincoln, the director general of Border Force, revealed about 150 people a day are entering enforced hotel quarantine, about 1% of the 15,000 arrivals each day."
2021-02-24T08:38:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Heathrow hit by Â£2bn loss as airport calls for more Covid support,"Heathrow airport plunged to an annual £2bn loss in 2020 as the pandemic closed borders and the government restricted most international travel, underlining the impact of Covid-19 on aviation. Britain’s largest airport said the number of passengers who passed through slumped to 22.1 million last year, more than half of whom travelled in January and February, a fall of 73% compared with a year earlier and the smallest annual total since 1975. Cargo volumes also fell by 28% during 2020, although some dedicated cargo flights helped the airport to offset some of the lost passenger travel. However, Heathrow’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said he thought it was “very likely” that people would be able to go on summer holidays, following the prime minister’s plan to allow international travel to resume from 17 May, as part of the government’s roadmap out of lockdown. “There will be huge pent-up demand to travel,” Holland-Kaye told the Guardian. “Even if it’s a month or so later the recovery is coming.” However, Heathrow’s forecasts do not show it reaching 2019 levels of activity until at least 2024, he said. It has enough cash to survive without any revenues for a year. Heathrow said it had acted quickly last year as coronavirus surged to cut its operating costs by slashing pay, closing one runway and two terminals, and raising money but warned that airports had very high fixed costs. Heathrow complained that government policies had effectively closed borders but that it had received no government support other than furlough. It said it had not benefited from business rates relief, unlike other airports, as well as retail, hospitality and leisure businesses. Holland-Kaye called for the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to extend business rates relief in the budget next week to large airports for both the current and upcoming tax years. The policy would cost £232m for Heathrow alone. Business rates relief is capped at £8m in England, meaning larger airports such as Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester have been forced to pay the tax. Holland-Kaye said it was “completely discriminatory to exclude the major airports”. “Even large companies should get support when their business is wiped out by Covid and government policy,” he said.
The company has warned that Britain’s economic recovery will be held back until long-haul passenger flights can restart, including to key markets such as the US. Airlines and travel companies reported a surge in holiday bookings on Tuesday, after Boris Johnson’s announcement about England’s roadmap for the easing of coronavirus restrictions. Companies including easyJet, Ryanair, Tui and Thomas Cook said there had been a jump in bookings to destinations including Spain and Greece after the prime minister’s announcement, although this remains subject to review. The green light for international travel is also dependent on the continued success of the vaccination programme and no resurgence in coronavirus cases. Holland-Kaye said Heathrow had actively sought to increase the number of cargo flights during the lull in passenger travel, and that the airport was handling more flights carrying pharmaceutical and medical products, including vaccines and personal protective equipment. British Airways and Qatar Airways were among the passenger airlines that had repurposed planes to carry cargo."
2021-02-24T07:00:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Met police hails success in county lines drugs crackdown,"A fresh crackdown on county lines drug dealing has resulted in police in London bringing 1,000 charges in just over a year, the Metropolitan police has said. The successes were the result of new tactics and the coronavirus lockdown prompting criminals to switch to riskier tactics, because child drug runners travelling from the capital could no longer blend into the crowd on busy trains and coaches. Country lines is a model of distributing drugs, sending them from bigger cities to smaller towns and rural areas. Users call a mobile phone and order their drugs. Drug dealers often believe the use of anonymous pay-as-you-go mobile phones, which do not have to be registered, protects them from detection. But a senior officer revealed that police had been able to track the devices being used, seize them and get such good evidence of who was using the phone and when – by extracting communications data stored on the device – that they were able to bring hundreds of charges. Deputy assistant commissioner Graham McNulty told the Guardian that the Met had reversed the sense of impunity that county lines dealers had felt: “We have not seen a change like this in such a short time.” Between November 2019 and January 2021, the Met had brought over 1,000 charges against county lines dealers and their associates. More than nine in 10 people arrested in the crackdown had pleaded guilty without a need to go to full trial: “When we only go through the front door we get the individual, the phone and the charge, there is no bail,” McNulty said. The new tactics involve forces based where the exporters of drugs are located, and those where the drugs are sent, working together to track dealers who thought they were anonymous, but are trapped by their pay-as-you-go mobiles. Police have used modern slavery and trafficking laws against dealers who have targeted children and the vulnerable, with some as young as 14 years old. Police have brought prosecutions against them without needing the cooperation of those pressed into drug dealing, so-called “victimless prosecutions”. McNulty said:“They are buying trainers, taking children for a meal, buying a phone, posing as their friend, but really it is just manipulation.” Police revealed Covid lockdowns had meant the youths who crisscrossed the county on usually crowded trains and coaches, now stood out, meaning dealers had changed tactics. McNulty said: “With Covid, the use of coaches and trains has stopped. In the last year we have seen more of a move to cars with older people.” These are then easier to track using automatic number plate recognition. The Met said that between 1 November 2019 and 31 January 2021 a total of 587 county line dealers and their associates were charged with 1,135 offences including conspiracy to supply, possession with intent to supply and supply of class A drugs. The successes so far are against smaller dealers. Met commissioner Cressida Dick vowed to go after the major importers and drugs barons: “Alongside our work to tackle county lines and lower level supply, we remain focused on disrupting those higher up the chain and responsible for the widespread distribution of substances across the UK.”"
2021-02-23T19:24:58Z,uk-news,UK news,UK weather: up to 17C expected in parts of England this week,"It could feel more like May than February for much of the UK this week, with forecasters predicting a spell of warm weather and the first signs of spring in the coming days. In a likely welcome development for Britons still living under coronavirus lockdowns, clear skies and sunshine have been forecast for parts of the country for the rest of the week. Highs of up to 17C (62F) are predicted for Norfolk and Cambridgeshire on Wednesday, with the mercury rising to about 15-16C across parts of south-east and central England. While much of Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of north Wales and north-west England have been braced to expect heavy rain, the rest of the UK has been told to expect mild and often dry conditions. The Met Office forecaster Oli Claydon said the mid-teen temperatures would seem especially warm given the recent freezing weather. He said: “A few days of milder temperatures are forecast. Through the week, we’re into double figures [in Celsius] for many places, including parts of Scotland. It will be a noticeable change from what we’ve had in recent weeks.” The mild weather follows snowfall and sub-zero temperatures across much of the country earlier this month. Wednesday’s predicted highs are well above the UK average maximum temperature for February, which stands at 6.6C, and will eclipse the average maximum temperature for May, which is 14.8C for the UK, and 15.8C for England. Rain is forecast to move down across the UK from Wednesday into Thursday, but is likely to clear by Friday. More sunshine is predicted for the end of the week, with mild temperatures again peaking at up to 15C across the UK. Claydon added: “It will feel more like spring, especially in the sunshine.”"
2021-02-23T18:34:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Labour scraps all-female shortlist for Liverpool mayor,"Labour has been accused of a “stitch-up” after scrapping its all-female shortlist in the race for the next mayor of Liverpool, with one candidate threatening legal action if the decision is not reversed. The party reopened the selection for a mayoral candidate on Tuesday shortly before ballots were due to go to party members, with none of the existing candidates invited to apply. Figures on the Labour left have accused the party of trying to keep Anna Rothery, the candidate endorsed by the former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, off the ballot. Rothery said that she was “shocked by the party’s chaotic handling of the selection”. The Guardian understands she will seek an injunction if the decision is not reversed. Last week, the party “paused” the voting process in order to reinterview the candidates: Rothery, Wendy Simon and Ann O’Byrne. The three women, who are all Liverpool councillors, are well-known figures in the city’s political circles. Wendy Simon is currently interim mayor, Ann O’Byrne is a former deputy mayor and Rothery is the current lord mayor. The move seemed to have taken the candidates by surprise, with Rothery and O’Byrne rallying for votes on social media in the hours before the candidacy was reopened. The former shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, tweeted that the “fiasco leaves the Labour bureaucracy wide open to charges of sheer incompetence or a political stitch-up or both. If there was a problem with any candidate it should have been dealt with earlier or is the problem the socialism of a possible winner?” Marcia Hutchinson, a committee member for the BAME Labour North West group, has organised a letter in solidarity with Rothery who, if elected, would have been the first black female mayor of Liverpool. More than 300 signatories state that it is “beyond transparent” that the purpose of this action is to stop the leading candidate being elected. “The decision to effectively invade the pitch to stop the match because their team is not winning is both morally and legally suspect,” the letter said. A Momentum spokesperson said reopening the selection process was deeply concerning. “Delaying ballots and then removing candidates with no explanation smells like a stitch-up to keep left candidates off the ballot.” In a statement, Rothery, who was backed by the union Unite, said: “Like many people across our city and our movement, I’m shocked by the party’s chaotic handling of the selection for Liverpool mayor. Instead of a positive, unifying campaign for our city, we are faced with what looks like an undemocratic failure of process.” She said that she stood as the city needed a “socialist mayor to clean up local politics, deliver a local Green New Deal and leave no one behind”. Rothery said that she welcomed more scrutiny in the process but not to “remove transparency and accountability”. “If the decision stands, then I will be left with no choice but to challenge it legally,” she added. One council insider said that Labour’s NEC had “taken its time waking up to the situation on the ground in Liverpool with both the police investigation and the government inspection”. In December, the government ordered an inspection into the council’s planning, highways, regeneration and property management functions after the arrest of Joe Anderson, the city’s mayor, and several council officers as part of an investigation into allegations of corruption in regeneration projects. Anderson denies wrongdoing but stepped back from his position and said he would not stand for re-election, prompting the selection race. Two of the three candidates – Ann O’Byrne and Wendy Simon – served as Anderson’s deputy mayor. O’Byrne previously held the regeneration brief but dramatically quit Anderson’s cabinet in 2018, accusing him of “not listening” to colleagues. A spokesperson for Labour said that after careful consideration, the party was reopening the selection. “We are committed to ensuring members are able to choose the right candidate to stand up against the Conservatives, lead Liverpool out of the coronavirus crisis and fight for the resources that the city desperately needs.” In an email to Liverpool Labour members, the party said ballots will be distributed from 8 March so members could choose from “an alternative shortlist of candidates”. • This article was amended on 23 February 2021.

2021-02-23T18:09:24Z,uk-news,UK news,Scotland's stages: how coronavirus lockdown will be eased ,"Nicola Sturgeon has unveiled a “cautious and gradual” plan for how coronavirus lockdown measures will be eased in Scotland. Unlike Boris Johnson’s “roadmap”, the “strategic framework” deliberately avoids specific dates. “If we open up too quickly to meet arbitrary dates, we risk setting our progress back,” the first minister says in a foreword to the document.
A day after the release of England’s date-heavy plan, Sturgeon said: “To set dates that are too definite now would be irresponsible. There are far too many uncertainties such as the impacts of both new variants and of the vaccinations.” Instead Scotland’s government will implement a series of stages for easing lockdown “when the epidemiological conditions allow”. Sturgeon said the Scottish government would continue to aim to “suppress the virus to the lowest possible level and keep it there”. But approximate dates are given in the document, and it says there will need to be a gap of at least three weeks between each stage. Stage 1: now to early March On Monday children between the ages of four and eight in primary years one to three returned to school, along with some senior secondary pupils who need to do practical work for qualifications and nursery-age children. Restrictions on care home visiting will be eased. Stage 2: from mid-March The second phase of school reopening with all primary schoolchildren set to return to class, as years four to seven join their younger classmates who returned on 22 February. More senior secondary pupils will also return. Children aged 12-17 can take part in outdoor non-contact group sports. The number of people who can meet outside will increase from two to four people from two households. Stage 3: from early April The “stay at home” order could be lifted. All pupils likely to be back in school. Some retail will begin to return, with the definition of essential retail extended and restrictions on click-and-collect services removed. Six people from two households can meet together outdoors. Churches, mosques, synagogues and other places of worship can reopen. The exact return date for communal worship will take into account the timing of major religious festivals, with Easter and Passover falling on 4 April. Stage 4: from late April Scotland will move back to its five tiers of coronavirus restrictions, with level 0 the least restrictive and level 4 most. Most areas are in level 4, with the exception of some islands. Sturgeon said from 26 April “hopefully all of Scotland” will move to level 3, “albeit with some possible modifications”. But strategy stresses this would only happen if the R number remains below 1 and all the first nine priority groups have been vaccinated. Non-essential retail, hospitality, and gyms and hairdressers can reopen in level 3, though under current rules alcohol cannot be served in pubs. Sturgeon added that at this stage “we will begin to reopen the economy and society in the more substantial way that we are all so longing for”. Travel restrictions to continue Sturgeon said the easing required “continuing to accept some trade-offs for a period, for example on international travel”. She said: “Travel restrictions are also essential and are likely to remain so for some time yet. “We saw over the summer how new cases were imported into Scotland, after the virus had almost been eliminated. We do not want that to happen again.” • This article was amended on 24 February 2021 because an earlier version was incorrect to say that all areas are currently in level 4. Some islands are in level 3."
2021-02-23T17:15:22Z,uk-news,UK news,Welsh ministers fear England's roadmap could lead to Covid resurgence,"Welsh ministers and health experts have expressed concern at the UK government’s target to lift all limits on socialising in England by June and insisted that reopening schools to all pupils at the same time was unsafe. The Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, said he was worried that the UK government’s aspiration to restart international holiday flights by the end of May and for nightclubs in England to open by the end of June could lead to a resurgence in coronavirus. “We simply can’t predict months and months into the future what the position will be with the spread of coronavirus,” Gething said. “To give somehow a baked-in roadmap with dates not data going into the middle of the summer I don’t think is the right approach.”
Gething described the UK’s decision to get all children back to school at the same time as the “big bang approach”. “We have made a deliberate choice to be faithful to the scientific evidence and public health advice,” he said. “Our risk appetite is different.” The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, defended his country’s phased reintroduction of face-to-face learning, which means that some secondary pupils will not get back to the classroom until after Easter, more than a month later than their counterparts in England. Drakeford insisted that the Welsh government was following the advice of scientists and quoted the warning from the UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which in January said returning all pupils together would raise the R number by between 10 and 50%. The first minister said: “We are recommended to return children in tranches, to pause between those tranches so we can properly gather the evidence of the impact of that return. We will return children to school as fast as it is safe to do so. We will follow the science whatever happens elsewhere.” During first minister’s questions, the leader of the Tories in the Welsh parliament, Andrew RT Davies, claimed there was an “absence of any coherent plan to bring the Welsh economy out of lockdown” and flagged up a complaint by the Federation of Small Businesses that there had been “radio silence” from the government over the way out of restrictions. Drakeford argued his government had begun to set out the way forward and would be liaising with businesses before the next three-weekly review of the restrictions. The deputy chief medical officer for Wales, Chris Jones, also expressed concern and scepticism over the UK government’s 21 June target to lift all limits in England on socialising. Asked on BBC Radio Wales about the excitement in England the announcement of the date had caused, Jones said: “One is very concerned. The messaging to the public has always been very important here. To send the message that everything is going to be back to normal in a few months’ time is a message with some risk. This pandemic could easily go out of control again. This is a critical time. “There is a real risk of a third wave if restrictions are lifted too quickly and too early. There’s no doubt about that. We still have a vulnerable population. We’ve only had time to vaccinate the most at risk.”"
2021-02-23T17:07:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Plan to open England's shops before museums and galleries criticised,"Museum and gallery leaders in England have expressed anger, disappointment and bafflement at why commercial art galleries – which count as non-essential shops – can open five weeks before them. “It is just nuts,” said Rebecca Salter, the president of the Royal Academy of Arts which, like other public galleries, has been told it can reopen no sooner than 17 May. Shops, meanwhile, can open on 12 April. Salter said it meant people would not be able to come to see the RA’s Tracey Emin exhibition but would be able to go to see works by Emin on display a two-minute walk away at White Cube gallery. “It just makes no sense. On the 12 April all the retail will open on Piccadilly and our gates will stay shut, I don’t get the logic of it frankly. It just doesn’t feel joined up to me … I’m angry. “If we do genuinely worry about the mental state of this nation having been locked away then I would like an explanation into why the government feels retail therapy will make people feel better but ‘art’ therapy, coming to see pictures, can wait another five weeks.”
Salter said the RA and other galleries were safe spaces with rigorous procedures in place. “I know that lots of people caught Covid shopping on Oxford Street before Christmas.” Axel Ruger, the secretary and chief executive of the RA, welcomed the roadmap out of lockdown. “However, it is incredibly frustrating that museums and galleries can only reopen from 17 May whilst gyms, hairdressers and the non-essential retail sector are able to open from 12 April.” The frustration was echoed by the Museums Association. Sharon Heal, its director, said there was no logic to the delay and called for a rethink. “Museums and their audiences are losing out because the government has classified museums as ‘indoor entertainment venues’ alongside cinemas and theatres. Yet in terms of implementing social distancing, they have far more in common with libraries, public buildings and community centres, which will all open on 12 April.” Thomas Marks, the editor of Apollo magazine, said it made no sense, writing that it “looks like a clear expression of what many who work in the arts have come to suspect of this government: that it sees culture as an afterthought, something easily left on the shelf”. Many gallery bosses said their annoyance was softened by at least having a date. “My reaction was first of all relief,” said Iwona Blazwick, the director of Whitechapel gallery in London. “But also disappointment that we can’t open on 12 April. Libraries and community centres can – we are a community centre, we have a library … that was a little disappointing but at least we have clarity and a direction of travel and we are marching towards it. I’m feeling quite optimistic.”
The Whitechapel will reopen with its delayed Eileen Agar show. “I’m so thrilled because her work is the perfect spiritual balm for our post-pandemic convalescence.” The Hepworth Wakefield gallery in West Yorkshire is planning to reopen on 21 May, 10 years to the day since it first opened, with a major show devoted to the artist it is named after, Barbara Hepworth “We are just so excited to think that we can confidently get the doors back open again,” said director Simon Wallis. “The senior management team meeting I had this morning was packed with just so much more energy than it’s had in a long time.” A government spokesperson said: “We will seek to reopen museums and galleries at step three which is in line with other indoor entertainment and leisure venues as part of our approach to ease restrictions without putting pressure on the NHS and avoiding a further lockdown. “We established the £1.57bn culture recovery fund to support our cultural organisations and so far more than £1bn has been allocated to thousands of organisations, including museums and galleries, in addition to other support measures like the furlough scheme.”"
2021-02-23T16:40:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Nicola Sturgeon unveils plans for easing Scotland's Covid restrictions,"Scotland’s schools are expected to fully reopen in early April, with some household mixing allowed, after Nicola Sturgeon unveiled a partial route map to lifting the country’s strict Covid controls. In a statement to Holyrood, the first minister confirmed Scotland’s lockdown would remain in place for at least six weeks, with the stay-at-home rule enforced until 5 April at the earliest.
She did not expect non-essential shops, or outdoor bars and restaurants, would be allowed to reopen until late April, the date at which the government expected to move to regional or local lockdown levels. Sturgeon told MSPs the priority was to suppress the virus, with the goal of virtually eliminating it from the community, and that meant she would take a very precautionary approach to lifting the lockdown. She said the vaccination programme in Scotland was “motoring”, with nearly 1.5 million people having received their first dose, with all nine priority groups expected to be vaccinated by mid-April, a few weeks earlier than originally forecast. Even so, until transmission rates were much lower and the vaccination programme completed, caution was needed. The new Kent variant was still at large and highly transmissible.
“It is by being cautious, careful and patient for the next period – while the vaccination programme progresses – that we will make that route as safe and sustainable as possible,” she said. “Taking the brakes off too quickly will allow the virus to get ahead of us again and put our progress out of lockdown into reverse.” In contrast to Boris Johnson’s detailed route map published on Monday, which included target dates and covered all social and business sectors in England, Sturgeon offered few specific details about what else would reopen and when. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader in Holyrood, said that would disappoint many voters and businesses who had watched Sturgeon’s statement in the hope of getting greater certainty. There was no mention of sports venues, or weddings, or when social distancing rules would be eased. “There is nothing on what would happen after 26 April,” Davidson added. “This isn’t a route map out of Covid; it’s a holding document for the next eight weeks.” Voters “were not expecting certainty but they were expecting the first minister to give them some form of hope”. Business leaders urged Sturgeon to quickly offer more detail and longer-term targets with the owner of Glasgow and Aberdeen airports furious there was no clarity on air travel and holidays resuming. The Federation of Small Businesses said more than half of companies were worried they would not survive the next few months, and a third of owners worried about their mental health.
Sturgeon defended the strategy and said in the last week of April there would be a “significant” reopening of the economy, with hairdressers, non-essential retail, restaurants and gyms allowed to resume business. From 15 March, all primary school children would be back in class, with senior secondary pupils allowed in part time. Non-contact group sports for children aged 12 to 17, and greater household mixing, allowing four people from two households, would also resume then. Schools would fully reopen from 5 April, as would limited communal worship. Sturgeon said Johnson had warned his more detailed route map was conditional and open for revision, and refused to take up an invitation from Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green co-leader, to attack the prime minister. Even so, she said caution was a more prudent approach. “I want to give as much as possible today – while avoiding giving false assurance or picking arbitrary dates that have no grounding at this stage in any objective assessment,” she said."
2021-02-23T16:26:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Utility firms to be charged for pavement works in London,"Works that dig up pavements and disrupt pedestrians and cyclists in the capital will now be charged in the same way as roadworks that block traffic, under plans announced by Transport for London. The lane rental scheme will be extended to cover pavements from May as part of London’s push to encourage more walking and cycling journeys. Utility companies are currently charged a daily fee of up to £2,500 for works in the busiest roads, to deter congestion and encourage them to work as swiftly as possible. Firms will be charged £350 a day for works that affect the busiest areas of pavement. TfL said the changes would raise standards of safety and accessibility in the capital, and reduce in particular the impact on people with accessibility needs who can be badly affected by pavements being dug up. Incentives to minimise works are also seen as vital for buses. Associated congestion caused a slump in bus speed and reliability over parts of the last decade, before returning to record levels during lockdown. The lane rental scheme, first operated in London and Kent since 2012-13, will also be expanded to cover more of the major roads, about 69% of TfL’s routes. Glynn Barton, TfL’s director of network management, said: “London’s road network plays an absolutely vital role in keeping the capital moving and this has become more apparent than ever over the last year, with our pavements in particular playing a key role in enabling safer walking journeys. “We recognise the hugely important job done by utility companies and we’ve worked closely with the industry to develop these changes to our pioneering lane rental scheme, which will boost safety standards and make a real difference to everyone using our road network, including people walking and cycling.” The initiative appears unrelated to TfL’s parlous financial situation since the coronavirus pandemic slashed its fare income. While TfL has extended the London congestion charge’s operating hours, and proposed to generate funds from a new boundary charge for drivers, it said that all revenues from the scheme would be reinvested in initiatives to reduce disruption from roadworks across the capital. Such schemes already allocated funding include mapping below-ground utilities and a works coordination programme. Around 30% more roadworks are now carried out at night since lane rental started, according to TfL."
2021-02-23T15:41:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Prince Philip to stay in hospital for several more days,"The Duke of Edinburgh is expected to spend several more days in hospital, where he is being treated for an infection, Buckingham Palace has said. Prince Philip, 99, was admitted to King Edward VII’s hospital in central London a week ago as a “precautionary” measure for “observation and rest” after becoming unwell at Windsor Castle. In a statement, Buckingham Palace said: “The Duke of Edinburgh remains at King Edward VII’s hospital where he is receiving medical attention for an infection. He is comfortable and responding to treatment but is not expected to leave hospital for several days.” No further details were given. The exact reason for his admission has not been disclosed but it is said not to be Covid-related. Both he and the Queen received their vaccine jabs in January.
Philip travelled to the hospital by car, and walked in unaided. Prince William, asked about his grandfather on Monday, said: “He’s OK. They’re keeping an eye on him,” and he gave a wink. On Tuesday, the Earl of Wessex said of his father in an interview with Sky News: “He’s a lot better, thank you very much indeed, and he’s looking forward to getting out, which is the most positive thing so we keep our fingers crossed.” Asked whether Philip was frustrated to be in hospital, Edward laughed and replied: “Just a bit. I think that gets to all of us, and then, you can only watch the clock so many times and the walls are only so interesting.” He added: “We’ve had some brilliant and lovely messages from all sorts of people and we really appreciate that and so does he, I’ve been passing them on. It’s fantastic, thank you.” The duke received a visit from his son the Prince of Wales on Saturday. Charles spent 30 minutes at the hospital after making a 100-mile trip from his home in Highgrove, Gloucestershire. He left without making any comment. Hospital Covid rules state that a visit from one person can be considered “in exceptional circumstances”. Charles had not seen his father since before Christmas, and a source said: “The duke has been in hospital a few days longer than expected and the prince simply wanted to go and see him.”"
2021-02-22T20:01:22Z,uk-news,UK news,"More support needed as England exits lockdown, say business leaders","Business leaders have told Boris Johnson that his roadmap for exiting the third Covid lockdown in England remains incomplete without fresh financial support for companies and workers hardest hit by the pandemic. The prime minister promised the government would “not pull the rug out” from under struggling firms and workers while restrictions remain in place during the phased relaxation of lockdown, but to the disappointment of company bosses and trade unions he deferred details of future economic support to the budget in 10 days’ time. Tony Danker, the director general of the CBI, a business lobby group, said: “The budget is the second half of this announcement – extending business support in parallel to restrictions will give firms a bridge to the other side. This is particularly needed for sectors who will have to wait for up to three months to reopen and have an anxious 10 days ahead before the budget.”
With a phased reopening playing out over four key stages between March and June, the roadmap keeps many firms closed beyond the planned end of the furlough scheme at the end of April. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, a trade union umbrella body, said ministers needed to stop “dithering and delaying” and announce an extension of the wage subsidy scheme until the end of 2021 at least. About 4.5 million workers are believed to be on furlough during the latest lockdown, down from about 9 million during the first wave. “With jobs and livelihoods hanging in the balance there is no reason to keep workers and businesses waiting,” she said. Under the plan, cafes, pubs and restaurants will be allowed to serve customers outside from 12 April at the earliest. Non-essential retail, gyms, hair salons, and overnight stays in self-contained accommodation could also reopen then. Hospitality indoors would not be allowed until 17 May at the earliest, while nightclubs and theatres are to remain closed until at least 21 June, when all legal limits on social contact are hoped to be removed. Several major decisions affecting business and the economy – including the return of international holidays, changes to working-from-home guidance and whether Covid-status certificates could be used – are also subject to four major reviews Johnson said would be completed later this spring. In line with the guidance on limits on social contact, offices across England will remain empty until June at the earliest. Under pressure to offer more support while tough measures remain, the prime minister dropped a heavy hint that assistance would come in the budget on 3 March. “We will not pull the rug out. For the duration of the pandemic the government will continue to do whatever it takes to protect jobs and livelihoods across the UK,” he told the House of Commons. But the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, attacked the delay. “It won’t have escaped businesses that many of them will not be able to open until mid-April at the earliest and many until mid-June,” he said. “Health restrictions must be accompanied by proper economic support. It makes no sense today to announce businesses will be closed for many more weeks and months, without economic support. Businesses are crying out for that certainty and the prime minister should give it to them today.” Companies facing the longest timetable, including those in retail, hospitality and leisure, said many would struggle to survive. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UKHospitality, said the sector was “devastated” that reopening was so far away. Although outdoor trade is planned for April, only 40% of hospitality firms have outside space, she said, meaning many would stay shut until rules allow customers indoors, from May at the earliest. “The chancellor has just nine days to save thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of jobs that simply will not be there without a substantial package of compensation,” she said. The British Beer and Pub Association said the “cautious” reopening would cost pubs £1.5bn and that just 17% of the industry’s capacity would be able to open from April. Emma McClarkin, the chief executive of the trade body, said support at the budget to plug this “black hole” was needed. “The prime minister said he will not pull the rug out and do whatever it takes. We will hold both him and the chancellor to this.” Representatives from the trade questioned the evidence for infection rates in hospitality, while Sacha Lord, Greater Manchester’s night-time economy tsar, said pubs in typically working-class urban areas would struggle most. “It is once again the working class who are hardest hit by the decisions coming from Westminster during this pandemic,” he said. The long period before reopening is a concern for hotels, said James Mason, the chief executive of tourism agency Welcome to Yorkshire, adding that the government’s announcement left many questions unanswered for businesses that depend on visitors. “Some businesses are thinking: shall we call it a day? They have been thinking about this for weeks and they are still in limbo,” Mason said. “Some are thinking: shall we call staff back, shall we start planning marketing and our summer?” Non-essential retailers said they were disappointed to miss out on Easter trade as they would not be allowed to open until 12 April at the earliest. Andrew Goodacre, the chief executive of Bira, which represents thousands of independent retailers, said: “Whilst it is good for us to have a date, we are very disappointed that non-essential shops will miss the Easter period, especially as they also missed out on most of the busy festive period.
“We therefore want the chancellor to recognise this in the budget next week and make clear statements about the support that will be available for the next 12 months.” Despite frustration over the lengthy timetable for reopening, company bosses said they recognised the need for caution because it could boost consumer confidence once venues reopen, and prevent a fourth wave of the pandemic and return to lockdown. However, firms need urgent support as they fight to make it through the summer. Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “On one side of the coin we have continued restrictions – on the other, we need corresponding business support.”"
2021-02-22T19:05:48Z,uk-news,UK news,US executive was told Grenfell panels were unsafe on buildings over 12 metres,"One of the most senior US executives at Arconic was probably told that the company’s cladding panels were unsafe for buildings above 12 metres in height two years before the Grenfell Tower disaster, a public inquiry has heard. The $7bn-a-year-turnover aluminium specialist sold the plastic-filled panels for use on the apartment block in west London, which was 67 metres tall and went up in flames in June 2017, killing 72 people. In June 2015 the company’s French subsidiary produced an assessment of the safety of the cladding panels at the request of Diana Perreiah, president of Arconic’s global building and construction systems business. It said the polyethylene-filled (PE) aluminium panels were “flammable”, had limitations “given by the smoke production and flaming droplets” and could only be used on buildings up to 12 metres. The inquiry has already concluded that Arconic’s Reynobond 55 PE panels were the main cause of the spread of the fire. Perreiah sought the assessment from Claude Schmidt, the president of Arconic’s French subsidiary, who told the inquiry he was “practically sure” it was sent to her. Arconic was selling the panels in the UK on the basis that they were safe for buildings over 18 metres. It had failed to update UK safety certificates after fire tests of the same panels used at Grenfell went so badly they had to be stopped, meaning the material could only be rated E for fire performance. The certificate that was consulted by the Grenfell builders claimed they reached a B classification for fire. The revelation brings the US headquarters of Arconic into the spotlight of the public inquiry, which has so far focused largely on its French subsidiary that operated in the UK market. Last year a US court rejected a product liability claim for damages against Arconic brought by survivors and the bereaved, on the basis that it should be heard in the UK. Arconic said: “It is not appropriate for us to comment while the inquiry is ongoing and before all evidence has been presented in phase two [of the inquiry].” The inquiry also heard that shortly after the request from the US parent company, Claude Wehrle, the French technical director, emailed colleagues that “PE is DANGEROUS on facades, and everything should be transferred to FR [fire retardant] as a matter of urgency.” That didn’t happen until after the disaster. Richard Millett QC, counsel to the inquiry, asked Schmidt: “If it was dangerous, why were you still selling it? Millett then asked: “Did the management of Arconic choose simply [to] ignore Mr Wehrle’s warning that PE was dangerous in facades and substitute his view for something more commercial?” The French subsidiary president replied: “No.” Schmidt is the most senior Arconic executive to give evidence to the inquiry. Three other key current and former staff, including Wehrle, are refusing to face cross-examination, citing an arcane French law that the country’s government has said does not apply. Schmidt also told the inquiry how Arconic did nothing to stop the sale of the cladding despite two high-rise infernos in the Middle East involving similar materials sparking internal concerns. The firm kept selling the plastic-filled panels after a 2012 fire at the Tamweel Tower in Dubai wrapped in similar material sent “fireballs” to the ground, and did not warn customers of possible risks. The executive said he read a BBC report in November 2012 that detailed how the Tamweel Tower’s “cladding may have been the culprit behind the blaze’s fire spread”. It was circulated internally in an email titled “Cladding blamed in skyscraper fire – sounds like something our customers make”. Wehrle also emailed colleagues to say that although the Tamweel Tower used a rival’s version of the panels, “all PE composites react in the same way”. One of Arconic’s competitors, Alucobond, told clients to say it was no longer selling PE panels after another tower in the United Arab Emirates went up in flames in 2013. Alucobond said “the perils of using cheap ACM alternatives have been exposed” and that it would only sell fire-retardant panels. Schmidt said he did not believe that Alucobond had actually stopped sales. Millett asked why Arconic did not attach a health warning to its own panels. “I can’t answer,” said Schmidt. “I don’t believe our competitors did it. Ten years later it is a legitimate question to raise, but at the time it wasn’t so obvious.” Millett asked why the fact that the material had only achieved an E rating in tests did not make the need for a health warning obvious. “I don’t have an answer,” said Schmidt, who stressed the fire in Dubai had not spread to the interior of the building. The inquiry continues."
2021-02-22T18:16:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Tributes paid to family who died in Exeter house fire,"Tributes have been paid to a couple in their 20s and their four-year-old daughter, who all died in a house fire in Exeter. Three other children – two boys aged four and nine and a seven-year-old girl – who were also in the house at the time are still in hospital in a stable condition. Relatives, friends and neighbours named the couple as Daniel and Kaylie Rudge, 29 and 28, and the child as Lilly. The three children who survived were also related to them. Mr Rudge’s sister, Mandy Rudge, 31, said: “Words cannot describe how we feel. I’ve lost a brother, sister and niece. We were talking with them only the other day and now they’re gone. Kaylie was the most beautiful person in the whole world and Daniel has the biggest heart. They would do anything for anyone.” Specialist investigators remained at the scene at Clayton Road in the St David’s area of the city on Monday after emergency services were called just after 5.30am on Sunday morning. They are continuing to try to establish the cause of the fire, but police have ruled out any third-party involvement. A friend of the couple, Lauren England, said: “They were such funny, caring and loving individuals, amazing parents. They were always there when we needed them the most without any hesitation, they were at our door within minutes, always thinking about everyone else but themselves. They will be truly missed and Exeter has gained a huge hole in its heart.” A fundraising page was set up to help the surviving members of the family and within hours almost £10,000 had been donated. Natalie Anderson, who created the appeal, wrote: “This will help their family cover costs for funerals, travel, childcare and for the other children for the present and the future.” Tom Woodman, the chief executive of Cornerstone Housing, which owns the property, said: “Words can’t express how devastated we feel about this terrible tragedy in one of our houses. Our hearts go out to the family’s relatives, friends, and the whole of the local community. We will do whatever we can to help and support them at this awful time.” Exeter city council said a flag would be flown at half-mast at the civic centre and a minute’s silence held before a full council meeting on Tuesday. Phil Bialyk, the leader of Exeter city council, said: “This is tragic news that will impact the whole of the city. Our hearts go out to the family. We will of course do anything we can to support the community.”"
2021-02-22T17:05:10Z,uk-news,UK news,UK's Ordnance Survey to launch mapping app in Australia,"Ordnance Survey, the UK’s national mapping agency, is eyeing an international expansion as it launches its first app in Australia. In the UK, OS Maps was first released in 2016. The free app, aimed at walkers, cyclists, and campers, lets users plot detailed walking, running and cycling routes, and also follow ones laid down by others. The app is built on a mix of Ordnance Survey’s own data, and open-source data provided by OpenStreetMap, an independent project that aims to build a Wikipedia-style free map of the world. For an additional monthly fee, users can access the entire range of Ordnance Survey maps, including the Explorer maps, which cover Britain in 403 maps at a 1:25,000 scale, as well as save maps for offline use – perfect when heading to remote areas. There is no such equivalent map for Australia, however, and so the organisation has instead partnered with the federal government and a number of state governments to incorporate their large-scale maps into the service.
“It has been a big challenge to launch an app in a new market while we are going through a global pandemic,” said OS’s managing director for leisure, Nick Giles. “From the research we have conducted, we discovered how Australians share similar behaviours and habits around enjoying the outdoors as we do in Great Britain, with an insatiable appetite for living outdoor active lifestyles much like ourselves. “We believe outdoor enthusiasts in Australia are not served well enough by the market for discovering and planning walks, runs, cycles or hikes both on and off the beaten path. OS Maps will give them the ability to plan their own routes or discover and download thousands of readymade ones all over the country.” However, Australian hikers should not leap into the outback just yet. Although GPS-enabled mapping apps can make locating yourself a breeze compared with awkwardly triangulating with a paper map, and the ability to use a few landmarks and a compass, a phone can run out of battery and leave its owners in the lurch. Australia’s federal system also means the coverage, at launch, is less complete than in the UK. Hikers in New South Wales, for instance, can access a relatively detailed map of national parks, suitable for rough way finding. But cross the border into the Australian Capital Territory and the coverage in effect disappears, replaced with a map so vague it would be hard to navigate even main roads. If the launch is successful, Ordnance Survey hopes to expand further, to Canada, the US and New Zealand."
2021-02-22T16:00:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Scotland drugs policy minister resolves to reduce horrific death toll,"Scotland’s new minister for drugs policy, Angela Constance, has said she is determined to see a reduction in the country’s horrific drug-related death toll and significantly more people in treatment within the year. “I’m talking about the full range [of treatment]: residential, in the community, harm reduction, recovery services, medication where it’s appropriate … I’m not punting my preferred option,” Constance said. Expectations are high following the appointment of Constance – a Holyrood veteran and former social worker – to the newly created role, which reports directly to the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. In December, Scotland’s drug-related death toll rose to another grim record, as long-delayed figures revealed a death rate more than 3.5 times that of the UK as a whole and higher than those reported for all EU countries. It was condemned as a “national tragedy and a disgrace” by experts at the time. Now Constance speaks of a “national mission”. At the end of January, Sturgeon announced more than £250m in new funding over the next five years in a Holyrood statement that many observers believed signified a change of tone in recognising the level of crisis the country faces. There has been growing anger among charities and specialists at what they see as political inertia beyond the high-level talk on both sides of the border. Many are frustrated that improvements that could be made immediately are overshadowed by wrangling about Westminster’s intransigence in refusing to devolve drug laws to Scotland. With fewer than 40% of the 60,000 people in Scotland with a drug problem now in treatment, how does Constance imagine this changing in a year’s time? She said she won’t set “arbitrary targets”, then noted that England has 60% in treatment, adding “our aspiration has to be greater than our nearest neighbour”. As for residential rehab, which will receive £20m of the annual £50m, latest data shows there are now 418 beds available, but Constance wants this increased by 50%, adding there is more capacity within the system than previously thought. Since her appointment, Constance has met a range of interest groups, from campaigners with experience of abstinence programmes pushing for more grassroots support, to Peter Krykant, the community activist who risked arrest last year to set up a safe injecting facility in the back of a van for addicts in Glasgow, in a personal crusade to break the political deadlock around drug consumption rooms. “This isn’t either/or, residential rehab versus harm reduction,” she said. “I believe in the power of residential rehabilitation but we need a vigorous emergency response as well. “What you need to do to save someone’s life this week can centre around quick access to naloxone [the potentially life-saving drug that reverses the effects of opioid overdose] or medication to stabilise them.” She acknowledges that opioid substitute therapy (OST) has “a good evidence base” but said “no one is advocating medication on its own”. One of the key criticisms of OST is when it is delivered without sufficient wraparound support.
The involvement of those with lived experience of addiction is “crucial”, she said, to addressing stigma. Attitudes need to change within services as well as among the wider population, she said. Practically, measuring progress over the first 12 months will require “a forensic focus on where the money goes and what it achieves”. Safe consumption rooms, like Krykant’s van, have been credited with saving lives around the world, but it remains illegal in the UK to facilitate drug use in this way. There are those who would like Constance to go further in testing the limits of devolved competence over drugs. “I don’t have a solution to that today,” she said."
2021-02-22T15:57:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Muslim Council says UK ministers' refusal to cooperate has had 'tragic consequences',"Britain’s largest Muslim group has complained that the government’s refusal to work with it throughout the pandemic crisis has had “tragic consequences” and urgently called on ministers to reconsider a policy of non-engagement with the organisation. The Muslim Council of Britain asked whether “similar faith-based, democratic bodies are excluded in this way” at a time when there is concern about the levels of vaccine uptake among members of minority communities in the UK. During the pandemic, the MCB has produced and shared detailed guidance for individuals and mosques and had its work praised by the Sage science committee’s behavioural subgroup, which said the organisation was “more trusted” than the government by some British Muslims. The Muslim Council remains blacklisted by the Conservative government and the limited behind-the-scenes contact there was with government officials was cut off abruptly last March at the start of the first lockdown. “The tragic consequences of such a policy were seen at the height the pandemic, when civil servants unexpectedly ceased engaging with the MCB, without providing a reason,” a spokesperson for the organisation said. “This took place at a time when both parties were working hard to provide vital information and guidance to Muslim communities, and whilst government ministries were sharing our work,” they added. British Muslims have suffered some of the worst effects of Covid-19, although faith-based data is not always easily available. Last June, the Office for National Statistics said Muslim men and women had the highest fatality rate of any faith group in the period between 1 March and 15 May. Vaccination rates among black and Asian minorities – roughly one in three of whom are Muslim - have lagged markedly behind the white population, prompting the government to launch a celebrity-fronted take-up campaign. The MCB’s statement came after Penny Mordaunt, the paymaster general, was criticised by government insiders for holding a meeting last week with Zara Mohammed, the newly elected head of the umbrella group. After the meeting, Mordaunt tweeted she wished Mohammed “every success” and would “look forward to working with her and her team”. But she was criticised for breaking the “zero cooperation” policy in reports in the Telegraph and the Sun. Government sources briefed that the meeting had taken place in Mordaunt’s capacity as a constituency MP, although others said she was in “hot water” because of her refusal to stick firmly to the government line. The last Labour government in 2009 suspended cooperation with the MCB after accusing its leaders at the time of supporting violence against Israel – a policy continued by Conservative ministers for the following decade. However, the practice has been followed inconsistently, with Labour ministers in 2010 and Lib Dem ministers during the coalition government meeting with the MCB. Contact with civil servants continued sporadically before it was cut off at end of last March. MCB insiders add that what little relations they had with officials deteriorated after Johnson became prime minister. The MCB criticised Johnson in 2018 after a row in which the politician had written a column in the Telegraph comparing fully veiled Muslim women to “letterboxes” and “bank robbers”. A spokesperson for the MCB said: “The election of Zara Mohammed – the youngest and first woman secretary general of the MCB - represents an opportunity for both the MCB and the government to come together and discuss areas where we could work together for the common good. We were delighted that Penny Mordaunt did exactly that.” The government said its policy of not engaging with the MCB had not changed."
2021-02-22T14:38:39Z,uk-news,UK news,"Police should carry drugs overdose antidote, says senior officer","The overdose antidote naloxone should be made available to all police officers in areas where there is a clear need, the police chiefs’ drug lead has urged after successful pilot schemes. North Wales police and Police Scotland are trialling having beat officers carry naloxone nasal sprays that can be used to treat opiate overdoses, and West Midlands police have extended their pilot scheme, with a rollout due to be announced. The National Police Chiefs’ Council’s drugs lead, Jason Harwin, a deputy chief constable with Lincolnshire police, told the Guardian that he was championing the use of naloxone by officers in areas where they may encounter people who have overdosed on opiates. “One of the core responsibilities of the police service is to save life,” he said. “Recent data shows us the really sad position where the number of people dying from opiate-related overdose is too high and unfortunately we see certain parts of the UK with high levels compared to other parts.” He said naloxone provision by police should be part of a wider public health response to drug use, and it was important for officers to have the necessary equipment to do their job. “The fact they have saved the lives of some members of their community is testimony to its need,” he said. “Other forces are also looking at similar and I look forward to seeing the wider availability where there is a clear need.” In one incident in north Wales during the 12-officer pilot, PC Tom Brownhill rushed to a squat to assist colleagues who had found a man overdosed on heroin and did not have the naloxone themselves. “His body temperature had dropped rapidly and I think he was just minutes away from death, and although the ambulance was there quickly I think it would have been too late. It’s good to know that we can be part of the solution in these cases rather than having to stand by and wait for the ambulance,” Brownhill said. His partner PC James Tapley said: “I’ve been to numerous sudden deaths that are likely to have been overdoses. And now, so long as I can get there within the window, I’m much more confident they have a better chance at survival.” Martin Powell, the head of partnerships at Transform, a drug charity that advocates for legal and regulated drug markets to reduce harm, said the thousands of police forces in North America who had carried naloxone for a number of years had saved “innumerable” lives. “We welcome the fact that police in the UK have started to follow suit, and applaud calls from the NPCC to roll out naloxone,” he said. “It is time the Police Federation got behind this life-saving intervention as well.” Simon Kempton, the Police Federation’s drugs lead, said there was a fear of encroaching on the territory of paramedics, and people in a medical emergency would prefer to be treated by a paramedic.
“The amount of times police are there before paramedics is small,” he said. “Naloxone should be given to drug users and their families proactively. If we’re going to carry naloxone, why don’t we carry a whole host of other pieces of equipment? We cannot become quasi-paramedics. It doesn’t give the public better standards of care.” Freedom of information responses from ambulance trusts in England show that thousands of naloxone administrations have been made each year from 2017 to 2020 since the drug was made available in 2005. Last year Harwin called for heroin-assisted treatment to be expanded across the country after the UK’s first fully established programme in Middlesbrough resulted in a number of people dependent on drugs all but ceasing to commit crimes, having previously recorded hundreds of offences between them."
2021-02-22T14:38:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Harry and Meghan Oprah interview to air hours after Queen's Commonwealth message,"On the last Commonwealth Day, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex appeared in public with the Queen and other senior royals for a final time before they departed the UK for North America. One year on, and the fracturing of the royal family is clearly marked as the Queen, Prince of Wales and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge appear in a special televised broadcast to celebrate the Commonwealth, while hours later the Sussexes appear on TV in the US for an “intimate” and “wide-ranging” interview with Oprah Winfrey about their experience of leaving the royal fold. The Queen will share her annual audio message on BBC One on Sunday 7 March, after the annual Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey was cancelled for the first time in half a century due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Her decision to share her message, pre-recorded at Windsor Castle, during the BBC’s A Celebration for Commonwealth Day, means it will be seen by millions ahead of the Oprah 90 -minute special on CBS at 8pm EST – at about 1am on Monday. Other senior royals will support the Queen in the show, hosted by Anita Rani, sharing their perspectives on the importance of Britain’s Commonwealth links. CBS announced its royal exclusive last week. The news was swiftly followed by the announcement that, following a 12-month review, the Sussexes had told the Queen they would not be returning to the UK as working royals. The couple, who had initially hoped to create a half-in, half-out, self-funded, progressive royal role, were forced to relinquish their royal patronages by a “saddened” Queen, who said it was not possible to continue with the roles. These include Harry’s honorary military titles, which will have been a bitter blow to him, and their positions as president and vice-president of the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust. In their statement, Harry and Meghan said: “We can all live a life of service. Service is universal”, prompting accusations they were sticking two fingers up to the institution of monarchy, and being disrespectful to the Queen. The Commonwealth Day service, usually attended by about 2,000 people, is one of the highlights of the Queen’s diary. It was due to be held on Monday 8 March, as it has been every year since 1972. The decision to replace it with a programme on 7 March was said to have been made at the start of February, before the Harry and Meghan interview with Oprah was announced. A Westminster Abbey spokesperson said: “The decision was taken jointly by the abbey, the BBC and the royal household about three weeks ago.” The Oprah interview will focus on Meghan, who is expecting the couple’s second child, who will discuss “stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood … to how she is handling life under intense public pressure,,” according to CBS. Meghan will later be joined by Harry to talk about their move to the US and their future plans.

The Duke of Cambridge, visiting a Covid-19 vaccination centre in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, on Monday, was asked about his 99-year-old grandfather, who was admitted to the King Edward VII’s private hospital in central London last week. William replied: “Yes, he’s OK. They’re keeping an eye on him,” and he gave a wink. Prince Philip was admitted last Tuesday evening as a precautionary measure after a doctor was called to Windsor Castle, where he has been shielding with the Queen, 94. He had complained of feeling unwell, but travelled to the hospital by car and walked in unaided. His reason for admission has not been disclosed but is said not to be Covid-related. He and the Queen had their coronavirus vaccination in January. He received a visit from the Prince of Wales on Saturday. Charles spent 30 minutes at the hospital after making a 100-mile trip from his home in Highgrove, Gloucestershire. He left without making any comment. Hospital Covid rules state that a visit from one person can be considered “in exceptional circumstances”. Charles had not seen his father since before Christmas and a source said: “The duke has been in hospital a few days longer than expected and the prince simply wanted to go and see him.” On Friday, Buckingham Palace said Philip would remain in hospital into this week as doctors were acting with an “abundance of caution”."
2021-02-22T13:01:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Jury discharged in Nazir Ahmed sexual abuse trial,"The jury has been discharged in the trial of a former Labour peer who was accused of sexually abusing two younger children as a teenager. Nazir Ahmed was charged with two counts of attempting to rape a girl under 16, indecent assault of a boy under 14, and raping a boy under 16, all alleged to have occurred in the early 1970s. On Wednesday Sheffield crown court heard that Ahmed rejected the allegations as “malicious fiction”. He was on trial alongside his brothers Mohammed Farouq and Mohammed Tariq, who were charged with indecent assault of a boy under 14. It was ruled that they were not fit to stand trial, but jurors were told they would still have to determine if they had committed the alleged acts. The defendants pleaded not guilty to all charges. On Monday, the judge, Jeremy Richardson QC, told jurors they were being discharged for legal reasons. He said discussions with the prosecution and defence counsel were ongoing. The prosecution said there was nothing further they could add at present."
2021-02-22T11:30:09Z,uk-news,UK news,"Streets in Welsh county can't be named after public figures, council rules","Streets in a north Wales county can no longer be named after public figures, celebrities or other individuals in case they later become controversial, councillors have ruled. The decision will also ease the burden on council officers in Denbighshire who say they are often asked by relatives of fallen military personnel to name a street in honour of their lost loved ones. Exceptions to the policy would only be made for people who had achieved “once in a generation” feats, the county council’s cabinet concluded. The councillors also decided that all new streets should have Welsh-only names, a move that follows a policy agreed by Cardiff council. Richard Mainon, the lead member for corporate services, said that as “times and attitudes change” some names did not stand the test of time and could be divisive. The councillor said he would prefer street names to “describe the area and signify the cultural and historical significance of the place”, adding: “It should be about the place and the community.” Mainon said officers were being asked to name new streets or even rename roads after fallen military personnel. But he said armed services bodies had suggested this was not a good idea unless someone had done something truly exceptional. The councillor expressed sympathy with families who wanted streets named after their loved ones. “You never want to say no,” he said. But he argued that a clear policy would “save a lot of work and a lot of tears”. The senior council officer Emma Jones told the council’s cabinet: “It’s the street-naming officer who bears the burden of whether a person is worthy of having a street named after them. It’s a heavy burden and we need to remove the normalisation of naming streets after individuals.” During a debate on the issue, Julian Thompson-Hill said places had to be re-named after Jimmy Savile was exposed as a serial sexual predator. But the councillor said he was opposed to a “blanket ban” that could stop a person such as Captain Sir Tom Moore’s fundraising efforts being recognised. He said: “I wouldn’t want us to have a policy that totally stopped us naming [a street] after a worthy individual.” The decision to name new streets in Welsh was welcomed by Welsh language campaigners. Ffred Ffransis, a prominent member of the pressure group Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg – the Welsh Language Society – said: “I think that having our street names in Welsh is an important way of remembering that the Welsh language belongs to all of us.”"
2021-02-22T11:18:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Captain Sir Tom Moore's funeral to take place on Saturday,"The funeral of Captain Sir Tom Moore will take place on Saturday, his family have said, as they reminded the public to stay at home. The second world war veteran, who raised almost £39m for NHS charities during the first coronavirus lockdown in spring 2020, died this month at the age of 100 after testing positive for coronavirus. A statement issued on behalf of his daughters Lucy Teixeira and Hannah Ingram-Moore said: “Over the past year, our father spoke openly about his death and his funeral, and had wondered out-loud if perhaps the interest in him over the last 12 months would mean we would need to have more Victoria sponge cakes available for the extra guests. “Sadly, like so many other families affected by the pandemic, we have no choice but to hold a small family funeral, which will take place this Saturday. While we understand so many people wish to pay their respects to our father, we ask that the public and the press continue to support the NHS by staying at home.” The family said they had set up an online book of condolence after they were contacted by so many people asking what they could do to honour Captain Tom. They also suggested the public could plant a tree in his memory, donate to a charity or to the Captain Tom Foundation, which supports causes including mental health and education. The statement added: “In the last few months of his life, our father had spent many enjoyable hours writing a book he chose to call Captain Tom’s Life Lessons, which he planned to release just before his 101st birthday. Sadly, he’ll never get to share this with you personally. “The final chapter is so poignant and reading it brings us so much comfort and warmth, so we share the last chapter now as a thank you, from our father Tom and us as a family, for the love and kindness the nation and the world have shown him.” Moore was admitted to Bedford hospital on 31 January after having been treated for pneumonia for some time and testing positive for Covid-19 the week before. His fundraising efforts during the first national lockdown in April raised £38.9m for NHS charities after his pledge to walk 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday captured the imagination of people around the world."
2021-02-22T00:32:38Z,uk-news,UK news,UK's anti-terror chief fears rights group boycott threatens Prevent review,"Britain’s best chance of reducing terrorist violence risks being damaged amid a huge backlash to the government’s choice of William Shawcross to lead a review of Prevent, the country’s top counter-terrorism officer has told the Guardian. Assistant commissioner Neil Basu’s comments came after key human rights and Muslim groups announced a boycott of the official review of Prevent, which aims to stop Britons being radicalised into violent extremism. It was hoped the review would quell persistent criticism that has dogged the government’s counter-radicalisation scheme and undermined Prevent’s legitimacy. Instead, the appointment of Shawcross by the home secretary, Priti Patel, threatens to leave the review struggling for credibility, with critics saying Shawcross was the wrong choice because of alleged anti-Muslim comments in the past. Patel chose the writer and broadcaster, who is also a fellow with the rightwing thinktank Policy Exchange, over Nazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor in the north-west who is from a Muslim background. In a surprise intervention, Basu said the participation of critics in the official review was vital and that “only when all sides of the discussion are heard can this review achieve what it sets out to achieve”. The boycott of the Shawcross-led review was announced last week by groups including Amnesty International, Liberty, the Runnymede trust, and others from Muslim communities. For Basu, the stakes could not be higher. He said he saw Prevent as the most important part of the fight against violent extremism from both Islamists and the far right. Basu, who is highly regarded in Whitehall and seen as a potential next head of Scotland Yard, told the Guardian: “I have always believed and stated publicly that Prevent is the most important pillar of our counter-terrorism strategy, and counter-terrorism police have long been advocates of an independent review. “We will, of course, work with the government’s chosen reviewer, because we believe the process will give our Prevent practitioners the opportunity to share their many years of expertise and insight, with the hope of bringing lasting improvement to this vital strategy. “But we also recognise how important the support and trust of our communities will be if we are to continue to protect vulnerable people, and so it is with great disappointment that I read some key groups plan to boycott the review altogether. “I would urge them to reconsider, because only when all sides of the discussion are heard can this review achieve what it sets out to achieve. “But it is my hope that even if they do not intend to participate in the review, they will consider working with counter-terrorism policing to try and find some common ground and ultimately help us improve our protection of those who need it.” The background to why counter-terrorism chiefs think Prevent is so important is the need to slow down the constant flow of those lured by terrorism, with the realisation that more arrests and prison sentences are not enough. There was a huge growth in terrorist activity triggered by the rise of Islamic State, with counter-terrorism operations increasing by 50% from 2015 to 2017. They have remained high ever since, with the threat from the extreme rightwing also growing. The Guardian understands there are serious concerns in counter-terrorism circles at Shawcross’s appointment, and the foreseeable hostile reaction to it, which is so strong that the review’s credibility may already be fatally flawed. The government has struggled for over a year to appoint a chair of the Prevent review. In August 2019 the government first chose Lord Carlile to chair the review with the aim of boosting the legitimacy of Prevent. The scheme has become a “toxic brand” within Muslim communities, with some viewing it as a state tool for spying. But in December 2019 Carlile was dropped by the government after criticism that he could not earn the confidence of communities seen as vital to Prevent’s legitimacy and success. It followed a legal challenge that argued he was appointed without a proper process and had apparent bias. Lord Carlile told the Guardian: “I have full confidence that William Shawcross will produce a well thought-out review and I am very disappointed in the refusal of a number of NGOs to cooperate with this review.” The chair of the review has a staff of around nine people, who have been waiting for more than a year for a new chair to be chosen. One other shortlisted candidate was Nazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor in north-west England. In a 2019 Guardian interview, Basu said Prevent had been the least successful part of the UK’s counter-terrorism strategy and had at times been “badly handled”."
2021-02-21T18:17:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Two adults and a four-year-old girl die in house fire in Exeter,"Police have launched an investigation into the deaths of a four-year-old girl and two adults in a house fire in Exeter. Those who died in the blaze on Sunday morning in the St David’s area of the city were a 28-year-old woman, a 29-year-old man and a four-year-old girl. Two boys aged four and nine, and a seven-year-old girl, were also in the house at the time of the fire and remain in hospital. All those occupying the house were part of the same family, Devon and Cornwall police said in a statement. A critical incident was declared after police were called at about 5.30am on Sunday. By then the ambulance and fire crews were already at the family home and the fire had been extinguished. On Sunday evening forensic experts remained at the house on Clayton Road, which has been cordoned off as the investigation continues. Ch Supt Daniel Evans of Devon and Cornwall police said: “It has now been confirmed that two adults, a 28-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man, plus a four-year-old girl have all died following this house fire. Next of kin have been informed and we will be supporting those affected with specialist officers. “Two boys aged four and nine, and a seven-year-old girl who were also in the house at the time of the fire remain in hospital. All three are currently in a stable condition, and all will be transferred to Bristol children’s hospital later today. All six within the property are related to each other.” Evans said officers were working with specialist scene investigators to establish the cause of the fire. “Currently there is nothing to indicate any third-party involvement in this matter and therefore we are not seeking anyone in connection to this fire at this time,” he said. “We hope to release the wider cordon along Bonhay Road by this evening, but an inner cordon surrounding the property along with a scene guard will be in place for the next three days at least, whilst vital scene investigation work takes place.” Evans added: “This is a deeply upsetting incident and one that will cause great distress to the community, particularly to those who knew the family. “I don’t doubt that people will wish to leave a tribute and flowers at the scene. I ask that at this time the public give our officers space to undertake the vital investigative work at the scene, and we will update you all over the coming days in relation to a safe space where people can leave flowers or a tribute if they wish.” In a statement, Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service said: “Our heartfelt thoughts are with the family and everyone involved in responding to this tragic incident. Our officers remain at the scene working alongside the police. Investigations into the cause of the fire continue and we are working closely with specialist scene investigators.” Exeter city council announced that the flag on the city’s civic centre will be flown at half mast tomorrow, and a minute’s silence will also be held before Tuesday’s council meeting."
2021-02-21T18:01:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Fewer than one in six ‘hostile environment’ raids led to deportations,"Fewer than one in six of more than 44,000 “intelligence-led” Home Office immigration enforcement raids on people’s homes since the introduction of the “hostile environment” policy have resulted in deportations, according to data obtained by the Guardian. According to a freedom of information (FoI) response provided to the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants by the Home Office, between 2015 and 2019 there were 44,225 raids on private homes resulting in just 7,578 people deported. There were also 190 raids carried out on care homes resulting in just 37 care workers removed from the UK. Mary Atkinson, campaigns officer at JCWI, said: “These figures show just how out of control the hostile environment has become. Carers are being arrested in the middle of their shifts, often as they look after elderly and vulnerable people – it is difficult to see who could possibly benefit from that. Ours is a government relentlessly pursuing an anti-immigration agenda, regardless of the harm it causes – in this case, to some of the very same carers whose hard work and sacrifice has been rightly applauded throughout this pandemic. “It’s time the Home Office scrapped the hostile environment and prioritised keeping people safe, instead of perpetuating a cruel set of immigration laws which cause needless harm to our communities.” According to the Home Office’s own guidance to immigration enforcement officials conducting raids, published in December 2020, when entering people’s homes: “You are entitled to be persistent but you must not be officious, rude or aggressive.” Susan Cueva, trustee at Kanlungan Filipino Consortium, which works with migrants including those working in care homes said: “We know that care homes lack staff. The Home Office should stop raiding care homes. It is counter-productive. The solution is to regularise the immigration status of these workers who are carers. That’s the most practical way to deal with this situation.” She said that if any undocumented workers were working in care homes they were more likely to be indirectly employed, but to come through other routes. This could be one reason why Home Office raids on care homes appear to have such a low success rate. In September 2015 the Home Office carried out a number of raids on care workers who were then removed on a charter flight to Nigeria. When raiding care homes many other agencies may be involved, including national care organisations, local authorities, adult social services and borough or constabulary police public protection units. The Home Office has to inform Care Quality Commission in England and equivalent organisations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and need to advise ambulance, police and the local authority when they are planning to raid a care home. Alternative staffing needs to be arranged to cover for those arrested and if necessary care home residents have to be moved elsewhere. “If at any stage of the operation owing to unforeseeable circumstances a resident of a care home or someone receiving care from an agency is likely to become left without necessary care, medication or facilities you must inform social services, commence critical incident procedures and contact the command and control unit,” the Home Office guidance states. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Immigration Enforcement operations including residential visits, play a critical role in reducing the harm caused by illegal immigration, such as modern slavery, people trafficking and smuggling. “Tackling illegal working in the care sector is one of the Home Office’s main illegal working concerns – individuals have been consistently found to use false identities and documents to secure employment and bypass DBS checks, but may not have the skills, experience and qualifications they claim.”"
2021-02-21T09:15:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Manhattan makeover for London with floating green walkway plan ,"New York was revitalised by the High Line, a ribbon of parkland floating above Manhattan on a disused elevated railway that has become one of the city’s biggest tourist attractions. Now the High Line’s designer hopes to give London its own green thread, after being chosen to create the Camden Highline. James Corner was picked last week as the lead landscape architect for the structure, a linear park on three-quarters of a mile of railway viaducts running from Camden to Kings Cross, which he believes will give London a similar boost after the trials of Covid and Brexit.
“In New York they struggled for years to get political interest and funding and it was only after 9/11 that they invested in projects like the High Line,” Corner said. “In some ways this is a very similar project, a very positive feelgood investment to help London come out of all the negative vibes of the past couple of years.” At least 700,000 foreign-born residents left London in the 12 months up to September 2020, according to the Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence, and uncounted others have been staying with family outside the capital during the pandemic. Projects like the Camden Highline are an essential part of reversing that trend, Corner told the Observer.
“When cities start to stagnate, they can go downhill really fast. This project is something that is catalysing and revitalising, keeping Camden alive as a place. “If you have the opportunity to live in a city that’s got great parks and gardens and high lines and canals and things that bring people out of a weekend, it’s just cool – it’s something you want to be part of. You need the magic that makes people say ‘I want to live in London’.” Calling it the Hanging Gardens of Camden Town might raise unrealistic expectations, and the first designs will not be seen for many months, but Corner anticipates a lot of greenery with “a palpable sense of nature – birds and butterflies” as well as places to meet and picnic. His firm, James Corner Field Operations, was selected after a competition involving 75 bids in what has been an unusually community-led process. The idea of a London highline was first mooted by Oliver O’Brien, a geography researcher at University College London, who was considering which parts of the capital might be suitable for a linear park. One already exists a little further north of Camden – the Parkland Walk, a nature reserve created out of a former railway line from Finsbury Park to Highgate in 1984. The first floating parkland on a former viaduct was the Promenade Plantée in Paris. O’Brien’s idea was picked up by the Kentish Towner, a local newspaper, then adopted by Camden Town Unlimited (CTU), which represents businesses in the borough. The route runs alongside track used for the overground North London Line, starting in the west at Camden Gardens, going past Camden Road station and on to York Way at Kings Cross. After lengthy feasibility studies, CTU began conducting walking tours underneath the railway, and gathered more than 1,000 crowdfunders to start the ball rolling. The next stage will be to canvass more local views, then submit plans to Camden council in about 18 months’ time. CTU’s chief executive, Simon Pitkeathley, expects the project to cost about £35m and open in about three years. “We need to make sure it grows from the bottom up,” he said, adding that connecting Camden Town to Kings Cross would help the economy and hopefully become a tourist attraction. “I hope one of the reasons it will be used is because it’s beautiful. The fact that you’re going to be able to get off an overground train straight onto the Highline will add to its usefulness and encourage normal use as well as visitors. But you want both.”
Corner was keen to emphasise that the Camden Highline will have a different character from that of its New York counterpart. The New York High Line is surrounded by skyscrapers, yet has an open vista. Camden’s buildings are low rise, and the park will run alongside a working railway, so needs a wall separating promenaders from locomotives. “Camden has its own dishevelled, edgy, eclectic feel,” he said. “It has its own vibe and own context that we want to leverage and play on. It’s not New York, so this elevated walk should be unique to Camden.” • This article was amended on 22 February 2021 because an earlier version referred to James Corner as the “lead architect” for the Camden Highline structure. Corner’s role is to be lead landscape architect."
2021-02-21T08:30:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Asylum seekers 'subjected to sexual harassment' in government hotels,"The Home Office has been urged to investigate the network of hotels holding thousands of asylum seekers following allegations of sexual harassment, intimidation and claims that staff have been paid significantly below the minimum wage. A joint investigation by the Observer and ITV News suggests privately contracted staff at some asylum hotels have been paid little over £5.50 an hour. Yvette Cooper, who chairs the home affairs select committee, has called on the Home Office to investigate if the private firms running the hotels are “fit for purpose”. Among the investigation’s findings are that asylum seekers have been unlawfully threatened by private contractor staff that the police will be called if they leave their hotel. There are allegations that women have been sexually exploited inside hotels, with others complaining they feel unsafe. At least nine asylum seekers have died in hotels last year run by Home Office private contractors, while others have been forced to sleep in parks and streets after being ejected by contractors for breaching hotel rules. There are also claims that training for contractor staff dealing with vulnerable and traumatised individuals is inadequate. “The Home Office has to make sure the systems they put in place for these private contracts are properly working and that there are proper checks and safeguards in place,” said Cooper. “At the moment we are not seeing that. The Home Office has to take some responsibility.” The low pay allegations involve hotels run by Stay Belvedere Hotels Ltd (SBHL) which is responsible for providing temporary accommodation for asylum seekers in about 50 hotels and hostels in London and the south of England. SBHL is subcontracted by Clearsprings Ready Homes, which stands to earn up to £1bn for its Home Office contracts despite controversy over its running of Napier barracks in Kent, where asylum seekers have complained of dire living conditions. Some SBHL staff say they worked 12-hour shifts, six days a week, for as little as £5.77 an hour. When one employee complained, a WhatsApp from the SBHL manager stated: “I have plenty of ppl willing to work at even less than what u are getting paid, trust me.” Last night the firm said it was committed to ensuring all staff received at least the minimum wage and had launched an immediate review into pay that would rectify issues found. Inside hotels overseen by Clearsprings, some asylum seekers have complained of unwelcome sexual behaviour. One current resident, whose anonymity is being protected, said she felt “very unsafe” and alleged she had been sexually harassed. “Staff use the master key to enter my room and call the women unpleasant names. The unwelcome sexual behaviour and invasion of privacy makes me feel uncomfortable,” she said, adding that she had complained to Clearsprings staff. Maddie Harris from the Humans for Rights Network, which documents violations against asylum seekers, said they had recently heard claims from a reliable source that women were being abused in a London hotel. Harris said: “We have received allegations that young women are being exploited. This is deeply concerning as these vulnerable women must be protected from harm. The Home Office must immediately investigate these allegations and ensure that asylum seekers whom they have a statutory responsibility to protect are safeguarded from harm.” One serving staff member admitted they knew of at least one colleague who had sexual relations with an asylum seeker despite it being “forbidden.” They said: “You’re not allowed to do that. These people are considered vulnerable people.” Meanwhile, provisional findings from a data gathering exercise by charity Care4Calais volunteers inside 40 hotels, had recorded contractor staff dismissing an allegation of sexual harassment by a woman asylum seeker as “not an emergency.”
Last night Clearsprings said it would fully investigate the allegations but questioned their accuracy and rebutted any suggestion that concerns around safety or security raised were not taken seriously. The hotels, which are estimated to be holding as many as 6,000 people, form a major component of the Home Office’s solution to coping with the backlog of individuals waiting for a decision on their asylum claims. However, new evidence suggests a number have imposed arbitrary and seemingly unlawful rules on residents. One notice, taken from a hotel in north-west London, warns asylum seekers: “Any absences longer than two hours will be reported to the Home Office and disciplinary action might be taken.” Under current lockdown rules, there is no limit to the amount of time someone can be outside. Another poster – to private contractor staff in a north London hotel – simply states that asylum seekers “should not be leaving”. It adds: “If anyone leaves the hotel for more than an hour we need to call the police.” It also warns that if asylum seekers cannot show proof of where they intend to visit “they will not be allowed back into the hotel”. Georgia Banks, a caseworker for Duncan Lewis Solicitors, said the Home Office must take ultimate responsibility. She said there was no legal basis for this policy, “which essentially amounts to an unlawful deprivation of liberty for individuals who are already vulnerable as a result of a history of torture and/or trafficking prior to their arrival in the UK”. In addition, reports have emerged from at least five hotels where asylum seekers have been ejected for apparently breaking rules. Earlier this month Care4Calais received information that one asylum seeker had spent two nights in an east London park after being “penalised” for staying out overnight. Another asylum hotel in north west London was reportedly locking people out if they left the premises for longer than one hour, but had since ceased the practice. Clare Moseley, founder of Care4Calais, said: “Being an asylum seeker means that, by definition, you have suffered something terrible. This may make them easy to intimidate.” Further questions over the running of the hotels are also raised by new figures that reveal that nine asylum seekers died last year “in Home Office hotel accommodation.” However the data, obtained in a freedom of information response, does not reveal the deceased’s identities or even how and where the individual died, prompting calls for more transparency. Questions also remain over how privately contracted staff are treated. One former SBHL employee shared invoices showing that during October he was paid £5.77 an hour, based on the amount he was paid divided by the number of hours he worked. He expected £7.70 and said he accepted the position and pay because he was desperate. “Because of this pandemic it was difficult to find a job, and being a student it was even harder during this time.” he added. His weekly tally of 72 hours worked is significantly more than the 48-hour working week, known as the EU working time directive, conceived to protect workers rights. Other invoices, from an SBHL employee at a north London hotel, indicates that during November they were paid less than £6 an hour. Many of the hotel’s private contractor staff are foreign nationals and South Asian international students who say they also accept the low wages because they are breaking the terms of their visas by working far more than 20 hours per week. SBHL said: “We are committed to ensuring all staff are paid fairly, at least in accordance with the national minimum wage requirements. In addition to their pay, many staff receive accommodation and other amenities and benefits.” The SBHL statement added its staff received “thorough training” including safeguarding that were regularly reviewed by independent bodies. Clearsprings said it was not aware of any staff or sub-contractor staff “currently” being paid below the minimum wage and pledged to investigate staff working hours and student permits. “We strongly deny claims that concerns around safety or security raised by asylum seekers are not taken seriously as all reported concerns are investigated and actioned appropriately. Clearsprings and their subcontractors cooperate fully with any investigating authority.” It added that asylum seekers were “free to come and go as they please” and could access the 24/7 Migrant Help service for registering complaints or request assistance. Clearsprings said it had recorded four deaths in hotels run by its subcontractors since March which were all “related to ongoing health conditions and not to Covid”. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We have raised these serious allegations with our accommodation provider and will investigate them fully. “Asylum seekers are not detained – they are free to come and go as they please in line with Covid restrictions. “The Home Office takes the wellbeing of asylum seekers incredibly seriously and they have 24/7 access to a migrant helpline if they need any assistance. We are deeply saddened by the death of any asylum seeker in our accommodation and our thoughts are with the friends and family of those who have passed away.”"
2021-02-21T08:15:55Z,uk-news,UK news,"Keep out of Bristol’s slaver street names debate, ministers are told","A history commission set up by Bristol’s mayor after the toppling of the Edward Colston statue has urged ministers to stay out of debates on the future of dozens of city streets named after slave traders. Prof Tim Cole, the commission’s chair, said a new audit by Bristol city council had identified a handful of streets named after Colston, whose company enslaved at least 80,000 Africans, and dozens more streets named after other slave traders. “It should be up to people who live on those streets to decide – it is an uber-local issue,” he said. “If a bunch of people who live on Colston Avenue want to change the name of their street they should be empowered to do so.” The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, has warned that “town hall militants” and “woke worthies” have “street names in their sights”. While Jenrick’s proposed new “retain and explain” planning policy will apply only to plaques and monuments, there are growing concerns that ministers’ inflammatory rhetoric will make it harder for locals on opposing sides to have conciliatory discussions about the future of street names. “These kinds of divisive phrases add to this sense of a culture war,” said Cole, who is based at Bristol University. “We need a more thoughtful way to explore the past and think about the public realm. It is stoking fires that don’t need stoking.”
After the Colston statue was brought down by Black Lives Matter protesters in June, the headstone of an enslaved African man was smashed in Bristol. A statue of a black playwright was also attacked in the city. Some commissioners fear Jenrick’s proposed laws will prevent the city from deciding the fate of other local monuments. History professor Madge Dresser accused the government of a power grab. “It is a bid to control history and to bring these vital local decisions under the overcentralised and partisan grip of the Tory party,” she said. “Its tone is hectoring and needlessly divisive. It seems supported by those elements in the party whose grasp of history is at best traditionalist and at worse stone-cold ignorant.” Jenrick’s proposals could backfire, say other commissioners. Nigel Costley, TUC south west regional secretary, said blocking change could lead to people taking matters into their own hands. “Cities have always changed and people will find ways of changing things for themselves if you don’t allow local democratic processes to work,” he said. The commission will also be making recommendations to highlight the struggles of workers and other marginalised groups in the city. “We have to recognise that the formal statues in the city completely fail to represent Bristol. There’s only one woman and that’s Queen Victoria. There’s been barely any recognition of black people and the working class. It’s been wealthy white men who have been put on pedestals and that needs to change,” said Costley. While the commission is yet to make any recommendations on the future of the empty plinth where Colston once stood, there are fears the far right might attack any monuments erected to mark the city’s involvement in the slave trade.
Dresser said she would like a counter-memorial placed near the empty Colston plinth. “Personally, I would like to have a monument to the contribution enslaved Africans and their descendants have made to the prosperity of the city,” she said. “But I worry that this might be vandalised and attract the attentions of the far right.”
Although the commission has limited resources, it turned down funding from the influential Society of Merchant Venturers, which once counted Colston as a member and managed institutions in the city bearing his name, in order to maintain its independence. The society said it respected the commission’s decision. Costley said he was glad the funding had been rejected. “They’ve tried to reform but they’re too steeped in the past,” he said. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government would not comment on the suggestion that the renaming of streets would be blocked. “For hundreds of years, public statues and monuments have been erected across the country to celebrate individuals and great moments in British history,” they said. “Any removal should require planning permission and local people be given the chance to be properly consulted – that’s why we are changing the law to protect historic monuments.”"
2021-02-20T19:57:19Z,uk-news,UK news,21-year-old UK teacher becomes youngest woman to row Atlantic solo,"A 21-year-old swimming teacher from North Yorkshire has become the youngest woman to row solo across the Atlantic Ocean. Jasmine Harrison, a part-time teacher and bartender from Thirsk, began the journey in December when she departed from La Gomera in the Canary Islands. It took her 70 days, three hours and 48 minutes to reach Antigua. Her arrival in the Caribbean was greeted with a fanfare on Facebook, where she was broadcasted crossing the finishing line. The triumphant 21-year-old stood in her rowing boat and lit her flares as she came into the bay. Arriving on the island, Harrison said the experience had been “everything [she] wanted it to be”. Asked what she was most looking forward to, the 21-year-old answered: “Food, definitely food”.
She said the 3,000-mile (4,828km) journey has been made of “good and bad memories”, but explained that she had appreciated being able to escape from normal life. “There’s nothing like it, actually getting away from everything – social media, bad news, from literally everything,” she said.
The rower faced several challenges on her journey. Her boat capsized in early February and again two days ago, injuring her elbow. Harrison said she would row for two hours and sleep for two hours on rotation during the crossing. She was inspired to sign up for the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge when she visited Antigua after completing her A-levels. She began training for the competition in January 2020 in Hartlepool, according to a report in the Northern Echo.
Her record-breaking feat has raised more than £10,000 for charity, with the money going to the Blue Marine Foundation, which aims to fight overfishing, and ShelterBox, an organisation providing relief to people affected by natural disasters. “I want to inspire young people to get out there and do something, whether that be changing the world or just doing something outside your comfort zone,” Harrison wrote in a statement on her website. Until now, the youngest female rower to traverse the Atlantic was 22-year-old Katie Spotz from the USA who made the journey between 3 January and 14 March 2010."
2021-02-20T17:53:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Prince of Wales visits his father Prince Philip in hospital,"The Prince of Wales has visited his father the Duke of Edinburgh in hospital. Prince Philip, 99, was admitted to King Edward VII’s hospital in London on Tuesday evening as a precautionary measure after feeling unwell and walked unaided into the medical centre. Prince Charles arrived at the hospital at about 3.20pm on Saturday in a grey Tesla car, and exited the vehicle wearing a face mask, before leaving about 30 minutes later. It is understood the prince travelled from his home in Highgrove, Gloucestershire, to the hospital in central London, a journey of about 100 miles. He is the first member of the royal family to visit Philip during the duke’s four-night stay in hospital. It is thought Charles had not seen his father since before Christmas because of the nationwide coronavirus restrictions, with the duke staying at Windsor Castle. The visit comes the day after Charles’ son, the Duke of Sussex, and his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, were stripped of their prestigious patronages as the couple confirmed Megxit was permanent. Earlier in the day, it was announced Princess Eugenie and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, have named their baby son August Philip Hawke Brooksbank in a tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh. The newest addition to the royal family, who was born at the private Portland hospital in central London at 8.55am on 9 February, is the Queen and Prince Philip’s ninth great-grandchild.
It is understood the couple chose the name August after Queen Victoria’s consort Prince Albert, who had Augustus as a middle name. Hawke is a Brooksbank family name. Eugenie posted on Instagram: “We wanted to introduce you to August Philip Hawke Brooksbank. Thank you for so many wonderful messages. Our hearts are full of love for this little human, words can’t express. We are excited to be able to share these photos with you.” She added that the images were taken by “our wonderful midwife” and she thanked “the wonderful essential workers” who discharged her child. The new arrival was born 11th in line to the throne but will move to 12th place upon the birth of Prince Harry and Meghan’s second child. A tweet from the official royal family account said: “The couple have been touched by the well wishes they have received on the birth of their first child, and are delighted to share this first photo as a family.”"
2021-02-20T11:03:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Bloodlands: location of BBC drama kept secret to avoid tourist influx,"The filming location of a new BBC drama starring James Nesbitt will not be disclosed to fans, amid concerns that the small island will be overwhelmed by tourists. The police thriller Bloodlands, which is due to air on Sunday night, is set in Northern Ireland’s Strangford Lough, which is home to at least 100 islands. According to the director, Pete Travis, the show decided not to name the island it was filmed on to avoid an influx of tourists. The show was originally meant to be set in another location, but was changed at the last hour after the location’s owners pulled out over concerns about a surge in visits. Travis acknowledged that “for the people who own the location it can become a bit of a nightmare”.
Northern Ireland has become a particular hotspot for crime dramas, with dramatic landscapes providing the backdrop to shows including Game of Thrones, The Fall and Line of Duty. “People turn up from all over the world to find out about former shows that have been shot there [in Northern Ireland],” Travis told the Telegraph. “We never actually named the island, so no one will know that we filmed on it for people that live nearby. “I remember there was one island where the people that owned it, having said to us we could do it … decided at the last minute that they didn’t want us to because they didn’t want tourists trying to find out where Bloodlands was shot,” he said. Bloodlands follows the detective Tom Brannick, played by Nesbitt, as he investigates a serial killer who seems to reappear after 20 years, in a case which has “enormous personal significance”, according to the BBC. It is executive produced by Jed Mercurio, who is behind hit thrillers including Line of Duty and Bodyguard. A number of locations for hit TV shows and films have become tourist hotspots, such as Downton Abbey’s Highclere Castle. In December 2019, the local council was forced to ask fans to stay away from the pink Notting Hill house featured in Love Actually, after the owner complained about an influx of fans. The owner said she “had no idea this house was in the film when I bought it” and was “now living under a blanket of selfies, tour guides and a queue of tourists lining up to take photos on weekends”. “They even walk into my house if the door is open, thinking it’s some sort of theme park,” she added."
2021-02-20T07:00:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Manchester council loses legal fight to build car park next to school,"A group of women from Manchester have won a legal battle with the city’s council, which wanted to build a 440-space car park next to the city centre’s only primary school. Campaigners said the victory exposed the “hypocrisy” in the local authority’s approach to addressing air pollution and global heating. It may also be viewed as a warning shot to other councils which, like Manchester, declare “climate emergencies” and then push through polluting development projects. Manchester city council (MCC), which is running a public consultation on how to save £50m, spent an estimated £70,000 on some of England’s top planning barristers to fight a community group called Trees Not Cars. Gemma Cameron, a software engineer and mother of one, formed the group after learning that MCC had given itself planning permission to put a 440-space car park on an abandoned retail park next to New Islington free school in Ancoats. In 2017 MCC paid £37m for the Central retail park and partnered with Abu Dhabi United — a private equity company owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, an Abu Dhabi prince who owns Manchester City football club — on a joint venture to plan the site’s future. The plan was to build a temporary car park before the land was turned into offices. Trees Not Cars proposed the 10-acre site be turned into a “people’s park” instead, and staged various protests to make their case. Unlike London or New York, Manchester does not have any major parks in the city centre. When sit-ins and petitions failed, they brought a judicial review which argued the application should have been blocked because of air pollution. After a high court judge ruled in their favour on Friday, Cameron said: “This is the first time we are aware of a community group beating the council in a legal challenge … It’s time for communities to fight back.” She added: “Now that we have won, we need to turn serious attention to questioning the judgment and competence of the council in using public money to pursue a polluting car park at enormous expense to the taxpayer.” As well as paying its own costs, estimated by Trees Not Cars as £70,000, the council will have to pay Trees Not Cars’ £35,000 legal fees. MCC said it was still collating costs and it would be “inappropriate” to confirm how much of taxpayers money it had spent on the action. Julia Kovaliova, another lead organiser from Trees Not Cars, who has two sons at New Islington free school, said: “I am delighted by the judge’s decision and will be able to sleep easier at night knowing my son who has asthma won’t be exposed to even greater levels of air pollution. Our victory must be a wake-up call for the council, who can’t continue to prioritise car parks and offices over clean air and green space.” Following the judgment on Friday, the council said it had sought leave to appeal. It said it brought the case because of “the precedent it would set and the potential impact of this decision on future applications if insufficient weight was given to the previous use of sites – in this case as the car park for a retail park”. A spokesperson said the site would not be used as a car park but that the council hoped to develop the site as part of a “net zero carbon business district, with public space at its heart and as little car use as possible”. They added: “We do however recognise calls for more green space and the site will integrate with an improved Cotton Field Park, to the immediate north of the site. Work is also well under way to create Mayfield Park, a major new city centre park.” • This article was amended on 22 February 2021. Manchester city council was the sole buyer of Central retail park, rather than purchasing it jointly with a private equity company owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan as an earlier version said."
2021-02-19T16:53:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Majority of Canadians think royal family 'no longer relevant',"The tumultuous exit of Canada’s governor general has left Canadians questioning the need for a constitutional monarchy, according to new polling which shows that 55% of respondents believe the royal family is no longer relevant. In Canada, the governor general is the representative of Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. The role has long been seen as largely ceremonial, but moved to the political centre stage last month when Julie Payette stepped down from her position amid allegations of bullying and harassment of staff. Following Payette’s unprecedented resignation, polling this week from the Angus Reid Institute found support for both the position of governor general, and the royal family more broadly, is eroding. Given the chance, 43% of respondents said they would eliminate the position of governor general. Only 22% would opt to keep the role as is. A majority of respondents (65%) found the job paid far too generously, reflecting widespread outrage that Payette could be eligible for a pension of at least C$149,484 (£84,625) a year as well as an expense allowance of C$206,000 annually. As separate poll conducted by Ipsos found that 80% of Canadians didn’t believe Payette was entitled to a pension. As Justin Trudeau faces mounting pressure from opposition leaders to create an independent committee to select the next governor general, an overwhelming majority of Canadians have rejected the idea that the prime minister alone should have a hand in choosing the head of state.
A former astronaut and accomplished scientist, Payette was hand-picked by Trudeau in 2017. With lingering questions over how well she was vetted, the prime minister has faced sharp criticism for acting without relying on the advice of a non-partisan committee. Canadians appear to be growing weary of the role of the monarchy itself. A majority (55%) say the royal family is no longer relevant to their daily lives – a rise of 14% from last month. While the country is evenly split over support for the Queen, opposition to the monarch has jumped nearly 20 points since April, with 50% saying she should no longer be recognised as Canada’s head of state."
2021-02-19T16:45:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Harry and Meghan turn away from Britain and towards world stage,"The decision by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to permanently step down as working royals comes as no surprise. When they first announced their wish to no longer perform royal duties, and to become financially independent – blindsiding Buckingham Palace by making their intentions public before matters had been negotiated with the Queen – it was hard to see how they could return.
It caused surprise, hurt and disappointment among the rest of the family. At the time the Queen gave her reluctant blessing to their ambition for a new “progressive role” and stressed they would remain “a valued part of my family”. At a historic crisis summit at Sandringham, attended by the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry, a transition period of 12 months was agreed. It appears now this was less to facilitate their eventual return to the royal fold, more for the couple to establish if they could make enough money to become self-funding. They have proved that in spades. Lucrative contracts have been struck with the streaming sites Netflix and Spotify, the former for a series of documentaries, the latter for podcasts to promote their Archewell brand. Their profile in the US is soon to be further enhanced with their planned interview with Oprah Winfrey, billed as an “intimate” and “wide-ranging” chat, which it is thought will be recorded this week. It will primarily focus on Meghan, exploring her experience of joining the royal family, before Harry then joins them to discuss future plans. None of this exposure will have been welcomed by the rest of the royals. Neither will it have done anything to heal strained relations between Harry and his brother, William. The two are separated by much more than the Atlantic. Initially, the couple hoped for a “half in, half out” deal, whereby they could be based abroad, but still fly the flag.
However, Buckingham Palace played hard ball, mindful that any financial enterprises could compromise the Queen. The couple were ordered to give up the Sussex Royal brand they had fashioned. Dismantling the Sussex Royal website and social media platform the couple had built would have been a bitter blow. They were also forced to repay taxpayer money used to refurbish their Windsor home, Frogmore Cottage. For Harry, who has now given up everything, it has undoubtedly been an emotional rollercoaster. He allowed a glimpse of his inner turmoil when, in a speech at a private London dinner last year for his charity Sentebale – of which he retains his patronage – he said: “Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth and my military associations without public funding. Unfortunately that wasn’t possible.” It was not a decision he had taken lightly, but there was “no other option”. Speaking “not as a prince, or a duke, but as Harry”, he said he had found the “love and happiness I had hoped for all my life” with Meghan. It had brought him “great sadness”, he said, that it had come to this. Now, expecting their second child and living in an £11m mansion in Montecito, California, the world rather than the UK is their chosen stage. That much has been evident from the moment they selected South Africa, and a meeting with Archbishop Desmond Tutu, to properly show off their baby son, Archie. Throughout this year of transition they have taken on – time and again – a critical UK media, including in the courts. They have been outspoken in their condemnation of the way they have been treated by some UK publications, making any return to Britain as working royals extremely difficult. They appear to see the UK press as an aggravation, preferring the less critical US media. Today their fate is sealed. There is no turning back. Though as the grandson of a sovereign, and the son and brother of future sovereigns, Harry will always be indelibly royal by blood. All but his familial links are, however, severed once and for all."
2021-02-19T15:04:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Calls to review five-year jail term for man who strangled wife in Wales,"The attorney general is under increasing pressure from MPs and campaigners to ask the court of appeal to reconsider the sentence of a man who strangled his wife days into the first coronavirus lockdown. Anthony Williams, 70, was sentenced to five years in jail at Swansea crown court on Thursday after he was found not guilty of murder but admitted manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. The judge, Paul Thomas, said it was a “tragic case on several levels” but in his view Williams’ mental state was “severely affected at the time”. The Labour MP Harriet Harman said on Friday that she would write to the attorney general for England and Wales, Suella Braverman, to ask her to refer the case to appeal as an unduly lenient sentence. Fellow Labour MP Jess Phillips said she would join calls for the sentence to be reviewed. Harman said: “If he had killed his neighbour, or his neighbour’s wife, it’s inconceivable that he would have got five years. “This sentence is a result of the culture of excuses that surrounds domestic violence. It must be perverse that you get a discount on your sentence if your victim is your wife, when you’re killing somebody who should be able to trust you, and should be able to be safe in her own home.” Ruth Williams, a retired supermarket worker, was found slumped with a set of keys in her hand in the porch of her home in Cwmbran, south Wales, on the morning of 28 March last year. A postmortem found her neck was fractured in five places and she had suffered haemorrhaging in her eyes, face and mouth consistent with strangulation. Her cause of death was given as pressure to the neck, and the pathologist said the lack of a ligature mark did not rule out use of a soft dressing gown cord found at the couple’s home. During his trial the jury heard Williams had admitted to detectives that he had “literally choked the living daylights” out of his wife. He said he had found lockdown “really hard” just five days into the UK-wide restrictions and felt depressed, and told police he had attacked his wife after she told him to “get over it”. Dr Alison Witts, a psychiatrist, told the trial Williams’ anxiety and depressive illness were heightened by the coronavirus measures and impaired his ability to exercise self-control. Another psychiatrist, however, Dr Damian Gamble, said Williams had no documented history of depressive illness and had “no psychiatric defences” available to him. he said he believed Williams “knew what he was doing at the time”. Domestic violence campaigners have raised concerns about the sentence. A spokesperson for Welsh Women’s Aid said the service had experienced an increase in demand during the pandemic, and that the virus and lockdown must not be used to justify or excuse abuse. “We are shocked by the leniency in this case and a precedent must not be set that allows domestic homicide to be an inevitable result of the current restrictions,” the spokesperson said. “Domestic homicides often follow years of coercive and controlling abuse and it is vital this is understood by all in our justice system.” Harriet Wistrich, the director of the Centre for Women’s Justice, said the sentencing laid bare “deep-seated discriminatory attitudes”. “It is clear that women who resist male violence are punished most severely, whereas men who throttle their wives to death for no apparent reason are just ‘tragic’ figures,” she said. Sentencing, the judge said: “The overwhelming greatest tragedy here is a lady of 67, who had so much to live for, had her life ended by an act of great violence at the hands, literally, of a man she loved for very nearly 50 years.”"
2021-02-19T14:51:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Court refuses to grant HS2 possession order for tunnel protest site,"A judge has refused to grant a possession order to HS2 for the site of a tunnel occupied by environmental activists close to London’s Euston station. HS2 went to the high court to obtain a possession order for the site and an injunction against the protesters in the tunnel. In his ruling on Friday Mr Justice Mann granted an injunction to HS2 against the five remaining climate activists in the tunnel. Four others have already left voluntarily. He declined, however, to grant HS2 a possession order at the moment, saying he had doubts about the issue. “I consider there is a question mark,” he said. “HS2 claims to be entitled [to the land]. It seems at the moment that it has not complied with the provisions of the act. That is a troubling conclusion.”
In other circumstances he would have dismissed the possession claim in its entirety, he said, but in a highly unusual move he he was prepared to give HS2 a further opportunity to convince him that they had the right of possession. He convened another court hearing on Monday to allow HS2 to make further representations. “This matter is of significant public interest,” he said during the hearing. The case is the third related to the Euston tunnel protest to reach the high court since the protest began on 27 January. Friday was the 24th day of the underground protest. The climate activists say they launched the tunnel protest because they believe the HS2 development is causing major damage to the environment and destroying ancient woodland and the biodiversity its contains. HS2 denies this and says it is taking a range of steps to protect the environment, including by planting 7m new trees. The five remaining people in the tunnel are Dr Larch Maxey, Dan Hooper known as Swampy, Isla Sandford, known as Blue and two other protesters referred to in court papers as Nemo and Bradley. Hooper’s son Rory, 16, has left the tunnel, along with Lazer Sandford, 20, a 17-year-old female protester and Scott Breen, 46. Saira Sheikh QC, representing HS2, told the court: “What the claimants seek is possession of the land. Work is being impeded and it’s extremely dangerous for these occupants to remain. “We have the right of temporary possession” and Maxey was the subject of previous court orders requiring him to leave the tunnel but had not done so. She said notice to vacate the site had been given to the lawful occupiers – Network Rail and two bus companies. “When we are seeking acquisition you wouldn’t need to go through unlawful occupiers,” she told the court. In his ruling the judge said: “No notice was given to the right of possession against these trespassers.”
The judge acknowledged the controversial nature of the HS2 development, but said the application for possession and injunction was not concerned with those issues. “The matter has attracted a lot of hostility on ecological grounds,” he said. “Danger of collapse of the tunnels is real and serious. I’m quite satisfied that there is grave danger,” he said. Soon afterwards, protesters in the tunnel network reported three internal collapses and said about a third of a tonne of earth had fallen on top of one of the bailiffs. The eviction operation is said to have cost £1.35m so far, or £64,000 a day. John Cooper QC, representing Maxey, said: “Issues relating to the law around this form of protest are going to become more and more prevalent as time goes on. I, like everyone else, recognise that the most important thing is people’s safety.” HS2 has indicated that if the judge does not find in its favour on Monday it was possession of the land inhabited by the tunnellers and would seek permission to take the case to the court of appeal. An spokesperson said: “HS2 has today successfully sought injunctions which apply to the remaining illegal trespassers in crudely constructed tunnels under Euston Square Gardens. “Mr Justice Mann recognised that the activists have put themselves, and those working to extract them, in ‘grave danger.’ The injunctions sought by HS2 state that the activists illegally occupying the tunnels are forbidden from entering or remaining on the land at Euston Square Gardens, including within the tunnel.” The spokesperson added that the injunction stated that the protesters should cease any further tunnelling activity, inform HS2 and others of how many people are in the tunnel and what its layout is, and cooperate with the authorities to leave the site safely."
2021-02-19T13:59:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Pupils in Wales set to return to primary schools from 15 March,"All primary schoolchildren in Wales will return to face-to-face teaching from 15 March if the coronavirus situation in the country continues to improve, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford announced on Friday that there was “headroom” to begin a phased and flexible reopening, starting with modest changes to the country’s lockdown. The overarching “stay at home” message will be extended for at least another three weeks to allow for a safe return to school for the youngest pupils from Monday, he said. Coronavirus cases in Wales are at their lowest level since the end of September . The seven-day average stands at 84 per 100,000 and the R number is below 1. Evidence shows the reduction in community transmission was being reflected in falling hospital admissions, Drakeford said, and the vaccination programme was on track. A third of adults have received at least one dose. He told the briefing in Cardiff the situation was improving every day, and that there was now “headroom to make some modest changes as we take the first cautious steps to relaxing the lockdown” from Monday. Children aged between three and seven will resume face-to-face learning in classrooms, and some vocational students, including apprentices, will return to colleges. Young children are being prioritised because they are the least likely to transmit the virus and have the most difficulties with remote learning. Students such as apprentices need to prepare for practical exams. As many as four people from two different households will also be able to exercise outdoors together from Saturday, and Drakeford said the law would be changed next week to allow licensed wedding venues to reopen for weddings and civil partnerships from 1 March, and for some sports training to resume. The government would look again at how to allow more care home visits to take place safely, he said. The changes to the rules do not mean it is permissible to drive somewhere to exercise, and “it does mean exercise, not socialising”, he said.
If the situation continues to improve in Wales, the government would look at getting more young people back into school and college in the next review of restrictions during the week beginning 8 March, Drakeford said. The aim would then be for all primary school children to return to face-to-face learning from 15 March, along with students in exam years 11 and 13 on a blended learning basis. The reopening of non-essential retail and close-contact services such as hair salons could be on the cards if the government was able to lift the “stay at home” message, Drakeford said. Looking beyond the next three weeks, discussions would also begin with the tourism sector to look at ways to reopen self-contained accommodation, he said.
All four of the UK’s nations have remained in lockdown as the vaccine is rolled out. In Northern Ireland, the lockdown has been extended to 1 April, and in Scotland most measures are expected to remain in place until the end of February. Boris Johnson is expected to set out a roadmap for easing lockdown in England “cautiously” on Monday. Public Health Wales said on Thursday that 822,633 first doses of the vaccine had been administered. It also reported another 290 Covid-19 cases and 14 deaths, taking the death toll in the country to 5,189."
2021-02-19T13:25:51Z,uk-news,UK news,Watchdog investigates second death after contact with police in Wales,"The police watchdog is investigating a second death following contact with police in Wales as protesters gathered in Newport to demand answers. Moyied Bashir, 29, died on Wednesday after officers were called to his home in the city. They attended the property on Maesglas Crescent at about 9am over concerns for Bashir’s welfare after an emergency call was made from the address, Gwent police said. The force said he was suffering a medical episode. He was taken to Grange University hospital where he was pronounced dead at about 11.40am. Gwent police has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) in line with standard procedures. The watchdog said in a statement: “After being notified by Gwent police at around midday on Wednesday we sent investigators to the property and to the post-incident procedures where the officers involved have provided their initial accounts of their interaction with Mr Bashir.” The IOPC said it was aware that Bashir, who was not arrested, was initially handcuffed and put in leg restraints at the property while awaiting an ambulance. “During their interaction with Mr Bashir his condition was noted to deteriorate. Paramedics arrived and gave medical treatment at the address prior to moving him to a waiting ambulance,” the statement said. By the time the ambulance arrived a number of police vehicles and nine officers had responded to the incident. The coroner was informed and a postmortem was carried out on Thursday. More than 100 protesters gathered outside Newport’s central police station on Thursday shouting “we want answers” and “we want justice”. Black Lives Matter Gwent released a statement calling on the police and the IOPC “to put their money where their mouth is and deal with this deeply distressing death in a swift, transparent and empathetic manner”. Moyied’s brother, Mohamed Bashir, told the BBC he had been stabbed three weeks ago and was recovering from the injury, and that he had struggled with his mental health. He said his parents had decided to take him back to hospital and ended up calling the police because they were unable to get him out of his room. “They believed their best option was to call the police and help them escort him to hospital,” Bashir said. Instead, he said, officers arrived and forced their way into his room. He said police handcuffed him and “tied him up by his leg”. “His stab wound is on his main artery, so while he is tied up, handcuffed, he started getting weaker,” he said. He later died in hospital. Bashir’s death comes a month after the death of Mohamud Mohammed Hassan, 24, hours after he left custody in Cardiff. It emerged earlier this month that an investigator had told Hassan’s family that he had come into contact with more than 50 police officers during the final hours of his life. An officer has been served with a misconduct notice as part of an investigation into his sudden death shortly after he had been released from custody. Catrin Evans, the IOPC director for Wales, said: “I offer my condolences to Mr Bashir’s family and friends, and to everyone affected by his tragic death. We have spoken to family members to explain our role and how the investigation will progress. “It is appropriate in the circumstances of a death following police contact that we investigate what happened, and I would like to reassure people that we will do so thoroughly and independently. We will be carefully examining the interaction police officers had with Mr Bashir and whether their actions were proportionate and reasonable in the circumstances.” Deborah Coles, the director of the human rights charity Inquest, said: “That two men of colour in Wales have died following police use of force, just six weeks apart, is deeply concerning, not least after the level of scrutiny racism and restraint in policing has received in the past year. Inquest’s work has revealed a systemic pattern of deaths raising concerns about structural racism, state violence, neglect and impunity. “Yet again we see a man in mental health crisis, in need of care and protection, restrained and bound. Moyied Bashir’s death reflects the double discrimination faced by people in mental health crisis. We stand with both families in demanding truth, justice and accountability. Accountability means ensuring systemic change after deaths, enactment of recommendations from previous deaths and reviews and stopping law enforcement being used as a response to health and social problems.”"
2021-02-19T13:24:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Shamima Begum: supreme court to decide next week on UK return,"The supreme court will announce next week whether Shamima Begum, who left London as a schoolgirl to join Islamic State in 2015, should be allowed back into the UK to challenge the removal of her British citizenship. Begum was 15 when she fled to Syria to live under Isis rule for more than three years. Her British citizenship was revoked on national security grounds shortly after she was found, nine months pregnant, in a Syrian refugee camp in February 2019. She had already lost two children and the third died shortly after being born. Begum, now 21, is challenging the Home Office’s decision to remove her British citizenship and wants to be allowed to return to the UK to pursue her appeal. The court of appeal ruled in July last year that “the only way in which she can have a fair and effective appeal is to be permitted to come into the United Kingdom to pursue her appeal”. The Home Office challenged that decision at the supreme court in November, arguing that allowing her to return to the UK “would create significant national security risks” and expose the public to “an increased risk of terrorism”. The UK’s highest court will rule next Friday on whether Begum should be granted leave to enter the UK to pursue her appeal. It will also rule on whether her appeal should be allowed if she is refused leave to enter the UK. At the hearing in November, Begum’s lawyers said she was in al-Roj camp in northern Syria, where conditions were dire. Lord Pannick QC told the court that the Syrian Democratic Forces, which control al-Roj camp, “do not permit visits from lawyers nor do they permit detainees to speak to lawyers”. He said the case against Begum was “no more than that she travelled to Syria and ‘aligned with’” Isis, and that “it is not alleged that she fought, trained or participated in any terrorist activities, nor that she had any role” within Isis. He said that if Begum was unable return to the UK “the deprivation appeal must be allowed” because there was “no other fair or just step that can be taken”. Extracts of MI5 assessments of the dangers posed by the return of those who joined Isis were read out at the hearing. Sir James Eadie QC, for the Home Office, told the court the assessments gauged that Begum presented a serious threat “justifying the removal of her British citizenship and … the placing of serious impediments in the way of her return to the UK”. “She is assessed to pose a real and current threat to national security. She is aligned with Isis,” he said. “During the four years she has spent in Islamic State territory she had undergone radicalisation and ‘desensitisation to violence’.” The court was also told that Home Office officials declared “public sentiment is overwhelmingly hostile” toward Begum and argued that removing her British citizenship would not affect community relations. Begum, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase, then 16 and 15 respectively, boarded a flight from Gatwick to Istanbul, Turkey, on 17 February 2015, before making their way to Raqqa in Syria. The three schoolgirls from Bethnal Green Academy left London shortly after Sharmeena Begum, who is no relation, travelled to Syria in December 2014. Begum says she married the Dutch convert Yago Riedijk 10 days after arriving in Isis territory. All three of her school friends also reportedly marryied foreign Isis fighters. She told the Times in February 2019 that she had left Raqqa in January 2017 with her husband, but her children, a one-year-old girl and a three-month-old boy, had both since died."
2021-02-19T12:00:02Z,uk-news,UK news,MI6 boss apologises for past ban on LGBT staff,"The new head of MI6 has apologised publicly to officers who were thrown out of the spy agency before 1991 when it operated a “wrong, unjust and discriminatory” ban on LGBT staff in its ranks. Richard Moore, also known as C, released a short video statement acknowledging that “committed, talented, public-spirited people had their careers and lives blighted” because they were told gay people could not serve. Problems continued after 1991, Moore acknowledged. LGBT staff who were employed when the ban ended were treated badly for not previously disclosing their sexuality, he said, and others who joined after 1991 were made to feel unwelcome. During the cold war it was believed that same-sex relationships were a risk to national security, partly because of the prejudices of the time and partly because it was thought the information could be used as a tool for blackmail. The ban persisted for nearly a quarter a century after homosexuality was decriminalised in 1967. MI6 said it was unable to say how many people had been kicked out or prevented from joining for security reasons. The practice of dismissing openly homosexual agents ran across Britain’s three spy agencies, most notably in the case of Alan Turing. The mathematician and codebreaker was forced out of GCHQ in 1952 after he was convicted for having a gay relationship. He was subjected to chemical castration and subsequently killed himself. “Because of this policy, other loyal and patriotic people had their dreams of serving their country in MI6 shattered. This was wrong, unjust and discriminatory,” Moore said in a rare video message timed to coincide with LGBT+ history month. “Today I apologise on behalf of MI6 for the way our LGBT+ colleagues and fellow citizens were treated and express my regret to those whose lives were affected. Being LGBT+ did not make these people a national security threat. Of course not.”
The agency is keen to shed James Bond or Oxbridge images of its agents in the belief it badly needs people who can operate effectively around the world as it focuses on Russia, China and the Middle East. On occasions in recent years it has lit up its Vauxhall headquarters in the rainbow colours of the pride flag. “We still have more to do to become a fully inclusive employer, and my goal for MI6 is to make it a workplace where you can always bring your true self to work,” Moore said. “Diversity makes us more effective; inclusion makes us stronger.” Prejudice against gay men in the secret service may have been heightened in part by a series of cold war spy scandals. The Cambridge Spy Ring, a group of agents and diplomats who passed information to the Soviet Union during the second world war, included two gay men, Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt. A third, Donald MacLean, was bisexual. It was routinely suggested that homosexual men in the secret service could not be trusted, a prejudice solidified by the case of the gay civil servant John Vassall, who was caught in a ‘honey trap’ sprung by the Soviet secret service in 1962. He was blackmailed into passing secrets to the Soviet Union and as a result sentenced to 18 years’ imprisonment for espionage. The Ministry of Defence said earlier this week that it would allow former serving personnel to reclaim any medals taken from them when they were kicked out of the armed forces for being homosexual. The military’s bar on LGBT people serving ran until 2000. The MoD action was criticised for not going far enough because it did not address issues such as criminal convictions, lost ranks and pension rights or compensation. Nor did Moore’s apology on behalf of MI6 refer to any form of redress. Moore said he decided to act after his first meeting with MI6’s LGBT+ staff group when he took over in the autumn. “They said, look, this is outstanding, in our view. We’ve never had an apology for the hurt and distress caused to so many people.” He added: “That resonated very strongly with me.” The spy chief was speaking in a short video discussion with the actor and gay rights campaigner Sir Ian McKellen. The actor said he believed it was worthwhile for MI6 to make an apology even if “some people will see it as late in the day”, arguing that “symbols do matter”."
2021-02-19T11:58:59Z,uk-news,UK news,Asylum seeker brings case against Covid 'curfew' at London hotel,"Asylum seekers in hotels are being subjected to false imprisonment and a 23-hour a day curfew, according to a legal challenge lodged in the high court. An asylum seeker, who cannot be named, has launched judicial review proceedings against the home secretary, Priti Patel, challenging the “curfew”. He says there is no legal basis for the restrictions, which amount to false imprisonment and deprivation of liberty in breach of the European convention on human rights. The high court has given the Home Office until 4pm on Friday to file a response to the claim. Solicitors from Matthew Gold, who are bringing the legal challenge, say they are aware of at least 11 hotels imposing this type of restriction, including the one the asylum seeker bringing the case is in. Ten are in London. The asylum seeker in the case was moved into the hotel in mid-January. He says he has been told that if he is absent for more than an hour a day doing exercise and essential food shopping he will be reported to the Home Office, and that it could damage his right to accommodation and his asylum claim. Security guards at the door ask questions about where the asylum seekers are going, enforce a rule that they sign in and out, and check their bags when they return. Coronavirus lockdown rules do not restrict the amount of time each day that people can leave home for to do exercise or essential shopping. The asylum seeker bringing the case fled persecution, which included state detention and abuse. He says the enforcement of the curfew is a traumatic reminder of what happened to him in his home country. The Guardian has seen a letter received by other asylum seekers accommodated at a London hotel threatening to call 999 if they are found to be breaking the rules about leaving the hotel. Hotels have been targeted by supporters of the far right who claim asylum seekers are living a life of luxury there. Reading Healthwatch published a report in November examining the situation of 80 asylum seekers accommodated in a hotel in the city. It found that some had experienced unsafe breaks in medication such as insulin after being moved to the area from other parts of the UK. Some of the asylum seekers at the hotel recently embarked on a hunger strike in protest at conditions, including food which they said was inedible.
Much of the asylum-seeker hotel accommodation is in London. A recent internal report from a London council seen by the Guardian said that 6,212 asylum seekers were accommodated in 54 hotels in 23 boroughs. The council inspected some of the hotels in its area and raised concerns about the size of rooms and the quality and choice of food, especially for families. In one hotel inspectors found a shortage of water, toiletries, poor food, poor hygiene and mice in the rooms. The charity West London Welcome has also highlighted the poor food received by asylum seekers in hotels. Rachel Etheridge, of Matthew Gold solicitors, said: “There is no lawful or moral justification for imposing restrictions on the lives of asylum seekers which are more stringent than those being applied to the wider population.
“We call on the secretary of state to stop her accommodation providers from continuing with this practice which is negatively impacting on the many asylum seekers who have come to this country seeking sanctuary from state abuse with an expectation of fair treatment.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The government has a statutory duty to provide accommodation to asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute – the accommodation is safe and secure and they receive three nutritious meals a day – this is all funded by the taxpayer. “Asylum seekers in hotel accommodation are not detained – they are free to come and go as they please but of course, like everyone else in the UK, they must comply with the Covid restrictions.”"
2021-02-19T11:14:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Digested week: the soundtrack of this pandemic is teeth grinding,"Monday Virus numbers are down in New York, while the positivity rate remains high – hovering at 8% – bringing new safety guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control. If you can’t find an N95-grade mask, says the CDC, try double-masking: putting a cloth mask over a disposable medical one, with a wire pin to close the gap over your nose. It’s no hardship to wear a mask after a year of conditioning. It offers protection against the cold and permits one to scowl undetected in public. Two layers, however – or a single layer containing two filters – brings on panicky feelings of claustrophobia. It’s one thing to breathe through flimsy fabric that doubles up as a chin warmer, and another to feel the weight of multiple layers between you and every gasp of fresh air. There’s no getting around it. Until everyone is vaccinated, masks remain, along with social distancing, the best break on transmission. But we’re getting tired, and sloppy, and mask etiquette is getting grosser. On the street, pale blue medical masks flutter against every fence and clog every drain. I catch my children surreptitiously blowing their noses in theirs – “Mum! There’s a booger in my mask!” – and on one occasion, my daughter sucking the fabric until I screamed at her to desist. Meanwhile, entire friendships have been formed – in my case with the mums of my children’s new classmates – whose entire faces I’ve never seen, and who’ve never seen me or my kids unmasked. It’s a weird, weird side-effect of the pandemic that we couldn’t pick each other out in a line up.
Tuesday It’s a fear up there with losing my wallet or leaving the stove on: that I’ll make a typo in the course of paying a bill online and transfer money I don’t have to someone I don’t know. So it was that on Tuesday it was possible, almost, to feel pity for Citibank, when a judge in Manhattan ruled against it in its struggle to recover – oops – $500m (£357m), wired in error to some dastardly hedge funds. It could’ve been worse. The original sum accidentally sent over was a whopping $900m, but some of the hedge funds returned the money. All were creditors of the cosmetics giant Revlon, to whom Citibank agreed, in 2016, to act as a loan agent and in which capacity it was attempting to make a scheduled interest payment of a trifling $7.8m. Instead, by mistake, it sent the cohort of hedge-fund lenders $893m, the entire balance of the loan and a sum not due until 2023. The banker in question, said Citibank, had made a processing error they blamed on complicated tech rather than what is known within banking as a “fat-finger mistake” – a clumsy mashing of the keys resulting in the wrong command going through. The hedge funds weren’t buying it, and excerpts of their glee in the aftermath of the error were read out in court. “I feel really bad for the person that fat-fingered a $900m payment,” joked a vice-president at one company. “How was work, today, honey? It was OK, except I accidentally sent $900m out to people who weren’t supposed to have it.” What happened next was, in Citibank’s sober version, that attempts by the bank to recover the money “encountered resistance”, or as the hedge-funders said jokingly to each other in text messages at the time: “We have not paid the money back :)” Six months later, you can still hear the echoing high fives. The US district judge Jesse Furman ruled on Tuesday that the wire transfers of 11 August 2020 were “final and complete transactions, not subject to revocation”, before calling the accident “a banking error of perhaps unprecedented nature and magnitude”. It was a stunning verdict. And while it’s true that, were I to overpay my Citibank mortgage by $900m, I wouldn’t fancy my chances of getting it back, I do wonder with vague sympathy about the fate of the guy with the fat fingers.
Wednesday Every friend in every neighbourhood has noticed it, a tiny rip in the social fabric of New York represented by a huge increase in dog poop. It’s everywhere, volumes of the stuff. The snow always makes it worse – selfish owners not wanting to prolong their walks to pick up after their dogs – but this predates the winter storms, reaching back to last summer and beyond. It’s never been this bad in the city before. It has, surely, to do with the pandemic. The ways in which we have all given up are generally confined to personal grooming, but for people with dogs, perhaps that defeat has extended to pet care. With civic authorities strained in other directions and the pandemic downsizing everything else to no big deal, it becomes a question of what, precisely, you can get away with. A friend in Brooklyn spots a woman making off after her dog takes a massive shit outside his building, and opening a window, yells down: “Do you need a bag?” Seamlessly, she yells back: “Yes please! I forgot mine!” – and after he throws down a bag, she cleans up the mess. No breach of politeness occurs, nor is it acknowledged at any point that he’s caught her in the act of being an arsehole. “I wonder,” he says later, “if I should have been ruder?” Thursday Before Christmas, my dentist told me that tooth fractures were up, brought on by the stress of the pandemic. Now the New York Times throws its weight behind the issue to look into what’s going on with “bruxism” – the dental term for grinding and gritting that, it reports, is so severe in some patients they can grind down with a 250lb (113kg) force. There’s a discussion around whether or not mouth guards work or if counselling is the key, given that grinding is largely behavioural. In most houses, I suspect, beyond the immediate needs of the patient, what’s required are good earplugs. Until the early hours when, without fail, my daughter sleepwalks into my room, I can hear her through the wall grinding her teeth. Then she lies down next to me and saws away peacefully for the rest of the night.
Friday The trailer dropped this week for Cruella, the new live action Disney movie and origin story of Cruella de Vil, Dodie Smith’s villain from 101 Dalmatians. It follows in the footsteps of Wicked, which redeems the Wicked Witch of the West, Maleficent, which does the same for Sleeping Beauty’s wicked stepmother, and even Nurse Ratched, presently receiving sympathetic treatment in Ryan Murphy’s TV show of the same name. Untitled Lizzie Borden Project can’t be far off a green light. I’m fond of the 1996 movie version of 101 Dalmatians, in which raccoons gambol through Hyde Park and – my children’s favourite bit – Hugh Laurie gets electrocuted climbing over a fence. Judging by the trailer, Emma Stone will be both more winsome and much posher than Glenn Close’s original Cruella, and what more heavenly diversion during lockdown’s darkest hour: a heroine in a fright wig brandishing an accent leftover from The Favourite, part Pennywise the Clown, part Edith Evans."
2021-02-18T18:58:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Prince Philip to spend third night in hospital for 'observation and rest',"The Duke of Edinburgh is expected to remain in hospital for a third night following his admittance on Tuesday after feeling unwell at Windsor Castle. Prince Philip was taken to the King Edward VII’s hospital in central London as a “precautionary measure”. Sources said it was not Covid related. There were no reports of any visitors arriving at the private hospital on Thursday. Buckingham Palace previously said he was expected to remain “for a few days of observation and rest”. No update on his condition has been given. Philip, who will celebrate his 100th birthday on 10 June, was a non-emergency admission, travelling to the hospital by car, and was said to have been in good spirits and to have walked into the hospital unaided. He and the Queen, who have spent the pandemic together at Windsor Castle, both received their Covid-19 jabs in January.
He spent four nights in the same hospital in December 2019, where he was treated for a “pre-existing condition” and discharged on Christmas Eve. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, is among those to have sent their best wishes for his recovery. The Queen has remained at Windsor Castle. Buckingham Palace said in a statement issued on Wednesday: “His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh was admitted to King Edward VII’s hospital in London on Tuesday evening. “The duke’s admission is a precautionary measure, on the advice of His Royal Highness’s doctor, after feeling unwell. “The duke is expected to remain in hospital for a few days of observation and rest.”"
2021-02-18T18:33:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Man who killed wife 'in act of great violence' jailed for five years,"Domestic violence campaigners have raised concerns over the leniency of a five-year jail sentence given to a man who strangled his wife days into the first coronavirus lockdown. Anthony Williams, 70, who was on Monday found not guilty of murder, appeared for sentencing at Swansea crown court after admitting manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. The judge, Paul Thomas, said it was a “tragic case on several levels”, but in his view Williams’ mental state was “severely affected at the time”. “The overwhelming greatest tragedy here is a lady of 67, who had so much to live for, had her life ended by an act of great violence at the hands, literally, of a man she loved for very nearly 50 years,” the judge said. With the maximum possible sentence for manslaughter running to potential life imprisonment, women’s rights campaigners said they were shocked by the sentence passed down to Williams. A spokeswoman for Welsh Women’s Aid said that the service had seen an increase in demand during the pandemic, adding that the pandemic and lockdown must not be used to justify or excuse abuse. “We are shocked by the leniency in this case and a precedent must not be set that allows domestic homicide to be an inevitable result of the current restrictions,” the spokeswoman said. “Domestic homicides often follow years of coercive and controlling abuse and it is vital this is understood by all in our justice system. We have seen an explosion of domestic abuse during the pandemic with increased severity of abuse experienced by callers to our Live Fear Free helpline. “Our justice system must ensure that it takes all action necessary to hold perpetrators to account.” Ruth Williams, a retired supermarket worker, was found slumped with a set of keys in her hand in the porch of her home in Cwmbran, south Wales, on the morning of 28 March last year. A postmortem examination found that she had suffered haemorrhaging in her eyes, face and mouth, consistent with strangulation, and that her neck was fractured in five places. Her cause of death was given as pressure to the neck, with a pathologist saying the lack of a ligature mark did not rule out use of a “soft” dressing gown cord found at their home. In transcripts of police interviews read out in his trial, Williams admitted to detectives that he “literally choked the living daylights” out of his wife. He said he had found lockdown “really hard” just five days into the UK-wide restrictions and felt depressed, and told police he had attacked his wife after she told him to “get over it”. Dr Alison Witts, a psychiatrist, told the trial Williams’ anxiety and depressive illness were “heightened” by the coronavirus measures and impaired his ability to exercise self-control. But another psychiatrist, Dr Damian Gamble, said Williams had no documented history of suffering a depressive illness and had “no psychiatric defences” available to him, saying he believed Williams “knew what he was doing at the time”. After the sentencing, Jane Monckton Smith, a criminologist whose work focuses on intimate partner homicide, said she had received reports that such killings were on the rise, doubling at points during the past year. “The excuses are pretty similar, based on a crime of passion, mental health justification for what they have done, but there is always a trackable history of problems,” Monckton Smith, who works closely with police, said. She urged caution over defences such as that given by Williams. “To say that the lockdown is causing men to kill their wives is not accurate … [it] is making already unstable people more volatile. Lockdown can certainly act as a trigger to make them more volatile, but it’s not causing it.” • This article was amended on 19 February 2021 because Alison Witts and Damian Gamble were described as psychologists instead of psychiatrists.

2021-02-18T18:21:37Z,uk-news,UK news,"Hedge fund manager groped banker 'like an octopus', court hears","A multimillionaire hedge fund manager groped a junior banker “like an octopus” during an alleged assault at his Chelsea home, a court has heard. The banker said she was warned by colleagues she would be fired if she complained about the incident. Crispin Odey, 62, has acknowledged propositioning a then 26-year-old banker in 1998 after inviting her to his home, but has denied indecently assaulting her. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told Hendon magistrates court that Odey had put his hand down her shirt to touch her breast and reached up her skirt, after inviting her back to his house following a work meeting at his office in Grosvenor Square, central London. The complainant, who now lives in the US, told the court the following day she informed three senior colleagues at the bank, which cannot be named to protect her identity. She said: “They said, ‘You will be fired … nothing will come of this. You will lose your job’.” In his statement to police, one of the men said: “She was upset and felt that Odey had taken advantage of her. I didn’t know how serious it was and what exactly had happened.” Giving evidence, he said: “The impression was something inappropriate had happened, but she didn’t tell us anything more than that in terms of what had happened, so there was a sort of spectrum of possibilities. “There was no suggestion that anything was necessarily so serious that action need be taken forthwith. “I think if that was the case the three of us, even though we weren’t management, would’ve taken action unilaterally ourselves.” Odey, who was 39 at the time, denies any physical contact with the woman, who was a junior employee at a well-known investment bank of which he was a client. Under cross-examination the complainant said: “He was next to me. It was sort of like an octopussy-type manoeuvre. “The first thing I remember was actually on my back. Then, it was like a scramble of hands – it was like a groping event is the only way to describe it. “The very first thing was the hand on my back. I can’t remember the exact sequence, I just remember the general attempt to get involved with my body and on top of me with his hands. Odey’s lawyer, Crispin Aylett QC, asked: “Is it the case this didn’t happen at all and that’s why you can’t remember the choreography?” The woman replied: “Well, we disagree on that.” She also disagreed when the barrister suggested that Odey “didn’t touch you in any way at all in a sexual sense” inside the house. The court also heard from a former boyfriend and ex-colleague who the woman called after leaving Odey’s home. He said she was “very upset” when she arrived at his flat, adding: “She was crying and when I asked details of what had got her so upset, she clammed up and then was very emotional. “I suggested if anything untoward had happened she should go and report it to police. “I think the reaction that she gave me where she didn’t want to talk about what happened made me think something not very nice had happened.” Taking him through his police witness statement, the prosecutor Kerry Broome said the man had “presumed at the time Crispin Odey had tried it on with her”. He replied: “Yes, that’s correct.” The trial continues."
2021-02-18T18:04:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Northern Ireland firms optimistic Brexit barriers will be eased,"Business leaders in Northern Ireland are optimistic that Brexit barriers preventing parcels, pets, potatoes and plants getting to the region from Britain will be eased after a meeting between Michael Gove and his EU counterpart, MaroÅ¡ Å efÄ�oviÄ�, on Thursday. They said the UK and the EU had a legitimate reason to remove or ease the barriers because they were having an impact on daily lives, in breach of a pledge in the Northern Ireland protocol that states the â€œapplication of this protocol should impact as little as possible on the everyday life of communities in both Ireland and Northern Irelandâ€�. In a joint statement Gove and Å efÄ�oviÄ� said they had a constructive meeting that would help guide the UK-EU joint committee, which they confirmed would meet on 24 February.
Sefcovic told the BBC he was â€œready to move fastâ€� but he did not want to overpromise. The interruption to supermarket and parcel deliveries in the first few weeks of January and the continued refusal of some high street chains to deliver in Northern Ireland have heightened tensions among loyalists and are beginning to fuel resentment among the wider population. Roger Pollen, the head of the regionâ€™s Federation of Small Business, said they told Gove and Å efÄ�oviÄ�, who chair the UK-EU joint committee tasked with implementing the Brexit agreement, there was a real sense of urgency about resolving the issues.
â€œThe trouble with things like the parcels issue is that it starts to build up a lot of resentment on the street and when people here are experiencing the â€˜not available in Northern Irelandâ€™ then the protocol is having an impact on the life of communities,â€� he said. Business leaders said they were pleasantly surprised by the understanding shown by Gove and Å efÄ�oviÄ� following weeks of problems involving garden centres, supermarkets and municipal tree planting. It emerged on Wednesday that orders for 100,000 trees from Scotland and Wales had to be cancelled because of a ban on British soil and EU prohibitions on imports of native trees including oak. â€œThe messages that we are working as hard as we can, but that we need support to make it work, really seemed to resonate with both of them,â€� said AodhÃ¡n Connolly, the director of Northern Irelandâ€™s retail consortium. â€œThey were positive about everything that we put forward which was very disarming. Theyâ€™ve given a genuine commitment to work with us.â€� Among the four demands business leaders made was an extension to the April grace period for supermarket and parcel deliveries from Great Britain without customs declarations. A second grace period for chilled meats, including sausages, entering Northern Ireland without health checks expires in July, and business leaders are urging the EU and the UK to reconsider the issue entirely.
Stephen Kelly, the chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland, said there appeared to be a clear understanding that the UK and the EU needed to be active on the ground to ensure the protocol worked. The appointment of David Frost as the new Brexit minister was not raised at the meeting, but Kelly said it was imperative he got to grips with the unique issues Northern Ireland presented as he succeeded Gove as co-chair of the joint committee. â€œA massive amount of time has been spent on making sure politicians in London understand the requirement for fixes. Thereâ€™s obviously going to be a change of guards in terms of the new minister responsible for these issues and itâ€™s important that they grasp those concerns as quickly as Michael Gove grasped them,â€� he said. Apart from an extension to the grace periods, business leaders have called for measures to provide certainty through long-term solutions, the simplification of border checks and mitigation to prevent costs for business and consumers in Northern Ireland rising, which they say would be discriminatory in the single UK market. A senior member of the Orange Order was among the civic leaders invited to a second meeting with the UK and EU Brexit leaders. Beforehand, Mervyn Gibson said he would be telling them the protocol must go."
2021-02-18T17:53:44Z,uk-news,UK news,City of London scraps plan for 'Tate Modern of classical music',"An ambitious £288m concert hall that was supposed to be “the Tate Modern of classical music” has been scrapped by the City of London Corporation, which said the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic made the plan impossible to complete. The Centre for Music was billed as being an acoustically perfect 2,000-seat concert hall for the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) and would have had restaurants, commercial space and a smaller venue for jazz performances.
The City of London confirmed on Thursday, however, that the project had been axed. “Members of the City of London Corporation’s policy and resources today agreed that, given the current unprecedented circumstances, plans for a centre for music will not be progressed,” a spokesperson said. “Alternative proposals for the site, currently occupied by the Museum of London, will be brought forward over the coming months.” Serious doubts about the venue’s future began to circulate when the LSO’s conductor, Simon Rattle, announced in January that he was leaving the organisation to move to the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra in 2023 for personal reasons. Rattle was one of the driving forces behind the project, which he said would be the “great concert hall for our time” and would put London on the same level as other European cities with major landmark halls that have world-class acoustics. The New York-based architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro had already revealed their designs for the centre, which the Guardian’s architecture critic, Oliver Wainwright, described as “a faceted ziggurat, rising from the roundabout site of the current Museum of London as an angular glass beacon”. The decision will be another huge blow to an orchestral world already reeling from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic that has left performers and venues out of work and in doubt about when audiences will be able to return. Funding for the project has always been controversial, with critics and figures within government saying a concert hall of that scale and cost was not needed. The government pulled its funding for the project in 2016. The former chancellor George Osborne initially backed the scheme and spent £5.5m on a detailed business case, but his successors decided it was too costly. At the time, a spokesperson for Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, called the decision to pull the money “a vote of no confidence in London from the government”. The City of London announced additional funding for the project in March last year, which took its investment up to £6.8m. It said no public subsidy would be required for the centre’s running costs, but the private donations that were supposed to make up the huge shortfall in funding failed to materialise. The loss of the venue will be a blow to those who feel London is still without a venue to rival those in cities such as Paris and Hamburg, which have spent heavily on controversial and over-budget concert halls. It will also leave classical musicians and technical staff without crucial work, as many struggle with post-Brexit visa rules when applying for work in the EU. The City of London also announced it would invest in the Barbican Centre and “upgrade the 40-year-old complex”. It said the search for a world-class architect-led team to lead the project would be launched later this year."
2021-02-18T16:54:57Z,uk-news,UK news,North of England leaders fear region faces 'cheap and nasty' rail alternative,"Leaders in the north of England fear that a new £39bn railway line could be scaled back, with the region ending up with a “cheap and nasty” alternative instead. The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and others are concerned that the government wants to water down plans to build Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR), which is supposed to halve journey times in the region. Currently, travelling coast to coast by train in the north can take longer than getting from Leeds to Paris by rail. Burnham told a meeting on Thursday that the people of the north of England “will not forgive us” if their leaders did not fight against the region being palmed off with a “cut-price railway in the north and a fully funded railway everywhere else”.
Sometimes described as “Crossrail for the north” – a nod to London’s vastly delayed, £18.7bn line – a properly funded NPR would be “the single most important infrastructure project in the north-west in the 21st century and potentially the most significant rail intervention in our region since the Rainhill trials, which led to the development of the world’s first passenger rail line between Liverpool and Manchester almost 200 years ago”, according to Steve Rotheram, the metro mayor of the Liverpool city region. Burnham said the leaders had a duty to ensure NPR was built in full, describing it as a decision that would “define the north of England for the rest of this century, and indeed, the one afterwards”. The business case for NPR was due to be signed off and published in March by Transport for the North (TfN), the statutory body set up to advise the government on the north’s transport needs. It would endorse a new line from Liverpool to Leeds via Warrington, Bradford and Manchester airport, and upgrades of lines to Sheffield, Hull and Newcastle. Leaders in the Liverpool city region are already concerned that government officials are trying to cut costs on their leg of NPR in what it calls the “minimum viable network”. In a letter sent to Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, on Thursday, Rotheram and others accuse him of favouring a “cheap and nasty” old route previously used to ferry coal to a power station, instead of investing in a new line. Using that route would go “nowhere near the original NPR vision of 20 minutes [travel time] between both [Liverpool and Manchester] cities”, the letter argues. At a meeting of the TfN board on Thursday, the leaders were told the government had asked for all discussions of the “preferred way forward for NPR” to be held in private, excluding the public and media.
Last week the government wrote to TfN to ask it to delay publishing its NPR “strategic outline business case” until it had published its own “integrated rail plan”. The leaders worry this will allow the government to dismiss the most ambitious elements of NPR by saying they are incompatible with its national plan. “Our voice is being marginalised just at the critical moment, and our ambitions are being downgraded at the same time,” Burnham said. He added: “I think we’re in danger of being sidelined at the worst possible moment … It feels as though the [transport] department is slowly turning down the volume on TfN’s voice and most possibly getting ready to pull the plug.” Rotheram said the move was typical of the “recent and ongoing neutering of many of the things that we would like to do”. However, the leaders reluctantly agreed at the meeting that they had a “statutory duty” to do what the government wanted and delay the publishing of its NPR business case."
2021-02-18T15:50:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Hercules Mulligan: US revolutionary to be Northern Ireland tourist attraction,"Hercules Mulligan, the 18th-century tailor, spy and US revolutionary, is soon to become a Northern Ireland tourist attraction. The emigrant who helped clinch America’s independence by spying on British officers and reputedly saving the life of George Washington has been honoured in his native land. The Causeway Coast and Glens borough council has decided to recognise Mulligan in heritage trails, a rather modest tribute but one that reflects renewed fascination with his exploits two centuries ago. Mulligan, was born in Coleraine, County Derry, in 1740 and as a boy moved with his family to New York. In the 1770s he sided with those resisting British rule and used his job as a tailor to gather intelligence from British officers who discussed military operations while being fitted for uniforms. Some historians credit Mulligan with twice saving Washington from capture and execution and with helping the rebel forces to defeat the troops of King George III. Mulligan is said to have toppled a statue of the king that was melted down to make 40,000 bullets. He was also a mentor to Alexander Hamilton, one of the founding fathers of the United States. “It wasn’t reluctance to acknowledge his role in defeating the British in the war of independence that prevented Hercules Mulligan being honoured before now, but the fact that few people on this side of the Atlantic had ever heard of him,” said the Belfast Telegraph. Mulligan was largely forgotten until the AMC period drama series Turn: Washington’s Spies, and the musical Hamilton, in which he was played by the actor Okieriete Onaodowan. Alan McClarty, the son of the late independent unionist MLA David McClarty, suggested to Yvonne Boyle, an Alliance party councillor with the Causeway Coast and Glens borough council, that the council celebrate Mulligan. A plaque would have cost £1,200 and taken at least two years so the council’s leisure and development committee voted to recognise the local son in future heritage trails. “Although we are in a pandemic, arts and heritage are still important so we have something to look forward to,” said Boyle. Not everyone is thrilled. Mulligan supported the abolition of slavery but census data suggests he owned a slave. “Maybe the Broadway show … has clouded people’s minds to the real Mulligan,” Stephen McCracken, a member of the history group Limavady Area Ancestry, told the news site Derry Now."
2021-02-18T15:15:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Body of woman found after house collapse in Greater Manchester,"The body of a 61-year-old woman has been found at the scene of a collapsed house in Bury, Greater Manchester. Emergency services were called just before 9.30pm on Wednesday, after reports that a house had collapsed in Summerseat, near Ramsbottom. Three people were treated at the scene by paramedics for minor injuries, while a woman and child were also taken to hospital with minor injuries. The cause of the collapse has not yet been established. A spokesperson for Greater Manchester police (GMP) said: “Officers responding to reports of a collapsed house in Ramsbottom have sadly found the body of a woman. “Five properties were evacuated as a precaution and a small scene remains in place. Inquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances surrounding this incident.” Although formal identification of the body found has not taken place yet, police say they believe they know who the woman is, and her family are being supported. An earlier police report mistakingly said the woman was 79. One local resident told the Manchester Evening News they believed the collapse was the result of an explosion, and assisted emergency services in evacuating residents.
They said: “It was a loud bang. I got as far as the water pump and emergency services were already on scene. I thought there was going to be another explosion and that’s why we needed to evacuate. “I was allowed through and started to clear every building up to the football pitch to get them down to the garden centre. We then got residents back to their own property once it was safe.” Greater Manchester fire and rescue service said it had dispatched three fire engines and a number of support units to the scene. A joint investigation is under way between Greater Manchester police, Greater Manchester fire rescue service and Bury local authority partners to establish the circumstances of the incident. Steve Wilcock, the incident commander at the scene on behalf of Greater Manchester fire and rescue service (GMFRS), said: “I want to first pass on my condolences to the family and friends of the woman who tragically lost her life at this incident – our thoughts are with them at what must be an incredibly sad and difficult time. “Given the nature of this scene, I must also praise the professionalism and dedication of the firefighters who have worked here all night in the driving rain, as well as throughout the morning. An investigation is now under way so it would not be appropriate to speculate at this time on a probable cause. “It’s also important to place on record our appreciation for the help and cooperation of local people. Summerseat is a close-knit community and there has been an outpouring of support, with many neighbours offering their homes to those evacuated from roughly 20 houses last night. I am proud to serve this community and GMFRS, GMP, Bury council and other partner agencies will continue to work really hard today to do the best by local people without compromising the scene.” A spokesperson for GMFRS said it was too early to determine the cause of the explosion."
2021-02-18T14:39:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Ex-police chief loses appeal over child abuse video on phone,"An appeal by a decorated former police chief against her conviction for having a child abuse video on her phone has been refused by the court of appeal. The former superintendent Robyn Williams was convicted in November 2019 after being sent an unsolicited video via WhatsApp of a child being abused, despite never viewing the images. The prosecution accepted she had no sexual interest in children, but she was sentenced to 200 hours of community service for possession of an indecent image. The conviction led to her fast-track sacking by the Metropolitan police, ending a 36-year career during which she had been hailed as a role model, commended for her work after the Grenfell Tower fire and awarded the Queen’s Police Medal. Williams’s barrister, Anesta Weekes QC, told the court there was “not even a suggestion” her client had watched the 54-second video. But the appeal was rejected by Dame Victoria Sharp, sitting with Mr Justice Sweeney and Mrs Justice Ellenbogen. Williams had been sent the clip by her older sister Jennifer Hodge, 57, who had originally been sent it by her long-term boyfriend, 63-year-old Dido Massivi. The convictions of all three under paedophilia laws were upheld. Sharp said: “The applications made on behalf of all three appellants in this case are refused for reasons which will be handed down later.” Weekes told the appeal court that the case against Williams, 56, at trial was that “there was a clear image and you were looking at a thumbnail for some 12 seconds, so you must have seen that indecent image”. But she said experts were not able to properly examine Williams’s phone, adding: “There is an element of unfairness here if you do not even have the very phone and you cannot demonstrate on the phone … how clear it [the thumbnail] would be.” Richard Wright QC, for the crown, said: “The experts were plainly not giving evidence about what Ms Williams did see. They were giving evidence about what was present on her phone to be seen and that was the central issue in the case and one which required expert evidence to reconstruct the thumbnail, its clarity, its size and how it would have appeared in the absence of the original thumbnail.” Hodge, of Brent in north-west London, was found guilty of distributing an indecent image of a child, actions she told the court were intended to find the abuser responsible, and was sentenced to 100 hours of community service. Massivi, also of Brent, was convicted of two counts of distributing an indecent photograph of a child, and one count of possessing an extreme pornographic image portraying a person having sex with a horse."
2021-02-18T13:03:44Z,uk-news,UK news,'6.2cm-tall man' offered priority Covid vaccine after NHS blunder,"A 32-year-old man with no underlying health conditions was offered a Covid vaccine early because of a blunder at his GP surgery which recorded him as being 6.2cm tall, giving him an astonishing body mass index (BMI) of 28,000. The Liverpool Echoâ€™s political editor, Liam Thorp, said he was left â€œreally confusedâ€� after he was offered the jab this week seemingly ahead of the governmentâ€™s rollout plan, and shared the â€œfrankly surrealâ€� experience in a Twitter thread which quickly went viral. Manchester Evening News politics and investigations editor, Jennifer Williams, replied: â€œShould they not have been in touch before to see how the man the size of a thumb was getting on?â€� And palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke said: â€œThis, for me, is the single best tweet of the entire pandemic, Liam. And may I please commend your decency in not exploiting your remarkable BMI to jump the queue?â€�
After his initial surprise at the invitation, Thorp said he was under the impression you should accept an invitation and book an appointment but later felt â€œuneasyâ€� about the situation, especially with so many vulnerable people yet to be vaccinated. Under-50s with no underlying health conditions are the final group on the governmentâ€™s priority list and are not expected to be offered the vaccine until the summer.
After ringing his GP to ask if there had been a mistake, Thorp was told he had been placed in priority group six because of his weight. Writing in the Echo, he said that despite being â€œon the chunky side, I wouldnâ€™t have thought of myself as clinically obese (even after lockdown)â€�. After â€œsome serious soul-searchingâ€� and a revision of Pancake Day plans, Thorp was called back by the surgery the next day. â€œWhat followed was one of the most bizarre phone conversations of my life,â€� he wrote. It transpired that his details had been put into the system incorrectly, with his height recorded as 6.2cm rather than 6ft 2ins (188cm). Combined with his weight, this had given Thorp a BMI of 28,000 â€“ roughly 1,000 times higher than the UK average â€“ which would have made him morbidly obese. â€œIâ€™m not sure how he kept it together when he told me this,â€� he wrote.
â€œIf I had been less stunned, I would have asked why no one was more concerned that a man of these remarkable dimensions was slithering around south Liverpool. But he was very apologetic and really nice and I think he was just relieved that I found it so funny.â€� Thorp also shared a hilarious interaction with his mother after he shared the mishap on Twitter. â€œWhen I told my mum I had been classed in the clinically obese category, she said: â€˜Well perhaps this is the wake-up call you needâ€™.â€� Thorp said the mix-up showed how important it was for people to check if they feel they may have been invited for the jab by mistake.
The NHS Liverpool clinical commissioning group said it was â€œgratefulâ€� to Thorp for checking with his GP. Its chair, Dr Fiona Lemmens, said: â€œI can see the funny side of this story but also recognise there is an important issue for us to address.â€�"
2021-02-18T12:58:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Irish Sea border protest posters reflect loyalist anxiety in Northern Ireland ,"The anonymous and vaguely menacing posters have proliferated across Northern Ireland since the start of post-Brexit checks on food- and plant-related goods travelling from Britain. “Loyalist Markethill will never accept a border in the Irish Sea,” says one, the “never” in red capital letters. “Loyalist Rathcoole will never accept a border in the Irish Sea,” says another. There are hundreds like them bedecking lamp-posts, all neatly printed, all leaving the potential consequences of the border unstated. It is hardly an uprising but the posters reflect loyalist anxiety about Northern Ireland’s position in the UK – and the snaring of the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) in a political trap of its own making. The party of Arlene Foster, Ian Paisley and Sammy Wilson backed Brexit as a liberating new dawn but now finds itself demoralised and disoriented by the Northern Ireland protocol, the part of the Brexit deal that keeps the region aligned with EU rules while the rest of the UK goes its own way. Some unionists fear the disruption in food supplies since it came into effect in January is the start of a process that will tilt Northern Ireland away from Britain and towards Ireland, a fate they have resisted since Northern Ireland’s foundation a century ago. Others consider such concerns overblown and think the protocol is purely about trade and could be made to work with political will.
“This is not a mass mobilisation of the pro-union community against the protocol. Most are thinking: ‘Can this be fixed?’ Those in business are thinking: ‘How may this benefit the economy?’” said Peter Shirlow, a director at the University of Liverpool’s Institute of Irish Studies and an authority on unionism. In this moment of crisis, the DUP is hamstrung. It appears unwilling to make the new arrangements work or to lead a full-throated charge to overturn them. Its fingerprints are on the protocol. The party backed leave in the 2016 referendum, sank Theresa May, and put its trust in Boris Johnson, only for the prime minister to betray his allies in Northern Ireland and agree to a de facto border in the Irish Sea. In January, Foster, the party’s leader and Northern Ireland’s first minister, seemed reconciled to the new reality. She played down the political implications and mooted the benefits of privileged access to EU markets. Alarm among core DUP voters, and the EU’s blunder in briefly moving to trigger article 16, prompted a U-turn. Foster launched a campaign to scrap the arrangements and said the DUP would boycott all engagements with the Irish government on matters relating to the protocol. It will press its case in a House of Commons debate on Monday.
But Downing Street and the European commission have shrugged off the campaign and reiterated their commitment to the protocol, leaving the DUP with three unpalatable options. It could escalate its opposition to all-out defiance, with potential for paramilitaries and other shadowy elements joining the campaign to try to force London and Brussels to renegotiate the protocol. This would please hardline loyalists, but it risks backfiring. The power-sharing executive and assembly at Stormont would probably collapse, leading to elections that could result in the Alliance party siphoning more votes from the DUP and crown Sinn Féin as the biggest party, installing Michelle O’Neill as first minister, a prospect that makes unionists blanch. “Is the scrapping of the protocol more important than the continued operation of the assembly? A choice may have to be made,” Peter Robinson, a former DUP leader and party grandee, said last week in a Belfast News Letter article. The second option is to embrace the protocol – play down any constitutional implications and focus on economic benefits, as Foster briefly did before. The risk is that supporters will defect to Traditional Unionist Voice, a flintier rival that has tapped unionist anxiety and is surging in polls. The third option is to muddle along lamenting the protocol but without destabilising Stormont. Jeffrey Donaldson, the party’s leader at Westminster, appeared to keep options open in an interview with the Guardian. The protocol was hurting businesses, consumers and citizens’ rights and needed to be addressed urgently, he said. “We want to see political stability. I won’t be drawn on what steps we might take if these issues are not taken seriously. We’re not ruling any steps out at this stage. We’re clear whatever we do must be lawful.” A party insider predicted the DUP would opt for the muddle. “They don’t have good options. Bumble through is probably as close as you will get.” If so Northern Ireland is on course for a perilous, toxic stalemate, with unresolved anger over the protocol poisoning the political climate in its centenary year. “Brexit has come to dominate unionism,” said Shirlow. “They didn’t understand the repercussions of being Brexiteers.”"
2021-02-18T12:53:48Z,uk-news,UK news,"Refugee, 18, blinded in acid attack says Met delay may have cost him sight","A teenage refugee from Eritrea who was blinded in an acid attack in south London says he believes he might still be able to see if the police had acted more swiftly. The teenager, Aaron, 18 (not his real name), is speaking out for the first time. The incident happened on 7 December 2020 at about 8.10am in Thornton Heath. Aaron was walking to college with his friend Jemal, 25 (not his real name), an asylum seeker also from Eritrea. A man approached them and threw a cup of acid into their faces. Jemal received injuries to his eyes and face but was not blinded. The Metropolitan police say the suspect and the motive behind the attack are unknown. Crimestoppers has launched an appeal, offering a reward of up to £5,000 for anonymous information. The victims are receiving support from Da’aro, a youth project for young asylum seekers and refugees, which launched a crowdfund campaign to help them. The two victims say the man who threw the acid is white and they believe the attack could have been motivated by racism. Police say the man who blinded Aaron is the same person who came to his home on 7 September saying he had a letter for him. CCTV footage of that incident shows the teenager going into the street to collect the letter and being punched twice in the face by the man who had a bicycle chain wrapped around his fist. Aaron said: “I reported the first attack to the police but they didn’t catch him. If they had caught him after the first attack I would not have been blinded in the second one. I asked for help after the first attack but I didn’t get it. With the acid attack the police waited until January of this year to launch a witness appeal. I feel hopeless now.” Both victims fled persecution in Eritrea and endured difficult journeys through Libya, crossing the Mediterranean in a small boat, and spent time in Calais before finally reaching the UK and believing they were safe at last. “I didn’t know anything about acid attacks until this happened to me,” said Aaron. “We came here to save our lives,” said Jemal. “I thought this was a peaceful country where nobody would hurt us. We never expected an acid attack. We are not involved in crime. We were on our way to college to further our education when this happened. “In Eritrea we don’t have the opportunity to study because of the dictatorship,” said Aaron. “It was a long journey to the UK, I suffered a lot in Libya and in Calais. My injury is for ever. The attack was more than painful. I was completely blinded. I ran out into the road, not seeing where I was going. A man stopped his car and called the ambulance. I could hear them but couldn’t see anything.” Initially, the two victims were taken to Croydon hospital and later transferred to Chelsea and Westminster hospital’s burns unit. “My friend’s face was extremely damaged,” said Jemal. “His eyes, his nose, his hair was burned off the top half of his head. I was discharged that evening. Luckily my sight returned to my right eye, but my friend had to stay in hospital for almost one month.” Jemal added: “The biggest injury is in my heart. I worry about my friend. He’s very scared. He doesn’t feel safe to go outside. He tells me that he believes leaving his room could cost him his life. He doesn’t sleep and cries all night.” DC Dimitri Savathrakis, of the south area CID reactive team, said: “This was a violent and unprovoked attack on two innocent victims and we are doing everything in our power to bring the person responsible to justice.” The suspect is described as a white or Asian male, of slim build, who wore a black hooded jacket, dark coloured trousers and shoes or boots. On each occasion he was wearing a light blue medical mask and a dark coloured baseball cap. Aaron appealed to his attacker to hand himself in to police and said he would not feel safe until the man was caught. “Please go to the police and admit to what you have done,” he said. When asked why there had been a delay in launching a witness appeal after the acid attack, a Met spokesperson said: “After exhausting a number of avenues of inquiries a decision was made to issue a witness appeal. There is no evidence at this time to suggest it was a racially motivated attack, but we keep an open mind as to motive. Following inquiries, officers are confident the attacker in the first and second incident is the same person.” Anyone with information can contact Crimestoppers UK or call 0800 555 111. The reward of up to £5,000 is on offer for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the acid attack."
2021-02-18T06:00:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Budget to provide fresh Covid rescue package as tax rises deferred,"Rishi Sunak’s March budget will be a fresh Covid rescue package that will defer plans for significant tax increases as the chancellor throws his weight behind a cautious approach to reopening the economy, government sources have confirmed. Boris Johnson signalled on Wednesday that the government would take a slow path towards reopening hospitality, which could mean pubs and restaurants are not able to serve customers without restrictions on groups until June or July. Even then, venues are likely to need to continue to have social distancing measures in place. The budget will now be dominated by measures to protect jobs and shore up support for shuttered sectors. With the vaccination programme proceeding rapidly, Sunak had hoped to be able to focus on rebuilding the economy for the long term and helping businesses to expand and take on more workers. But the Treasury and No 10 are in agreement that easing lockdown restrictions must be sustainable – which Johnson has repeatedly stressed means a gradual shift towards reopening, with schools coming first. Treasury modelling experts have been helping Cabinet Office officials with the task of analysing the potential impact of different reopening plans. Unlike last year, when Sunak was among those keenest to push for key sectors to be reopened, allies say he now believes the best thing for the economy is to avoid a stop-start. “The thing that makes the biggest difference to the economy is it being sustainable,” said a Whitehall source. Sources now say the budget is likely to echo Sunak’s autumn “plan for jobs”, extending key support schemes such as furlough and the business interruption loans, which are due to close at the end of next month.
Proposals for an online sales tax to penalise firms that have flourished during the pandemic are unlikely to feature, with the Treasury now prepared to allow more time for international efforts to tax tech giants more fairly. Donald Trump’s White House had previously blocked progress by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on developing a common approach. A government source said: “The budget won’t be about that stuff, it’s going to have to be about protecting jobs.” Sunak said last week when grim GDP figures were announced: “My priority throughout this crisis has always been to try to protect people’s jobs first and foremost and provide support to families and businesses through what has been an enormously difficult time.” He added: “That very difficult time is it not going to be over in the spring”. However, he also signalled the need for some action to tackle the deficit, warning: “I want to make sure that whenever the next shock hits the country, that we can also respond in the same way that will require our public finances to be put back in a strong position.” The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has been pressing Sunak to make an early announcement on extending the various business support schemes to avoid a “cliff-edge” for firms next month, when they are due to end. On Wednesday the prime minister provoked some anger from the hospitality industry for suggesting venues were inherently less safe. “You have to remember from last year that we opened up hospitality fully as one of the last things that we did because there is obviously an extra risk of transmission from hospitality,” he said. Johnson confirmed the reopening would come “in stages, cautiously” and repeated his hope that no further lockdowns would be necessary. “We want to be going one way from now on, based on the incredible vaccination rollout,” he said. Exasperated pub bosses criticised the prime minister’s description of the industry as unsafe. The row risks worsening relations between Downing Street and the pubs sector days after the industry broke off weekly talks with the government, with the Young’s boss Patrick Dardis citing a “lack of interest and respect”. Chris Jowsey, the chief executive of the 1,000-strong pub chain Admiral Taverns, said: “I find it pretty incredible to be honest. If he’s [Johnson] data-driven, he’d know there’s no increased risk of transmission from hospitality. All the data from last summer proves that.” Demot King, who runs the Oakman Inns chain, said the suggestion that pubs and restaurants present a particular danger was “made up … there’s no data that supports that”. Senior sources have pinpointed May as the most likely reopening date for pubs and restaurants, although the prospect of pubs being allowed to serve customers outdoors from April has been discussed but not decided on. Once pubs and restaurants are allowed to open again there will still be significant restrictions on who can meet, which is likely to mean support packages for the industry will be needed for some time. Lockdown-sceptic Conservative MPs have long seen the chancellor as their champion inside government, but allies of Sunak said he was won over to the arguments for a cautious reopening in order to protect the vaccine programme. One ally of Sunak said he had “always been pro-reopening as quickly and as safely as possible” but said the vaccine had been a “gamechanger” that meant his perspective had shifted since last year. “We didn’t have a potentially permanent route out previously. So there is now hope that this will be the last lockdown and therefore everyone across government is taking more cautious approach.” The budget deficit is on course to hit £400bn – or about 20% of national output – by March. Monday’s roadmap is being worked on by the prime minister and a tight group of ministers including Sunak, Matt Hancock and Michael Gove, who are meeting throughout the week. Health sources said a better picture should be available by Friday on the effectiveness of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab in protecting against death or serious illness. Industry leaders and heads of local government said they were not expected to start being consulted on plans until the end of the weekend. Johnson urged the public to be cautious about partial information that was leaking out of government. “I know there’s there’s a lot of understandable speculation, people are coming up with theories about what we’re going to do and what we’re going to say and about rates of infection and so on,” he said. “I would just advise everybody: just wait, you know, we’ll try to say as much as we can.”"
2021-02-18T00:01:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Covid crisis: 1.9m people in UK have not worked for more than six months,"Almost 2 million people in Britain have not worked for more than six months during the coronavirus pandemic, amid growing risk to workers from long-term economic damage caused by the crisis. The Resolution Foundation said up to 1.9 million people in January had either been out of a job or on full furlough for more than six months, revealing the lasting impact on employment caused by Covid and multiple lockdowns. Highlighting the risks to workers from long-term unemployment, it called on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to use next month’s budget to extend targeted support for sectors of the economy hardest hit by the crisis. The report warned that while the outlook for the economy was steadily improving thanks to the vaccination programme and as the government prepares to roll back Covid restrictions, many workers remained concerned about their job prospects. Redundancies are rising at the fastest rate on record, and the Treasury’s independent economics forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, expects unemployment to hit 2.6 million by the middle of the year as the furlough scheme is wound down. The scheme, which has cost almost £50bn and subsidised the wages of almost 9m jobs at its peak in May last year, is due to close at the end of April. About 4.5m jobs are furloughed during the current lockdown, according to the Resolution Foundation. According to the study, 8% of workers currently employed either expect to lose their jobs in the next three months, or have been told they would be made redundant. This figure rises to 21% among those who have been furloughed for at least six months of the crisis. The findings come as pressure mounts on the chancellor to extend furlough and to announce a fresh package of tax cuts and business grants at the budget to ensure a swift economic recovery from the pandemic. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned on Thursday that sales to UK customers had fallen in the last three months for as many as 61% of companies, according to a survey of 1,100 firms. Underscoring the risks to businesses from the cumulative impact of a year of Covid restrictions, it said a quarter of companies planned to make staff redundant if state support is brought to a sudden halt this spring.
Adam Marshall, director general of the BCC, said: “Firms are desperate to start trading again so they can boost revenue and start thinking about the future. To do so they need to see a clear, evidence-based plan for reopening, and they need time to get back on their feet without unnecessary additional taxes, and the security of knowing that government will once again support them should we see additional restrictions imposed at any point.” A cross-party group of more than 40 MPs also warned on Thursday that pubs, bars and nightclubs risked “extinction” unless the chancellor used the budget on 3 March to increase emergency support for firms. In a report warning that urban centres risked becoming “ghost towns”, it said 85% of people working in the nighttime economy were considering leaving the industry. The Resolution Foundation said the furlough scheme needed extending while pubic health restrictions remain in place, and should be kept for longer in sectors that still faced legal restrictions, such as hospitality and leisure. It should then be phased out gradually. The Treasury’s £2bn kickstart scheme, designed to support young people with job placements, also requires extending beyond the end of 2021, it added. Nye Cominetti, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While the UK’s economic prospects are finally looking up, job insecurity remains high, particularly among those who have spent long periods not working, or who are currently furloughed.” A Treasury spokesman said it was doing all it could to support jobs during the crisis. “We will continue to invest in protecting and creating jobs through the remainder of the pandemic and through the recovery, and we will set out further details via the next stage of our ‘plan for jobs’ at the upcoming budget.”"
2021-02-17T16:45:12Z,uk-news,UK news,"Former Labour peer sexually abused two children in 1970s, court told","A former Labour peer repeatedly sexually abused two younger children when he was a teenager, a court has heard. There were claims that Nazir Ahmed, previously known as Lord Ahmed of Rotherham, had carried out serious sexual acts on others even before he was 14, jurors were told. The 63-year-old is on trial at Sheffield crown court where he denies two counts of attempting to rape a girl under 16, indecent assault of a boy under 14 and raping a boy under 16, all alleged to have occurred in the early 1970s. Ahmed has dismissed the allegations as “malicious fiction”, the court heard on Wednesday. He is on trial alongside his brothers, Mohammed Farouq and Mohammed Tariq, who have both been charged with indecent assault of a boy under 14. They were not in the dock after the judge ruled they were not fit to stand trial, but the jury was told it would still have to determine if they had committed the alleged acts. Opening the case for the prosecution, Tom Little QC said the trial concerned allegations of repeated sexual abuse that took place over a number of years, with the victims being too young to stop it at the time. “This was not isolated or innocent sexual experimentation by children,” he said. “It was abuse, plain and simple.” The complainants only went to the police in 2016, more than 40 years after the alleged assaults took place, the court heard. The woman went to South Yorkshire police first, followed by the man 12 days later. The two then spoke on the phone and the woman recorded the call. The court heard the recording, in which the man said of Ahmed and his two brothers: “All three of them abused me. I didn’t know about you. I’m sorry.” Little said the recording was evidence that the man went to the police independently of the woman and without her knowledge. The barrister said: “If it was concocted in this way then it was a highly sophisticated ploy for which there is no evidence.” The court heard Ahmed was also accused of abusing a young primary school-aged child when the defendant was under 14, but is not charged with doing so because the law at the time said under-14s were not capable of rape or attempted rape. The law was changed in 1993 but Ahmed can only be prosecuted according to the law at the time. When first interviewed under caution by police in May 2016, Ahmed answered “no comment” to every question, jurors were told. At a second interview, in September 2016, he was more forthcoming and denied the allegations, Little told the court. The trial is expected to last three weeks. The defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges."
2021-02-17T15:39:22Z,uk-news,UK news,"Hedge fund boss Crispin Odey 'lunged at woman', court told","The multimillionaire hedge fund manager Crispin Odey has acknowledged propositioning a banker after inviting her to his Chelsea home following a work meeting, but has denied indecently assaulting her. Odey was accused of lunging at the woman after showering and changing into a bathrobe. During a hearing at Hendon magistrates court on Wednesday, prosecutors alleged that he put his hand down her shirt and up her skirt during the incident in 1998. The married 62-year-old said he made an “ill-judged and unwanted sexual invitation” after inviting her to his home following a meeting, the prosecutor Kerry Broome said, but claimed she was exaggerating. Broome told the court that the woman, in her 20s at the time, was “shocked and scared” by the incident. The court heard that, when Odey was interviewed in 2019, he accepted that the woman was at his house, where they were talking about work, and said she asked him: “Where is this going to end?” The prosecutor told the court: “Odey said, ‘This is going to end up in bed, hopefully.’ He said the woman was appalled, that he had misread signals, and she left. “He accepts he made the proposition but said there was no physical assault and for whatever reason she is exaggerating. He said it was stupid of him to make the offer, but stupid of her to go to his house.” The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, met with “high-profile” Odey at Odey Asset Management, the company he founded in 1991, where he “showed an interest in her” and invited her to return later, which “she hoped would further her career”, the prosecutor said. No male employee was invited to the office and the woman went to Odey’s house by taxi, having assumed that his wife, Nichola Pease, would be there. “Odey suggested ordering takeaway and going to change into something more comfortable,” Broome told the court. “He returned sometime later wearing a robe, having obviously showered. By this time the woman was somewhat concerned. She didn’t anticipate what was about to happen. “She remembered sitting in a booth in the seat next to a table so she was blocked in. There was a seat next to her and at that point he lunged at her. He put his hand on her breast down her shirt, put his other hand on her back, then he put his other hand up her skirt.” Odey, whose first name is Robin but uses his middle name Crispin, was supported by his wife in court. The case continues."
2021-02-17T15:24:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Prince Philip admitted to hospital as precautionary measure,"The Duke of Edinburgh has been admitted to hospital after feeling unwell, Buckingham Palace said. Prince Philip, who is 99, was admitted on the advice of his doctor and a palace statement said it was a precautionary measure. The statement said: “His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh was admitted to the King Edward VII hospital in London, on Tuesday evening. “The duke’s admission is a precautionary measure, on the advice of [his] doctor, after feeling unwell. The duke is expected to remain in hospital for a few days of observation and rest.” Philip, who was said to be in good spirits, went by car to the hospital and it was not an emergency admission. He is said to have walked into the hospital unaided. A source said the illness was not Covid-related and the stay in hospital was purely precautionary. He had been feeling unwell for a short period and the doctor was called to Windsor Castle, where he and the Queen have been shielding. The Queen remains at Windsor. No further details of his condition were being released, Buckingham Palace said. A spokesman for the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said: “The PM sends his best wishes to the Duke of Edinburgh as he undergoes a few days of rest in hospital.” The Queen and Philip, who celebrated their 73rd wedding anniversary in November, received their Covid-19 vaccinations in January. Philip, who will celebrate his 100th birthday on 10 June, spent four days in hospital in December 2019 for what royal officials said was observation and treatment for a pre-existing condition. He was discharged on Christmas Eve and driven to Sandringham to spend Christmas with the Queen. He has suffered a number of ailments over the years, including being treated for a blocked coronary artery at Papworth hospital, in Cambridgeshire, in December 2011, and a bladder infection in June 2012, forcing him to miss the Queen’s diamond jubilee celebrations. Exploratory surgery on his abdomen followed in June 2013 and he began to use hearing aids in 2014. He later pulled out of a Battle of Jutland anniversary event in June 2016 citing a minor ailment, which was followed soon after by his retirement from public duty in 2017. In June 2017, after a day in sweltering conditions at Royal Ascot, he was admitted to hospital as a precautionary measure for treatment for an infection arising from a pre-existing condition. He was discharged after a two-night stay. He also had a hip replacement operation in 2018. In January 2019 he was unhurt after the vehicle he was driving was involved in a traffic accident that injured two people near the Sandringham estate in Norfolk."
2021-02-17T14:17:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Future of archive on Northern Ireland Troubles secured,"A non-profit organisation based in Switzerland has secured the future of a leading archive about the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The Conflict Archive on the Internet (Cain) website had faced crippling cuts because Ulster University, which hosts the archive at its Derry campus, said it could not afford to keep it going. Academics said that would represent intellectual vandalism of a free historical memory bank of data, stories and images used by scholars around the world. Ulster University announced on Wednesday that funding from Initiatives of Change would help to sustain the archive. It is understood to have donated £150,000. “This generous donation not only secures the live nature of the Cain archive, but makes possible its future expansion, enabling us to overhaul the archive in ways that will benefit both the academics who contribute to it and the many thousands of visitors to the site,” said Paul Seawright, the executive dean of the arts, humanities and social sciences faculty. Initiatives of Change, formerly called Moral Rearmament, considered the archive a unique historical record, said Alec McRitchie, a member of its Ireland committee. “We are pleased to play our part in enabling it to be maintained as a live archive.” The Irish government’s department of foreign affairs reconciliation fund, a longtime supporter of Cain, recently added project funding. The funding will help modernise the site, which launched in 1997, and keep it as a live resource which fields queries and corrects, revises and updates information. The donation is for two years, leaving a question mark over longer-term funding, but the university has committed to staffing and sustaining the archive. It includes oral histories, election results, political memorabilia, public records, bibliographies and the names and details of more than 3,600 people killed in Troubles-related violence in Northern Ireland, Ireland, the UK and continental Europe. The information is free to access and responsive to requests and queries ranging from school students, professors and former paramilitaries."
2021-02-16T18:42:44Z,uk-news,UK news,QCovid: how improved algorithm can identify more higher-risk adults,"The shielding list in England is about to almost double, as 1.7 million people are added to the 2.2 million who have already been advised to stay home at all costs because of their increased risk of becoming severely ill should they catch Covid-19. It’s not a recommendation anyone would wish for. Everyone has had enough of their own four walls. But for some it will be a relief. It means they will be supported, with statutory sick pay, medicine deliveries and help to get their shopping. And in the case of about 800,000 who are under the age of 70, it means they will move into the current priority group for vaccination. These are individuals with a multiplicity of health problems, which could include obesity, diabetes, dementia, epilepsy, severe mental illness and hip fracture. The list is long. Many of them – and their families and friends – will have worried that the outcome if they were infected might not be good. Some will already have been staying at home as much as possible, even before they were officially on the shielding list. The reason these people are now being identified is thanks to long and painstaking work by a team based at University of Oxford to figure out how to weight each risk factor and how having a number of them affects the prognosis for someone catching Covid. It was commissioned by the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and funded by the National Institute of Health Research. But it’s not easy. Julia Hippisley-Cox, professor of clinical epidemiology and clinical practice, who led the team, previously developed a similar risk assessment tool for cardiovascular disease. That was 10 years in the making, so QCovid, as it is called, has been produced with lightning speed.
This is about the risk of ending up in hospital with severe Covid, not the risk of getting infected or mildly ill. We already know age is the biggest risk factor for death, hence why the over-80s were called first for vaccination. Since then, the priority has been in descending age order, but adding in NHS and care staff and people with conditions that carry an obvious risk of death – basically those that undermine your immune system like cancer chemotherapy and organ transplants. The original shielding list said nothing about people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. The Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisations, which advises the government, did not put them in the priority groups either. That’s because it was thought those most at risk would be caught by other criteria such as age or underlying conditions. This time ethnicity and, significantly, postcode are being included as factors to be weighed, aiming to provide information on deprivation. This is acknowledgment that many people in socio-economically deprived areas are more likely to have underlying poorer health and face great exposure to the virus due to their living arrangements and jobs. Previously there has not been a way to differentiate those in BAME groups who are affluent and healthy from those who suffer greater health inequality and therefore at risk of severe Covid. This much-needed algorithm will hopefully achieve that. As the discussion builds over the ending of lockdown, it is ever more important to know who is most at risk from the virus – and take stringent measures to protect them, beginning with vaccines. With the extended list of nearly 4 million people who are the most vulnerable, it should be easier to ensure they are kept safe if the pandemic should take another unwelcome turn, and we find that new vaccines against emerging variants are needed in the autumn."
2021-02-16T17:59:03Z,uk-news,UK news,"Adultery, accusations and walkouts: when royals do TV interviews","The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are due to give a “wide-ranging” interview with Oprah Winfrey next month, and according to a source the couple will not want to say anything to undermine their love and respect for the Queen. However, when royals face TV interviewers, it doesn’t always go to plan, as previous examples illustrate. Prince Charles and Jonathan Dimbleby – 1994 The Prince of Wales’s astonishing admission of adultery on camera stunned the nation and reportedly left Prince Philip incensed when Charles spoke to Dimbleby, his official biographer, two years after he and Diana had separated. His affair with Camilla Parker Bowles had long been the subject of widespread media speculation, but it was quite another thing for the future king to admit he had strayed. In the immediate aftermath, a Sun telephone poll found two-thirds of callers believed him unfit to be king. Addressing tabloid reports, Dimbleby asked Charles if he had tried to be “faithful and honourable” to his wife. To which Charles replied: “Yes, absolutely.” “And you were?” asked Dimbleby. “Yes” Charles replied, before adding: “Until it became irretrievably broken down, us both having tried.” Originally Charles was not convinced he should mention his adultery, but, apparently, was later persuaded that he should as it would come out in a “sympathetic” way. The fallout was immense, not least because it led to Diana’s famous retaliatory interview. Princess Diana and Martin Bashir – 1995 The Princess of Wales’ revenge interview the following year, with BBC Panorama’s Bashir, was even more controversial. An estimated 22.8 million people watched her discuss her marriage, her eating disorder, and whether her estranged husband could ever to be king. “I don’t think any of us know the answer to that,” she said. She too admitted to an extramarital affair, with guards officer James Hewitt. Bashir asked: “Do you think Mrs Parker Bowles was a factor in the breakdown of your marriage?” Diana paused, before uttering the immortal line: “Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.” To the horror of Buckingham Palace she also spoke of her postnatal depression, and her self-harm. “Yes, I did inflict upon myself, I didn’t like myself,” she confessed, at a time when mental health was a taboo subject. Sir Richard Eyre, ex-director of the National Theatre, later said he had lunch with the Queen shortly afterwards, who reportedly told him: “Frightful thing to do, frightful thing that my daughter-in-law did.” One month later Buckingham Palace announced the Queen had sent letters to the Prince and Princess of Wales, advising them to divorce. The Duchess of York and Michael Usher – 2018 Sarah, Duchess of York stormed out of a 60 Minutes Australia interview after Usher questioned her about a 2010 sting by the News of the World’s “fake sheikh”, in which she allegedly offered an undercover reporter access to her former husband Prince Andrew for £500,000. In the newspaper’s sting, she is heard on camera apparently saying: “I can open any door you want, and I will for you.” However, forced to listen again to the recording by Usher, Fergie rolled her eyes and shook her head before snapping: “Don’t try to trick me now.” She then demanded that “that bit” be deleted before declaring, “What more can I say, what more can I say,” and walking off set. The Duke of York and Emily Maitlis – 2019 As car crash interviews go, however, Prince Andrew’s with Maitlis of BBC Newsnight over his friendship with the sex-offender US financier Jeffrey Epstein is hard to beat. Despite Andrew reportedly thinking it had gone very well, it led to him being forced to step down from public life for the foreseeable future. Maitlis skewered a hapless Andrew as he admitted he did not regret his friendship with Epstein, adding that their relationship had “some seriously beneficial outcomes”. He also defended staying with Epstein in 2010, following Epstein’s conviction and imprisonment for soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution, explaining he wanted to end their friendship face-to-face “to show leadership”. On Virginia Giuffre’s accusation that she had sex with the prince and he sweated profusely when they danced, he repeated his denials of any sexual encounter and claimed a medical condition meant he could not sweat. The interview also put Pizza Express in Woking on the map when Andrew said he had taken daughter Beatrice to a birthday party there on the night he was alleged to have been with Giuffre."
2021-02-16T16:15:57Z,uk-news,UK news,Harry and Meghan aim to avoid embarrassing Queen in Oprah interview,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not wish to embarrass the Queen despite frenzied speculation over their planned “wide-ranging” interview with Oprah Winfrey, it is understood. The announcement by CBS of a “tell-all” intimate account by Harry and Meghan of their “Megxit” departure from the UK has led to reports it is the final straw for an exasperated Buckingham Palace who will strip the couple of their royal patronages. The couple are said to have the greatest respect and love for the Queen and will not say anything to undermine that, according to a source. They are determined to fight to retain their patronages.
Reports that the interview will directly result in Harry being stripped of his honorary military titles, and of Meghan losing her patronage of the National Theatre, personally bestowed by the Queen, are understood to have conflated two issues. Rather, practical considerations, such as the couple living thousands of miles away, are likely to see them being forced to relinquish them under palace pressure. Harry’s military titles were put on hold for a year when Megxit was thrashed out at the Sandringham summit one year ago. The agreement stipulated the position would be reviewed ahead of 31 March. He is currently captain general of the Royal Marines, honorary air force commandant of RAF base Honington and honorary commodore–in–chief of small ships and diving. Royal patronages are entirely in the gift of the palace, so the Sussexes have no control over them. The couple believe they have made their commitment clear to each of the organisations concerned, it is understood. Had it not been for the Covid-19 pandemic, it is said they would have regularly returned to the UK to support those organisations. They still hope to be able to promote and represent them on the world stage. Buckingham Palace declined to comment. One source said of the planned interview that as the duke and duchess were no longer working members of the royal family, any decisions they took with regard to media commitments were matters for them. As non-working royals, they were under no obligation to inform the royal household of such plans, the source said. Winfrey is a close friend and neighbour in southern California. She attended their 2018 wedding, and recently promoted a vegan latte business Meghan has invested in. Royal observers say the interview is unlikely to be hostile, and will have been carefully choreographed before recording. But the announcement has led to a backlash against Meghan in the UK press, with accusations she is invading her own privacy just days after victory in the high court in her privacy battle against the Mail on Sunday. There was no official comment from the Sussexes. One source indicated that the duchess’s victory established that individuals had the right to agency over their own lives, and it was not for others to decide which elements of their private lives could be made public. There are also questions over whether the interview will further strain relations between Harry and his brother, Prince William. The 12-month review of the couple’s status had been seen as a safety net while they explored whether they could achieve their ambition of being independently funded. Huge contracts with Netflix and Spotify have shown they have the potential to establish lucrative careers in the US. The 7 March interview will be staged in two parts, with the duchess – who announced on Sunday she was expecting her second child – first being interviewed about “stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood ... to how she is handling life under intense public pressure”, according to CBS. Later, they will be joined by Harry and the couple will speak about their move to the US last year and their future plans. Oprah with Meghan and Harry: A CBS Primetime Special has been described as an “intimate conversation” by the US television network. “This isn’t going to be an unscripted interview. It’s going to be carefully thought out and choreographed,” said Joe Little, the managing editor of Majesty magazine. “But looking at the history of royal interviews, you just wonder if this will trip them up.” “The timing is obviously significant because the [privacy] judgment had to take place before they could finalise the interview,” he added. “I think Harry will lose his patronages, but not as a consequence of the interview. The 12 months is up and given he isn’t going to be returning to the UK any time soon, his appointments with the military and other patronages have lost their importance as far as the organisations are concerned.” The Sussexes would not be happy at the prospect of losing their patronages, he said, before adding: “But finding freedom comes at a price.” Plans by Harry to fly back and forth from the US to support those organisations could be seen as hypocritical and undermine his “climate change credentials”, added Little. Even without the royal patronages, the couple remain indelibly royal. “As long as they retain their royal styles and title, that is validation in itself. Harry, grandson of the sovereign, will be son of the sovereign, then brother of the sovereign. So that proximity to the throne is never going to change,” said Little."
2021-02-16T15:48:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Human rights groups to boycott government's Prevent review,"A coalition of human rights and community groups have said they will boycott the government’s review of the anti-radicalisation programme Prevent in protest at the appointment of William Shawcross as its chair. The appointment last month of Shawcross, who chaired the Charity Commission between 2012 and 2018, was met with criticism over previous remarks he has made about Islam. In a joint statement, 17 groups with interests in human rights and communities, including Liberty, Amnesty International and the Runnymede Trust, said the appointment of Shawcross showed the review was there to “simply rubber-stamp” the controversial and divisive strategy, and they would not contribute to the exercise. There have been calls for an independent review of Prevent for years, by critics who say it fosters discrimination against people of Muslim faith or background and inhibits legitimate expression. The Prevent strategy includes a statutory duty for schools, NHS trusts, prisons and local authorities to report any concerns they have about people who may be at risk of turning to extremism. The Prevent duty has led to cases in which teachers have reported primary school children to the police for having toy guns or talking about video games. There are thousands of referrals each year but just 11% of those referred are ultimately deemed to be at risk of radicalisation, the most recent figures show. The review, announced in January 2019, has been beset by delays. It took 13 months to appoint Shawcross to lead it, after the government’s first choice, Lord Carlile, was forced to step down in December 2019 over partiality concerns. In the statement, the groups said: “The appointments of both Shawcross and Lord Carlile have made clear, beyond doubt, that the UK government has no interest in conducting an objective and impartial review of the strategy, nor in engaging meaningfully with communities affected by it. We, the undersigned groups, cannot be complicit in a process that serves only to rubber-stamp a fundamentally flawed strategy.” The groups announced that instead of participating in the government’s review, they would conduct a parallel review that “properly considers the harms of Prevent”. In 2012, as a director of the neoconservative thinktank the Henry Jackson Society, Shawcross said: “Europe and Islam is one of the greatest, most terrifying problems of our future. I think all European countries have vastly, very quickly growing Islamic populations.” The Charity Commission for England and Wales, under Shawcross’s tenure, was accused of institutional bias against Muslims by the Claystone thinktank, while Muslim groups have highlighted comments he made in his book Justice and the Enemy, which appear to support the use of torture and the detention camp at Guantánamo Bay. Rosalind Comyn, the policy and campaigns manager at Liberty, said: “This exercise could have been a chance to properly scrutinise the premise and impacts of the Prevent strategy, which stifles speech, spreads fear and distrust, and encourages discrimination. “But Liberty will no longer engage in the farce it has become. We need interventions that respect the rights of the people directly affected and that bring communities together – both Prevent and its review are very far removed from that ideal.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “There was a full and open recruitment process to find the new independent reviewer of Prevent. A panel, led by an independent chair, assessed the candidates and found that Mr Shawcross met the criteria and possessed the right range of skills and experience to conduct this important review. “It is false and disingenuous to say that Prevent disproportionately targets Muslims. It plays an essential role in stopping vulnerable people being drawn into all forms of terrorism, with safeguarding at its heart. It is important that this review is conducted so this vital programme continues to improve.”"
2021-02-16T15:07:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Artifex affordable housing project pays tribute to former Guardian columnist,"“When the time comes for action” the priority should not be large hotels and super cinemas but “homes for the people”. These are not the words of a current Guardian columnist discussing a post-lockdown economic recovery, but those of Canon Peter Green in 1944. Headlined “Homes for the people”, his plea to prioritise housing in the government’s postwar recovery plans appeared in the Manchester Guardian under the byline Artifex. Now, Green’s legacy will be Salford’s first affordable housing development in decades, which has been named after his pseudonym. The new high-rise Artifex development in Trinity will have more than 100 affordable homes and is due to be completed by spring. The 11-storey building will be near St Philip’s church, where Green served as a rector. Writing under his pseudonym during the first world war and until the 1950s, Green used his weekly column to speak out against war, injustice and racism. Sue Sutton, the chief executive at Salix Homes, said the Artifex development would bring 108 desperately needed affordable homes for people in Salford. The area is the 18th most-deprived local authority in England and its mayor, Paul Dennett, is keen to use housing to create a more equal society. “We wanted to pay our own tribute to this much-respected Salford son whose fight against social injustice represents our own beliefs and values at Salix Homes and our ethos to deliver high-quality, affordable housing for everyone,” she said. The tower block’s one- and two-bedroom apartments will be available under the government’s rent-to-buy scheme, with rent set at 20% below the market value for the area. After five years of renting, residents will have the option to purchase the flat. Dr Janette Martin, a modern history archivist (special collections) at John Rylands Library, part of the University of Manchester, said the naming of the Artifex building during the year the Guardian celebrates its bicentenary was a “fitting tribute to the memory of the champion of social justice, compassion and decent housing”."
2021-02-16T14:56:43Z,uk-news,UK news,"Forensic science rationing is putting justice at risk, says outgoing regulator","Police forces are having to ration forensic toxicology work, especially samples from suspected drug drivers, because there is not enough capacity in the system to handle the volume of work, the outgoing forensic science regulator has said. Dr Gillian Tully, who steps down from her post after six years on Tuesday, said the service needed to be treated as critical national infrastructure and given the funding and regulatory powers necessary to maintain the integrity of the criminal justice system. She warned that police forces were having to ration certain types of tests, which led to backlogs in cases, and parts of the sector remained in a precarious position due to the shortfalls. “Essentially, road traffic toxicology work is having to be rationed because there isn’t enough capacity for every police force to submit every sample that they’d like to submit,” she said. “The inescapable conclusion is that offenders who are suspected of driving while under the influence of drugs are tolerated and allowed to present a continuing threat to communities.” She added that the high workload of staff working in these laboratories also risked undermining the quality of their analysis. Tully also called for greater scrutiny of scientific evidence in court, including training lawyers and police officers on the limitations of forensic science – particularly digital evidence – as well as the need for greater training of medical examiners working with sexual assault victims, to ensure vital physical evidence was not missed. The role of the regulator is to develop scientific quality standards for the various forensic disciplines and to ensure that police and private laboratories offering these services in England and Wales are meeting them. Tully took up the appointment in November 2014, having worked in forensic science for more than 25 years, specialising in DNA. During her tenure, she warned of wide-ranging problems that threaten the justice system, with too few providers meeting the quality standards that are meant to prevent errors. She has also criticised the government for failing to give the regulator the necessary powers to enforce standards, despite committing to do so in 2016. She said that progress had been made towards improving the reliability of scientific techniques and the implementation of quality standards by forensic labs. “But there is still a very long way to go to make sure we have a system that operates in a way that supports research and development, delivery of day-to-day services, alongside quality as well – and that it is not robbing Peter to pay Paul for one or other of those,” she said. She also warned that alongside toxicology labs there were similar capacity problems existing in digital labs, such as those recovering data from computer hard drives and mobile phones, resulting in a backlog of devices waiting to be processed. “It means some cases will just be waiting and the investigations won’t be proceeding until those devices eventually are reached,” Tully said. Although these capacity problems had been known about for several years, little had been done to rectify the situation, she added. Meanwhile, those working in the criminal justice system needed better training on how to interpret the evidence being presented in court and understand its limitations. This was particularly true of digital evidence such as cell site analysis, which is used to pinpoint where a mobile phone was used at the time of an incident. Tully said: “I think there’s a lot of accepting at face value. What I would like is more understanding, throughout the whole criminal justice system, of what the limitations are on all types of evidence. “There is the potential for evidence to be misunderstood, misconstrued and given either more or less weight than it should be given. A miscarriage of justice is at the extreme end of what that can lead to, but it could just give more weight to a particular piece of evidence in the minds of jurors, that they perhaps ought to put less weight on, or vice versa.” She urged her successor to take a systematic approach to improving forensic science, and called on the government to prioritise the area. “Forensic science provision ought to be treated as an important national infrastructure and given the priority it deserves across government – including adequate funding to support quality and delivery and research. And there ought to be legislation to enable the regulator, when necessary, to prevent people from delivering services that pose a risk to the criminal justice system.”"
2021-02-16T13:21:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Mountain rescuer who fell helping lockdown breakers may never walk again,"A mountain rescue volunteer may never walk again after falling 150 metres during a callout to two lockdown breakers in the Lake District. Chris Lewis, 60, a retired engineer, sustained life-changing spinal injuries and multiple facial fractures when he was called out to help people camping illegally above Kirkstone Pass on 6 February. He was part of the Patterdale mountain rescue team that went to the aid of the two campers from Liverpool and Leicester after one fell ill, believing he was having a heart attack. It was pitch black and cold enough that the team’s oxygen cylinders froze when Lewis slipped and fell.
The original casualty was taken to hospital where he quickly recovered. Both men were fined £200 for breaking coronavirus restrictions. Lewis, who worked for the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca until his retirement three years ago, was given immediate medical attention by fellow team members and airlifted to hospital. Paralysed from the neck down, he is still in hospital and will need to use a wheelchair when he is discharged, according to Mike Blakey, a mountain rescue volunteer who helped to rescue Lewis. More than £300,000 has been raised for him via a JustGiving page set up by the Lake District Search and Mountain Rescue Association. Though mountain rescue volunteers are determined not to judge anyone they are called out to help, Blakey is clear the accident was avoidable. “We were in lockdown and they shouldn’t have been camping. It was avoidable,” said Blakey. He was irritated that the man rescued tried to justify breaking the law in a subsequent interview. “His response in the press annoyed me because he said: ‘I’d just come for a walk in the Lake District.’ And I thought, you hadn’t just gone for a walk, had you, because you’d travelled a long way, and you’ve stayed overnight? I didn’t quite understand what he was seeking to achieve by getting out there and justifying his actions. I’d have kept my head down.” The team was struggling to process what had happened, said Blakey, whose day job is as a director of a company providing fostering services. “I’ve probably experienced every emotion in the last week. I guess at times I’ve felt angry, but I’m just sad really for Chris and the impact this has had on the wider rescue team. “We are a very strong-knit community. I’ve been to all sorts of things in my career that are tragic. That’s the nature of the job … But you don’t expect to rescue your own.” He said doctors had told Lewis that because of where the spinal cord had been partially severed, “it means he probably won’t ever walk again”. But he said Lewis was maintaining a positive attitude, talking about where he would go exploring in the region when he recovered, “and where we can go if he gets the right wheelchair”. He cannot use his hands, so an intensive care nurse has been holding a phone he can talk to friends via Facetime from his hospital bed."
2021-02-15T19:44:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Harry and Meghan to break silence in Oprah Winfrey interview,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will break their silence in their first interview since quitting their roles as senior royals when they sit down with Oprah Winfrey next month. Prince Harry and Meghan, who revealed on Sunday they are expecting their second child, announced their plans to step back from the royal family on 8 January last year. Oprah with Meghan and Harry: A CBS Primetime Special, described as an “intimate conversation” by the US television network, will be aired on 7 March. CBS said: “Winfrey will speak with Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, in a wide-ranging interview, covering everything from stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood, philanthropic work to how she is handling life under intense public pressure. Later, the two are joined by Prince Harry as they speak about their move to the United States and their future hopes and dreams for their expanding family.” Winfrey is a personal friend of Meghan and attended the royal wedding in May 2018, and there was speculation at the time the couple would be interviewed by her.
It is not known if the Sussexes informed the royal household in the UK about their plans to be interviewed, but as non-working members of the monarchy they do not have to give notice of their media commitments. Buckingham Palace declined to comment. The news follows their Valentine’s Day announcement that their one-year-old son, Archie will be getting a new baby brother or sister. The child will be born eighth in line to the throne and become the most senior royal in the current line of succession to be born overseas, with an automatic right to US citizenship.
Harry retained his place in the line of succession despite the couple’s decision to step back from royal life and live independently in the US. But his position, and those of his children, will continue to descend the line of succession as his niece and nephews, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, have children of their own. Like Archie, the new baby Sussex will not be entitled at this stage to the style HRH – his or her royal highness – or the title prince or princess due to rules set out by George V. They are entitled to be a lord or a lady, but Harry and Meghan eschewed such a title for Archie, opting to style him plain master, with the surname Mountbatten-Windsor, and are likely to do the same for a future son, or use miss for a daughter. The baby will be entitled to HRH and prince or princess status once the Prince of Wales – their grandfather – ascends to the throne, although it is thought unlikely that the Sussexes will opt for such a change, having forfeited their own HRH styling.
The photographer Misan Harriman, a friend of the couple who shot a black and white image released to mark the their pregnancy announcement, said he had captured it on an iPad remotely. The photograph shows the couple under a tree in Los Angeles, with a barefoot Harry resting his hand on Meghan’s face while she lies in his lap resting her hand on her baby bump. Harriman, the first black male photographer to shoot a British Vogue cover– and the first to shoot its September issue – in its 105-year history, said it had been an “absolute joy” to be asked to help share the good news, especially following the loss and heartbreak the couple suffered last year when Meghan had a miscarriage. Speculation that the duchess might be expecting a second child arose after she applied for and was granted a postponement of her privacy trial against the Mail on Sunday until the autumn for a “confidential” reason. Any trial was averted when, on Thursday, the duchess won her high court privacy case against Associated Newspapers Ltd over the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online’s publication of extracts from a private handwritten letter she wrote to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, 76, after the judge, Lord Justice Warby, granted summary judgment in Meghan’s favour."
2021-02-15T19:43:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Police officer given misconduct notice over Mohamud Hassan's death,"A police officer has been served with a misconduct notice as part of an investigation into the sudden death of a 24-year-old shortly after he was released from custody. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said that the South Wales police officer was in the back of a van with Mohamud Mohammed Hassan after his arrest in January at his Cardiff home on suspicion of breach of the peace. Hassan complained of having a fit and suffering a migraine, and displayed signs of experiencing pain during the journey, but was held in custody overnight. He died shortly after his release at 8.30am the next day. The IOPC said that the notice indicated an investigation was under way into whether the officer failed to pass on information about Hassan’s condition to colleagues at the police station. If the officer is found to have breached professional standards after an investigation, they could be given a written warning. The notice comes as part of a wider IOPC investigation into Hassan’s death using body-worn video and CCTV footage, amid allegations that he suffered a series of injuries while in custody. The watchdog said last week that preliminary indications were that there was no physical trauma injury to explain the cause of death and toxicology tests would be needed. It emerged last week that an investigator told Hassan’s family that Hassan had come into contact with more than 50 police officers during the final hours of his life. Family lawyer Hilary Brown said then: “They are understandably disturbed by it. There are allegations of excessive force and to hear that Hassan was subject to this level of police contact has been really upsetting.” He said the family also felt it was unfair that they had been denied further information about the nature of the contact. The IOPC director for Wales, Catrin Evans, said that a decision over whether the officer had a disciplinary case to answer would come at the conclusion of the investigation. “We are continuing to analyse the footage and piece together other evidence, and we are looking at all the interaction police had with Mr Hassan over the weekend of his death,” she said. “We have advised Mr Hassan’s family and South Wales police that we have [served a disciplinary notice] for one officer over possibly not passing information about Mr Hassan’s welfare to the custody sergeant on duty. We keep misconduct notices under review during the course of an investigation.”"
2021-02-15T19:14:41Z,uk-news,UK news,Pensioner cleared of murdering wife during first lockdown in Wales,"A man who killed his wife five days into the first lockdown last year in Wales has been cleared of her murder. Anthony Williams, 70, strangled his wife, Ruth, 67, at their home in Brynglas, Cwmbran, after a period of feeling depressed and anxious and later told police he had been struggling mentally with coronavirus restrictions, his trial heard. The jury at Swansea crown court on Monday unanimously found him not guilty of murder. Williams, who had already pleaded guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility, is to be sentenced on Thursday. The pensioner had told police he had suffered sleepless nights in the run-up to the attack due to “trivial” fears, including that he would run out of money because he was not able to go to his bank to take out cash from his savings. He said he had coped “not very well” in the 18 months since his retirement from a factory making rubber and polyurethane-covered rollers, saying the couple “didn’t have much of a social life”. But he described his wife as being “happy” since her own retirement from an Asda store four years earlier. The trial had heard differing views about his state of mind from two psychiatrists. One of them, Dr Alison Witts, argued that his anxiety and depressive illness were “heightened” by the tough coronavirus measures imposed on the UK days earlier and had impaired his ability to exercise self-control. Another, Dr Damian Gamble said the defendant had no documented history of suffering from depression and had “no psychiatric defences” available to him, telling the court he believed Williams “knew what he was doing at the time”. Williams was arrested on suspicion of murder at the scene on the morning of 28 March, where he told police officers: “I am sorry, I just snapped, I am sorry.” In interviews read to the jury, he agreed with detectives that he was responsible for killing his wife of 46 years, telling them he had put his hands around her throat when they were in bed. He said he chased his wife downstairs and again grabbed her by her throat as she tried to unlock the front door to escape. She was found slumped in the couple’s porch with a pair of keys in her hand. Her cause of death was given as pressure to the neck, with a pathologist saying the lack of a ligature mark did not rule out use of a “soft” dressing gown cord found at their home. The couple’s daughter, Emma Williams, 40, told the court her parents had spent “90% of their time together” and she had never heard either of them raise their voices to each other. But while describing her father as a “gentle giant” who “wouldn’t hurt a fly”, she said he had shown signs of strange behaviour from January 2020. This had included claiming he was going to lose the couple’s home and becoming “obsessed” with turning off lights and heating to save money, even though the couple had savings of about £148,000. She said her father had been watching news reports on the global pandemic “all the time” and believed “no one’s ever leaving the house again”. “I said, ‘You’re just overthinking things. You’re just watching the news all the time and getting worried with Covid and your mind is just spiralling’,” she said. • This article was amended on 16 February 2021 because Alison Witts and Damian Gamble were described as psychologists instead of psychiatrists."
2021-02-15T16:48:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Blackburn mayor steps down after Covid breach fine,"The mayor of Blackburn has stepped down and offered his “deepest apologies” after being fined £200 for breaching coronavirus restrictions. Iftakhar Hussain was caught by police on Saturday at a house in Blackburn after a member of the public called to report a wedding on Saturday. Hussain, a Labour councillor for the Bastwell area of Blackburn, which has had one of the highest Covid infection rates in the UK, apologised for what he said was a “momentary lapse of judgment”. After news of his fine spread over the weekend, Hussain gave a baffling excuse to the Lancashire Telegraph, saying he had only gone “to open the door to the house so some food could be delivered”. He said he had been called to a relative’s house in Blackburn and realised all too belatedly that he should have refused to attend.
On Monday he resigned, saying: “Given recent events, I have taken the decision to step down from my position as the mayor of Blackburn with Darwen with immediate effect. I believe this is the right thing to do and I no longer believe I can continue to serve as mayor to the best of my ability. “I do not want to make any excuses; I regret the momentary lapse of judgment – I should have known better and I accept full responsibility for my actions. Being appointed as the mayor of Blackburn with Darwen during these difficult and unprecedented times has been challenging, but it has been a great honour to have served the residents of this great borough. It was a proud moment for me and my family. “I want to give my deepest apologies over any breaking of restrictions. I hope my actions will serve as a reminder to the people of Blackburn with Darwen of the importance of following the Covid-19 guidelines as it remains a real and serious threat.” The leader of the council, Mohammed Khan, said: “I have accepted Councillor Iftakhar Hussain’s resignation as mayor of the borough following the incident this weekend where he was found to be in breach of Covid restrictions. I know he deeply regrets this mistake. I would like to thank him for his dedicated service as mayor during this difficult year.” A Lancashire police spokesperson confirmed that there had been reports of up to 30 people attending a wedding in Dukes Brow and added: “There they found nine people inside celebrating the wedding, including two residents of the address. Each individual was issued with a £200 fixed penalty notice and was instructed to leave, which they did.” In a separate development, Greater Manchester police (GMP) said it had broken up a party over the weekend in Manchester’s tallest building. About 40 people were discovered in a private flat in Beetham Tower. “Some of the group, aged in their 20s and 30s, dispersed on police arrival and a review is ongoing into retrospective action for those present at the event, including the prospect of the maximum £10,000 fixed penalty notice (FPN) for the organiser,” GMP said. The force said it issued 185 FPNs over the weekend, including several £800 fines, for incidents including an 18th birthday party attended by at least 30 people in Newton Heath and a staff party at an industrial estate in Salford attended by 17 people on Friday evening. Officers also responded to a reported wedding party in Oldham where seven £800 FPNs were given after about 15 people who were present when police arrived fled."
2021-02-15T14:05:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Irish Sea rail tunnel plan derided as Doctor Dolittle fantasy,"A proposed undersea tunnel between Scotland and Northern Ireland has hit some credibility problems with one senior Conservative MP describing it as a Doctor Dolittle fantasy designed to distract from post-Brexit border check problems. “The trains could be pulled by an inexhaustible herd of unicorns overseen by stern, officious dodos,” tweeted Simon Hoare, the Tory MP who chairs Westminster’s Norther Ireland affairs committee. “A PushmePullYou could be the senior guard,” he said, alluding to the Doctor Dolittle creature with a head at each end of its body, “and Puff the Magic Dragon the inspector”. The idea was a fantasy that distracted from efforts to smooth post-Brexit checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, said Hoare. “Let’s concentrate on making the protocol work and put the hallucinogenics down.”
If the rail industry leaders who proposed tunnelling under the Irish Sea between Stranraer and Larne hoped for enthusiasm, or at least to be taken seriously, they must be disappointed by the withering responses. Politicians and business leaders have lined up to scorn the idea, calling it a distraction from efforts to adapt to the Northern Ireland protocol, a part of the Brexit deal with requires customs checks on some goods entering the region from Great Britain. “It’s time the prime minister woke up to that reality, people here simply don’t want a Boris bridge, a Boris burrow, frankly a Boris anything,” said Nichola Mallon, Northern Ireland’s infrastructure minister. “They want jobs, opportunities, stability and a brighter future.” Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said it took 30 years to build the Channel tunnel, that there was a munitions dump blocking the way and that any tunnel to Northern Ireland would not obviate border checks. The most direct route passes Beaufort’s Dyke, a 1,000ft deep trench in the Irish Sea where the government dumped about 1m tonnes of unused explosives and chemical weapons, including sarin and mustard gas. The High Speed Rail Group has proposed the tunnel in its submission to a review to a group tasked with exploring ways to improve connectivity between the four constituent parts of the UK, saying it would bind Northern Ireland closer to Great Britain and “address problems in economic status of Northern Ireland post-Brexit”. The preferred route, based on 120-year-old research by the Victorian engineer James Barton, would be diverted to avoid Beaufort’s Dyke. Sir Peter Hendy, who is leading the group, is expected to publish his interim report within weeks. It appears to be a sequel to the bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland that Downing Street mooted last year. Critics called it a fantasy designed to mollify unionists worried that Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal would undermine the region’s position in the UK. The Ulster Unionist party leader, Steve Aiken, dismissed the tunnel as impractical. “Can we just have 10% of the multi-billions that it would cost to fix our infrastructure – oh, and maybe some zero-emission ferries [built here] – now that would make more sense [also get rid of the Irish Sea border].” Sammy Wilson, a Democratic Unionist party MP, did not ridicule the tunnel but said it was more important for Northern Ireland to be connected economically and constitutionally, not physically."
2021-02-15T12:34:40Z,uk-news,UK news,UK's first football hate crime officer turns focus on social media,"Since starting his role as the UK’s first football hate crime officer earlier this month, PC Stuart Ward has been busier than expected, considering football fans are banned from stadiums as part of the coronavirus lockdown. Instead of jibes from the stands, players are now fielding more abuse on social media – just the other week, in Ward’s biggest case to date, West Midlands police arrested a man suspected of racially abusing West Bromwich Albion footballer Romaine Sawyers online. In his first-of-its-kind role, 34-year-old Ward is working alongside men’s and women’s clubs in the West Midlands, as well as with grassroots community football, to investigate incidents of hate crime relating to race, gender, religion, sexual orientation or disability at matches and, increasingly, online. “It’s unacceptable. If you’re walking down the street and you’re abused, it’s an offence. If it happens online, it’s still an offence,” said Ward. “For many years, people have thought they can hide behind a laptop, they can type something and think there’s going to be no consequences, no comebacks – but there will be comebacks.” He is joining calls for social media companies to require formal identification, such as a passport or driving licence, from users, a move that will make it easier for police forces to prosecute hate crimes he says, as well as discouraging people from posting abuse in the first place. Earlier this month, the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, called for social media companies to ensure “improved identification and banning of offenders” after a swathe of racist abuse directed at players including the Manchester United players Axel Tuanzebe and Anthony Martial, while their teammate Marcus Rashford said he was subjected to “humanity and social media at its worst” after receiving racist abuse. Ward himself knows what it’s like to experience abuse on the pitch. As a mixed-race child growing up in Dudley, he received racist abuse at the age of 11, after a tackle during a game. “It came from another player, and the thing that stuck with me was how no one did anything about it, other than my mum who stopped the game and took me off the pitch. “There were parents, match officials, the other players – who were old enough to know right from wrong – who didn’t challenge the comments or support me. “That’s just one incident – I’ve had it all my life and it’s made me a stronger person,” he said. He hopes his lived experiences of racism will help him to better empathise with the victims he’ll be working with. “Education is really important at all levels, just to get people to understand what hate crime is and what impact it has on people, because it does have a massive impact and that’s where my personal experiences come into it, because that’s what I can relate to.” Data shows one in 10 football fixtures in the 2019-20 season had an incident of hate crime in England and Wales, and the number of arrests for racist or indecent chanting more than doubled from 2018-19 to 2019-20 – from 14 to 35 – even though hundreds of matches were cancelled or played behind closed doors due to the pandemic. But the picture is not as bleak as it seems, according to Ward. “I think we’re seeing more offences being reported now. I don’t necessarily think that’s because the problem is getting worse, I think it’s because more people are aware of these issues, these offences, and they’re more confident in reporting them.” He credits the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as footballers taking the knee before matches, as helping to raise awareness of the prevalence of racism and encouraging people to stand up to it. “Obviously what we want to do now is start driving those numbers down, not by people not reporting it, just by dealing with it in a positive manner.” Over the coming months he hopes to work closely with players to pursue prosecutions against abusers, and work with officials on match days to stamp out unacceptable behaviour in the crowds when fans are allowed to return. Ward said he is “extremely proud” to be leading the way in tackling a problem that is so close to him, and hopes more than anything that when football returns to normal after lockdown, the country is reminded how the sport can be used to as a tool for bringing people together. “To me, football was all about the community. You would go to the ground, you would sit in the same seats and get to know the person next to you, and all the people around you – and that’s what we want to get back to. “What we don’t want is people avoiding football grounds because they feel they can’t go, the abuse is going to be too much, it’s going to be upsetting for them. When football is back, we want people to come to the grounds and have that community spirit again.”"
2021-02-15T12:16:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Family pay tribute to couple whose car was swept away in River Trent,"A couple who died after their car was swept away in the River Trent in Nottinghamshire this month have been named as John and Patricia Lillistone. John, 83, and Patricia, 82, were in a car that was seen entering the water at Hoveringham, between Newark and Nottingham, on the evening of 1 February. After a two-week search, hindered by high water levels, their bodies were recovered from the river on Saturday. A formal identification has taken place and the couple’s family have paid tribute to the “wonderful” grandparents, from Lowdham in Nottinghamshire. The family said in a statement: “John and Patricia were loving, caring parents and grandparents who were always there for family and friends. “Our family is devastated by the loss of two wonderful people and they will be dearly missed by all. We have many happy memories of our time spent together that we will cherish forever. “We would like to thank the emergency services and other agencies involved for their tireless effort and support at this very difficult time.” Specialist officers had been searching the river since the car was seen entering the water, with witnesses reporting seeing two people inside. Sonar equipment was used to locate the vehicle on the riverbed days later but it had not been accessible because of fast-flowing water. After an assessment of the site, a specialist police dive team entered the river at about 10.30am on Saturday and was able to recover the bodies. Insp Tim Ringer, who led the recovery operation, said: “Our thoughts remain with the family of the deceased, who have asked for their privacy to be respected at what I know is an immensely difficult time.” Nottinghamshire police, in partnership with the Environment Agency, had used sonar technology and an underwater drone to identify the location of the vehicle, which has also now been removed from the water. Councillor Roger Jackson, who represents the Southwell ward on Nottinghamshire county council, told Nottinghamshire Live: “It’s very, very tragic what has happened. “We don’t know what the circumstances are around it, but it’s awful for everybody involved. My heart goes out to their family. I have been speaking to the local parish council and highways team to see whether we need to do some work to see if we can stop it from happening again. “It was quite traumatic for those that witnessed it – I understand some residents saw what was happening – but there was absolutely nothing they could do. That will play on people’s minds.” A file will be prepared for the coroner."
2021-02-15T00:01:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Johnson should repay north of England voters with private investment – report,"The prime minister should repay voters in the north of England who lent the Conservatives their vote at the last election by unleashing billions of pounds of private investment, according to a report. It argues that ministers should aim to harness the “restless radicalism” from those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and the Conservatives in 2019 by creating an economic “big bang”, along the lines of the Thatcherite deregulation of the City in the 1980s which reinforced London’s position as a global financial centre. The report from the influential rightwing Centre for Policy Studies thinktank is produced with the Northern Research group, a group of Conservative MPs who represent northern England, the Scottish borders and north Wales. It says the transformation of the north of England from an industrial powerhouse to an area that includes huge deprivation and one of the least productive economies in Europe has led to voters tired of being neglected and ignored. Prescribing a “deluge of private sector investment” in the north, both from Britain and overseas, would match the special treatment awarded to the south-east for generations. Citing Nissan’s investment in manufacturing in Sunderland as an example of one of the UK’s most successful examples of regeneration, the report’s authors argue that a formula of colossal private investment supported and enabled by government is the solution for replicating it. Recommendations to make the north “one of the most investable places on the planet” include cash incentives for major investors and creating a new northern infrastructure bond aimed at global investors. An example given is encouraging investment into new giga-factories, which would help make northern England the “natural home for the Green Industrial Revolution”, the report argues. All projects funded through the new national infrastructure bank, which is to be based in the north, should prioritise private sector investment, the paper, which is partly funded by Lloyds Banking Group, says. The report also advocates slashing red tape to allow automatic approval for planning applications that create more than 100 permanent new jobs in the north and a fast-track process for investors planning to put £20m into the local economy, or whose investment will create more than 250 jobs. The report, co-authored by Jake Berry MP, a former northern powerhouse minister and Nick King, a former adviser to Sajid Javid, calls for a new northern growth board to advise and help steer investment. Berry, the chair of the Northern Research Group, said the prime minister needed to recognise that the millions of northern voters who broke tradition to vote for the Conservatives at the last election were not just voting for Brexit, but to “voice the systemic disadvantages felt in many communities that were tired of being neglected in favour of London and the south-east”. “The measures we have put forward will help the prime minister and this government to ‘level up’ the economy and help make the north build back better as one of the most investable places in modern times”, he said. The paper points out that public investment is heavily tilted towards regions which are already thriving. King, a research fellow at the Centre for Policy Studies, said the government had already taken steps to invest in infrastructure but that only the private sector could bring the scale of investment and dynamism that the north needed. “There is a huge amount of domestic and global capital ready to be invested. Our recommendations are designed to make the north of England one of the most investable places on the planet and to unleash this capital through a northern ‘big bang’,” he said."
2021-02-15T00:01:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Father of missing chef Claudia Lawrence dies at 74,"The father of the missing chef Claudia Lawrence has died at 74 without learning what happened to his daughter after she disappeared more than a decade ago. Peter Lawrence, a retired solicitor and campaigner for the families of missing people, died on Thursday in St Leonard’s Hospice in York after a brief illness, his family said in a statement. His daughter, a 35-year-old chef at the University of York, was reported missing on 19 March 2009 after she did not show up for her shift that morning. Police believe she was murdered, but her body has never been found. The Lawrence family said in a statement: “It is sad that nearly 12 years after Claudia’s disappearance from York, Peter never found out what has happened to her. He was a very private person thrust into the full glare of the media, and despite a tireless campaign to find her, he also selflessly devoted himself to helping others with missing relatives through the charity Missing People.” Lawrence campaigned for Claudia’s Law, which established a new legal status of guardian of the affairs of a missing person, allowing families to act in the best interests of a loved one gone for 90 days or longer. He told the BBC that the legislation, which is officially known as the Guardianship (Missing Persons) Act 2017, means there is “one less burden at a time when families are at their emotional lowest ebb”. The former solicitor described seeing the legislation progress through parliament as an “absolutely marvellous feeling” and received an OBE for his campaigning in 2018. Claudia Lawrence was last seen on 18 March 2009 and reported missing a day later. Police previously said they “strongly suspect” the case is being hampered by the withholding of “key and vital information”. Speaking on the 10th anniversary of her disappearance, Det Supt Dai Malyn of North Yorkshire police said: “It remains the case that we strongly suspect key and vital information is being withheld that could provide the breakthrough that we all want to see, not least Claudia’s heartbroken family. “Unless we get information or intelligence to suggest that Claudia came to harm as a result of an opportunity taken by someone unconnected to her, me and the team still strongly believe the answer lies locally.” He said police were confident that a breakthrough could come from the public sharing information with the force, as in other cold cases. The investigation was hindered by a lack of CCTV around Lawrence’s home, as well as the fact that she had neither a smartphone nor a social media profile when she vanished. Lawrence’s mobile phone did not leave the area before it left the phone network, which police believe lends weight to the theory that her attacker was known to her. Nine people have been arrested or questioned as part of the investigation, but no charges have been brought. The investigation was scaled down in 2017, leaving her father “hugely disappointed and depressed”. The Lawrence family statement said: “Despite Peter’s death, the message remains the same – where is Claudia?” They ask that anyone with any information contact North Yorkshire police on 101."
2021-02-14T18:17:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Drones used by police to monitor political protests in England,"Police have used unmanned drones to monitor political protests, including those held by the non-violent Black Lives Matter movement, research shows. Police also used drones in 2020 at animal rights protests, Extinction Rebellion and anti-HS2 demonstrations, and in one instance, an extreme-right protest. Campaigners say the police’s expanded use of drones is happening with the rules not clear and next to no debate. Police say that is not the case. The campaign group Drone watch used freedom of information requests to ask police forces to detail their use of drones at protests from January to October 2020. The Surrey, Cleveland, Staffordshire, Gloucestershire and West Midlands forces said they had used drones at BLM protests. Cleveland at three BLM events, Gloucestershire at two BLM protests and one lockdown protest, and West Midlands at three BLM protests. In south-west England, the Devon and Cornwall force and Avon and Somerset police used drones at 15 events including protests and public disorder incidents. Both forces declined to say at which protests drones had been used. Police were criticised for using drones during the first coronavirus lockdown, when they were used to monitor walkers in the Peak District in Derbyshire.
Polling for Drone watch by Yonder claims to show public concern about drone use when they fly beyond where a human can see them. Of 2,000 people questioned, 60% were worried about the effects on privacy and civil liberties, and 67% said they were concerned about the safety implications. The National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for the police use of drones, assistant chief constable Steve Barry, said: “Police use drones at protests to help inform policing tactics to keep everyone safe. Their use is well regulated and governed by the surveillance commissioner and information commissioner guidelines.” Chris Cole of Drone watch said: “Police are adopting this new surveillance technology with little oversight or consent from the public. There seems to be little control over how the data is being gathered or stored with alarmingly worrying replies from the police indicating they do not understand what rights the public have in regard to accessing data.” The use of drones in the UK is set to expand, and not just by the police. Companies such as Amazon also plan to use them more. Cole said: “This is just the tip of the iceberg. Despite serious public concern, the government is planning to liberalise airspace regulations to enable a whole raft of public agencies and private companies to operate drones freely in our airspace. Before that happens, it’s vital that there is a proper public debate about the limits of drone use and comprehensive privacy controls are put in place.” Rosalind Comyn, the policy and campaigns manager at Liberty, said drone use was part of an alleged general assault on the right to protest. “Protest is a key way we can all fight for a better society and stand up for what we believe in. “Recent years have seen a concerted attack on the right to protest from police and government, which particularly threatens people who are already marginalised and cut off from having their voices heard. “Increased mass surveillance, whether through drones or other developing tools like facial recognition, is designed to intimidate and control, and ultimately silence dissent.”"
2021-02-14T15:06:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Rail bosses plan to build Northern Ireland to Scotland tunnel,"Rail industry leaders have proposed building a tunnel between Scotland and Northern Ireland to a group tasked with exploring ways to improve connectivity between the four constituent parts of the UK. High Speed Rail Group (HSRG) has proposed tunnelling under the Irish Sea between Stranraer and Larne in its submission to a review led by Sir Peter Hendy, who is expected to publish his interim report within weeks. The two towns are 31 miles apart but a preferred route for the tunnel, based on 120-year-old research by the Victorian engineer James Barton, would be diverted to avoid Beaufort’s Dyke, a 1,000ft deep trench in the Irish Sea.
According to the HSRG, the tunnel would bind Northern Ireland closer to Great Britain and would “address problems in economic status of Northern Ireland post-Brexit”. A new rail connection between Carlisle and Stranraer would be needed and the width of railway track in Ireland may need to be altered, the proposal said. Jim Steer, an HSRG board member, said: “There is an urgent need for both new and improved transport links between the four nations of the United Kingdom, which have been systematically neglected for too long. “Cross-border travel markets for rail were growing strongly over the period to 2019. Travel generates economic value, but the opportunity for further economic stimulus from this source will be lost if transport network capacity constraints are not addressed. “Building on the transformative impact of HS2, HSRG are calling for these cross-border rail links to be addressed as a matter of urgency, safeguarding the strength of the whole of the UK economy in the years ahead.” The pitch submitted to the review claims the proposal has the backing of the Northern Ireland assembly and the Scottish parliament and that there is a “feasible path to its funding from the UK Exchequer that does not adversely impact on other transport funding”. A government spokesperson said: “We have asked Sir Peter Hendy to make recommendations on how to improve transport connectivity between Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England. His recommendations will be published in due course.” The prime minister first suggested connecting Stranraer in Scotland to Larne in Northern Ireland by bridge three years ago, an idea that was widely derided by engineers. Experts raised concerns about the practicality of constructing a bridge across the stormy stretch of water, which is more than 1,000ft deep in places, and said would require dozens of support towers at heights “never achieved anywhere in the world”."
2021-02-14T13:47:20Z,uk-news,UK news,ONS gears up for once-in-a-decade challenge with 2021 census ,"Amid endless flyers from food delivery companies dropping through the letterbox, households in England and Wales will soon receive a postcard from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) giving notice of the 2021 census. It will be followed by a letter advising that every household must complete a detailed questionnaire about themselves and their co-residents on 21 March. The letter will contain a unique code enabling recipients to complete the census forms online, although paper forms will be available on request. In the weeks following census day, 30,000 field officers will knock on the doors of those households that have failed to return a completed questionnaire. The officials will begin with explanations and encouragement, but the process can end with a court appearance and a £1,000 fine.
The once-a-decade exercise to take a snapshot of the country in one 24-hour period is a major challenge. This time it is complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic, but the ONS is confident there will be high levels of compliance and the vast majority of households will answer questions online. Some pockets of the population are hard to reach, for reasons that include language barriers, mistrust of government, worries about personal data and aversion to or difficulty with form-filling. The overall response in 2011 was 94%, but among some BAME households it was up to 10 percentage points lower. Hundreds of community engagement advisers have been recruited to work with different ethnic and religious groups this time. Adel Khaireh of the Greenwich Islamic Centre in south-east London is leading efforts to engage the Muslim community. “Trusted members within our community are appearing in videos which can be shared on social media,” he said. “The imam of the mosque will be explaining how important it is and reminding people to fill in the form. People will think: ‘If the imam trusts this, then so should we.’” The data gathered from the census would not only help the government to plan public services and housing needs for the next decade, but would provide the mosque with a better understanding of its community, he said. The last census documented 17,349 Muslims in the borough, 6.8% of the population, but Khaireh believes the figure today is closer to 30,000. “We want to measure our growth as a community, plan for how we can serve the community and address specific groups within the community, such as Somalis,” he said. Emily Stidston, the ONS’s census community partnerships manager, said one area of concern was how personal data would be used. LGBTQ+ people in particular may be worried about new questions on sexual orientation and gender identity, and migrant or refugee communities may be concerned about data being shared with the Home Office. “No one can be identified from the census data, everyone is completely safe filling out their census. All the ONS wants are hard, anonymous facts,” she said. Mistrust of government was a core concern among some population groups, she said. “In other cases, people have simple misunderstandings foremost in their mind. For example, I have had to reassure people that filling out the census will not lead to doorstep marketing for double glazing.” The census form asks questions about the makeup of households, type of accommodation, occupation, education, ethnicity, religion, marital status, state of health and means of transport to work. In 2011, 270 people were found guilty of non-compliance and ordered to pay a fine averaging £280. The ONS estimates it will take a year to process the data. As well as routine government planning, information from the 2021 census will help preparations for possible future pandemics and other emergencies. Northern Ireland will also hold a census on 21 March, but Scotland has postponed its census until 2022 because of the pandemic."
2021-02-14T09:10:37Z,uk-news,UK news,"‘Children are not pets, society has to help parents bring them up’ ","Parents have had to become teachers, a footballer has helped expose the plight of deprived families, and local groups across the country have been on the frontline in providing emergency advice and supplies. As a result, the pandemic’s extraordinary impact has helped shift Britain’s attitude to a community’s role in bringing up children, the children’s commissioner for England has said. Talking to the Observer before she leaves the role at the end of the month, Anne Longfield said that when she took up the job in 2015, the care of children was regarded as “a bit like pets – you wanted one, they’re yours”. However, she said she had witnessed a gradual change in attitude underlined by the pandemic. “I think we are in a slightly more communal space than we were. That was happening before the pandemic, but I think the pandemic has heightened that more. “That process has been a very good thing. After the last year, people feel more confident about offering help. Hopefully, they also feel more comfortable asking for help.” She said that the crisis had brought home the importance of schools and other local institutions in a child’s life, as well as highlighting the impacts of deprivation and abuse that had remained invisible for years. However, she warned that the “glue around children’s lives” in the form of community support had faced a decade of erosion since the financial crash that now needed to be reversed. “During the pandemic, teachers were great,” she said. “They were delivering food boxes to people’s homes and the like, but they can’t do that and run classrooms. Council children’s services can’t do that and run their high cost interventions. So actually, the pandemic re-exposed those activities that can go on and should go on for families, but actually during normal times, don’t get done. That infrastructure around communities now needs to be rebuilt.” Longfield, who has run hundreds of charitable community services, said radical reforms should include rebuilding a government department that looked more widely at children, schools and families.
A department under that name was rebranded by Michael Gove in 2010 as the Department for Education. “Government is not terribly well set up for dealing with people as people or children as children,” she said. “It deals with them as pupils or patients or prisoners. “You can’t have a recovery programme without helping the kids that can’t learn. You can’t have a recovery programme without helping the families to help the kids. It’s now time to take a deep breath on that and actually put children and families back into the title. I think there should be a cabinet minister for children.” The DfE has faced serious criticism over its response to the pandemic, with teaching unions complaining of late and unclear advice, and unrealistic demands – such as the exams fiasco, the threat of legal action to make schools reopen before Christmas and the order to draw up Covid testing with little notice. While Longfield did not comment directly on the position of the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, she said the department “needs to have that loud, strong voice sticking up for kids, right at the centre”. “I have deliberately left it to the prime minister to worry about who we put around this table, but [the department] needs to be a priority. It needs to become a big beast – and I don’t think it’s been a big beast for a government for some years now.” She said the closure of schools had been “enormous” in bringing home their significance. “We will have had almost a billion school days lost by mid-April in this country, which is astounding – the place we all in some ways took for granted was whisked away. Over the pandemic, everyone has come to understand how important schools are, not just the education part, but friends, relationships with teachers, mental health. But also, for those kids where home is not a safe place, it’s schools that know that. We saw the drop in referrals [to social services] in the first few weeks and it’s still not back to where it should be.” Longfield said her biggest shock on taking the job in 2015 was the number of children raising concerns about mental health and their access to help. She wants mental health counsellors installed in every secondary school as soon as possible. Her second big drive was to focus more attention on the 1.6 million children who would need some kind of help from social services, but were not formally in care. She said their plight was better understood as a result of the pandemic. “It’s played out in front of everyone’s eyes,” she said. “I think people generally come out a year later knowing what it means to not have resources to draw on. They know what it means where you don’t have access to tech, sharing a broken phone – and all those kinds of hidden harms, like domestic violence. People can see what that means. I’d say the response hasn’t been to the scale needed.” A DfE spokesperson said: “Education has been at the heart of the government’s response to the pandemic. We are providing 1.3 million laptops and tablets for children who need them most.” The spokesperson added that the department will invest a further £300m for tutoring and to work with parents and schools to help children catch up."
2021-02-14T08:15:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Leave.EU donor Arron Banks loses data breach appeal,"The Leave.EU campaign and the insurance company owned by the political group’s key financial backer, Arron Banks, have lost an appeal against £105,000 of fines for data protection violations in the wake of the EU referendum campaign. The companies were issued the fines two years ago, for including promotions for Banks’s GoSkippy insurance brand in emails to Leave.EU subscribers between August 2016 and February 2017. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) had said then that the two organisations were closely linked, with “ineffective” systems for segregating the data of insurance customers from that of political subscribers. Leave.EU was also fined £15,000 for using Eldon Insurance customers’ details unlawfully to send out almost 300,000 political marketing messages, before the referendum. An initial appeal against that ruling was withdrawn in May 2019. In February 2019, when the fines and an audit into both companies’ use of data was announced, the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said: “It is deeply concerning that sensitive personal data gathered for political purposes was later used for insurance purposes, and vice versa. It should never have happened.” The fines against which Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance had tried to appeal in the latest case were for sending more than 1 million emails to Leave.EU subscribers, containing adverts for discounted insurance from GoSkippy, a brand name used by Eldon.
The campaign negligently disobeyed electronic marketing regulations in doing so, the ICO found. The latest tribunal ruling noted findings of a previous court that both companies have a “confusingly two-faced approach to regulation” of personal data. It also noted that Banks had admitted being “untruthful”, and used a “bullying tone” in correspondence about the case. “Mr Banks’s letter to the information commissioner admitting that he had been untruthful in the past was hardy likely to assuage all regulatory concerns, especially as it was followed by his letter of bullying tone,” the earlier ruling found. Banks said Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance “will be appealing the fines to a higher court in due course”. He said the ruling would prevent newspapers and publishers from sending offers to subscribers. The judges had addressed this argument, saying that Leave.EU’s privacy policy was so loosely drafted, it amounted to “signing a blank cheque”, and “frustrated the ability of its subscribers to consent to receive a political newsletter and nothing else”. Because of this, the lower tribunal had been entitled “to find on the facts that subscribers did not ‘consent’, as that term is properly understood, to receiving direct marketing about Eldon’s insurance products”, the ruling said. The judges also said that previous breaches of data protection law at Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance “should have put the parties on guard”. The fines were initially announced as part of a wide-ranging investigation by the ICO into political uses of voters’ data, launched in 2017 following revelations in the Observer. Denham, the commissioner, said it uncovered “a disturbing disregard for voters’ personal privacy”, and showed that the digital electoral ecosystem needed reform. The ICO’s investigation involved 71 witnesses, 30 organisations with data practices under review, and more than 700 terabytes of data being assessed by investigators."
2021-02-13T17:57:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Police recover two bodies from submerged car in River Trent,"The bodies of a man and a woman have been recovered from a submerged car after a large search operation on the River Trent in Nottinghamshire. Police dive teams located an object believed to be a vehicle on 2 February, a day after a car with two passengers was reported to have been seen floating along the river at Hoveringham, between Newark and Nottingham. High river levels have since hampered efforts to recover the vehicle but two bodies were removed from the water at about 10.30am on Saturday after the car was located on the riverbed using sonar equipment. No formal identification has yet taken place but family members have been informed by a family liaison officer. Work, which is being supported by a tug boat from Newark, is under way to remove the car. Insp Tim Ringer, who is leading the recovery operation, said: “This has been a difficult and complex operation involving dozens of people from multiple agencies. Underwater recoveries of this nature are always very challenging, but our divers’ work has been further complicated by the very fast-flowing water at the site. It was simply not safe to attempt this work before today. “Our thoughts remain with the family of the deceased who have asked for their privacy to be respected at what I know is an immensely difficult time.” Eyewitness Pauline Bulpitt said at the time of the first sighting of the submerged car, according to the BBC: “It was quite shocking. My husband rushed to get his wellington boots, hoping the car would come into the bank further up and we might be able to do something to help. There was another gentleman running down the field to see if he could do something to help but the car carried on down.” A file will now be prepared for the coroner."
2021-02-13T14:57:25Z,uk-news,UK news,UK weather: more snow expected after record-breaking minus temperatures,"More snow is expected in parts of the UK this weekend after a record-breaking week of cold weather, according to the Met Office. The UK recorded its coldest temperature for 25 years in Braemar in Aberdeenshire on Wednesday night, when the mercury dropped to -23C. In Scotland, and parts of Wales, Northern Ireland, and northern England, yellow weather warnings are in place for snow and ice on Saturday and Sunday. But parts of the UK are expected to enjoy milder conditions next week, the Met Office said. Temperatures are expected to reach double figures next week, following icy weather over the weekend.
Northern Ireland is still grappling with disruption caused by snow, with blizzards expected and wind speeds likely to reach 40mph in coastal areas. The Met Office forecaster Luke Miall warned that the conditions would “really significantly reduce visibility when driving”. A yellow weather warning for snow is in place until 10pm on Saturday, with people advised to make only essential journeys. Weather warnings for wind have also been put in place for counties Down and Antrim from 04:00 GMT to 23:59 on Sunday. Transport remains disrupted and sports games have been called off. Loch Glascarnoch, near Garve in northern Scotland, recorded the lowest temperature in the UK on Friday night at -6.5C, while temperatures dropped to -5.8C overnight at Pennerley in Shropshire and -5.6C at Parc Bryn Bach in Tredegar, South Wales. In London, parts of the Thames have frozen over. The chief meteorologist at the Met Office, Neil Armstrong, said: “For the past week the UK has been in a very cold air mass with temperatures well below average, this will change through the weekend as milder air moves in from the Atlantic and pushes that cold air mass out into the North Sea. “Where temperatures were close to freezing in many places last week, we could expect to see 11C or 12C next week,” he said, though warned that “there are still some wintry hazards to get through over the next few days, with low temperatures, strong winds and further snow especially in Northern Ireland.” Public Health England extended its cold weather alert during the weekend, encouraging people to check on vulnerable relatives and neighbours, from a distance. Dr Owen Landeg, group leader for extreme events and health protection at PHE, said cold weather can have a “serious impact on health, particularly for older people and those with heart and lung problems, as it increases the risks of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections”. “Make a call, or socially distanced doorstep visit if they live close by, to remind them to heat their home to at least 18C, 64.4F, and to keep up to date with the forecast,” he said. “It’s also helpful to check they have enough food and drinks and any medicines they need.” This week England and Wales also recorded their lowest temperature for February on Thursday, when Ravensworth, in North Yorkshire, reached -15.3C overnight. • This article was amended on 14 February 2021. Due to an error in agency copy, an earlier version incorrectly stated that the UK had experienced its coldest temperature for 65 years; this has been corrected to 25 years."
2021-02-13T13:44:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Activists evicted from longest-running HS2 protest camp,"Activists at the first and longest-running protest camp against the controversial HS2 high-speed rail development were evicted in the early hours of Saturday morning. The camp, at Harvil Road in the Colne Valley, Hillingdon, 25 miles west of the Euston tunnel protest against HS2, which has now entered its 17th day, was set up three and a half years ago. It has been the subject of several high court actions as HS2 sought and obtained injunctions to evict environmental activists from various parts of the site. Seven activists were evicted soon after midnight by dozens of black-clad members of the National Eviction Team (NET) supported by police officers. Four environmental activists had erected hammocks in trees and three were on the ground. One activist could be seen on the ground surrounded by members of NET screaming: “Can you get off me so I can stand up. Ow!” A NET bailiff can be heard saying: “You are on HS2 property I’m afraid.” “We really don’t need the level of aggression you are putting towards us,” the protester can be heard saying. Protesters said the eviction was swift. In previous high court cases relating to the eviction of parts of the Harvil road site protesters were told that while they were being removed from parts of the site they could still exercise their legitimate right to protest at a camp on the side of the highway. Now that camp has been dismantled. “Harvil Road Wildlife Protection Camp is no more,” said Mark Keir, a longstanding environmental protester at the site. “But this is not the end of the line for us. We will find other ways to protest against the HS2 development. The camp, once in a green and verdant landscape, is surrounded now by mile after mile of building site and endless floodlights at night. Last night’s eviction of Harvil Rd Wildlife Protection Camp was one of the most brutal we have yet seen. A vast army of 40 against a very doughty seven activists.” In September 2020 the high court issued its latest injunction barring protesters from the HS2 site. Opponents of HS2 have pointed to its spiralling costs and the destruction of trees and wildlife to make way for the rail line. The Colne Valley nature reserve is home to a variety of fauna and flora including bats, owls and osprey. Protesters claim that pile-driving into an aquifer (an underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock) on the site, which supplies almost a quarter of London’s water, will cause serious damage to this water supply. HS2 denies there will be any damage. Meanwhile at the Euston tunnel protest tunnel activists have reported soil collapse in one of the tunnels they have named Crystal. HS2 says that ensuring that the seven protesters remaining in the tunnel are removed safely is their priority. An HS2 spokesperson said: “Today we have taken possession of land to the west of Harvil Road to secure it for our future works. This was carried out with support of a warrant and involved the safe removal of a small number of illegal trespassers, who had put themselves and our team at risk. Protesters are always given the opportunity to remove themselves from sites that they illegally occupy.”"
2021-02-13T13:00:26Z,uk-news,UK news,"‘Significant gaps’ in Covid hotel quarantine plans, says Heathrow","The UK’s biggest airport has expressed concern that the government’s hotel quarantine policy is not ready, 48 hours before it is due to be launched. From Monday travellers arriving in the UK from 33 “red list” countries must isolate in a hotel room for 10 days at their own expense, but a spokesperson for Heathrow airport said “some significant gaps remain” before the policy could be effectively carried out. “When the government announced its hotel quarantine plan, we immediately offered our help to make this successful in a complex airport environment. We have been working hard with the government to try to ensure the successful implementation of the policy from Monday, but some significant gaps remain and we are yet to receive the necessary reassurances,” the spokesperson said in a statement issued on Saturday morning.
The airport urged the government to act urgently to ensure staff had the resources and instructions to launch the policy next week. “We will continue to work collaboratively with government over the weekend but ministers must ensure there is adequate resource and appropriate protocols in place for each step of the full end-to-end process from aircraft to hotel to avoid compromising the safety of passengers and those working at the airport,” the spokesperson said. It comes a day after immigration officials, who are expected to enforce the policy, warned they were in the dark about even basic details of the system. The Immigration Services Union (ISU), representing many of the Home Office’s immigration officers, said staff were yet to be given details on how or when people obliged to quarantine would be taken to hotels. They were also unsure whether they were required to check for arrivals who had not properly declared their status.
On Friday, preparation for the hotel quarantine stays was marred by technical issues that prevented people from booking hotel rooms, with an official booking portal going down. There are also concerns that the policy does not go far enough. Unlike the hotel quarantines in Australia, guests will be allowed to exercise once a day in hotel grounds as long as the area is “suitable”, security guards and hotel staff will not be tested regularly, and security guards will not given a higher-specification mask.
The policy was announced on 27 January in response to the spread of new strains of coronavirus in South Africa and Brazil which may be more resistant to vaccines. Contracts with hotels were not agreed until Tuesday, however, and the full legislation for the rules was not published until Friday evening. A government spokesperson said: “We are taking decisive action at the borders and every essential check – from pre-departure testing to the passenger locator form – will help prevent the importing of new coronavirus variants into the UK. “We are working closely with airports and hotels to manage any issues that arise and ensure the new process runs as smoothly as possible, and we are clear the safety of all staff and passengers is a priority.”"
2021-02-13T09:00:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Mundill Mahil was a straight-A student with a bright future. Then she was charged with murder,"Mundill Mahil knows it sounds cheesy, but as a girl she wanted to save the world. She was a model student. At Rochester grammar school, she got 10 A*s at GCSE, three As at A-level, mentored an autistic child and worked in a hospice, before winning a place at Brighton and Sussex Medical School; she hoped to do aid work for Médecins Sans Frontières when she qualified. Then everything went wrong; at 19, she was charged with murder. There are no winners in this story. One young man died; one was convicted of murder, another of manslaughter. On 25 February 2011, 21-year-old Gagandip Singh was brutally beaten by two men in Mahil’s Brighton bedroom, before being burned to death in the boot of a Mercedes. A year later, an Old Bailey jury acquitted Mahil of murder, but found her guilty of GBH with intent, for having lured Singh to his death. She was given a six-year sentence. Her motive, prosecutors argued, was revenge; she had told friends Singh had assaulted her six months earlier. It was a shocking crime. In a television documentary broadcast last year, Singh’s mother, Tejinder, talked about how she has struggled since her son was killed: “I have no life left. Two or three times a day, I think I want to die.” Last week, Singh’s sister, Amandip, told the Guardian that the family still grieve every day. “We will never be a normal family again. There’s not a moment we do not think of Gagandip.” Mahil, now 29, has never talked about what happened before: she never felt she had the right. “It is so horrific, what happened to Gagan. It felt, if I told my story, it would seem as if I didn’t care: ‘Look at me, I’m the victim.’” We are talking over Zoom, and she is clearly nervous. In media coverage of the case, Mahil has been portrayed as a vengeful student at the heart of a honeytrap plot to kill Singh, once her close friend. And she admits she was her own worst enemy in the days that followed: it was true she had invited him to her house under false pretences; and that when his body was found, she failed to tell police the full story. She even acknowledges that Singh would not have died had he not come to see her. Looking back, Mahil says she is not surprised the jury convicted her. But she says she was oblivious to any plan to hurt Singh, let alone kill him. There was no thought of revenge that night: she had hoped to put an ugly episode with her former friend behind them. So how did a teenager with so much to look forward to end up here? *** Mundill Mahil grew up the youngest child in a conservative, upwardly mobile Sikh family. Her parents ran a B&B; her sister was a doctor; one brother went to medical school before going into IT, while the other became a police officer. Mahil thrived at her girls’ school, making friends and becoming a star pupil. But she also felt an outsider: while her classmates had boyfriends, traditional Sikh girls were not expected to socialise with boys. A marriage would be arranged when the time was right. Occasionally, Mahil found herself lying to her mother if she knew there were going to be boys present – at the school disco, for instance.
But she was religious herself, with a growing interest in Sikhism. At 17, Mahil wore a turban and considered becoming baptised; before that, she had been to conferences, a meditation course, boot camps and a Sikh martial arts club. It was at this club that she met Harinder Shoker, a trainee electrician who went by the name of Ravi. A friendship developed, which Mahil kept secret. The two were very different. Shoker wore hoodies, smoked cannabis, was far more streetwise. “He used to use slang and say ‘bruv’.” Mahil pauses, embarrassed. “I was a bit snobbish. It was cool to have a friend like that. He drove a car without insurance. That, to me, was like, woah!” She called him her “gangsta” friend, something that would come back to haunt her. In August 2009, when she was 18, Mahil received a Facebook friend request from Gagandip Singh; he was a few years older, but they had a Facebook friend in common: Shoker. Mahil didn’t accept requests from strangers, let alone male strangers, so she asked Shoker about him; he had met Singh five years earlier at a Sikh temple. “Ravi said he was great, that he ran a Sikh TV channel and was Amritdhari – baptised. He said he was a ‘safe’ guy. So I accepted the request.” Now Mahil had two male friends she kept secret from her family. A few weeks later, she met Singh in person for the first time. “Gagan was ambitious, respectful, progressive,” she says. “He was very active in Sikh youth work, and I liked that.” Not long after, Singh received shocking news: his father had been murdered in India after a business dispute. He became withdrawn and depressed; over the next year, Mahil says she became more a counsellor to him than a friend. But he saw it differently, and told her he loved her. He became more needy and possessive, Mahil says. By now, she was living with fellow students in Brighton. “A number of times he turned up unannounced and said, ‘If I can’t see you, I’ll kill myself.’” Mahil says it felt like emotional blackmail; she wasn’t in love, but she valued his friendship and worried about him. She immersed herself in student societies, taking part in the Student Stop Aids campaign and preparing for a half marathon to raise money for Anti-Slavery International. But for the first time, she failed an exam. In August 2010, she returned to Brighton to resit it; for a few days, she was alone in the house. The night before her exam, Singh turned up unannounced. He brought her flowers, wished her luck, then said one of his headlights had failed: could he stay the night? Mahil was reluctant, but he persisted. She told him he could sleep in the lounge, fetched him a blanket and said she had to revise. She says he began to cry. He wrote a message on his phone and asked her to look at it: “I think you should go or I will rape you.” She dismissed it as a weird joke.
As she worked in her room, he kept coming in. She told him he could sleep in the bed and took her books and laptop to the lounge. “He followed me. I was like, ‘For goodness sake, I need to concentrate.’ I went back to my room.” Exhausted, she fell asleep on her bed. She says the next thing she knew Singh was on top of her. “He pinned me down with his arms so I couldn’t move my wrists; his ankles were pinning down my ankles. I saw his kirpan, the dagger baptised Sikhs wear, which is meant to be a reminder to uphold what’s right and wrong. I looked at my phone on the desk. He said, ‘Don’t you dare.’” Mahil says she has never described this night in detail, not even to her husband. Tears pour down her face. “It was a completely different person, like Jekyll and Hyde.” She remembers seeing Singh’s kachera, traditional white undergarments meant to symbolise sexual purity, as he assaulted her. “I was trying to struggle all the time. I felt so weak – like, why can’t I get out of this? All the self-defence classes I’d done. When he took the kachera off, I had this burst of energy and managed to fight him off.” She says Singh immediately turned back into the decent young man she knew. He was apologetic and tearful. “He said, ‘Oh God, I’m so sorry.’ And I said, ‘Get out, I’ll call the police, just get out.’” Before he left, he made a strange request. “He said, ‘Can I tell a friend about it?’ And I said, ‘Yes, just get out.’” *** The following day Mahil was a wreck. She took the exam, but she never told the police. “I thought it was my fault. I let him stay – no good Sikh girl does that. What if my family found out, what if the community found out? Who would believe me anyway? They would say I was leading him on.” She needn’t have feared being accused of making it up: Singh did tell a friend, later referred to in court as “Sonny”. Also a baptised Sikh, Sonny was eight years older than Singh, who saw him as a mentor. After Singh’s death, police found his message on Sonny’s phone: “Paji [brother] I broke your promise and tried to rape my best friend I don’t know what to do help.” Sonny told police he had kept the text, “in case Gagandip should need reminding to be a good Sikh”. Meanwhile, Mahil told her friend Shoker about the assault. The next month, Shoker introduced her to his friend Sonny, who said he’d heard she had been through a rough time; it was the same Sonny Singh had confided in. “He seemed a good-natured guy,” she says now. “Respectful, humble, quite wise, a bit older.” As the weeks passed, Mahil began to put the assault to the back of her mind. But in November, Shoker told her Sonny had discovered Singh had behaved inappropriately with other young women. Sonny, he said, wanted to meet Singh to remind him how important it is for a good Sikh to respect women –but Singh was no longer answering his phone to either of them. He suggested Mahil arrange to meet Singh; then he and Sonny would join them. It wouldn’t be hard: Singh was bombarding her with texts asking for forgiveness. But Mahil didn’t want to see him again, nor did she like the idea of tricking him. In early February 2011, phone records show she texted a friend to say: “Can’t lie to some1 … even tho he did the worst thing he cud to me.” But Shoker pressed her: he said she owed it to the other women Singh had allegedly harassed, and this made her reconsider. Around this time, she noticed Shoker’s feelings towards her changing. He told her he loved her; she said she didn’t feel the same, but saw him as a close friend, which he seemed to accept. On 18 February, Mahil told her brother, also called Harinder, that a man had tried to rape one of her friends. Would it be wrong to trick the man into meeting somebody who would give him a serious talking to? Harinder said he thought that was fine. She was too ashamed to say she was talking about herself. Mahil asked Harinder if he would meet Sonny, too, and tell her if he seemed genuine; she says she worried about the impact on Singh if a confrontation was handled wrongly. The following day, Harinder met Sonny in Woolwich, south London. “I was quite religious at the time,” he says now. “There are hardly any Sikhs where I live, so it was an opportunity to meet somebody new. We talked mainly about Sikh youth politics, then he said, ‘Gagan is in trouble and needs help. He keeps calling girls, and harassing them.’ If you decide to stick to a strict religious path but fall off it, you rely on the people around you to tell you right from wrong. In that context, a meeting made perfect sense.” Did Harinder know Singh? “We had met two or three times, and I understood Mundill knew him. I didn’t know how friendly they were.” Was there any suggestion of violence from Sonny? “Oh God, no. The question wasn’t even raised in my mind.” A day later the pair met again, this time with Mahil, and she agreed to set up a meeting. In her police statement a week later, she said she invited Singh to her house so she’d “feel safe”, with her housemates present. *** Mahil asked Singh over for 11pm on 25 February, to discuss the assault and their friendship. Why so late? “We were students; 11pm wasn’t late. Often we didn’t go to bed till 3am.” She had told her housemates about the assault. Now she told them Singh was coming to talk, and Shoker and a respected older Sikh were going to give him a lecture. She thought they would do this in the lounge, and asked her housemates if they’d leave them to it; it might be tense. Mahil drove to Brighton station to collect Sonny and Shoker, off a train from London. But instead of Sonny, Shoker introduced her to another 19-year-old. “This is Jason,” he said. In fact, it was Darren Peters, an old schoolfriend of Shoker’s – a bike mechanic and a petty criminal with a record for car theft.
Surely this must have seemed a big change of plan? Peters would not be giving Singh a lecture on Sikh morals. “It just seemed like a normal uni thing, where everyone brings their friends. When I look back, that’s another ‘what if’ moment. If I’d said, ‘Where’s Sonny, why’s he not here? This is dodgy.’ It didn’t occur to me to question all these things till afterwards.” But she did ask Shoker on the way back to the house. Sonny would be around later, he said. She bought food for the two men and cooked supper, introducing “Jason” to her housemates; they already knew Shoker. Meanwhile, Singh was on his way in his sister’s Mercedes; his BMW had broken down. At 4pm, he had texted Mahil: “Can we talk civil or do you just want me dead?” Phone records released in court show she texted a number of times to say he shouldn’t come if he was anxious; they could chat another day. She dreaded the encounter, Mahil says now, and hoped he would turn back. Singh arrived at 11pm. “I answered the door and he came with a teddy bear, and that threw me right off. I saw him how he used to be. He was friendly, and it made me feel confused.” She had asked Shoker and Peters to wait in the lounge so she could speak to Singh alone in her room. But when she walked in to her room, the two men were still there; before she could ask them to leave, Peters had pushed Singh against the wall and punched him. “When he threw the punch, I dropped the teddy bear. I ran out. I’d never seen anyone punched before. I ran up the stairs to find my housemates. I was hyperventilating, shaking. Even when Gagan called my name, I didn’t know what to do.” Why didn’t she go back downstairs with her friends to help Singh? (The lounge and her bedroom were in the basement.) She shakes her head. She says she was petrified, and it is something she will never forgive herself for. Police reports suggest the attack lasted 20 minutes: what was she doing during that time? Mahil says this is inaccurate; the attack lasted around five minutes. “Two of my housemates were cuddling me, trying to calm me down.”
The last thing she heard before the men left the house was movement at the basement back door, and Shoker saying he had hurt his hand, then a car driving away. She and her friend Live checked the front door, back door and basement room; they were gone. In her bedroom, her duvet was missing. “I was trying to make sense of it all. Where were my bedsheets? I was annoyed they’d not eaten the food. I said to my friend, ‘I’ve made them so much food! Why didn’t they eat it?’” Her friends made her a cup of tea and gave her a piece of the key lime pie she had bought for Peters and Shoker – a detail later picked up on by reporters. “They said I was eating pie while waiting to have my victim killed. It couldn’t be further from the truth.” Why didn’t she call the police? Again, she says she doesn’t know. She called Shoker at 2.30am and he didn’t pick up. At 2.50am he called back. Mahil asked what had happened: was Singh OK? He said everything was fine; they had taken him to see Sonny. At 4am, Mahil went to sleep in Live’s room. *** That morning, Singh’s sister Amandip called Mahil. She said her brother had not returned home, and she had heard he was visiting her the night before. At first, Mahil told her she had not seen Singh; then she said he had come to the door, but she had not let him in. Why? She says she panicked. How could she tell Amandip the last time she saw her brother he was being punched? And that she had not thought it worth calling his family or the police? She rang Singh, but there was no answer. She rang Shoker and told him Amandip had called: was Singh OK? Shoker was evasive. Then she got a series of texts from friends saying they had heard a rumour, from people working at Singh’s TV channel, that he had killed himself. She was distraught. “I thought, because I betrayed his trust and lied to him, he’d gone and killed himself.” Soon after, she got a disturbing call from Shoker, who told her: “I’m ready to go to jail for you for 21 years.” She was terrified, and told Live. (In court, this call was used against both Mahil and Shoker as proof that they had planned to kill Singh. Although Live was a witness for the defence, and remains a close friend of Mahil’s, the prosecution also made her their key witness.) That afternoon, Live told her the BBC was reporting a body had been found in a burned-out Mercedes in Blackheath, not far from where Shoker lived. Mahil called her brother Harinder and told him what had happened; they agreed she should call the police. She told an officer she had received texts from friends suggesting Singh had killed himself and heard the reports of a car with a body in it – a car like the one Singh had been driving. Mahil was asked to attend Lewisham police station immediately, where she had a five-minute conversation with an officer. She tried to summarise her friendship with Singh, the sexual assault, the fact she had invited him over to confront him. She told them Singh had come to her home and left. But she left out two crucial facts: that Shoker and Peters were also there, and that she had seen him punched in the face. At 9.40pm on 26 February, Mahil was arrested on suspicion of murder. She spent the night in the station cell. Why didn’t she tell the police the full story? “I panicked,” Mahil says again. She looks drained. “I can’t explain it more than that.” On the evening of 27 February, she was formally interviewed under caution in the presence of a duty solicitor. This time, Mahil says, she told them everything she knew. But the police did not accept her version of events, and nor did the Crown Prosecution Service – she had omitted key details in her first interview and lied to Singh’s sister, why would she be telling the truth now? At 6.50am on 28 February, Mahil was charged with murder. “I had to go to a magistrates court where they said, ‘She’s remanded to custody.’ And I sat in the cell thinking, I don’t know what that means. I thought it was like custody of children – something that protected you. I didn’t realise I was in prison.” Shoker and Peters were also charged with murder. Mahil discovered the chronology of what had happened on the night of Singh’s death from a television in the induction room at Holloway prison. A news report said that Singh had been savagely beaten, wrapped in a duvet, taken from her house and put in the boot of the Mercedes. His hands had been tied with a satnav cable. The autopsy later suggested he was unconscious when the car was set on fire. *** The trial began at the Old Bailey in London on 5 December 2011. Mahil, Shoker and Peters all pleaded not guilty to murder. On the stand, Shoker said things had got out of hand; the plan had been to take Singh back to London, where Sonny could talk to him. The defence for both men pointed out that, if the plan was to kill Singh, it was extraordinary that they had turned up without a weapon or means of restraint. When cross-examined by the defence, Shoker acknowledged that Mahil had been told Singh would simply be given a tough talking to; if the men intended any violence, she did not. But the prosecution argued that Shoker was infatuated with Mahil: of course he would protect her in this way.
What of Sonny, whose idea the meeting was, according to Mahil and Shoker? Interviewed under police caution on 6 April 2011, he said he had driven Shoker and Peters to Charlton station on 25 February, but didn’t know they were going to Brighton. He also admitted meeting them later that night, at Shoker’s home in Shooter’s Hill, Greenwich, where Sonny’s VW Golf was being kept as a favour. “I got a call from Ravi at 1am: he thought someone had been messing around with the cars. I was not pleased, but drove over.” Sonny said he checked the cars and left. Shoker and Peters had arrived in Singh’s Mercedes; at this point, he would still have been alive. Sonny told police he had never met Mahil or her brother. He was not called as a witness for the prosecution or defence, though the jury asked twice when he would give evidence; it was not clear to lawyers on either side that he would further their case. The Guardian contacted his brother and local temple, who said they would pass on our request for a comment. Sonny did not respond. *** On the stand, Peters and Shoker turned against each other. Shoker blamed Peters for the violence, saying he had bought the petrol, poured it over Singh and the car, and set fire to it; Peters claimed he had simply done the driving and not witnessed the attack. He said he had been hired by Sonny to break into the Mercedes, and that when he had earlier tried to withdraw from this plan, Sonny had threatened him. Peters also claimed it was Sonny who had said they had to “get rid of the car”. Anything Mahil said in court seemed to work against her. She called Shoker her “gangsta” friend, and the jury took it literally. She told the court she had agreed Singh would be taught a “serious lesson”, which the prosecution argued was an admission she had consented to violence. But, she says, she meant just that: a lesson from Sonny about Sikh values. When giving evidence, Mahil repeated that she never thought there would be violence. Not even a slap, she was asked by the prosecution. Well, maybe a slap, she conceded.
Why did she say that? “They kept asking: ‘Surely you must have thought this or that would happen?’ And you’re thinking retrospectively, well, what’s the worst I think could have happened? The reality was that I didn’t consider there would be any violence. I was expecting a religious, mentor-like man. I thought they were good guys.” Her defence knew it was impossible to prove Mahil expected no violence, but argued all the circumstances pointed to that. If she had been masterminding a violent attack, would she have told her housemates, and invited the victim at a time when they would all be in? Would she have suggested he turn back? The court heard outstanding character references for Mahil, in which a recurrent theme was her naivety. A former teacher said: “If Mundill has a fault, it could be said she is naive, believing all the people she comes into contact with are like her.” Her friend Sarah said: “I don’t think she thought anything bad happened in the world.” Her housemate, B, described Mahil as “something of an agony aunt. She used to spend hours talking to people about their problems, and do anything she could to help.” But it was her second statement to the police that left a lasting impression. She said she remembered Mundil saying she wanted Singh dead. Under cross-examination, B admitted she may have been confused about her second statement. After nearly three months, the trial ended on 24 February 2012. Shoker was sentenced to 22 years for murder, Peters to 12 years for manslaughter, and Mahil to six years for GBH with intent. The prosecution conceded that she could not have foreseen that Singh would be set alight. Mahil’s sentence was controversial. There were protests outside the Old Bailey by people who thought she should have been convicted of murder, while women’s groups claimed the assault should have been taken into account and lowered her sentence. But Mahil says she has never been interested in that defence, because it concurs with the prosecution’s narrative. In sentencing Mahil, Judge Paul Worsley said: “He [Singh] was lured by you, Mundill, to your student house in Brighton where you intended, as the jury have found, that he suffer really serious harm. You had collected Ravi and Darren from the railway station for that very purpose.” Mahil was “manipulative, vengeful and deceitful”, Worsley said, adding: “You have sacrificed your outstanding character and future career.” The trial was widely reported as the “honeytrap murder”, with Shoker and Peters the “hitmen” and Mahil the ruthless figure at the heart of a “twisted love triangle”. *** Even in jail, Mahil says she expected to be told it was all a mistake. But her appeal was rejected. There had been nothing wrong with the trial process, and there was no new evidence; it was simply her word against the prosecution. At the appeal, the evidence cited to uphold Mahil’s conviction appeared damning. It was stated that Mahil had told police that Shoker and Peters had “pulled out sheets from a bag and put on black fingerless gloves” before Singh arrived. Mahil says this is not quite right; what she meant got lost in translation. “Earlier in the evening, I noticed Darren putting on black fingerless gloves, the kind you’d wear to keep your hands warm. I didn’t think anything of it. As for the sheet, when I was talking to Live later, I said I thought I’d glimpsed a sheet in my bedroom when I opened the door, but I was never sure. We’re talking a couple of seconds before I ran out.”
The appeal judges also said she had discouraged her housemates from investigating the struggle in her bedroom. Mahil disputes this: she says she could barely get any words out. In jail, at HMPs Holloway and Send, Mahil was a model prisoner. She took courses, qualified as a personal trainer and worked in the prison gym. She also became politicised about the justice system. “I thought, ‘Why would [then justice secretary] Mr Grayling ban books? Books are good. Why are they turning all the single cells into bunk beds? Oh, it’s because they don’t have space. Why are there so many women here with severe mental health problems? They need help. I was trying to fix things.” She also had to find a way of coming to terms with the fact that she had been jailed for her part in a vicious murder. “I told myself I was guilty of this because I lied to Gagan. That was my way of coping.” How did her parents cope? “They were so supportive. They said, ‘We’re going to get through this together, just look after yourself, make sure you’re eating.’” She wishes she had been more open with them as a teenager: “Why did I ever hide anything from them? I’d built this perception that there were things I couldn’t talk to them about, that was self-perpetuating of the culture I was in. But my family were never like that. They would have understood.” Does she feel any responsibility for Singh’s death? “I feel morally culpable, in terms of, what if I hadn’t lied to him and this had never happened? But from feeling guilty about lying to somebody to being responsible for his death – that’s just a massive disconnect.” Mahil was released on licence in 2014, after serving half of her six-year sentence. She already knew a criminal record meant she could never become a doctor, but she was about to discover how limited her options were. “I can’t become a nurse, an accountant, a lawyer. I can’t become anything caring because of the violent record I have. I thought, what am I doing with my life?” She went back to university and graduated from King’s College London in philosophy, politics and economics. In 2016, she married Varinder Singh Bola, a rising Labour star. The Daily Mail ran pictures of them taken before their wedding, under the headline: “Honey-trap woman appears every inch the happy bride as she gazes into her new husband’s eyes only yards away from where her former admirer was MURDERED.” In January 2019, Bola won the race to be mayor of Redbridge. Singh’s sister Amandip told the Sun that Mahil had been allowed to “ingratiate herself into polite society… But she doesn’t deserve any of it. Not once has she ever admitted her guilt or apologised to us.” Four days later, Bola stood down. At the time, Mahil was working for an organisation that supports victims of hate crimes. But when junior members of staff read about her conviction (which she had declared to the charity), they said they were uncomfortable working with her. “I’d been there five months with no problems. I thought, OK, if they don’t feel comfortable with me, I will resign.” Does she understand why Singh’s family were upset at her being mayoress? “Of course.” Mahil says there isn’t a day that goes by without her thinking of him or them. “I can’t begin to imagine what it is like to lose your son or brother in such a way. The way he died…” She trails off. Amandip Singh says she feels no pity for Mahil. Last week she told the Guardian: “Mundil says she is also suffering. If there were any truth in this, she would not have taken her pre-wedding pictures within walking distance of where Gagandip was murdered. She had been plotting this attack for months – there were several meetings between her brother and her gangster friends. She knew exactly what was going to happen that evening, and instead continued to eat her key lime pie with her housemates.” Mahil now works for Working Chance, a charity that helps women with criminal convictions find jobs. She says it has given her a degree of self-belief. “For so long, people said, ‘Time is the best healer, you’ll be fine – keep yourself busy and active.’ But time hasn’t healed. Now, for the first time in a long time, I wasn’t demonised.” She is also a trustee on three other criminal justice charities. “I just want to make good out of a bad situation. If I can help anybody else, that’s where I’m trying to head.” But, she says, her workplace is still an exception when it comes to not judging her. “You don’t feel you can go to the temple, or to a dinner party, without people looking at you and thinking, ‘Oh, is that that girl, who did that to that boy? She killed someone, what a bitch.’” A couple of months after we first talk, she tells us she has written to Shoker to let him know she is talking to a newspaper. He has now served nearly 10 years of his 22-year sentence. She says he rang her and apologised for ruining her life. How does she feel about him now? “Angry – but also sorry for him. I don’t think he intended to kill Gagan.” Spend any time talking to Mahil and she comes across as a bright, kind woman. Yet she knows the best she can hope for is to emerge from this terrible crime as a weak, naive liar. Why is she willing to tell her story now, rather than quietly getting on with her life? Because, she says, she can just about live with that version of herself – weak and naive – but not with the idea that she ruthlessly plotted Singh’s death. “I’ve had death threats and attacks on my family,” she says. “There are moments when I’m hopeful that this can’t last for ever. But I still feel like I’m living in prison. It might not have those four walls, but the psychological prison I’m in is almost worse.”"
2021-02-12T18:47:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Fresh inquest ordered into New Lodge Six killings in Belfast,"The attorney general for Northern Ireland has ordered a new inquest into the deaths of six men allegedly shot by the British army in Belfast in 1973. Families of the men, known as the New Lodge Six, for the area where they died, have campaigned for an inquest for decades. They hope the coroner will be able to force the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and the Ministry of Defence to submit documentation and compel any surviving soldiers to face cross-examination. A gunman firing from a car shot James McCann, 19, and James Sloan, 19, as they stood outside a bar at the junction of New Lodge Road and Antrim Road. Soldiers believed to have been in nearby flats shot the other four men outside a different bar after midnight that night. Anthony Campbell, who had been celebrating his 19th birthday, was hit 17 times. Brendan Maguire, 32, and John Loughran, 34, were said to have been shot as they tried to drag Campbell out of the line of fire. A witness said Ambrose Hardy, 24, was shot in the head after emerging from the bar waving a white cloth. In a statement at the time, the army claimed all six were IRA gunmen and that there was a gun battle. No guns were recovered and there is no evidence any of the men were armed. Several were not in the IRA. Witnesses said the shootings were unprovoked. The attorney general, Brenda King, notified the victims’ group Relatives for Justice (RFJ) of her decision on Friday. Her predecessor, John Larkin, called for a fresh police investigation in 2018 but that did not happen. Jim McCann’s nephew Daniel McCready welcomed news of the inquest. “I am glad this day has finally come,” he said. Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour party also welcomed the decision. “I pay tribute to the families for the determination and dignity in their long campaign,” said Carál Ní Chuilín, a Sinn Féin MLA. “The families of the New Lodge Six, like all relatives bereaved by the conflict, are entitled to the truth.” Unresolved crimes from the Troubles have dogged policing and politics in Northern Ireland since the 1998 Good Friday agreement. There is suspicion that Downing Street wishes to shield as many as 200 former members of the British security forces who have been under official investigation for alleged criminal actions during the Troubles."
2021-02-12T17:59:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Libby Squire murderer jailed for minimum of 27 years ,"The man who raped and murdered the Hull University student Libby Squire and dumped her body in a river has given a life sentence with a minimum term of 27 years. Pawel Relowicz encountered the intoxicated and probably hypothermic student late on 31 January 2019 and drove her to Oak Road playing fields in Hull where he carried out the crimes. Jurors at Sheffield crown court deliberated for six days before finding Relowicz, 26, guilty on Thursday.
On Friday he was sentenced to a minimum of 18 years for the rape, to run concurrently with the life sentence for murder and with previous sentences for voyeurism, outraging public decency and sexually motivated burglaries. Relowicz has been a serving prisoner throughout his remand but none of those days will be deducted from the minimum term, meaning his sentence started on Friday. He showed no emotion during the four-week trial, and on Friday he stood and stared at Squire’s parents, Lisa and Russ Squire, for more than a minute as the sentence was delivered. The judge, Mrs Justice Lambert, said Relowicz had been correctly described by another judge in a previous case as having conducted a “perverted campaign of sexually deviant behaviour”. She said: “He also considered you to be potentially a very dangerous individual. Again, he was correct to do so. Your offending escalated, you grew increasingly emboldened. No doubt you were increasingly confident you would not and could not be caught.” Lambert accepted that Relowicz may not have intended to kill 21-year-old Squire, but she called it a “malignant twist of fate” that his path had crossed with that of the confused and upset student that night. “You remained in the shadow of the treeline until you were sure she [Squire] was alone. From the moment you intercepted her, Liberty Squire did not stand a chance.” On the night of the murder, Relowicz had “prowled the streets” of Hull’s student area in a state of “heightened sexual arousal” in search of a vulnerable young woman. Upon encountering Squire, Relowicz offered her a lift home, and he claimed at trial that he had “only wanted to help”. She was last seen on CCTV getting into Relowicz’s car. The jury dismissed Relowicz’s claim that they had consensual sex, and accepted the prosecution case that he cajoled or forced her into his car before driving to a secluded area of Oak Road playing fields. He then attacked her before dumping her, dead or dying, in the river. Pathologists were unable to determine how or when she died because her body had been in the water for almost seven weeks when it was found in the Humber Estuary. In a victim impact statement, Squire’s mother said: “There are no words that can explain the torture of living without my Libby. I now live in two worlds where I live as a mother, wife, friend and employee, but there is also a world that will run parallel and it’s a dark and lonely world. “In this world I long to die so I can be with my girl. I wake up with disappointment that I will live another day. My memories of her are always in my thoughts and I will never allow our bond to be broken.”"
2021-02-12T17:39:06Z,uk-news,UK news,"Grenfell firm continued selling cladding despite high-rise fires in Middle East, inquiry hears","The Grenfell Tower cladding manufacturer Arconic considered withdrawing its combustible panels from sale before the disaster after a spate of high-rise cladding fires in the Middle East but decided against it for “commercial reasons”, the public inquiry was told this week. Deborah French, a former UK sales manager for Arconic, said that around May 2013 there had been discussion in the company about withdrawing the polyethylene core material. There had been several high-rise cladding fires in the United Arab Emirates, where “they used to sell tens and tens and tens of thousands of sq metres of that stuff every month”. She said a rival, Alucobond, had been considering withdrawing its version, but Arconic decided not to, in part, French agreed under questioning by Richard Millett QC, counsel to the inquiry, because it would have made less money selling the fire retardant version. Asked if safety was a consideration, French replied: “I don’t recall any conversations of that nature.” The decision to keep selling the combustible panels emerged in the first evidence from witnesses for Arconic, which made the plastic-filled rain-screen cladding that spread the fire that killed 72 people. The inquiry heard that the company was “very secret” about its products and French, who sold the material, knew in 2015 that the panels were combustible but did not tell anyone on the Grenfell project. The inquiry saw a transcript of a phone call a week after the disaster between French and a cladding system designer, who was furious that Arconic appeared to have sold the panels using a UK certificate about its fire safety that did not show, as European certificates did, that it was highly flammable. The phone call was taped without French’s knowledge and obtained by Scotland Yard detectives investigating possible manslaughter and health and safety crimes.
According to the transcript, John Simmons of Simco put it to French that Arconic may be “guilty of corporate manslaughter” because it had not revealed the true performance of its panels and that tests on the materials found it “goes up like a fucking bonfire”. They discussed the validity of the UK safety certificate Arconic provided to customers, and which came from the British Board of Agrément (BBA). The BBA had said the panels achieved a class 0 rating for fire spread, the safest rating. But French knew Arconic’s Reynobond 55 PE in cassette form, as used at Grenfell, performed worse. European fire classification reports using an alphabetic scale gave it an E rating. French told Simmons “they made a decision not to put it in the public domain”. In the phone call, Simmons asked: “Would they put it to the public domain that their PE core was highly flammable, knowing very well that everybody they’d supplied it to was gonna sue ’ em?” “No they probably wouldn’t no,” French replied. “This has happened that we’re in – fucking we’re right in the middle of it,” said Simmons. “We’re gonna be dragged … right into the middle of it and we can’t get no answers out of Reynobond and now our customers want fucking answers.” Simmons, who was worried about being held liable, asked French to search for paperwork that would show what claims had been made about fire performance. But French had left Arconic at the end of 2014 and had since moved house. She told Simmons: “I shredded loads of it.” The inquiry has previously heard that Arconic executives in France knew the panels showed “bad behaviour exposed to fire”. Claude Wehrle, a technical manager at the company who is one of three current and former Arconic staff refusing to give evidence, knew in the years before Arconic’s panels were sold for Grenfell that they were dangerous. Lawyers for Arconic have said that “a responsible specifier would have taken into account the combustible nature of ACM PE Arconic”, that the designers and builders failed to account for fire regulations, and when the panels were sold for use at Grenfell, no one in Arconic knew of any fires that had resulted in loss of life or serious injury. The inquiry continues on Monday, with Claude Schmidt, the managing director of Arconic’s French subsidiary, which sold the panels, giving evidence."
2021-02-12T17:13:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Mismanagement claims against Kids Company founder thrown out,"The founder and former chief executive of Kids Company, Camila Batmanghelidjh, has been exonerated by a court of allegations that the charity she created collapsed because she had failed to operate it on a proper and financially sustainable basis. After a three-and-a-half-year legal case, the court threw out claims by the official receiver that Batmanghelidjh and seven former trustees of the charity failed to properly manage the charity in the tumultuous final months of its existence. The judge said that while the charity, which went into insolvency in August 2015, had experienced cashflow difficulties, its board had taken steps to ensure it had a plan to manage the challenges it faced, and the charity might have survived had it not been brought down by unsubstantiated allegations of sexual abuse. The judge praised Batmanghelidjh for the “enormous dedication she showed to vulnerable young people over many years” and her achievements in building a charity that “until 2014 was widely regarded as a highly successful one, doing what senior members of the government rightly described as incredible work.” Mrs Justice Falk added: “It would be unfortunate if the events the focus of this decision were allowed to eclipse those achievements.” The judge also praised the seven trustees for their role in the final months of Kids Company. “Most charities would, I think, be delighted to have available to them individuals with the abilities and experience that the trustees in this case possess. It is vital that the actions of public bodies do not have the effect of dissuading able and experienced individuals from becoming or remaining charity trustees.” There had been no dishonesty, bad faith or personal gain on the part of Batmanghelidjh or the trustees, Mrs Justice Falk said. Nor had there been any inappropriate expenditure on children assisted by the charity. Batmanghelidjh told the Guardian: “I’m so relieved, for the children, for the staff, the trustees, for the volunteers. They have been shamed by the many false stories about Kids Company over the years. I’m so glad I stood up against it and didn’t back down. This judgment brings tears to my eyes. I’m so glad that finally the facts won.” The official receiver had asked the court to disqualify Batmanghelidjh as a company director for six years for her alleged part in the collapse of the charity. Although she was not formally a member of the board, the receiver argued her importance as the charity’s founder and chief executive made her a “de facto” trustee. It also sought four-year director bans for five Kids Company trustees at the time of its closure in August 2015: its former chair, the TV executive Alan Yentob, Richard Handover, Jane Tyler, Andrew Webster and Francesca Robinson. A three-year ban was sought for Vincent O’Brien, and a two-and-a-half-year ban for Erica Bolton. The court judgment will clear the way for a separate Charity Commission inquiry to be published into the administration, governance and financial management of Kids Company. The commission’s statutory inquiry has been ongoing since August 2015 but was put on hold when the official receiver took action. The official receiver had argued, backed with thousands of pages of evidence, that Kids Company was poorly governed and managed, that it operated inadequate financial controls and failed to put away sufficient financial reserves. The charity had knowingly operated an unsustainable model, it argued. However, Mrs Justice Falk ruled that while aspects of it were high risk, the Kids Company operating model was not unsustainable in principle. She said the board and Batmanghelidjh had formulated a restructuring plan along with the government to refinance the charity. “In summary, the court’s decision is the allegation is not made out against any of the directors and they are not unfit; in other words, the case against them fails,” said Mrs Justice Falk. Set up by Batmanghelidjh in south London in 1996, Kids Company became one of the best-known charities of the early 21st century. It counted on high-profile political backing from the likes of Gordon Brown and David Cameron, and support from artists such as Coldplay and JK Rowling. Iranian-born Batmanghelidjh, a psychotherapist by training, pioneered an intensive therapeutic model of working with maltreated and traumatised youngsters, often taking on the care of children who had been rejected by mainstream services after experiencing sexual abuse, violence, addiction and mental illness. Batmanghelidjh became a celebrity, yet despite raising hundreds of millions of pounds from the public and philanthropists and winning more than £42m in government grants over a 15-year period, Kids Company often struggled to keep its finances on track as its costs and ambitions rose. A month before it collapsed, Batmanghelidjh announced she was to step down as part of a £3m Whitehall plan to refinance the charity. That restructuring never took place, and in August 2015 the trustees wound up Kids Company after the Metropolitan police announced an inquiry into allegations of sexual abuse at the charity, revealed by BBC Newsnight. The police inquiry subsequently found no evidence of criminality or failures of safeguarding. Batmanghelidjh and Yentob have claimed the “malicious and untrue allegations” of child abuse against the charity were deliberately orchestrated to fatally damage it and were directly responsible for its closure. Two parliamentary reports have been published on Kids Company. The first, by the public accounts committee in November 2015, found tens of millions of government grants were spent by the charity without proper Whitehall assessment of whether it achieved value for money. A February 2016 report by the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee blamed a combination of “negligent” trustees and the “unaccountable and dominant” Batmanghelidjh for the charity’s failure."
2021-02-12T15:44:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Part of River Thames freezes amid sub-zero temperatures ,"In scenes reminiscent of the Great Freeze of 1963, part of the River Thames froze over as temperatures in Britain plummeted to sub-zero temperatures this week. The bitter chill from the Baltic led to the river at Teddington Lock, south-west London, partially freezing over, becoming a skating rink for local birdlife. At this section of the Thames, on the non-tidal side, water flows more slowly, so it is more susceptible to icing over. It did so to spectacular effect in January 1963, the coldest winter for 200 years, as blizzards covered the country in deep snow drifts. Surreal scenes included a man cycling on the Thames near Windsor Bridge. Elsewhere, people skated outside Buckingham Palace, and a milkman delivered his round on skis as snow lay on the ground for 62 consecutive days in the south of England. Modern times, however, have seen nothing compared to January 1814, when the last Frost Fair on the Thames was held. Then Londoners were able dance, play skittles, and drink purl – a mix of gin and wormwood wine similar to vermouth – from pop-up pubs and gingerbread sellers who set up stalls on the thick ice. Oxen were roasted on spits, and an elephant was even marched across the river alongside Blackfriars Bridge.
A Times report from the period said: “In some parts the ice was several feet thick, while in others it was dangerous to venture upon.” The fair sprang up at the heart of the capital, between London Bridge and Blackfriars. Between 1309 and 1814, during which Britain was said to have experienced a “little ice age”, the Thames froze at least 23 times, and on five of those occasions impromptu frost fairs – described as being a cross between a Christmas market, circus and boisterous party – were held. At the time of the first frost fair, in 1608, the river froze over for six weeks. London is unlikely to witness such a spectacle again. Apart from the climate crisis, the architecture on the Thames has changed. The new London Bridge, built in 1831 with fewer arches, allows more seawater to pass up river, and the saltier water means a lower freezing point. And the construction of the Embankment, later in the 19th century, narrowed the Thames, making it faster flowing. Peter Finch, chairman of the River Thames Society, said that the river above Teddington Lock has frozen before in recent times, usually just above the lock gates, but this has depended on the number of boats coming through. This year, partly due to the pandemic, there has been little river traffic so the lock gates have opened less frequently. He added the Thames is tidal below the lock and has not frozen over and is unlikely to, given the flow."
2021-02-12T14:37:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Wales is first UK nation to offer Covid jab to top four priority groups,"Wales has become the first UK nation to have offered a Covid jab to everyone in the top four priority groups, the first minister, Mark Drakeford has announced. Last month, Drakeford was forced to defend Wales’s vaccination programme after criticism of delays from opposition parties and doctors. But at a press conference on Friday, he said that 66 days after people in Wales first began getting the jab, the key target had been achieved. “I’m incredibly proud to say that we have achieved the first milestone in our vaccination strategy,” he said. “And what that means is that we have offered vaccination to everyone in the first four priority groups – that’s everyone over 70, all frontline health and social care workers, everyone living and working in an old person’s care home and everyone who are [sic] clinically extremely vulnerable.
“Now this has been a phenomenal effort and it is thanks to the hard work of the thousands of NHS staff, volunteers and military personnel across Wales, who have been vaccinating people every day of the week.” The latest figures, published on Friday, show that 715,944 people in Wales have received the first dose of the vaccine – more than one in five of the population. Drakeford said there were 740,000 people in Wales in the top four priority groups, which were drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. All UK nations were aiming to offer a first dose of the jab to people in the four groups – encompassing 15 million people across the UK – by 15 February.
Drakeford said there would be a small dip in the volume of the vaccine going to Wales before it increased again in March, when it would begin administering first doses of people in the next five priority groups, which encompasses residents aged 50 to 69 and everyone over 16 with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality. In the meantime, he said, over the next two weeks Wales would be able to continue to provide second doses to all of those who had already been booked.
He said Wales remained “firmly on track” to complete the priority groups five to nine by the spring, in line with the UK target of everyone over 50 getting their first jab by May, and raised the prospect of easing restrictions in the near future. He told reporters: “Provided we continue to see levels of infection fall in Wales and we see the impact on our health service being drained away and we see our vaccination programme delivering what we hope it will do in terms of protection it will offer it to people, if that is the path we are on, then the pattern in Wales, as we move towards the spring … we will be able, slowly and cautiously, [to] lift the restrictions that are currently in place in all aspects of our lives. “That will include the tourism industry and it will include those aspects of family life which are denied to us all at the moment.”"
2021-02-12T14:07:56Z,uk-news,UK news,"Digested week: we may not have holidays, but at least we have a lawyer cat","Monday Today I tweeted that I’d watched the new action-disaster movie Greenland, which involves Gerard Butler rushing to get his family to a government bunker in the face of some extinction-level event. Within minutes my phone was pinging with messages from friends, all of them wishing to make it very clear that if – no, I see most of them actually said “when” – we are faced with such a thing ourselves, they will be rushing precisely nowhere. “All that EFFORT!” wrote one. “And for what?! To scratch an existence amidst the smoking ruins. Feck off.” Others detailed plans involving long-husbanded bottles of expensive whisky or “finally lighting that £50 scented candle”. I couldn’t agree more. When our time comes, I will sit back and let the comets fall, content in the knowledge that I lived surrounded by my soulmates. Tuesday It is the cat video to end all cat videos and the internet has rightly gone mad for it. A 30-second clip of an online Texas court hearing shows one of the lawyers appearing on screen as – well, you may be ahead of me here – a cat. The judge points out that the lawyer, one Rod Ponton, seems to have a cat filter on. Ponton gives the kind of small strangulated cry that suggests he is, all at once, aware of everything. The deep, deep knowledge of the intransigence of computers, the endless vicissitudes of life and the malevolence of fate are all contained within that tiny groan. His assistant is trying to remove it, he says. Straight faces are maintained, as befits a situation that is essentially that of a man dying a thousand deaths while looking like a lachrymose, semi-cartoon kitten. Ponton professes himself willing to go on in his enforced felinity. “I am live,” he assures the assembled judiciary, with a kind of desperate nobility. “I am not a cat.” Amid all the hilarity and rightful celebration of a half-minute that seems to contain most of humanity’s absurdity and grandeur, a question does quietly assert itself: isn’t that exactly what a cat would say?
Wednesday I am 46 years old and I have just bought my first cookbook. That is how much, my friends, I loathe cooking. I hate reading about meals, I hate thinking of meals. I hate shopping for meals, preparing meals and applying heat in various form for various times to make my shambolic assemblages palatable to the ever-gaping maws of my family. No, I don’t find my own spiritual nourishment in nourishing them. I find it a criminally boring waste of time and resent every moment it parts me from the 1,001 better things I have to be getting on with. People say that food is a way of expressing yourself and they’re quite right. Putting edible meals – the four I have in my repertoire, in a rotation interspersed with takeaways, Charlie Bigham’s pies, and fish fingers and oven chips – on the table is for me a thrice-daily reminder of how utterly lacking in soul, sensuality and generosity of spirit I am. What does it tell you about yourself when you look at a husband or a child diving delightedly into a repast you have created, and are not suffused with a warm and loving sense of maternal and marital satisfaction but filled with bitterness at the time it takes for the bastard thing to be demolished versus the time it took to make? Nothing good, I assure you. So. A cookbook. It’s meant to break me out of the cycle of loathing. I’m sending myself on a forced march through new recipes, searching for something to tip the balance of time invested versus time taken for consumption in my favour, and make me into some semblance of A Good Person. This may be the first time a book has ever failed me.
Thursday Ah, the outrage – both genuine and stoked by various outposts of the media who think the best way to help in a pandemic is to make everything worse – at the suggestion that holiday options might be curtailed this year. What larks. Does nobody realise – or recall – that nobody in Britain went on holiday at all before 1974, and that was just a family from Cheshire who got lost on the way to see an auntie in Keswick and had to stay at an unexpectedly nice pub for the night. It’s only in the last nanosecond of human history that it’s come to be considered a human right. Once this is all over, the smallest foray anywhere is going to feel like an epic adventure. Two weeks in Madagascar after spending a year watching Madagascar on repeat with a five-year-old would make you insensible. We’re all going to be like vampires cringing away from the sun. We are going to have to build up tolerances we’ve lost without ever knowing we had them. Ordinary lives are going to be all the excitement we can cope with. And it’s still going to be wonderful. Friday “My word,” said Mike Parker Pearson, a professor of British later prehistory at University College London, “it’s tempting to believe it.” And when you hear a professor of British later prehistory lose his shit like that, you better KNOW something big has gone down. In this case, almost literally, as archaeologists appear to have found a circle of indentations in Wales that precisely match the Stonehenge monoliths. It provides potential proof of the historical foundation of the account in Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Arthurian tales of Merlin capturing such a monument in Wales to have it relocated in England. The Matter of Britain just got real(er), people! Exciting enough in itself, of course, but it also gives a further boost to my own particular faith: that the Loch Ness monster is real, and will be discovered in my lifetime. I long for this above all else. Come on, Matter of Scotland! You can do it, I know you can."
2021-02-12T13:54:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Queen's property chief delays sale of Scottish seabed windfarm plots,"The Queen’s property manager in Scotland has delayed the auction of Scottish seabed plots for windfarms after runaway bids for leases in England and Wales handed the Queen and the Treasury a multibillion-pound windfall. Crown Estate Scotland paused its auction in order to carry out a review of the process after the “unprecedented” bidding in an auction for England and Wales lease options last week reached record highs. The Queen and the Treasury could share a windfall of up to £9bn over the next decade from the England and Wales auction after energy companies including BP offered to pay five times more than expected for the option to build new windfarms. Crown Estate Scotland decided with ministers in the Scottish parliament that it would be “sensible” to undertake a six-week review of the structure for its own auction to ensure it secures “a fair price” for the seabed sites along the Scottish coast. Many within the renewable energy industry have blamed the structure of the Crown Estate’s auction for allowing aggressive “closed envelope” bids from oil companies to skew the market value of the seabed lease. BP took its first step into the UK’s offshore wind sector during last week’s auction with bids for two windfarms worth 15 times the rate paid by developers in the past, raising concerns within the industry that the rocketing seabed prices would inflate the cost of reaching the UK’s climate targets. Energy executives have warned that the costs would ultimately mean higher energy bills, and lower returns for green investors. The UK government hopes to build enough offshore windfarms to power every home in the UK by 2030. Crown Estate Scotland manages the Queen’s property, but unlike the Crown Estate – which manages property in the rest of the UK – it does not return its profits to the Treasury or the Queen. Instead, the revenues are handed to the Scottish Consolidated Fund, which in turn finances the Scottish government. The review will conclude on 24 March, but Crown Estate Scotland has not set a new date for the start of the auction, which was due to begin next month. Amanda Bryan, the chair of Crown Estate Scotland, said the “unprecedented outcome” of the auction for England and Wales “has, overnight, changed the market dynamics around offshore wind leasing, and could have significant implications for offshore wind development in Scotland”.
The Crown Estate’s auction for seabed plots in England and Wales guaranteed the Treasury and the monarch total payments of £879m a year from windfarm developers, for up to 10 years. This would hand the Queen a share worth close to £220m a year to run the official royal household and pay for repairs to Buckingham Palace. Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish government’s cabinet secretary for environment and climate, said: “In light of the significant changes that we are now seeing in the wider UK offshore wind market, ministers have agreed with Crown Estate Scotland that it would be sensible to review our leasing process.”"
2021-02-12T09:51:49Z,uk-news,UK news,Andy Flurry and Mary Queen of Salt: craze for naming Scottish gritters goes global,"It started as a winter safety campaign for school children living in the Scottish Highlands but has since captured the urgent need for escapism during lockdown. Hundreds of thousands of people are now following the daily journeys of nearly 100 Scottish gritter lorries and snowploughs, vehicles luxuriating in names such as Spreddie Van Halen, Sir Andy Flurry, Skid Vicious, Gritallica and Mary Queen of Salt. With much of Scotland gripped by the heaviest winter snow since the “beast from the east” three years ago, gritters are working round the clock on the country’s motorways and trunk roads, their every mile visible on an online tracker. Similar to the vicarious thrill of trainspotting from the warmth of your front room, the website allows fans to track Salt Disney heading up the A77; Licence to Chill trundling slowly through East Lothian or Sled Zeppelin inching through Argyll. Sir Chris Hoy, the cyclist and the UK’s most successful Olympian, was delighted when a gritter in the south-west was christened Sir Grits Hoy. News of the tracker, set up five years ago by Transport Scotland, a government agency, has spread worldwide. It has a small fanbase in California, and became more famous in the US when an ecstatic TikTok user, @chibichan_777, spotted that one gritter was called Gritney Spears. In one 24-hour period a week ago, the tracker site had more than 110,000 hits and has attracted interest from radio stations in the US and Russia. By contrast, it usually has about 700,000 hits across a 365-day period, excluding the summer months when the tracker is offline and the gritters shuttered away. The naming trend has taken off just in time for the vicious Arctic weather that has gripped much of Scotland this month. Amey, the contractor which runs truck road gritters in the south-west of Scotland, is naming another 50 of its gritters every weekday this winter after a public appeal last year garnered 1,200 suggestions. Many were themed to mark the death of Sir Sean Connery, regarded as the most famous James Bond. The new names include: Coldfinger, You Only Grit Twice, and, after the Ayrshire town, TroonRaker. BEAR Scotland, the contractor that covers the remaining three-quarters of the Scottish mainland and which has been heavily involved in the trend, has 56 lorries with names. It has a further 100 vehicles as yet unnamed, but plans to reopen its schools competition after the lockdown ends."
2021-02-12T06:01:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Dramatic discovery links Stonehenge to its original site â€“ in Wales,"An ancient myth about Stonehenge, first recorded 900 years ago, tells of the wizard Merlin leading men to Ireland to capture a magical stone circle called the Giants’ Dance and rebuilding it in England as a memorial to the dead. Geoffrey of Monmouth’s account had been dismissed, partly because he was wrong on other historical facts, although the bluestones of the monument came from a region of Wales that was considered Irish territory in his day. Now a vast stone circle created by our Neolithic ancestors has been discovered in Wales with features suggesting that the 12th-century legend may not be complete fantasy. Its diameter of 110 metres is identical to the ditch that encloses Stonehenge and it is aligned on the midsummer solstice sunrise, just like the Wiltshire monument. A series of buried stone-holes that follow the circle’s outline has been unearthed, with shapes that can be linked to Stonehenge’s bluestone pillars. One of them bears an imprint in its base that matches the unusual cross-section of a Stonehenge bluestone “like a key in a lock”, the archaeologists discovered. Mike Parker Pearson, a professor of British later prehistory at University College London, told the Guardian: “I’ve been researching Stonehenge for 20 years now and this really is the most exciting thing we’ve ever found.” The evidence backs a century-old theory that the nation’s greatest prehistoric monument was built in Wales and venerated for hundreds of years before being dismantled and dragged to Wiltshire, where it was resurrected as a second-hand monument.
Geoffrey had written of “stones of a vast magnitude” in his History of the Kings of Britain, which popularised the legend of King Arthur, but which is considered as much myth as historical fact. Parker Pearson said there may well be a “tiny grain” of truth in his account of Stonehenge: “My word, it’s tempting to believe it … We may well have just found what Geoffrey called the Giants’ Dance.” The discovery will be published in Antiquity, the peer-reviewed journal of world archaeology, and explored in a documentary on BBC Two on Friday presented by Prof Alice Roberts. A century ago the geologist Herbert Thomas established that the spotted dolerite bluestones at Stonehenge originated in the Preseli hills of Pembrokshire where, he suspected, they had originally formed a “venerated stone circle”. The newly discovered circle – one of the largest ever constructed in Britain – is virtually a stone’s throw (3 miles) from the Preseli quarries from which the bluestones were extracted before being dragged more than 140 miles to Salisbury Plain some 5,000 years ago. In 2015, Parker Pearson’s team discovered a series of recesses in the rocky outcrops of Carn Goedog and Craig Rhos-y-felin with similar stones that the prehistoric builders extracted but left behind. Carbonised hazelnut shells – the charred remains of a Neolithic snack from the quarry workers’ campfires – were radiocarbon-dated to 3,300 BC, meaning the bluestones had been quarried almost four centuries before Stonehenge was constructed.
It convinced Parker Pearson in 2015 that “somewhere near the quarries there is the first Stonehenge and that what we’re seeing at Stonehenge is a second-hand monument”. On Thursday he talked of his excitement of finding the evidence. “How else do you explain that the stones come from a series of quarries 140 miles away as the crow flies, if there isn’t some other kind of relationship?’ It just struck me that surely there has to be a stone circle.” Over many years, Parker Pearson and his team of professional archaeologists, students and volunteers explored every conceivable Preseli site in a needle-in-a-haystack search. To see the invisible, they used the most advanced scientific techniques, but they failed to reveal anything in the unyielding soil around a site named Waun Mawn. It still has four monoliths, three now recumbent. A century ago, a suggestion that these were remnants of a stone circle was dismissed. But the theory was proved correct. Parker Pearson refused to give up and resorted to tried-and-tested digging around those monoliths. “We were lucky because this circle had four stones still left. If they’d taken them to Wiltshire, we would never have found the circle’s stone-holes and I doubt archaeologists would have stumbled across this for centuries to come.” The acidic soil had destroyed almost all organic matter that could have been carbon-dated. But traces of ancient sunlight lingering in the soil was analysed and gave a likely construction date of around 3,300BC – finally confirming Stonehenge’s secret, lost history. • This article was amended on 12 February 2021 to clarify in the subheading that it was only the Stonehenge bluestones that are believed to have first stood at Waun Mawn before being transported to Wiltshire."
2021-02-11T19:16:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Libby Squire's family still in dark about how she died after murder conviction,"More than two years after their daughter’s murder, Libby Squire’s parents are still in the dark. They don’t know how she was killed or whether she was alive when she entered the River Hull. What they do now know, however, is that Pawel Relowicz, a 26-year-old butcher, is the man who killed her. Relowicz, who was convicted of murdering the 21-year-old on Thursday, is still the only person who knows what happened in the early hours of 1 February 2019. A Home Office pathologist, Dr Matthew Lyall, told jurors that Squire’s cause of death could not be determined because of the amount of time her body had been in the water. By the time it was recovered, it had spent seven weeks in the Humber Estuary. Squire, a philosophy student at the University of Hull, was described by her friends and family as a “beautiful, caring, wonderful girl”. She was last seen on CCTV getting into Relowicz’s car.
At the beginning of the trial on 11 January – it was postponed from June 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic – Relowicz had already been convicted of nine sexual offences carried out between July 2017 and 20 January 2019, 11 days before he raped and killed Squire. In court, prosecutors painted a picture of a serial sex offender, someone who prowled the streets of Hull looking for vulnerable young women to assault. Richard Wright QC, leading the prosecution, characterised him as a frequent offender who primarily operated in the student area of Hull. Relowicz’s crimes include voyeurism and outraging public decency as well as sexually motivated burglaries. A police search of his car found a pink holdall containing his trophies: sex toys, women’s underwear and photographs taken from the homes of his victims. Some of the items were covered in Relowicz’s semen and saliva. “In Libby Squire he found the opportunity he was looking for and he went further than he had done before, driving her away, raping her and killing her,” Wright told the court. “Libby Squire died because it was her sheer misfortune, by a terrible twist of fate, to stray into the path of a man who was looking out for just this opportunity.” Relowicz was born and raised in the Polish village of Warszewice before moving to the UK eight years ago “to earn good money”. He got a job as a butcher in Malton, North Yorkshire. By the time he was jailed for eight and a half years in August 2019 for sexual offences committed shortly before Squire’s disappearance, a pattern of behaviour had emerged. On pronouncing sentence, the judge, Jeremy Richardson QC, said: “Every single one of these crimes has a sexual undertone.” Those who knew him told the trial that he was a religious family man and a devoted father, but he admitted to jurors that he would often walk the streets “looking for a woman to have easy sex”. Relowicz explained his frequent nocturnal outings to his wife, whom he married in 2014, by claiming he needed to go for a run. On the night he killed Squire, he returned home before informing his wife that he was setting out again at about 3am for some fresh air. When news broke that Squire was missing, a huge search began the next day with Humberside police drafting in extra officers to help. It was only when Relowicz was arrested five days later in connection with Squire’s disappearance that the details of his previous crimes came to light. Squire grew up in the High Wycombe area of Buckinghamshire and was the eldest of four children. She was particularly close to her mother and her brother. In a statement to police, her mother, Lisa Squire, a neonatal nurse, said Libby would joke that she was her favourite child, and she conceded that they did have a “special bond”. Lisa Squire, who affectionately called Libby “Pie”, said: “We were that in sync with each other I would describe us as being almost as one. She worked hard on her mental health and was in a really good place when she went to university. “There is no closure. We don’t get to have Libby back. Our lives don’t revert back to normal.”"
2021-02-11T18:42:08Z,uk-news,UK news,Review casts doubt on London fire brigade's high-rise capabilities,"The London fire brigade’s ability to cope with a second high-rise fire on the scale of Grenfell Tower has been cast into doubt by government inspectors who found the brigade could not assure itself that its response would be vastly improved. In a conclusion likely to unnerve high-rise residents in the capital, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services found that 44 months after the disaster the LFB had failed to sufficiently retrain incident commanders or update policy on telling residents to stay put or evacuate burning buildings. Both issues were raised in a highly critical assessment by the Grenfell inquiry of the LFB’s handling of the fire, which claimed 72 lives. In a review ordered by the home secretary, Priti Patel, inspectors found that the LFB had met only four out of 29 recommendations made in October 2019 by the inquiry chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, who labelled its planning “gravely inadequate”. He concluded that incident commanders’ failure to overturn the tower’s “stay put” policy sooner cost lives. “The brigade still isn’t in a position to assure itself that if something similar to Grenfell happened again its performance would be vastly improved,” said Matt Parr, HM inspector of fire and rescue services. He said that at current rates of reform, such an assurance may not be possible until 2022. A lack of improvement of incident command was the most serious concern, he said. Inspectors were “surprised at how few [of the recommendations] they had got ticked off”. Adapting to the Covid pandemic had hindered progress. “They have learned lessons but the point we’re making is: can you put hand on heart and say if you are the commissioner of the LFB have you put everything right? And you can’t,” Parr said. The LFB must “act quickly … not only to reassure victims, survivors and their families, but to ensure public safety,” he added. Patel ordered the review after it emerged that experienced LFB commanders had had no training in the dangers of combustible cladding and there was no contingency plan for the evacuation. Moore-Bick described “serious deficiencies in command and control” and said “personnel and systems were overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster”. His criticism accelerated the departure of the LFB’s commissioner at the time of Grenfell, Dany Cotton, who told the inquiry that to train for a fire such as Grenfell would have been akin to planning for a “a space shuttle landing on the Shard”. She was replaced at the start of 2020 by Andy Roe, who has since admitted “the fire brigade let those families down”. Parr said he had seen a “palpable sense of urgency over the last year”, but much remains to be done. New policies on high-rise firefighting, handling calls from people in burning buildings, and evacuation and rescue will not be in place before April, almost four years after Grenfell. The inspectorate found that arrangements for practical training exercises on high-rise buildings were not yet in place and a new policy on how to judge whether residents evacuate or stay put had been delayed by 11 months. Progress was shown in the LFB’s acquisition of fire engines with extendable ladders, the practice of sending more vehicles and incident commanders to the early stages of high-rise fires, and providing smoke hoods to help fleeing residents. “We know there is more we can do and must do to keep Londoners safe and we will continue to work hard,” said the brigade’s deputy commissioner, Richard Mills. “The pandemic has impacted our progress on several areas of work and caused the implementation of some activities to be delayed. Even with these obstacles we remain committed to completing the recommendations. “We have made significant and immediate changes to how we respond to a fire in a high-rise building. For example, we increased the number of fire engines we send and have reviewed and improved our incident command training. We have introduced new equipment such as fire escape hoods and drone equipment.” He said it had reviewed policies on high-rise firefighting and giving fire survival guidance, and a new evacuation and rescue policy was forthcoming. Grenfell United, the bereaved and survivors group, said: “To hear that ‘stay put’ is still in place and the fire service is no closer to a national evacuation policy is devastating ... especially considering there are buildings still as dangerous as Grenfell Tower across the UK where inaction by the government means another tragedy could happen at anytime.”"
2021-02-11T18:01:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Meghan wins privacy case against Mail on Sunday,"The Duchess of Sussex has won her high court privacy case against the Mail on Sunday, hailing her victory as a “comprehensive win” over the newspaper’s “illegal and dehumanising practices”. After a two-year legal battle, a judge granted summary judgment in Meghan’s favour over the newspaper’s publication of extracts of a “personal and private” handwritten letter to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. In his judgment, Lord Justice Warby found for Meghan in her claim for misuse of private information against Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Mail on Sunday (MoS) and Mail Online, over five articles in February 2019 that included extracts from the letter. He said: “It was, in short, a personal and private letter. The majority of what was published was about the claimant’s own behaviour, her feelings of anguish about her father’s behaviour – as she saw it – and the resulting rift between them. These are inherently private and personal matters. “The claimant had a reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private. The articles interfered with that reasonable expectation.” Warby also found that the publication of the letter to Markle – which he described as “a long-form telling-off” – also infringed the duchess’s copyright. In a statement, Meghan said: “After two long years of pursuing litigation, I am grateful to the courts for holding Associated Newspapers and the Mail on Sunday to account for their illegal and dehumanising practices. “These tactics – and those of their sister publications Mail Online and the Daily Mail – are not new … For these outlets, it’s a game. For me and so many others, it’s real life, real relationships and very real sadness. The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep. “The world needs reliable, fact-checked, high-quality news. What the Mail on Sunday and its partner publications do is the opposite. We all lose when misinformation sells more than truth, when moral exploitation sells more than decency, and when companies create their business model to profit from people’s pain. “But, for today, with this comprehensive win on both privacy and copyright, we have all won.” A spokesperson for Associated Newspapers said: “We are very surprised by today’s summary judgment and disappointed at being denied the chance to have all the evidence heard and tested in open court at a full trial. We are carefully considering the judgment’s contents and will decide in due course whether to lodge an appeal.” The judge said “the only tenable justification” for publication would be to correct some inaccuracies about the letter contained in an article in People magazine that had featured an interview with friends of Meghan. It was legitimate for Markle and the defendant to use a part of the letter to rebut a false suggestion in the People article that the letter represented some form of “olive branch” from the duchess to her father, he said. But it was the “inescapable conclusion” that it was neither “necessary or proportionate” to disclose the rest of the information in the letter, he added. “Taken as a whole, the disclosures were manifestly excessive and hence unlawful,” he said. On the copyright claim, Warby said an electronic draft of the letter “would inevitably be held to be the product of intellectual creativity sufficient to render it original in the relevant sense and to confer copyright on its author or authors”. He also found that the MoS’s articles “copied a large and important proportion of the work’s original literary content”. The issue of whether Meghan was “the sole author”, or whether Jason Knauf, formerly communications secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, was a “co-author”, should be determined at a trial, despite being something “of minor significance in the overall context”, the judge said. Meghan’s lawyer had argued for summary judgment without trial in her favour, claiming that Associated Newspapers had “no prospect” of defending her claims for misuse of private information and alleged breach of copyright. They argued that her case was so strong, a trial was unnecessary on those parts of her claim. Warby said there would be a further hearing in March to decide the next steps in the legal action. Meghan’s data protection claim is still outstanding. The duchess sued Associated Newspapers in September 2019 over five articles in the MoS and Mail Online that were billed as a “world exclusive” featuring “Meghan’s shattering letter to her father”. A double-page spread in the MoS carried the headline: “Revealed: the letter showing true tragedy of Meghan’s rift with a father she says has ‘broken her heart into a million pieces’.” The duchess is seeking damages for alleged misuse of private information, copyright infringement, and breach of the Data Protection Act over the five articles."
2021-02-11T18:00:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Â£27bn roads plan in doubt after Shapps overrode official advice,"A £27bn expansion of England’s road network has been thrown into doubt after documents showed the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, overrode official advice to review the policy on environmental grounds, the Guardian can reveal. It has been a legal requirement to take into account the environmental impact of such projects since 2014. Shapps appears to have pressed ahead despite the advice of civil servants in his own department. The details are set out in court papers that form part of a legal challenge to the policy, which was described by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, last March as the country’s “largest ever” roadbuilding programme. Lawyers for the campaign group Transport Action Network (TAN) have sought a judicial review of the strategy to develop road projects nationwide, including the Stonehenge tunnel, the A46 Newark bypass and the Lower Thames Crossing. According to high court filings seen by the Guardian, evidence that Shapps had decided to override Whitehall advice to review the 2014 national policy statement on national networks (NPS) was disclosed at the 11th hour to the claimants. The claim focuses on the decision not to review all or part of the NPS, and has since been amended to introduce Shapps’ decision to go against the civil service advice, alongside the original grounds that the roadbuilding policy was incompatible with environmental and air quality commitments. The submission from David Wolfe QC states: “On the day before the limitation period for issuing this challenge was due to expire, the defendant provided the claimant with the advice of his officials, which was that it was appropriate to review the NPS.” He adds later: “The claimants have been presented, on the one hand, with official reasoning in support of a review, and on the other, with a decision by the defendant not to review the NPS, with no explanation of why, or on the basis of what information or considerations, he chose to depart from his officials’ advice.” Lawyers for the government argue that the transport secretary has no duty to provide reasons for his decision and say the claim is baseless. However, they said Shapps had considered that while there had been since 2014 “relevant changes in circumstance [from] road traffic and congestion forecasts … the UK legislating for a ‘net zero’ 2050 target; the Paris agreement; and air quality understanding and law, the policy “would not have been materially different if the changes had been anticipated”. The government first announced a £15bn roadbuilding programme on the back of the 2014 NPS. While ministers have committed to further targets on decarbonisation, the plans for new highways have continued unabated: in last year’s budget Sunak upped the ante to announce a five-year plan for the “biggest ever investment in strategic roads and motorways – over £27bn of tarmac”, on 4,000 miles of roads. The government argues new roads are needed to combat congestion, and that modal shift to walking and cycling cannot replace most longer journeys and the transport of goods or freight. Although the NPS addresses the environmental impacts, TAN’s lawyers argue that the significant subsequent changes in climate policy and scientific understanding of pollution means it needs review. Targets set out by the Committee on Climate Change and accepted by the government in December require the accelerated reduction of greenhouse gases by 2030. Meanwhile a major element of air pollution has been identified as particulates from tyres, which would be worsened by more traffic even with a transition to electric fleets. A review could stall the roadbuilding programme and give fresh impetus to challenges to individual schemes. Environmental campaigners last year temporarily succeeded with a similar legal challenge to the national policy statement on aviation, permitting a third runway at Heathrow. It was ruled illegal in February 2020 for not having taken account of climate commitments under the Paris accords. However, a further appeal by Heathrow overturned the verdict at the supreme court in December. Chris Todd, the director of Transport Action Network, said: “The largest ever roads programme and world-leading emissions cuts were always the strangest of bedfellows. “Far from ‘building back better’, the government’s £27bn roads plan would pollute communities, tear through treasured green spaces and turn up the heat on the planet, while making congestion worse. Our legal challenge seeks to end this nightmare and prioritise what’s important to people.” However, the government has already signalled its determination to press ahead with major roadbuilding projects despite the opposition and environmental cost. Shapps has on three occasions since the start of the coronavirus pandemic overruled planning inspectors to approve projects including widening of the A63 in Hull, the controversial tunnel under Stonehenge, and a further dualling of the A303 in Somerset. The Department for Transport said £12bn of its £27.4bn spending plans will upgrade rather than simply enlarge the road network and, combined with decarbonisation of vehicles and greener construction, are consistent with the government’s net zero aspirations. A DfT spokesperson said: “The advice to the transport secretary set out that the criteria for a review of the NPS had not been fully met. “The department is unable to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.”"
2021-02-11T16:47:38Z,uk-news,UK news,"Man, 26, guilty of rape and murder of Hull student Libby Squire","A 26-year-old man has been found guilty of raping and murdering a 21-year-old university student before dumping her body in a river. Pawel Relowicz was convicted of murdering Libby Squire following a 13-day trial at Sheffield crown court. The verdict was delivered after six days of deliberations, with the foreman acknowledging that at least 10 jurors were in agreement. Relowicz will return to court for sentencing at 2pm on Friday. The court heard that Squire, 21, was highly vulnerable, intoxicated and probably hypothermic when she encountered Relowicz on 31 January 2019. Relowicz, a father of two, was working as a butcher in Malton, North Yorkshire, at the time of the offence. He told the court he came across Squire as he drove round Hull “looking for a woman to have easy sex”. The jury at Sheffield crown court was made aware that Relowicz had been convicted of nine sexual offences carried out between July 2017 and 20 January 2019 – just 11 days before he raped and killed Squire. The court heard how on the night of 20 January, he had exposed himself to a woman on the same street where Squire lived.
On 31 January – the night he came across Squire – Relowicz admitted looking for an opportunity to commit a similar offence and said that he parked on Haworth Street with the intention of looking through windows and masturbating. However, he denied committing rape or murder. During questioning, barrister for the defence Oliver Saxby QC asked: “Do you accept you have a problem?” Relowicz replied yes, saying that it had been difficult to accept because he feared his wife would have left him if she found out. Jurors heard how Relowicz had a pink holdall containing sex toys, women’s underwear and photographs burgled from a student house and that his semen and saliva were found on some of the items. Police also found a book of student accommodation in Hull at his house. The trial heard how Relowicz “prowled the streets” of Hull’s student area in a state of “heightened sexual arousal” in search of a vulnerable student on the night of Squire’s murder. Seeing the distressed and intoxicated student, Relowicz offered her a lift home. Relowicz claimed he was acting as a good Samaritan and that he “only wanted to help”. But the prosecutor Richard Wright QC said: “In Libby Squire he found the opportunity he was looking for and he went further than he had done before, driving her away, raping her and killing her.” The Home Office pathologist Dr Matthew Lyall told jurors that the cause of Squire’s death could not be determined, nor whether she was dead or alive before entering the water, due to the amount of time her body had been in the river. But two lacerations inside her top lip showed blunt trauma consistent with “squeezing or compression of the neck or covering of the mouth”. A swab taken from Squire’s body was found to have sperm cells with a DNA profile matching the defendant at a probability of one in a billion. At trial, Relowicz claimed that he had consensual sex with Squire on the evening she disappeared. He described how while attempting to drive her home, he could not get an address out of her and so stopped near Oak Road as he thought she was going to be sick. Relowicz said she asked for a hug and they ended up kissing before they had sex on the ground near his car. The defendant said she tried to kiss him again but he turned away and she scratched his face. He told the court that he then drove away and saw her behind his car shouting at him not to leave her but that she was alive when he drove away. “I didn’t do anything to Libby. I didn’t kill her, I didn’t rape her and I left her where I said I left her,” said Relowicz. CCTV showed Squire travelling in the defendant’s silver Astra to Oak Road playing fields in the early hours of 1 February 2019 but she was never seen again. Five days later, Relowicz was arrested on suspicion of abduction. Squire’s body was eventually found by a fishing boat in the Humber estuary almost seven weeks after she went missing on 1 February 2019. The court heard how Relowicz had “laughed and smirked” when he was interviewed by detectives after the recovery of Squire’s body."
2021-02-11T15:19:26Z,uk-news,UK news,Conditions in barracks housing refugees in UK to be investigated,"Immigration and prison inspectors are to go into military accommodation being used to house asylum seekers after significant pressure from campaigners and MPs. The independent chief inspector of borders and immigration (ICIBI) had previously announced a broader inquiry into the Home Office’s use of hotels and barracks as contingency accommodation.. The ICIBI has now confirmed it will send inspectors on Monday to the two former military sites – Napier barracks in Kent and Penally camp in Pembrokeshire – and it has enlisted the assistance of HM Prison Inspectorate. Charities, healthcare professionals, lawyers and MPs have all called for independent scrutiny of the operation of the sites. Napier and Penally, which have held up to 600 men between them since September, have been dogged by allegations of cover-ups, poor access to healthcare and legal advice, and crowded conditions. Plaid Cymru’s Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said: “The Home Office has been evasive and dismissive ever since Plaid Cymru began raising questions about Penally in September. I therefore welcome the chief inspector’s decision to conduct inspection visits at the site.
“While this is a step in the right direction, there is still a long way to go. The next stage will be to secure the closure of the camp and obtain a clear commitment from the Home Office that dated, military-style accommodation has no place in the long-term future of the asylum system in Wales.” Clare Moseley, the founder of the charity Care4Calais, which has been assisting the men at the sites, said: “We are pleased to see that inspectors will be visiting the sites themselves, and in particular that they will be talking to the residents so that their voices can be heard.
“We hope that the findings of this review lead to real change in how asylum seekers are treated by the Home Office. Most critically we want to see the Home Office leading by example and offering protection and care to people who have been terrified and abused.” The ICIBI said its counterparts in the prison inspectorate offered “knowledge and experience of inspecting large institutional settings, particularly during the current pandemic”. Inspectors will interview staff and residents and conduct an assessment of the premises and onsite facilities. Last October the prisons inspectorate published a damning report into so-called short-term holding facilities, used to process migrants soon after they have arrived in the UK to claim asylum."
2021-02-11T14:19:15Z,uk-news,UK news,UK woman who killed disabled son detained in hospital indefinitely,"A woman who killed her disabled 10-year-old son after undergoing a breakdown during the UK’s coronavirus lockdown has been detained in hospital indefinitely. Dylan Freeman had been “an indirect victim” of the interruption caused by Covid-19 to normal life, said Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb as she sentenced his mother, Olga Freeman, 40, at the Old Bailey. Freeman had been struggling to care for her child, who was found dead at their home in Acton, west London, on 15 August, and was said by the judge to have reached her “wits’ end”. An independent serious case review is under way into the handling of the case and will be investigating alleged failures to offer sufficient support to the mother. The role of Ealing council had been a source of additional stress for her, a prosecutor told the court. “I have no doubt at all that you were a remarkably loving and dedicated mother to a vulnerable child until multiple pressures overwhelmed you and your mind was swamped by a destructive illness with florid psychotic elements,” Freeman was told by Cheema-Grubb. “To some unknowable extent, it should be recognised that Dylan was an indirect victim of interruption to normal life caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.” The boy was found in the master bedroom of the house, covered by a duvet and with toys placed beside him. A postmortem gave the cause of Dylan’s death as restriction of the airways. At the time of his death, his father, the celebrity photographer Dean Freeman, was in Spain. Freeman had been charged with murder but last month admitted manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility. The plea was accepted by prosecutors. Freeman appeared in court on Thursday by video link and was handed a hospital order without limit of time. Dylan had been diagnosed with autism, global neurodevelopmental delay, progressive myopia and significant difficulties with language and communication, self-help and independence. He required round-the-clock care and had attended a special school five days a week but had been unable to go during the lockdown. His mother had a history of depression but had been an “attentive and loving mother”, the hearing had been told. Prosecutor Gareth Patterson QC said: “However, last year during the first lockdown and through the summer she struggled more and more with her son. Eventually she suffered a mental health breakdown.” Dr Martin Lock, a psychiatrist, found Freeman, who had a law degree, “developed psychotic symptoms when under very heavy stress because of the Covid-19 lockdown”. It was made “considerably worse by struggling to look after Dylan” and “several times worse because of the Covid-19 lockdown and the closure of Dylan’s school”, he said in his report. Requests were made to increase support for Dylan’s care but Ealing council appeared to be “slow” in responding. “What is clear from the police investigation, is that the council does seem to have been slow in determining her requests for increased financial assistance and she felt let down by the council,” added Patterson. “The role of the council does seem to have been a further source of stress for the defendant at what was a very difficult time.” Even her request to the council to pay back the cost of toys for Dylan was declined, the court heard. A child safeguarding practice review (CSPR) is to consider the impact of the Covid-19, according to a statement issued on behalf of Ealing Safeguarding Children Partnership, which includes members from private, voluntary and public bodies in the area. It added that it was clear from evidence from the review so far that Dylan’s death could not have been foreseen. It added: “Dylan was receiving 30 hours of care a week, 16 of which were funded through direct payments from the council. Although Mrs Freeman requested that the council meet the full financial cost, she had assured that this care package was in place. The council was in the process of approving the cost of the additional hours.” “Regular contact was maintained between professionals of all agencies and Dylan and his mother. A high level of support remained in place, including the option of Dylan returning to school as the school remained open. But the challenges arising from the pandemic and Mrs Freeman’s concern for Dylan’s health meant that she felt unable to take up the breadth of services that were offered to the family."
2021-02-10T22:12:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Second man killed in weekend of London stabbings is named,"A 22-year-old killed in south London during a spate of stabbings in the capital last weekend has been named as Lavaun Witter. He was one of two men stabbed to death in eight unconnected stabbings over 24 hours, which started on Friday evening. The other man to die, Sven Badzak, also 22, was chased by a group and knifed to death in Kilburn on Saturday afternoon. The Metropolitan police and paramedics were called to a property in Wisbeach Road, Croydon, just after 8pm on Friday, where Witter died at the scene. No arrests have been made in connection with the death. His family said in a statement that they had been left “absolutely devastated”, adding: “No one could have seen this coming. Lavaun was destined for greatness and he wanted to fly high. He just wanted to have a good life and to take care of his family. “Everyone who knows him will remember him as a legend. We are all absolutely traumatised. We don’t know how we are going to go on. It is just too painful.” Det Ch Insp Kate Kieran, from Specialist Crime South, appealed for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward. She said: “Someone knows who did this and I would urge anyone who saw or heard anything shortly after 8pm on Friday evening to come forward, no matter how insignificant you think your information might be, it could help us piece together what happened.” Witter’s death was one of five such incidents reported in the area between 6.56pm and 9.12pm on Friday. At 11.20am on Saturday, a man in his 20s was stabbed in Coulsdon, south London, then shortly after 3pm police were called to a stabbing of a 24-year-old near West Croydon station. Then, at around 5.30pm on Saturday, Badzak and a 16-year-old friend were set upon by a group in Kilburn, north-west London. Badzak, who was working for his father’s construction company and hoped to do a law conversion course, was waiting outside a bagel shop when the pair were attacked. Both were taken to hospital. Badzak died and his friend remains in a stable condition. A 19-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday and a 17-year-old was held on Tuesday, both on suspicion of murder in relation to the case. The victim’s mother, Jasna Badzak, has called on the prime minister and other politicians to help her to get justice for her son."
2021-02-10T18:54:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Dover council backs Brexit lorry park plan despite residents' anger,"Residents of a village near Dover are enraged after the district council backed controversial government plans to turn fields behind their houses into a Brexit customs clearance park for 1,200 lorries. Local people in Guston have complained over the lack of notice, detail and consultation on the proposals after the government purchased the White Cliffs site with plans to turn it into an inland border facility. Under the plans, the site would deal with customs, tariffs and duties checks and be operational from July this year. At a council meeting on Tuesday night the Tory-led Dover district council backed the Department for Transport’s plans, welcoming the investment and jobs to be created, but called for mitigation measures against “the risk of serious traffic disruption and congestion in the area, along with enhanced environmental measures to protect local residents”. The DfT said the site would be used temporarily for “up to five years”. With the official 21-day engagement process coming to an end on Wednesday, residents say they have not had a single visit from the DfT to discuss their views, and detailed proposals have yet to be presented to them. They are furious with the plans, which they say will result in traffic queues on the A2 under Guston, ruin the surrounding countryside and blight the local tourism economy. Mick Palmer, 78, who has lived in Guston with his wife, Gill, 76, for 36 years, said he felt betrayed by the council supporting the plans. “I thought we lived in a democracy but we obviously don’t; it’s being dictated to us,” he said. Increased traffic and noise, light and air pollution are of major concern, he said. The couple say the proposed buffer zone will not protect their property and that the value of their house has dropped as a result. “We’ve got no protection and we’re getting no information on it at all. At our age we’ve got to live with this for six years, trapped in a house that we can’t sell. It’s just madness,” Mick said. Sarah Gleave, the coordinator for the Green party for Dover and Deal, has been leading the campaign to get the plans reversed. She said it was “deeply shocking” that all but one district councillor had voted in favour: “Only the Labour leader of the opposition had the backbone to stand up for Dover and the wider area to say this is the wrong location for the facility.” Port of Dover itself had suggested a safer location further up the A2, Gleave said. The disruption under the current plans would cause “an enormous amount of harm” to the surrounding villages and local tourism, she added, lamenting the “mess residents will have imposed on them”. Dover district council said it wanted reassurances from the DfT on mitigating the impact of the site, including improving the surrounding roads and avoiding disturbing an ancient Roman way, as well as detailed proposals to address residents’ concerns about pollution and shielding their properties. “Without major mitigation it was the council’s view that the proposal would be unacceptable to residents and businesses in the district,” it said in a statement. The Labour peer Lord Berkeley, who has taken up the fight in parliament and will raise it again in the Lords on Thursday, said it was “an appalling piece of ministerial trampling over local residents’ views”. “The government has had plenty of time to go through the proper planning process – including an environmental study, looking at alternative sites, consulting with residents. As far as I can see they haven’t done anything and only bothered to tell residents about this on New Year’s Eve. It’s pretty disgraceful,” he said."
2021-02-10T17:01:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Facebook under fire over encryption plans as man is jailed for abusing 52 children,"Facebook has been accused of choosing to shield paedophiles for profit by ignoring police warnings that its plans to toughen encryption will make the platform a safe haven for abusers. The warning came as one of the UK’s worst child abusers, David Wilson, was jailed for 25 years at Ipswich crown court after being convicted of 96 child sexual abuse charges, with more suspected. Wilson, 36, from King’s Lynn in Norfolk, trawled social media platforms, predominantly Facebook, for victims, and was branded “sadistic” by the sentencing judge. Wilson posed online as a girl, targeting boys so they would send images of themselves. His victims were as young as four, and some were so traumatised they wanted to kill themselves. Wilson’s response to one such traumatised child was to say “bye”. As the grooming turned into abuse, some were threatened with blackmail if they did not do what Wilson demanded. Some were so terrified they abused and recorded their attacks on younger children. Wilson mainly used Facebook and the company’s safety systems spotted suspicious activity and reported it to law enforcement. Senior police chiefs say that chance to spot similar highly dangerous offenders online would be lost if the tech company switches its messaging services popular with children to end-to-end encryption. Child sexual abuse is a largely hidden reality of modern Britain, police say, and they are overwhelmed. They say Facebook’s plans for encryption are so damaging, police are overtly using the Wilson case to drum up public support to stop it. Rob Jones of the National Crime Agency, which caught Wilson, said he would have got away with his offending if end-to-end encryption had been in place, adding: “They [Facebook] appear to be putting the pursuit of profit above the safety of people, especially children on their platform.” Jones said: “There isn’t a door I can put in that would deal with Facebook and if there was we wouldn’t hesitate.” Facebook made 15.8m global referrals about child sexual abuse material in 2019 and Jones said it was crucial law enforcement worked with them. Jones added: “Facebook’s plans are a disaster for child safety and law enforcement and mean the very many other David Wilsons out there will not be caught. Their plans will create a haven for child sex offenders to congregate to target children.” Facebook is concerned its commercial rivals have end-to-end encryption, which it believes users want. It vows to continue helping police, and in a statement said: “We will continue to work with law enforcement to combat criminal activity. End-to-end encryption is already the leading technology used by many services to keep people safe online and, when we roll it out on our other messaging services, we will build on our strong anti-abuse capabilities.” Last November Wilson pleaded guilty at Ipswich crown court to 96 offences against 52 children. The National Crime Agency said 500 children had sent Wilson images over a period of four years, and 5,000 had been targeted. Wilson used pay-as-you-go phones, and hid behind fake identities online. Detectives had to prove Wilson was the person connected to the phones and false identities. It took three years to bring the former roofer to justice. The majority of Wilson’s offending was committed while he was on bail as law enforcement desperately tried to get the evidence a court would accept to convict him. Sentencing Wilson, judge Rupert Overbury said: “You carried out a lengthy and premeditated campaign of sadistic and manipulative abuse of young boys using social media. Any decent human being will be astonished at the level of depravity involved.” One victim said: “At 12 years of age I was abused, blackmailed, made to feel suicidal. That’s something that no kid should have to go through.” Tony Cook, from the National Crime Agency, said: “He groomed, bullied and blackmailed young boys into sending him indecent images and in some instances performing horrific abuse on themselves and others. Despite knowing their utter anguish and despair, he ignored their pleas for him to stop. He retained indecent material and threatened to share it among victims’ friends so he could maintain control of them.” The home secretary, Priti Patel, said: “ It is vital that Facebook do not press ahead without amending their current end-to-end-encryption plans, otherwise sick criminals like David Wilson could still be abusing children with impunity.” In the UK, the NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac) offers support for adult survivors on 0808 801 0331.

2021-02-10T16:58:04Z,uk-news,UK news,"Eviction of Euston tunnel HS2 protesters can continue, judge rules","A high court judge has ruled against a call to halt the eviction of protesters from a tunnel beside Euston Square on grounds of safety. Seven people are currently occupying the tunnel, in order to raise awareness both of the climate emergency, and the damage they say is being done by HS2. Mrs Justice Steyn rejected the claim by Dr Larch Maxey, the protester who brought the case, that the eviction by HS2’s contractors High Court Enforcement was not being handled safely and in compliance with human rights obligations. It emerged during the hearing that the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) had twice asked HS2 contractors to stop evicting climate activists from a tunnel in central London because of its concerns about the way it was being carried out. The evictions had been halted at its request, and then restarted. In her judgment, Steyn described the tunnel as “poorly constructed and liable to collapse”. She rejected the protesters’ various concerns and accepted the responses and reassurances provided by HS2 in response to concerns raised by the protesters’ tunnel expert Peter Faulding that High Court Enforcement lacked specialist experience and equipment to carry out the eviction. She also rejected concerns about a lack of planning for the eviction and accepted HS2’s evidence that it had drawn up detailed risk assessments before embarking on the tunnel eviction. She rejected requests from the tunnellers that HS2 should provide them with sufficient food and water, saying in her judgment: “They are not detained or stuck in the tunnel; they are choosing to remain there as trespassers.” She also rejected a request for Faulding to be granted access to the tunnel site to conduct a safety assessment. HS2’s counsel Saira Sheikh QC told the court the HSE was satisfied, and that “they keep visiting the site and have raised no concerns whatsoever with our work”, but the HSE’s counsel Alistair Mills put forward different evidence. Mills said the HSE had insisted on improvements at the eviction site and was “prepared to take further action as necessary”. He added: “It [the HSE] has required work to stop on two occasions backed up by the threat of enforcement. Work did indeed stop.” Mills later clarified that quote and said: “The word ‘threat’ was not used.” Further explaining the HSE’s concerns, Mills said: “They felt they had not seen a risk assessment and method statements and a rescue plan regarding how they were going to undertake the works. The National Eviction Team [the team employed by High Court Enforcement to carry out the eviction] said they were planning to do work that night. HSE said it was necessary to have suitable emergency rescue arrangements. HSE requested that they stopped the work that had been planned for the night to break through from their shaft to the protesters’ shaft. HSE said you can either stop voluntarily or they would serve a prohibition notice. “High Court Enforcement then appointed a company called Mines Rescue to be on the eviction site the whole time the tunnel eviction work is under way.” After the high court ruling, an HS2 spokesperson said: “The decision of the court today is utterly unambiguous: that HS2 Ltd is carrying out the eviction correctly and that the illegal trespassers are breaking the law and should remove themselves from the tunnel immediately. We urge Dr Maxey to comply with the order as soon as possible – for his safety and the safety of the other activists and the HS2 and emergency personnel tasked with removing the illegal trespassers.” HS2 has been awarded full costs and Maxey has been ordered to pay them. A spokesperson for the tunnel protesters condemned HS2 for seeking costs against Maxey. They said: “They are attempting to financially ruin Dr Larch Maxey, a conscientious and altruistic man putting himself through enormous personal hardship in service to others.” The site of a second central London tunnel protest organised by environmental activists who were raising concerns about the felling of six mature trees for a development of council and private housing, has been cleared of protesters. One protester occupied a tunnel built on a site at Highbury Corner on Tuesday but was removed by police after several hours and arrested. A second protester was arrested after being removed from one of the trees on the site. Greens4HS2, a collection of members of the Green party who support the controversial HS2 rail project, has launched a new campaign website to challenge the party’s position on the scheme. The website, hs2.green, details the group’s positions and how it sees HS2 as a core part of a low-carbon future for British transport. Some of those protesting against the HS2 development are Green party members."
2021-02-10T13:35:28Z,uk-news,UK news,"Birmingham restaurant in-car dining not Covid-friendly, say police","A Birmingham restaurant which was preparing to offer a luxury three-course in-car dining experience has been asked by police to change its plans. The Varanasi Indian restaurant on Broad Street in Birmingham was planning to launch a service in which customers could eat a meal, styled on business class airline food, from their vehicle in a car park next to the restaurant. However, the restaurant’s manager, Abdul Wahab, said the police had now told them coronavirus regulations prevented establishments from using land adjacent to their premises for seating or standing capacity. He said: “Look, if that’s the rules, then we want to adhere to the rules, and we won’t promote dining in the car park. But it is a bit disappointing. We thought if you’re in your car with your household or bubble, we didn’t really see that was an issue. “The standard drive-through [restaurants] are offering a collection service where people are going into the car park and they’re eating it there,” said Wahab. “We’ll still do our takeaway service and still present it the way we intended on presenting it. We’re just going to tell customers they’re not allowed to use our car park for eating and where they go and eat is not down to us to enforce really.” Varanasi, which has been closed since the start of November, had already trialled the service last week, in preparation for launching in time for Valentine’s Day. A spokesperson for West Midlands police said: “Our licensing team, who work in conjunction with the local authority, have contacted Varanasi and advised them to amend their drive-through meal plans in order to comply with the current coronavirus regulations.”"
2021-02-10T12:18:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Call for England and Wales census to be postponed amid Covid concerns,"The UK’s biggest civil service union has called for the 2021 census to be postponed because of pandemic safety concerns and problems over a £45m outsourced contract to recruit tens of thousands of field staff. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has insisted the once-in-a-decade survey of every household in England and Wales will take place on 21 March as planned. But the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), which represents hundreds of ONS employees, says the pandemic makes it unsafe to conduct the survey. It urged the agency to follow Scotland’s example by delaying the census by a year. The PCS also called on ministers to remove private firms from involvement after the first attempt to outsource the recruitment of census field staff prompted a catalogue of complaints from candidates. The Zurich-based company Adecco was hired to recruit 30,000 field workers, who will be sent to homes to remind people to complete the survey. Candidates have told the Guardian that problems have included jobs being confirmed and then withdrawn; calls and emails repeatedly ignored; inadequate notice given before jobs are due to start; and at least one case of a job being awarded without references being checked. An ONS insider said: “It is a dreadful waste of money … Blinkered senior [ONS] managers are leaving staff to sort out the mess and have not listened to a chorus of requests to delay it since last summer. Colleagues closer to the situation are pulling their hair out as Adecco are so incapable of reacting, performing or getting to grips with their workload. A PCS spokesman said: “It is deeply irresponsible to recruit 30,000 people for door-to-door questioning of the public, when there are new, highly infectious variants of the virus emerging.” “We have raised serious concerns over safety around the upcoming ONS census and taking into account Scotland has postponed its census, England and Wales must follow suit.” It added: “Ministers must also remove Adecco from any rescheduled census work next year as private contractors have no place delivering public services which can be done in-house.”
The ONS said it was safe to go ahead, in part because it hoped 75% of surveys would be completed online. Field staff who will have to visit an estimated 6m homes who will be reluctant to complete the survey online will be given regular Covid lateral flow tests despite concerns about their accuracy. The head of the census, Pete Benton, said: “Census field officers will never enter a household, they will always be socially distanced, be equipped with PPE, and work in line with all government guidance.” Benton refused to answer specific questions about Adecco and the recruitment of staff. But he said: “Like everyone, we are operating in highly unusual times, and with Adecco, we have mobilised the recruitment drive in difficult circumstances and we are working hard to address some challenges candidates have faced.” The ONS said it was continuing to keep all options open to ensure staff were safe. Adecco has not responded. Jan Clare*, a census team leader who is due to begin work next week, said the recruitment process was “outstandingly poor”. She said she was badgered repeatedly to provide details of referees but then given the job without one of the referees being contacted, despite Adecco’s claim that they had been contacted. She was interviewed in December and told she would be told within 10 days whether she had been successful. The job was confirmed after almost two months and only days before it was due to start. Clare also said Adecco insisted on handing out work phones and computers in person rather than organising delivery. She said: “There is no need to do this physically, it just seems silly in a pandemic, but it is so difficult to get in touch with them that it is just not worth raising health concerns.” Zoe Watson, 22, from Bolton was given a job as a census area support officer in nearby Chorley for £11.22 an hour. She said Adecco withdrew the offer after she failed to produce a driving licence, despite telling her interviewer that she could not drive and being told this would not be a problem. She said: “It’s demeaning. I was told it was a ‘miscommunication’ but it wasn’t. They made a mistake and now I don’t have a job, and they are ignoring my calls and emails.” Penny Jekyll, 56, a freelance event organiser from London, first passed a psychometric test for a census job in November and had a Zoom interview for the role on 8 December. She still does not know if she got the job, despite passing DBS [disclosure and barring] checks and complying with numerous requests for documents and refusing official documents because they gave her name as Penny rather than Penelope, the name on her birth certificate. “I’ve never come across anything quite as inefficient in all my years working,” she said. “It doesn’t bode well – and ONS seem to be aware that Adecco are making an absolute hash of it.” A Facebook page where Adecco advertises census roles has been bombarded with complaints from people complaining of calls and emails going unanswered and applications being “deactivated” due to lack of response from applicants who have spent days trying to contact the company. Jack Nurse said he was given a job in Dorset but later told it was no longer available and that he would be placed on a long list. He said: “The process isn’t fit for purpose. It is a chaotic shambles. I don’t know how they’ll be able to handle the entire census. This is not going to go well.” Pascale Robinson, the campaigns officer at the anti-outsourcing group We Own It, said: “There is no benefit whatsoever in contracting this to a private company, rather than running it in house. The government must think again, ditch its ideological obsession with outsourcing and understand that public services should be delivered in public hands.” * Some of the names have been changed."
2021-02-10T06:00:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Craig Small killing: police officers under investigation over sharing of CCTV film,"Two Metropolitan police officers are under criminal investigation for allegedly filming and sharing CCTV evidence of the moment a man was murdered, the Guardian has learned. Carol Campbell said that the video of the murder of her son, Craig Small, being uploaded to social media has compounded her trauma.
Small, 32, was shot outside a shop in Wembley, London on 5 July 2019. He later died in hospital. The moment was caught on the CCTV of a nearby fast food outlet. Days later, his family discovered that a video was circulating on social media of the moment Small was killed. Campbell said the police initially claimed that a shop may have leaked the CCTV footage, but it later emerged that an officer had allegedly filmed the CCTV evidence in the police station on a mobile phone. Laughter can be heard in the background of the recording, according to Campbell. The video was shared and uploaded on to social media sites. The graphic footage shows Small being shot in the head, and then again once he had fallen to the ground. A police constable was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in a public office on 16 July 2019 and a sergeant from the same unit was interviewed under criminal caution. Both have been placed on restricted duties and have been served with notices informing them that they are under investigation for gross misconduct. Campbell said that watching the moment her son was murdered has given her nightmares and sleepless nights. “I’m an emotional wreck”, she said. It has also had a devastating impact on her family, including Small’s three young children. One of his sons, seven years old at the time, unwittingly stumbled across the video after typing his late father’s name into YouTube. While Campbell has been satisfied with the way the police have conducted the investigation into her son’s killing, she views the alleged filming and sharing of the video as a malicious act. “It wasn’t calling for any witnesses”, she said. “It was so unfair, my son mattered. It shouldn’t have been like this.” Campbell said she arrived on the scene shortly after Small was shot, but was prevented from seeing him before he died. Although her son was the victim of a crime, she feels the family were treated with suspicion and disrespect, threatening her with arrest at the hospital if she did not quieten down. She said she saw police officers going into the room where Small was being treated and emerging laughing. “I’m a calm person, I just want to know – is he alive, or is my son dead, because the way the police officer was taking it, it was like it was a joke,” she said. She said she believes that if she had been a white mother that day, “a police officer would have took me in hand, they would have carried me themselves to the hospital. I wouldn’t have had to go through what I went through. I was a nobody.” The Metropolitan police said they had not received a complaint in relation to the police’s response to Small’s murder or events immediately thereafter but have written to the family inviting them to add that to the investigation. Terence Channer, the family’s solicitor, said that the release of the footage piled additional heartache on Small’s family when they were looking to the police for support. “There appears to have been a clear and extremely disturbing abuse of police powers, at a time when my client and her family were mourning the tragic death of her son”, he said. “We now look forward to those responsible … being held fully accountable.” Small was a music producer and rapper, also known as Smallz. Campbell described her son as homely and humble, someone who “didn’t take the mick out of his aunties” and whose presence would “light up a room”. Small’s family have been waiting for the outcome of the investigation into the officers’ conduct since July 2019. It was originally referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which then referred it to the Met’s directorate of professional standards (DPS). Seven other officers have been interviewed and served with notices informing them that they are under investigation for misconduct and gross misconduct. In a letter to the family, the DPS said it viewed the matter as “a key investigation, not only in terms of the significant additional upset to you as a family but also because of the wider trust and community confidence issues the MPS faces in respect of the handling of public data and the negative impact this and other incidents have had on London communities”. A spokesperson for the Met said that specialist family liaison officers have been working to support Small’s family since his murder and have treated the allegations seriously, committing to a full and transparent investigation. “We understand that these allegations have been an additional source of distress for them at an already difficult time”. “This is a complex criminal investigation and we are making extensive enquiries. It is only right, given the severity of the allegations, that we are thorough in our approach”. Four men have been arrested in relation to Small’s murder. The trial is due to take place next year."
2021-02-09T20:09:30Z,uk-news,UK news,London's new diversity commission 'not about removing statues',"London’s commission on diversity in the public realm is not about tearing statues down, but addressing the dearth of monuments to people of colour and “instilling hope”, its youngest member has said. London mayor Sadiq Khan has announced the 15 panellists selected to be members of the new Landmark Commission to improve diversity in the capital’s public spaces. The members include 27-year-old art historian Aindrea Emelife; actor Riz Ahmed; and social activist and founder of the Ligali campaigning group, Toyin Agbetu, who made headlines in 2007 when he interrupted a service attended by the Queen and former prime minister Tony Blair to mark the 200th anniversary of the act abolishing the slave trade. Khan announced he would be forming the commission days after a statue of Edward Colston, a 17th-century slave trader, was pulled down in Bristol by Black Lives Matter protesters last summer. Emelife said: “The toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol marked a turning point, especially after artist Marc Quinn put up a sculpture of a black woman on the empty plinth and that reinvigorated the idea that public art should mean something. I saw little black girls looking at that statue and it made me wonder if I saw that when I was younger, how it would have inspired me.” Emelife, who studied at the Courtauld Institute of Art, remembers being one of the only black students there. “Throughout my work and life as a curator, writer and art historian – but also a young, black woman – I’ve often been in rooms that aren’t very diverse. “It made me wonder if there were more public artworks that properly reflected London, and all its hodgepodge of cultures, perspectives and ideas, how different London might be? How does what we see every day, the statues we walk past, the images that pervade our space, affect how we live our lives?” she added. The commission will review what makes up London’s public realm, discuss what legacies should be celebrated, and make a series of recommendations that will help to establish best practice, the London mayor’s office said. The commission is not being established to preside over the removal of statues, it added. “It’s not just about taking down statues, it’s about creating new commissions that will inspire generations. And that is what I’m most excited about,” Emelife said. She added: “It’s about what public art can mean and what it can do. It can inspire people, particularly the younger generation. You can argue that with good public art and a public realm that is more reflective of society, could that inspire change within that society? Can it inspire change in how we see people of colour, LGBTIAQ+ communities or people with disabilities? “After the year we’ve had, we need something that is inspiring, sparks debate and joy. This is art you see daily and this affects you in subliminal ways. If you walk past a statue of a black woman every day, it will obviously change the way you see black women. You won’t see them as othered, you’d see them as worthy: of taking up space, being seen and of being celebrated. It’s the same for people with disabilities and those who are LGBTQ.”"
2021-02-09T19:06:38Z,uk-news,UK news,Former Arconic executive tells Grenfell inquiry she knew cladding could burn,"The executive who sold the cladding used on Grenfell Tower knew it could burn but did not tell customers, she has admitted to the public inquiry into the fire. Debbie French, the UK sales manager for Arconic from 2007 to 2014, said the company provided the more flammable version of the panels by default in a marketing strategy that recognised a fire-retardant version that “drastically increases fire resistance” was less likely to secure contracts on price. The easier to burn version of Arconic’s Reynobond product, which was the main cause of the rapid spread of the fire at Grenfell that claimed 72 lives, cost less. It used polyethylene [PE] sandwiched between 5mm thick aluminium sheets and French said she knew it “was and is flammable”.
During cross-examination, Richard Millett QC, counsel to the inquiry, asked the executive: “Did you ever explain to your customers, in terms, that PE would burn?” “I don’t recall specifically explaining that to them,” she said. “If I had been asked the question I would have explained it.” She said she had not seen the building regulations guidance on fire safety or realised there were different rules for tall buildings such as the 24-storey Grenfell Tower. “My knowledge on the technical side was very limited,” she said. “Working for an organisation like Alcoa [as Arconic was known], it didn’t even enter my head, the question of whether it was or wasn’t suitable. They were a big name company and therefore it was all perfectly suitable for what it needed to do in the UK.” But the inquiry heard the company sought to “keep secret” differences between the PE and its more fire-retardant version. The inquiry saw a report from a 2004 fire test in a French laboratory of the panels fabricated into a cassette form, as deployed at Grenfell, that had to be stopped after 850 seconds because it was emitting too much heat. Millett said this was “ignored” by the company. French said she had never been told about the failure but agreed it was a “very serious omission” and made a subsequent certificate detailing fire performance issued by the construction industry approvals body, the British Board of Agrément (BBA), “significantly misleading” for her customers. The inquiry also heard how Claude Wehrle, Arconic’s technical manager, ordered French not to release to customers information about the difference between the polyethylene-filled panels and the fire-retardant version. When French asked Wehrle if she could share a document about the differences between the materials with Arup, a prospective client, he replied by email: “OH MY LORD!!! Where did you get that from??? For sure you’re NOT allowed to diffuse to the customer those documents.” He told her to instead talk about the different fire classifications obtained by Arconic via the BBA. This BBA document stated that the panels “may be regarded as having class 0 surface”, a measure of fire spread. Millett said there had been no tests on the PE core panels that showed they met class 0 under British standards. French said she did not know this. Wehrle, who worked for Arconic until recently, is one of three current and former employees refusing to attend to give evidence to the inquiry. They are claiming they risk prosecution under an obscure French law known as the blocking statute. The French government has said it does not believe it applies but only French courts can provide immunity. Millett said Wehrle, Peter Froehlich and Gwenaëlle Derrendinger were not cooperating despite intervention “at the highest level between the British and the French governments”. They are expected to be “empty chaired”, with time likely to be set aside for key questions that they should answer to be presented. The inquiry continues."
2021-02-09T18:42:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Home Office drops plan to house asylum seekers in 'prison-style' camp,"The Home Office has abandoned controversial plans to house nearly 200 asylum seekers in what campaigners have described as a “prison-style” camp on the site of an immigration removal centre. Government officials originally planned to move the asylum seekers into portable buildings adjacent to Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre in Bedfordshire at the end of last year. Tents were to be erected for preparing and serving food. But in a significant U-turn, the Home Office is no longer proceeding with the plans.
The Home Office has faced mounting criticism from lawyers, charities and human rights campaigners about the unsuitability of some of its accommodation for vulnerable asylum seekers, who have fled persecution and in some cases survived torture, and because of Covid concerns. The row over the Yarl’s Wood site followed a series of damning reports on conditions at two former army barracks sites in Kent and Pembrokeshire being used to hold up to 600 asylum-seeking men. Home Office director of strategy and change Deborah Chittenden confirmed on Tuesday that the Yarl’s Wood plan was no longer going ahead because there was enough alternative capacity in the system to accommodate asylum seekers. In a message to organisations consulted about the Yarl’s Wood plans, she wrote: “I am writing to inform you that having given the matter careful consideration, the Home Office has decided not to proceed with plans to use the site adjacent to the existing Immigration Removal Centre for temporary accommodation for asylum seekers. “As you are aware we worked at pace to stand up the site as part of our winter contingency planning to ensure we had sufficient capacity across the system to meet expected demand. It is now clear that we do not need to use the additional capacity at this location at this time.”
Bedford borough councillor Louise Jackson said she believed the plans had stalled because the large numbers on the site would not be Covid-secure. An outbreak of Covid with more than 120 confirmed cases at Napier barracks in Folkestone, which is being used to accommodate asylum seekers, contradicted Home Office claims that accommodation was Covid-secure. “The Covid management plan put forward by the Home Office was nowhere near sufficient to prevent an outbreak, and I am really pleased that the government have seen sense and withdrawn their proposals for the Yarl’s Wood site,” said Jackson. “I just hope that they won’t try to replicate the Yarl’s Wood asylum camp somewhere else. It’s very hard to see how accommodating people in this manner can ever be made safe in a pandemic.” Mohammad Yasin, the MP for Bedford and Kempston, welcomed the news. He said: “I’m relieved and delighted that following repeated representations from myself and Bedford borough council’s public health team, including Cllr Louise Jackson, the Home Office have been forced to drop their plans to house asylum seekers on the Yarl’s Wood site. “It was a terrible idea to house a vulnerable group of people in hostile, inappropriate and unsafe accommodation in the middle of a pandemic using military barracks and camps in remote locations to accommodate asylum seekers, many of whom have survived torture and other forms of persecution before fleeing their home countries. [It] is a new low for the Home Office and I will be pushing for an explanation for this dramatic change in policy which is straight out of the Trump playbook.” Clare Moseley, founder of Care4Calais, said: “This is a victory for everyone who believes that asylum seekers should be treated with dignity and respect.” Lottie Hume, a caseworker at Duncan Lewis Solicitors who had launched a legal challenge against Home Office plans for Yarl’s Wood, welcomed the news. “The plan was rushed through without due care or attention to legal obligations and the discriminatory impacts. It is yet another example of the home secretary’s callous approach of providing substandard accommodation to asylum seekers to appease and inflame anti-migrant opinion,” she said. Emma Ginn, director of Medical Justice, said: “The Yarl’s Wood camp was an unconscionable idea; sticking vulnerable people in portacabins in the shadows of a notoriously brutal immigration removal centre had all the hallmarks of a regime that had badly lost its way. We call on the Home Office to do the right thing and now close other dangerous and inappropriate sites such as the Napier and Penally barracks.” Home Office minister for immigration compliance, Chris Philp, said: “The government has a statutory duty to accommodate asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute. Work is under way to reduce the cost of the asylum system, which is under significant pressure, and we are considering a number of accommodation options while we fix the broken asylum system to make it firmer and fairer.”"
2021-02-09T18:11:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Plan now for more beastly weather and coastal destruction,"Once again, eastern England is in the icy grip of “the beast” (UK weather: Storm Darcy to bring more snowfall and gale-force winds, 8 February), with the coast being pounded by persistent waves up to 4 metres high. In February and March 2018, similar waves associated with “the beast from the east” and the “mini beast” stripped beaches down to bedrock and saw soft rock cliffs retreat by over 10 metres. The erodible East Anglian coastline supports habitats of high conservation value and installations of strategic importance to UK energy security (Sizewell nuclear power stations, Bacton gas terminals). If these outbreaks of polar air are to become more frequent in a warmer world, as some suggest, the potential impacts of such phenomena must be factored into regional coastal management planning, alongside the more usual focus on sea-level rise.

2021-02-09T17:25:57Z,uk-news,UK news,What are the new UK anti-Covid border restrictions? ,"The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has unveiled new measures aimed at protecting the UK from new and potentially dangerous variants of Covid-19 arriving from abroad. What has the health secretary announced? The government is setting up a system of hotel quarantine for UK and Irish residents arriving in England for anyone who has been in a “red list” country in the 10 days prior to their arrival in England. Sixteen hotels with 4,600 rooms have been initially contracted. Those who arrive will have to book through an online platform and pay for a quarantine package costing £1,750 for an individual travelling alone, which includes the hotel, transport and testing. They will have to quarantine for 10 days, and the quarantine period could be extended if they test positive for Covid-19. Those arriving from countries not on the “red list” will have to quarantine at home. Which countries are on the red list? Foreign nationals who have been in or through any of the “red list” countries in the last 10 days will be refused entry to the UK. There are more than 30 countries on the list including Brazil, Portugal and South Africa.
What about testing? All passengers will take a pre-departure test and cannot travel to the UK if the test is positive. But from Monday all international arrivals, whether under home quarantine or hotel quarantine, will be required by law to take further swab tests on day two and day eight of that quarantine. If either of these post-arrival tests comes back positive, they’ll have to quarantine for a further 10 days from the date of the test. What if arrivals do not comply with the new rules? Passenger carriers, such as airlines, will have a duty in law to make sure that passengers have signed up for these new arrangements before they travel. Significant fines will be levied against anyone found not to have complied. These include a £1,000 penalty for any international arrival who fails to take a mandatory test, a £2,000 penalty for any international arrival who fails to take the second mandatory test, as well as automatically extending their quarantine period to 14 days, and a £5,000 fixed penalty notice – rising to £10,000 – for arrivals who fail to quarantine in a designated hotel. Furthermore, anyone found to have lied on the passenger locator form, completed by all international arrivals, to conceal that they have been in a country on the red list in the 10 days before arrival will face a prison sentence of up to 10 years. What about the other UK nations? The Scottish government’s transport secretary announced that from Monday all international arrivals into Scotland will have be subject to hotel quarantine for 10 days, going further than the policy in England, where hotel quarantine will just apply to arrivals from “red list” countries. Scots arriving via England from “red list” countries will be required to complete their mandatory hotel quarantine there before returning home north of the border. Why is this happening? The government is concerned about the potential impact new variants of the coronavirus could have on the mass vaccination programme in the UK. Any positive tests caught among those under quarantine will automatically undergo genomic sequencing to confirm whether they have a variant of concern."
2021-02-09T15:21:23Z,uk-news,UK news,UK weather: snow and ice close vaccination centres and schools,"Snow and ice have closed schools and vaccination centres, as the UK recorded its coldest temperature since 2010. Temperatures dropped to -16.7C (1.9F) in Altnaharra in the Scottish Highlands early on Tuesday morning, the coldest temperature recorded since 2010, the Met Office said. Police have issued warnings not to travel, as the cold spell caused by Storm Darcy continues to disrupt roads and rail networks.
The AA dealt with 12,000 breakdowns on Monday. The motoring organisation’s president, Edmund King, said it was busy again on Tuesday in Scotland, north-east England and East Anglia. Vaccination centres in Ipswich, Bury St Edmunds, Clacton-on-Sea and Colchester remained closed because of the severe weather. The cold conditions will continue throughout the week and the Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for snow across swaths of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland. In Edinburgh and the surrounding area, a higher amber warning is in place until 9pm on Tuesday, with the Met Office saying rural communities could become cut off and power cuts are likely. Yellow warnings for snow will stay in place in England until Wednesday night, with warnings in eastern Scotland lasting until noon on Friday. The most snow on Monday fell in eastern parts of the UK, with 30cm of snowfall in Aboyne, in eastern Scotland. In England, 23cm of snow fell in Andrewsfield, Essex. In Suffolk, mounds of snow piled higher than snow ploughs. Suffolk Highways asked residents to stay at home and paid tribute to local farmers, 25 of whom supported their road-clearing efforts.
King said: “It is still pretty treacherous on the roads in some areas with a combination of ice, snow and wind.” There were also blizzard-like conditions in Norfolk, where snowdrifts caused blockages on roads. More than 380 schools in Norfolk were closed to all children, including vulnerable children and children of key workers, PA Media reported. National Rail has told users across the country that snow and ice could disrupt train travel. Networks in Kent, Essex and south-east London closed train lines and cancelled services. The wintry conditions will continue across the UK for the rest of the week, with snow expected across the eastern side of the UK. Temperatures will be below freezing overnight into Wednesday and in low single figures throughout Wednesday, although the weather will become milder towards the weekend. Maxey said: “Expectations are that Wednesday into Thursday might be the coldest night of the spell so far and then we see things pick up a little bit.” On Monday, Public Health England extended the current cold weather alert until midday on 12 February as severe wintry conditions continue. Dr Owen Landeg, the group leader for extreme events and health protection at PHE, said: “Cold weather can have a serious impact on health, particularly for older people and those with heart and lung problems, as it increases the risks of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections. “So it’s really important during this particularly cold period, to keep checking on frail or older neighbours or relatives, especially those living alone or who have serious illnesses.”"
2021-02-09T15:00:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Prince Charles vetted laws that stop his tenants buying their homes,"The royal family has used a secretive procedure to vet three parliamentary acts that have prevented residents on Prince Charles’ estate from buying their own homes for decades, the Guardian can reveal. His £1bn Duchy of Cornwall estate was later given special exemptions in the acts that denied residents the legal right to buy their own homes outright. Under the opaque procedure, the Queen and Prince of Wales were allowed to vet the contents of the bills by government ministers and approve them before they were passed by parliament. The exemptions have left residents living in homes that have diminishing or no financial value. The residents say they cannot borrow against their homes to pay, for example, for social care fees for themselves and loved ones.
Jane Giddins, who lives in one of the prince’s houses in a Somerset village, said a “feudal and anachronistic” system had unfairly favoured Charles, to her family’s detriment. “When we die, our kids will be left with a property that is very difficult to sell,” she said. The exemptions enable the prince to preserve the financial value of his estate and brings in income as the tenants have to pay rent to him each year. The residents say they have been unable to find out why and how the heir to the throne was able to secure preferential treatment from the government. The prince declined to comment when asked whether he or his family had lobbied the government for the exemptions in the three acts. However, the Guardian has established that Prince Charles and his mother were allowed to approve the contents of the three acts under an arcane parliamentary process known as Queen’s consent. Through this mechanism, the monarch has vetted more than 1,000 parliamentary bills during her reign to check whether any of them affect the crown or her private interests.
Previously secret documents have disclosed that the Queen used the procedure to secretly lobby for some laws to be altered to benefit her private interests or reflect her opinions on government policy. The same procedure allows Charles to screen proposed laws in case they damage his property estate, the Duchy of Cornwall, which gives him a private income of around £22m a year. In total, at least 275 draft laws have been vetted by the prince between 1970 and 2020 under this procedure. They include a wide range of laws from the ban on foxhunting to changes in inheritance laws. The prince declined to say how often he had asked for changes in proposed bills through the mechanism. By tradition, Charles, as the heir to the throne, is paid out of the profits made by his estate. Created in 1337, the 52,000-hectare (128,000-acre) estate extends across 21 counties in England and Wales. As well as large parts of Cornwall, it owns the Oval cricket ground in London, most of Dartmoor and land in Gloucestershire, Somerset, Wiltshire and Dorset. Case 1: leasehold reform The first parliamentary act that gave him exemptions preventing his tenants from buying their homes was the 1967 Leasehold Reform Act. The act sought to reform the leasehold law under which landlords grant buyers the right to live in a property for a set number of years on a lease, instead of owning it outright. It gave people in specific circumstances the right to buy their homes compulsorily from their landlords. But residents on the Duchy of Cornwall estate were barred from buying their homes in specific circumstances – for example, if the properties were deemed to have important architectural or historic features. Files in the National Archives show that the Queen was asked by a Whitehall official in February 1967 to vet the bill before MPs had begun to debate its contents. Martin Charteris, a senior courtier, said he had “laid the letter before the Queen” and she had approved. The duchy was at that time under the control of the Queen. Charles took over the estate two years later when he turned 21. Case 2: Scilly The second act was the 1993 Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act. The exemptions were altered to include specific properties within the Duchy of Cornwall that were in the Isles of Scilly and Dartmoor. The number of tenants on Scilly caught by the exemption is not known but has been estimated at 100. One of them is a 78-year-old retired oil executive, Alan Davis. He has been prevented from buying the freehold to his 1960s bungalow. He compared their plight with the millions of Britons who own their own home – the freehold – outright and can therefore pass it on as a valuable asset to their children. In 1984 he bought the right to live in his bungalow for 99 years. He fears he has invested in an asset that will become worthless. “The problem comes when you want to sell it. If the lease is down to something like 30-odd years, people will just shy away from it.” He said it was an “absolute nonsense” that he and other residents on the islands were unable to buy their homes from the duchy, attributing it to the prince’s influence within government.
The government defeated Davis’s attempt under freedom of information legislation to try to discover whether Prince Charles had privately lobbied government ministers to secure the exemption. In a statement, the Duchy of Cornwall said: “Neither the Duke of Cornwall nor the Duchy of Cornwall council have any involvement in the drafting of legislation that relates to any part of leasehold reform including residential enfranchisement.” “The duchy does, however, take great care to ensure that anyone purchasing a property where the freehold belongs to the duchy is made completely aware of the restrictions that may apply to their property as a result of the legislation. “The value of any leasehold property will reduce as the length of the lease attached to it reduces. Any purchaser is made fully aware of this at the point of purchase.” Case 3: Somerset The third bill vetted by Charles was the 2002 Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act, when the exemptions were again altered, this time to include houses in the tiny village of Newton St Loe near Bath, Somerset. Giddins is one of three tenants in the village who are not permitted to buy their homes from the Duchy of Cornwall. She and her husband bought the derelict Georgian house in 1996. “We have spent 25 years pouring a lot of money and love into renovating it.” But she said they will not be able to get that money back. “The question is: why should the crown be allowed to carry on with a feudal system just because they want to?”"
2021-02-09T09:29:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Mutation of Kent Covid variant discovered in Manchester,"Surge coronavirus testing will begin in parts of south Manchester on Tuesday after four cases of a mutation of the more transmissible Kent variant were detected in two unconnected households in the Moss Side area. Enhanced community testing will begin in parts of Hulme, Moss Side, Whalley Range and Fallowfield to try to limit the number of people exposed to the mutation and understand its spread. There is no evidence that this variant will be resistant to the vaccines or causes a more severe illness, and it is not yet known if the strain can be passed more easily between people.
More than 10,000 tests will be supplied to the community, Manchester city council said. Additional testing sites will be set up in the area to enable anyone over the age of 16 who lives, works or studies in the designated area to get a test as quickly as possible. No appointment will be needed and testing will also be made available for people who work in the area but do not necessarily live there. In the coming days, volunteers will also begin knocking on people’s doors to offer alternative testing for anyone who cannot get to a testing site. Residents of the following postcode areas are asked to check the council website: M14 4, M14 7, M15 5, M15 6, M16 7, M16 8. David Regan, Manchester city council’s director of public health, said: “We all know that the virus will change over time and it’s important that we investigate new strains to understand how they might spread. This is exactly what we’re doing with the intensive testing in parts of Manchester with local testing units and people going door-to-door to offer people tests.”
Dr Will Welfare, the deputy director for health protection at Public Health England North-West, said: “As part of our testing work, Public Health England (PHE) has identified in the Moss Side area of Manchester a small number of Covid-19 cases of the variant first identified in Bristol and South Gloucestershire. “PHE is working closely with and supporting Manchester city council, as we monitor the situation closely and ensure all necessary measures are being taken to reduce the spread of the virus. “The most important thing is that people continue to follow the guidance that is in place – limit the number of people you come into contact with, wash your hands regularly and thoroughly, keep your distance and cover your face. If you test positive you must isolate to stop the spread of the virus.” Responding to comments by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, comments about the South African variant of coronavirus being the greatest threat to UK, the Manchester Central MP, Lucy Powell, said: “These variants, especially the variants that are found to be resistant to the vaccines that we’re currently rolling out, of course are a worry.” She told BBC Breakfast that measures on protecting the border, such as hotel quarantine, are “only just coming into play now”, adding: “These delays we can ill-afford because that’s how the new variant takes seize in this country from other countries.” Surge testing is already in place in 12 other parts of England, including Sefton in Merseyside and Maidstone in Kent, amid fears that new variants could spread."
2021-02-09T07:00:05Z,uk-news,UK news,HS2: heavy machinery 'could destabilise Euston protest tunnels',"Heavy machinery such as cherry pickers being used in the vicinity of the Euston tunnel could destabilise it, says a safety expert who has raised a number of concerns about the way the eviction of the HS2 protesters is being carried out. Peter Faulding, who has worked in specialist rescue for a number of decades, is advising the legal team for the protesters in the case now being brought by Dr Larch Maxey, 48, one of the activists in the tunnel against HS2 in the high court on behalf of all of the activists in the Euston tunnel. The activists are occupying an extensive tunnel network in front of the central London station to protest about work on the HS2 high speed rail link which it is planned will go into the station. They argue that building the rail link is causing significant environmental damage to ancient woodland. They say they also want to raise awareness about the broader climate emergency facing the planet. Faulding is concerned that the protesters are not being provided with a multi-gas detector to monitor levels of oxygen, carbon monoxide and methane. He is also worried that the activists are not being given efficient means of communication with the eviction team in the event they would need to alert them to any emergency that occurs during the eviction process. Faulding expressed doubt about whether the National Eviction Team (NET), which is carrying out the eviction for HS2, have the requisite skills to conduct the highly specialised tunnel eviction. HS2 sources said NET are contracted by the High Court Enforcement Group with whom HS2 has a contract. They added that the contract was awarded on a competitive basis and the eviction team have the required skills to undertake the work they are contracted to do. New Civil Engineer reported last November that 253 companies and public bodies including the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) have signed gagging orders relating to some aspects of HS2’s work. An HS2 Ltd spokesperson said: “As we continue to develop HS2 we regularly engage with local authorities and share with them work at an early design stage. Non-disclosure agreements during the planning phase help to avoid placing homes and businesses in unnecessary blight, protect commercially sensitive information, and help protect the personal information of those potentially affected by any proposed changes.” Faulding said an earlier court order said that HS2 should carefully consider his expert opinions. But he said he has not been granted access to the tunnel so that he can inspect the eviction process and offer a view. “The court order did not require HS2 to give Peter Faulding access to the site. At present Larch Maxey is in contempt of court for not complying with the court order,” said the HS2 spokesperson. In a statement posted on LinkedIn, Richard Jordan, chief security and resilience officer at HS2, said: “Planning for this operation began at the start of December last year, some eight weeks before we were due to take possession of the site. A 167-page operational plan was produced by our contractors which contained 32 detailed risk assessments. This plan was independently reviewed twice by security professionals, HS2 Ltd and also twice by safety professionals before the operation was approved.” The case is due to be heard in the high court on Tuesday. The environmental activists have urged people to support the Climate and Ecological Emergency bill, which is due to have a short debate in parliament on the same day as the hearing."
2021-02-09T06:00:06Z,uk-news,UK news,52 police had contact with Mohamud Hassan before his death,"The police watchdog is facing growing pressure to disclose further information about the arrest of a man who died suddenly after being released from custody, after it was revealed that he came into contact with more than 50 police officers during the final hours of his life. Lawyers have demanded that the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which is investigating the contact South Wales police had with Mohamud Hassan, during his arrest and time in custody on the evening of 8 January, share evidence with his grieving family. Tuesday will mark one month since Hassan died and more than 30,000 people have signed a petition calling on the IOPC to release documents and CCTV footage detailing the contact between officers and the 24-year-old. Hassan, who was of Somali heritage, was arrested at his Cardiff home on a Friday evening on suspicion of breach of the peace. He arrived at the police station just after 10pm but was released without charge the following morning. Officers said he left custody at about 8.30am. It has now emerged that 52 police officers came into contact with Hassan during the short time he spent in police custody. The information was shared by senior independent investigator Ian Andrews during a meeting with the family and subsequently during a community reference group (CRG) meeting that took place last week. Lawyer Hilary Brown from Virgo Consultancy, who is representing the family, said Hassan’s parents and his family were deeply concerned by the new information provided to them by the IOPC regarding police contact. “They are understandably disturbed by it,” said Brown. “There are allegations of excessive force and to hear that Hassan was subject to this level of police contact has been really upsetting and then not to be given any further information about this, the contact, was really difficult and completely unfair.” Brown also raised concerns regarding the disclosure of this sensitive information to the wider public during the CRG meeting. The CRG is a forum to allow community leaders to ask questions regarding the progress of an IOPC case. On this occasion it was held on Zoom, with four local people from the community in attendance, shortly after the IOPC met with the family. “The family did not want the matter to be discussed with anybody else and they were trying to come to terms with this information and were devastated when they heard that this detail of the ongoing investigation had been disclosed during this meeting,” said Brown, who has already requested custody records and other documents which would reveal further important details of the police contact. “It seems unfair that information requested by the family has not been forthcoming and yet such sensitive information was revealed to a community group,” she added. Shortly after Hassan’s death, South Wales police said they had so far found no evidence of excessive force or misconduct. The force said its self-referral to the complaints watchdog was standard practice following a death after police contact. The IOPC director for Wales, Catrin Evans, said it would look carefully at the level of force used during the arrest and whether proper assessments were made of Hassan before he was released, but added that preliminary indications were that there was no physical trauma injury to explain the cause of death and toxicology tests would be needed. In response to the latest developments, the IOPC said it was in the course of obtaining accounts from a large number of police officers and staff who may potentially have had some direct or indirect contact with Hassan. Those police personnel included officers who went to his address at Newport Road on the Friday evening, those who were on duty at Cardiff Bay police station over two separate shifts, those who visited the Newport Road property on Saturday evening following his death, as well as others in supervisory positions. “We need to ensure we have spoken to anyone who may possibly have useful information to help us build a picture of what happened, as part of our thorough and independent investigation,” the IOPC spokesperson added. Since Hassan’s death, his family have paid for a private postmortem examination. The results of this and another public postmortem are expected to be released over the next three months. It is alleged that Hassan suffered a series of injuries during his time in custody."
2021-02-08T20:50:42Z,uk-news,UK news,"Home Office admits 15,000 people deleted from police records","A blunder led to the records of more than 15,000 people being deleted in their entirety from the Police National Computer, the Home Office has admitted. News of the data loss emerged last month, but on Monday the government put numbers on what had been erased. The policing minister, Kit Malthouse, said in a written statement that a total of 209,550 offence records relating to 112,697 individuals had been deleted from the PNC, which is run by the Home Office and used by forces across the UK. That included the entire records of 15,089 people. The government has said the deletion was the result of a coding mistake on 10 January. The error affects fingerprints, DNA and arrest records, and the government hopes to contain the damage and that no records will be permanently lost. Labour described the loss as “catastrophic”, warning that it could mean criminals could go free. Malthouse said fewer than 200 fingerprint records had been erased and that work was yet to be completed to recover lost fingerprint and DNA records held on other linked systems. Also yet to be completed was “work to ensure we are deleting any data that should have been deleted as usual when this incident first began”. The minister added: “We have also confirmed that no records of convictions have been deleted. Our analysis shows that 99.5% of the deleted records were created prior to 2011. Technicians are confident that all the data which has been deleted can be restored.” However, restoration will take another 12 weeks, Malthouse said. In the meantime, police will have to use alternatives and hope that nothing is missed. He said: “While the data is incomplete, there is the possibility that law enforcement partners will not have access to records and information that could help progress their inquiries and investigations.” The government has appointed former Metropolitan police commissioner Lord Hogan-Howe to investigate why the blunder occurred. He is due to report next month. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: “This statement confirms many of the worst fears about the impact of this catastrophic data loss. Even in the bes-case scenario, there will be three months during which criminals could walk free due to a dangerous lack of police records. “We do not trust a government with this appalling lack of leadership and grip will be able to rectify these huge errors. Ministers need to take personal responsibility for this huge security breach.”"
2021-02-08T20:14:51Z,uk-news,UK news,"Manchester police warned in 2016 over terrorism strategy, arena inquiry hears","Greater Manchester police were warned about shortcomings in their terrorism response plans six months before the Manchester Arena bombing, the public inquiry into the attack has been told. The inquiry heard on Monday how the police inspectorate outlined a number of concerns it had identified, as part of a national review, in a November 2016 “hot debrief” with GMP’s counter-terrorism lead, Catherine Hankinson. Among the inspectorate’s conclusions was the risk of a force duty officer becoming overwhelmed in the event of a marauding terrorist firearms incident (MTFA). Inspectors found that the majority of force duty officers “felt ill-equipped” to deal with a terrorism incident and needed more training before enacting Operation Plato, the police codename for a continuing marauding attack. The inquiry heard that the inspectorate report quoted an unnamed force duty officer as saying: “I get two days on how to command vehicle pursuit and approximately one to two hours in MTFA.” The inquiry has previously heard that, on receiving reports of gunshot injuries and an active gunman during the arena attack on 22 May 2017, Insp Dale Sexton, the force duty officer at GMP HQ, declared Operation Plato, believing an armed terrorist was on the loose. The Plato plan included the designation of a hot zone into which only suitably trained firearms officers could go, and dictated when emergency services could help those injured. The inquiry has heard that for the first 40 minutes after the blast, only one paramedic was in the City Room foyer, where Salman Abedi detonated his suicide bomb killing 22 people, and that the first fire engine arrived more than two hours after the explosion. Giving evidence on Monday, Andrew Buchan, associate inspector with Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services, said it found GMP’s Plato plan to be “very tactically focused” but did not go into detail about operations jointly conducted with other agencies. Buchan told counsel to the inquiry Paul Greaney QC that GMP had placed an “over-reliance” on the force duty officer (FDO) to lead its response to a terrorist attack. The inspectorate’s report was critical of “the number of tasks the FDO was expected to perform” saying that “in all likelihood there are so many that it may be some will not be completed or at least in the order expected”, the inquiry heard. The report concluded: “There is no question that the FDO is being overloaded with tasks in the initial stages of a potential Plato and will require urgent help.” Those findings were passed on to then assistant chief constable Hankinson – now assistant chief constable at West Yorkshire police – in early November 2016, when the terror threat level in the UK was severe. The hearing continues."
2021-02-08T18:08:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Britain's youngest convicted terrorist avoids jail,"Britain’s youngest ever convicted terrorist, who led a neo-Nazi cell from his grandmother’s house, has been sentenced to a two-year non-custodial rehabilitation order. The boy, now 16, from south-east Cornwall, was just 13 when he first downloaded bomb-making instructions. At 14 he had amassed a stash of terror material and shared far-right ideology including racist, homophobic and antisemitic views in online chatrooms. By the time his home was raided by police in July 2019, he had become the British cell leader of the Feuerkrieg Division, a neo-Nazi group that encouraged members to commit Anders Breivik-style terror attacks and was responsible for vetting and enlisting new members. One of his five UK recruits was Paul Dunleavy, 17, who was jailed last November for five and a half years for preparing for acts of neo-Nazi terrorism, and with whom he had discussed obtaining firearms. Another recruit, the court heard, was an undercover police officer. Police raided the teenager’s home, which he shared with his grandmother, on the basis of information that he had been constructing a weapon. No weapon was found, but his phone and laptop were seized and during the search officers found a Nazi flag and a copy of a neo-Nazi text. A Nazi slogan had been painted on the garden shed. The boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to 12 offences – two of dissemination of terrorist documents and 10 of possession of terrorist material – and was handed the 24-month youth rehabilitation order by Judge Mark Dennis QC at the Old Bailey. He was sentenced by video link from Bodmin magistrates court, where he was supported by his grandmother, who held his hand. Dennis told him he had “entered an online world of wicked prejudice” and any reoffending would lead to a “spiral of ever lengthening terms of incarceration” to protect the public. However, taking into account the boy’s guilty plea and expressions of remorse, he ruled out custody, saying it would undo the rehabilitation work that was already under way. He said: “You entered an online world of wicked prejudice and violent bigotry which has no place in a civilised society. You are now 16, coming on 17, years of age and any naivety or immaturity that may have played its part can no longer be put forward as an excuse. “Any resurfacing of such prejudice or bigotry or engagement in such extremist activity will inevitably lead you in one direction, and that is in a spiral of ever lengthening terms of incarceration in order to protect the public from such conduct. You now have the opportunity to put this behind you and to redirect your future.” Naomi Parsons, prosecuting, said the defendant’s young age was “alarming” and his conduct “betrays a maturity beyond his chronological age”. In mitigation, Deni Matthews said the youth was “damaged” and had “sought approval by expressing views he certainly does not ascribe to now and was unlikely to have ascribed to genuinely at the time”."
2021-02-08T17:41:04Z,uk-news,UK news,'He helped all his life': Jasna Badzak on the loss of her son Sven,"Sven Badzak had asked his mother, a doctor, to teach him first aid in case someone collapsed in the street after a heart attack or a stabbing. He never knew he would end up being a victim himself. The 22-year-old became one of two people to lose their lives in violence in London this weekend, prompting the prime minister to say he was concerned about a “rebounding” of crime figures as lockdown ends. Fourteen others were wounded in a spate of seven unconnected stabbings on Friday and Saturday. Sven’s grief-stricken mother, Jasna Badzak, 49, said her son had always wanted to help others. He donated some of his clothes to survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire and helped elderly people wherever he could. “He helped people all of his life,” she said.
Sven Badzak was was attacked on Saturday at around 5.30pm while waiting outside a bakery in Kilburn, north-west London, for smoked salmon and cream cheese bagels for himself and his mother. He was with a friend, 16, who was also stabbed and who is reported to be in a critical condition. Following his death, the police issued a statement saying the young man had been involved in an altercation with a group of males who had chased him. His mother is devastated by their choice of wording, telling the Guardian that witnesses had contacted her to say he was simply standing waiting outside the bagel shop when he lost his life. She said that her son never got involved in “altercations” or arguments with anyone. “The worst that ever happened was that I told him he was playing his music too loud,” she said. “Just the day before he died he was crying because he was moved by something he saw on TV about someone who was dying from Covid,” she said. “He was a very loving boy.” Jasna Badzak is a qualified medical doctor and wishes she had been there to help her son. “If only I had been with him when he was stabbed, I would have known exactly what to do to try to save his life,” she said. “But as his mother, the only thing I can’t do is return him from the dead.” Sven Badzak attended Wetherby’s private school, the school attended by princes William and Harry, and then Roehampton University. He was hoping to do a law conversion course to become a solicitor. He was working with his father in his construction company in the meantime. Badzak said she had not yet been allowed to see her son’s body. “I have received different information from the police – he was stabbed in the chest, he was stabbed in the stomach. They have given me several versions of what happened and of how he died.” Badzak, who has previously campaigned for the Conservative party, called on the prime minister and other politicians to help her to get justice for her son, posting pictures online of him as a boy with Boris Johnson, George Osborne and David Cameron. Originally from Yugoslavia, Badzak accused the police of “not doing their jobs properly”. “I feel less safe here in London with all the gang violence than during the war in the former Yugoslavia when I regularly had guns pointed at my head.” Johnson said his thoughts were with Jasna Badzak and her family. “I think that what’s happening on the streets of too many of our cities is very, very sad and I want to see kids protected from some of the gang crime, the knife crime, the culture of violence that they’re all too often sucked up in.” He said he is concerned there could be a “rebounding” in crime figures as the country emerges from lockdown, and said efforts were being made to ensure a “tough policing policy response” and also to “make sure that kids, young people, have other things to do, they don’t get sucked into the nihilistic culture of these gangs”. “That’s no consolation, I know, to a grieving mother, but we are doing absolutely everything we can to fight those gangs,” he added. When asked about the police use of the word “altercation” to describe the circumstances that resulted in Sven Badzak’s killing, a Metropolitan police spokesperson said: “Officers took a statement from a witness who reported seeing an argument between two groups shortly before the incident. The word altercation is a general term for an argument involving two parties. It doesn’t apportion blame to anyone and certainly doesn’t suggest provocation of any sort. “We acknowledge in the same quote that the victim in this incident was chased and was then attacked by a member of the chasing group. The investigation is still at an early stage and inquiries into the circumstances are ongoing.” Asked about the different information about Sven Badzak’s injuries given to his mother, the spokesperson said: “Officers were acting on the information they had available to them at the time. A postmortem examination will take place to establish the exact nature of the victim’s injuries.”"
2021-02-08T17:10:52Z,uk-news,UK news,UK weather: Storm Darcy to cause further disruption across UK,"Snow and icy conditions are set to cause further disruption across the UK as Storm Darcy brings more cold and snowy weather over the next few days. The Met Office has so far issued four national severe weather warnings for snow but further warnings are likely throughout the week. Amber warnings for snow are in place in central Scotland from 3am on Tuesday with road travel delays likely along with delays and cancellations to rail and air travel. About 5-10cm is expected fairly widely across the area, with up to 25cm in the worst-affected regions. The frequent snow showers that hit south-east England and East Anglia are expected to continue into the middle of the week with forecasters warning people to expect longer journey times by road, bus and train. Yellow warnings for snow and ice remain in place for most of the eastern half of the country until late on Wednesday night.
Steve Ramsdale, a Met Office chief meteorologist, said: “With cold air across all of the UK any precipitation will fall as snow. Snow showers will continue to feed into eastern parts through the week.” Overnight temperatures will remain low throughout the week, with lows of -10C expected as far south as East Anglia. “Daytime temperatures will also be cold, only reaching 1 or 2 degrees Celsius for many early in the week. With strong winds as well the wind chill will make it feel much colder,” said Ramsdale. In south-east England, the icy conditions and heavy snow caused mass disruption of rail services. Southeastern strongly advised customers to not attempt to travel on its network, with many routes closed and no replacement transport available. Greater Anglia announced a disrupted service across all routes with a reduced timetable until further notice. On Monday, police in parts of Suffolk, Norfolk and Essex told drivers not to travel as roads became impassable due to settled snow. Road closures were announced in Norfolk, Lincolnshire, Cumbria, Derbyshire and Hertfordshire.
Suffolk Highways said conditions were worsening, comparing the weather to the “beast from the east” of 2018, although the Met Office did not expect conditions to be as bitterly cold. The Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Jason Kelly said: “There is a chance of more organised snow affecting some western and south-western parts of the country as Atlantic frontal systems push into the cold air. There is a lot of uncertainty regarding which areas may see snow, but for now south-west England, south Wales and Northern Ireland look most prone.” Public Health England issued a cold weather alert for the whole of the country on Monday, saying it could have “a serious impact on health”. PHE’s Dr Owen Landeg said: “Cold weather can have a serious impact on health, particularly for older people and those with heart and lung problems, as it increases the risks of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections. “It’s really important during this particularly cold period to keep checking on frail or older neighbours or relatives, especially those living alone or who have serious illnesses.”"
2021-02-08T15:00:46Z,uk-news,UK news,"Royals vetted more than 1,000 laws via Queenâ€™s consent","More than 1,000 laws have been vetted by the Queen or Prince Charles through a secretive procedure before they were approved by the UK’s elected members of parliament, the Guardian has established. The huge number of laws subject to royal vetting cover matters ranging from justice, social security, pensions, race relations and food policy through to obscure rules on car parking charges and hovercraft.
They included draft laws that affected the Queen’s personal property such as her private estates in Balmoral and Sandringham, and potentially anything deemed to affect her personally. The Guardian has compiled a database of at least 1,062 parliamentary bills that have been subjected to Queen’s consent, stretching from the beginning of Elizabeth II’s reign through to the present day. The database illustrates that the opaque procedure of Queen’s consent has been exercised far more extensively than was previously believed.
Under the procedure, government ministers privately notify the Queen of clauses in draft parliamentary bills and ask for her consent to debate them. As part of a series investigating the use of the consent procedure, the Guardian has published documents from the National Archives that reveal the Queen has on occasions used the procedure to privately lobby the government.
The investigation uncovered evidence suggesting that she used the procedure to persuade government ministers to change a 1970s transparency law in order to conceal her private wealth from the public. The documents also show that on other occasions the monarch’s advisers demanded exclusions from proposed laws relating to road safety and land policy that appeared to affect her estates, and pressed for government policy on historic sites to be altered.
The database of 1,062 laws relates to legislation that the Queen vetted under consent rules, and it is not known on which occasions she also lobbied for changes to draft legislation. The Guardian has uncovered evidence of lobbying for changes to at least four draft laws, but it is possible she interfered with many more. When asked by the Guardian, the Queen’s representatives refused to say how many times she had requested alterations to legislation since she came to the throne in 1952. The royals describe the consent process as “a long-established convention that the Queen is asked by parliament to provide consent … for the debating of bills which would affect the prerogative or interests of the crown”. The database compiled by the Guardian reveals the vast swathe of draft UK law that ministers have decided to send to the palace for consideration. Some of the bills the Queen reviewed before they were passed by parliament relate to wealth or taxation. One of the richest families in Britain, with the monarch’s property investments exempt from inheritance tax and collections of fine art and jewellery built up over centuries, the Windsors are notoriously guarded about their finances.
Members of the Windsor family can have their will sealed from the public, unlike any other family in Britain, ensuring an unmatched level of secrecy around their private wealth. No confirmed figure of the Windsor family’s wealth exists, though estimates have placed it at hundreds of millions of pounds. In 2014, for example, the Queen and the heir to the throne screened the inheritance and trustees’ powers bill. Two years earlier she vetted the trusts (capital and income) bill. Trusts are legal arrangements often used by wealthy families to protect their assets from both tax and public scrutiny.
She has also screened bills covering whole swathes of government policymaking. At least 11 bills governing the railways have been vetted by the Queen, sometimes relating to the land owned by the royal estates. In 2013 the Queen gave her consent to the parliamentary bill to build the High Speed 2 rail line between London and Birmingham. Transport ministers had notified the palace that the bill affected the “interests of the crown” as the department needed to acquire 21 plots of land owned by the crown estate during the construction of the line. At least 10 bills relating to housing policy have been subject to Queen’s consent, as have five relating to laws on pensions, seven relating to the NHS and at least two concerning animal welfare. The government gave the Queen an exemption in a 2006 act to prevent the mistreatment of animals, stopping inspectors from entering her private estates. Some of the bills subjected to Queen’s consent are remarkably obscure and ostensibly have little relevance to the monarchy, raising questions about why the Windsors were asked to vet the bills. They include a 1963 bill relating to the British Museum, a 1986 bill on salmon, and the 2019 parking (code of practice) bill to regulate the behaviour of private car-clamping firms.
Dr Adam Tucker, a specialist in constitutional law at Liverpool University, said the breadth of laws made to undergo the Queen’s consent procedure was startling. “A lot of these bills are not distinctively about the crown, or mainly about the crown, or obviously about the crown in any way,” he said. “And yet they obviously still have some content which drags them into the process. “Seeing the sheer range, in this relentless list form, really drives home the sheer breadth of things that the procedure captures.” In other instances, a connection to the crown’s financial interests is plain, such as a 1988 bill affecting the duchy of Lancaster, the private estate that gives the Queen a multimillion-pound income. Buckingham Palace confirmed that the mechanism encompassed draft laws that affect the Queen’s private interests, such as her private estates, as well as anything that affects the Queen personally, whether as an individual or as a land owner or employer.
A spokesperson for the Queen said: “Whether Queen’s consent is required is decided by parliament, independently from the royal household, in matters that would affect crown interests, including personal property and personal interests of the monarch. “If consent is required, draft legislation is, by convention, put to the sovereign to grant solely on advice of ministers and as a matter of public record.” She added: “Queen’s consent is a parliamentary process, with the role of sovereign purely formal. Consent is always granted by the monarch where requested by government. Any assertion that the sovereign has blocked legislation is simply incorrect.” The Cabinet Office said: “Queen’s consent is a longstanding convention and a requirement of the parliamentary process. Consent is routinely sought by the government and agreed by the monarch as a matter of course.” A little-questioned rule Many of the laws appear to relate to matters of the royal prerogative, the powers of state that are formally vested in the monarch but are exercised by the government. The fact that the consent procedure takes place is briefly noted in the parliamentary record. In the Commons, a minister nods when asked by the Speaker, while in the Lords a minister will read a rote passage of text. Politicians infrequently question the procedure. One of the rare occasions was in 2015 when the Labour peer Lord Berkeley asked why the Queen’s consent was required for the enterprise bill after the rote passage had been read out. Lord Taylor, the then government chief whip in the Lords, replied that it was “a courtesy which Her Majesty extends to the house before we consider the third reading of a bill. It is not normal to discuss in detail what the interests are.”"
2021-02-08T15:00:45Z,uk-news,UK news,"Queen lobbied for changes to three more laws, documents reveal","When Prince Philip was spotted driving without a seatbelt on a Norfolk road in 2019, less than 48 hours after being involved in a nearby car crash, police issued “suitable words of advice”. The then 97-year-old consort could perhaps have been forgiven for assuming road safety law should not apply when he was driving in Sandringham, which is owned by his wife. That was precisely the legal position the Queen’s advisers took 50 years ago when they told the government the monarch did not much like the idea that the nation’s traffic rules should apply to her private estates. Details of this and other examples of secret lobbying by Buckingham Palace are contained in documents unearthed by the Guardian in the National Archives. They reveal how the monarch has used an arcane parliamentary process known as Queen’s consent to secretly press ministers to amend legislation.
On Monday the Guardian revealed that the Queen’s representatives lobbied Edward Heath’s government to alter a proposed transparency law, enabling her to hide her private wealth from the public. Now the Guardian can reveal three new instances – including the 1968 transport bill – that appear to show the Queen taking advantage of her advanced sight of proposed legislation to quietly press ministers to make alterations to benefit the crown or her private interests, or to reflect her opinions. The documents are historical and also written in the officious language of mandarins and royal courtiers. But they undermine the long-held assumption that the Queen does not meddle in the affairs of parliament. They also appear at odds with Buckingham Palace’s insistence that the Queen always grants her consent to bills at the government’s request as part of a “purely formal” parliamentary convention.
Dr Adam Tucker, a senior lecturer in constitutional law at the University of Liverpool, said he was “shocked” after reviewing the documents, which the Guardian has published. He said they undermined the claim that Queen’s consent was a mere formality. “The whole tone of all this documentation is that this is completely normal. Everyone involved is treating it as a genuine dialogue about policy, and an opportunity for legislation to be changed. “If it was a purely formal process, which it’s supposed to be, then no documentation like this would exist at all. There would be no substantive conversations about changing legislation.”
Dr Thomas Adams, who teaches constitutional law at Oxford University and who also examined the documents, observed: “The very possibility of Queen’s consent not being given at the appropriate stage in the process of the bill becoming law is clearly being used to influence the overall shape of that legislation.” Buckingham Palace declined to say how often the monarch had sought to use the consent mechanism to influence proposed legislation during her reign. Nor was it willing to answer any questions about the three newly discovered cases that show her advisers lobbying to change specific bills. Case 1: national monuments In one of the newly discovered cases, dating from 1982, a formal request for consent for a government bill relating to the preservation of national monuments prompted a palace response heavily hinting that alterations should be made to the draft law first. Margaret Thatcher’s government had written to the palace outlining its plans to reorganise the upkeep of Britain’s national monuments. It included a proposal to create an organisation that would preserve ancient monuments and historic buildings in England – in essence a forerunner to English Heritage. On 17 November 1982, a Whitehall official explained to Philip Moore, the Queen’s private secretary, that this new organisation could potentially subsume an existing royal commission. Six days later, Moore protested “most strongly at not being consulted at an earlier stage in accordance with the rules which are clearly laid down”, complaining that the bill had already been introduced in the House of Lords.
He wrote that the Queen had no objection to some proposals in the bill. However, he said, “Her Majesty inclines to the view that it would not be sensible for the functions of the royal commission to be taken over by the new commission. It would not therefore seem a very good idea to include in the bill a power, by statutory instrument, enabling the functions of the royal commission to be taken over by the new commission at some stage in the future.” He added: “I am glad to have your assurance that the Queen will be fully consulted before any decision is taken on this.” Despite a formal request for Queen’s consent for the new law, Moore’s letter detailing the Queen’s preferred policy approach contains no mention of her consent. By not giving her consent, the Queen’s response, in effect, denied parliament the ability to debate the law at that point. A concerned civil servant wrote: “The secretary of state should see straight away the attached response which [the department] have received from Buckingham Palace to their formal approach to Queen’s consent … Clearly this view must affect the way in which we go forward.”
The Queen ultimately consented to the bill six months later. However, the royal commission would survive for another 17 years. It was merged with English Heritage in 1999. Tucker said: “This looks like an example of consent being withheld based on an objection to the content of the legislation. Withholding is when you’re asked for something and you don’t give it.” Case 2: road safety The second case relates to the attempt by Harold Wilson’s government in 1968 to pass legislation updating road safety law. The files suggest that the Queen’s advisers attempted to use the consent procedure to try to extract a commitment from the government that the new law would not apply to her private estates. The then transport secretary, Richard Marsh, had written to the Queen requesting her consent for amendments to a new transport bill. The amendments would rationalise traffic law so that all roads to which the public had access, including those on crown land, would be governed by the same rules. The Queen’s then private solicitor, Matthew Farrer, telephoned civil servants. “He explained that the reason why we had not yet heard from the palace (an interim letter is apparently on its way) is that he is not entirely happy about the clause as it is drafted,” a civil servant noted. Farrer was “bothered” about roads on the Queen’s private estates such as Sandringham, “which he certainly would not wish to see any traffic law applied to”. “He is concerned solely with the crown private estates,” the official added.
Ultimately the Queen granted her consent to the bill – but only on the condition that a key clause did not apply to her private estates and that “objections which … have been raised by the crown estate and the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall are satisfactorily resolved”. A handwritten note on a Whitehall document noted: “The upshot of all this was that we inserted two small changes in subsections 1 and 2 of the new clause.” Case 3: land leasing The third case relates to a 1975 Labour government bill concerning the leasing of private land for development. Under the proposals, those intending to lease land for development would do so through local authorities in an attempt to secure reasonable rates. However, lawyers representing the royal family’s estates – including Farrer – attended a meeting with civil servants at which they outlined how an aspect of the bill “was causing them grave concern”. They warned the civil servants that “unless a modification were made to the terms of the bill”, they would escalate their complaints to a senior minister. “It’s very clear that there was pressure being put on the government to modify the terms of the bill,” said Tucker. The Queen gave her consent to the bill.
Buckingham Palace said: “Queen’s consent is a parliamentary process, with the role of sovereign purely formal. Consent is always granted by the monarch where requested by government. Any assertion that the sovereign has blocked legislation is simply incorrect. “Whether Queen’s consent is required is decided by parliament, independently from the royal household, in matters that would affect crown interests, including personal property and personal interests of the monarch. “If consent is required, draft legislation is, by convention, put to the sovereign to grant solely on advice of ministers and as a matter of public record.” The Cabinet Office said: “Queen’s consent is a longstanding convention and a requirement of the parliamentary process. Consent is routinely sought by the government and agreed by the monarch as a matter of course.”"
2021-02-08T12:55:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Police issue Lake District warning after rescuer falls 150 metres,"Police have urged visitors to stay away from the Lake District after a mountain rescuer fell 150 metres and sustained “life-changing injuries” while coming to the aid of two hikers. Rescuers were called to help two men who had travelled more than 100 miles in contravention of coronavirus regulations to camp overnight on a 780-metre (2,500ft) fell in near-freezing conditions. The hikers, who were from the Leicester area and the Liverpool area, requested help after one of them experienced chest pains on Saturday morning. Patterdale Mountain Rescue said an experienced member of its team slipped and fell 150 metres (490 feet), sustaining spinal injuries and facial fractures while making his way to the pair. The 60-year-old man, who has not been named, was airlifted to the Royal Preston hospital where he remained in a serious but stable condition on Monday. Mike Blakey, the operational lead for the Lake District’s mountain rescue teams, said: “I cannot stress enough the message to stay at home during lockdown. This rescue, and the subsequent life-changing injuries incurred by our team member, were avoidable.”
The rescue took place in “atrocious” conditions, Blakey said, with 18 volunteers battling a severe wind chill to get to the hikers, who were camping on the Red Screes fell between the villages of Patterdale and Ambleside. Andrew Slattery, assistant chief constable of Cumbria constabulary, said the two hikers were issued with £200 fines “which is the only legal penalty available in these circumstances”, despite them making round trips of nearly 600 miles (965km) during a national lockdown. He said: “We would appeal to everyone to stay at home as much as possible, exercise locally, and stay well within the limits of their own experience and equipment when exercising in the outdoors. “It is vital that anybody venturing on to the fells in winter takes note of the weather forecasts and mountain conditions before setting off. Now is not a time to be taking unnecessary risks as our ambulance service and hospitals are still under extreme pressure from high numbers of Covid patients.” Police and mountain rescuers have repeatedly urged visitors to stay away from the Lake District after the first lockdown resulted in huge numbers of people being drawn to its picturesque hills last year."
2021-02-08T10:59:59Z,uk-news,UK news,UK weather: Storm Darcy to bring more snowfall and gale-force winds,"Heavy snow and gale-force winds that hit south-east England and East Anglia on Sunday are forecast to continue into Monday as Storm Darcy brings icy conditions to much of the country. Amber and yellow weather warnings for snow issued by the Met Office were expected to cause widespread travel problems and possible power cuts to parts of London, the east and south-east of England. Forecasters are warning of a strong chance of roads becoming blocked by deep snow, “with many stranded vehicles and passengers likely”. Snow accumulations of 5-10cm (2-4ins) will be widespread in the affected area, and reaching up to 30cm (12ins) in places.
Yellow warnings for snow and ice will also remain in place for the entire country until Wednesday evening. The Met Office said the snow was forecast to turn more intermittent on Monday morning before easing gradually by the afternoon. The AA said “treacherous” driving conditions had led to numerous accidents on UK roads on Monday. Spokesman Ben Sheridan said: “Roads will be lethal where snow and ice has hit the UK. If you must travel, reduce your speed to account for the conditions and leave plenty of space behind other vehicles.” Meanwhile, National Rail has told train passengers that services across the country are likely to be affected. It said some routes might need to be closed, and urged customers to travel “later in the morning”. Southern Rail announced service cancellations in south-east London, while networks in Kent and Essex have closed train lines. Several Covid vaccination centres remain closed, including Clacton hospital, Colchester United’s stadium, Gainsborough sports centre in Ipswich and Chevington Close in Bury St Edmunds.
The easternmost part of the UK was worst affected by Sunday afternoon’s heavy snow, with the Met Office reporting disruptive conditions in Ipswich and the wider Suffolk area, Kent and parts of Essex.
Regions affected by the amber warning included Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Kent, which experienced “widespread, persistent and occasionally heavy snow”, as well as 40-50mph gusts that could cause snowdrifts until midday on Monday. The Met Office said the cold snap was the result of “bitterly cold” strong easterly winds from Ukraine and the Black Sea spilling across the UK on Sunday, but added that the chill was not expected to be as bitingly sharp as with the “beast from the east” in 2018. Forecasters predicted up to 30cm of snow in the Kent Downs and the North Downs, while many parts of Scotland and north-east England could be hit by 2-5cm of snow, with 10-15cm possible in higher regions above 200 metres. Roads may become blocked by deep snow, with the possibility of stranded vehicles and passengers. Daytime temperatures were forecast to stay in low single figures on Monday for much of the country, with some places staying below freezing but strong winds could make it feel even colder.
Sarah Kent, a Met Office meteorologist, said: “There will be significant disruptive snowfall across the south-east. Within this area, there is a small chance particularly over the downs of Kent and the North Downs that you could see 25-30cm of snow. It is a small chance but the threat is there, up to a foot of snow potentially combined with extremely strong easterly winds. Even inland in that area, gusting could be 45mph and higher than that on the coasts. “This could lead to significant drifting of any lying snow and obviously blizzards for the snow coming past you for anyone who is attempting to travel.”
Public Health England has issued a cold weather alert for the whole of England from Saturday through to Wednesday. Dr Owen Landeg, of PHE, said: “Cold weather isn’t just uncomfortable, it can have a serious impact on health. “For older people and those with heart and lung problems, it can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections. So it’s really crucial at this time, especially ahead of a potentially very cold snap, to remember to check on frail or older neighbours or relatives, especially those living alone or who have serious illnesses.”"
2021-02-08T00:00:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Police name stabbing victim after weekend of attacks in London,"A 22-year-old man chased by a group and knifed to death in one of a spate of stabbings in London over the weekend has been named by police. The Metropolitan police have enacted additional stop-and-search powers and beefed up patrols after the series of incidents in the capital, believed to be unconnected, which left two young men dead, a 16-year-old critically ill in hospital and 11 others wounded. One of the two fatalities was named on Sunday as Sven Badzak, who died in hospital after being stabbed while walking with a 16-year-old friend in Kilburn, north-west London, at about 5.30pm on Saturday. His mother, Jasna Badzak, a former Conservative activist, shared pictures on Twitter of her son, as a child, with Boris Johnson, David Cameron and George Osborne, and appealed to the prime minister, former prime minister and former chancellor to intervene in the case.
She told the MyLondon website her son had gone out to the shops to pick up some orange juice and was the “nicest of nice kids”, adding: “He was the most polite boy you could possibly imagine. The perfect manners … He was beloved by everybody.” Ch Insp Darren Jones of Scotland Yard said: “At this early stage we believe Sven and his friend became involved in an altercation with a group of males. As this group chased the pair, Sven and his friend became separated. Sven fell to the ground and was attacked by a number of the group. “His friend was also attacked but managed to seek sanctuary in a shop – however, he remains critically ill in hospital.” The weekend’s violence began on Friday evening, when five stabbings were reported in just over three hours in south London, leaving one man dead and nine people injured. No arrests have been made after a 22-year-old man died in an altercation with a group of males at a property in Croydon. One neighbour told PA Media she saw police and medical staff trying to save a heavily bleeding young man. The victim’s mother showed up “crying and in pieces”, the witness said. Elsewhere in Croydon, two people were arrested after a man in his 40s was found with a stab wound at an address on Dingwall Road. The victim was later arrested on suspicion of affray and a 38-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm. Police said none of the nine other casualties from the five incidents was considered to be in a life-threatening condition. At about 11.20am on Saturday officers were called to reports of a fight in Coulsdon, south London, where a man in his 20s had been stabbed and was taken to hospital. Two men have been arrested. Then shortly after 3pm police were called to a stabbing of a 24-year-old near West Croydon station. Scotland Yard said more officers had been deployed in response to the violence. Sarah Jones, the MP for Croydon Central and Labour’s shadow policing minister, said it was an “incredibly unusual and sad situation with so many incidents in 24 hours, but they are all unconnected and people can rest assured the police are doing what is required”. The stabbings came as the Home Office commits £35.5m to help violence reduction units, which support projects that carry out preventative work with children and young people, to battle the “horrors” of physical attacks. Priti Patel, the home secretary, said: “Violence reduction units play a vital role in preventing young people from being dragged into the horrors of serious violence, and this funding will enable them to continue this crucial work. I will continue to back our police with the resources and powers they need to cut crime and make your community safer.”"
2021-02-07T18:51:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Couple reunited after year apart under care home lockdown rules,"An emotional reunion between a married couple divided for a year by care home lockdown rules has highlighted the pain of separation still faced by thousands of people. Stanley Harbour, 83, and his wife Mavis Harbour, 81, embraced at the Lever Edge care home in Great Lever, Bolton in a moment captured on film by care workers who had laid out flowers and champagne flutes to mark the moment. Stanley, who lives with dementia, had been confined to the home since his wife last visited him in February 2020, before the Covid-19 pandemic triggered care home lockdowns, and they had been “lost without each other” according to the Manchester Evening News. Mavis Harbour kissed and hugged her husband before they sat together holding hands across a table scattered with rose petals. A care worker in face mask and visor poured them glasses of sparkling wine. “I couldn’t believe it when I saw Mavis,” said Stanley, according to the paper. “It was like a dream.”
The couple, who met in the late 1950s and married in the 1960s, have two sons, three grandchildren and one great grandchild. “We were so pleased to reunite Stanley and Mavis,” said Lisa Martin, home manager at Lever Edge care home. “There wasn’t a dry eye in the room when she was finally able to see her beloved Stanley again.” Although almost all care home residents have now had their first dose of vaccine, visits remain highly restricted and must be conducted from behind windows or screens, if they are allowed at all. Many homes are awaiting government guidance about how the vaccination programme may allow them to increase contact, the lack of which relatives and residents believe has been causing serious mental and physical health problems. Last week, care minister Helen Whately indicated residents will need their second dose before visits can restart."
2021-02-07T17:32:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Executive who sold cladding for Grenfell to appear before inquiry,"The executive who sold combustible cladding for use on Grenfell Tower will face questioning for the first time this week when the public inquiry into the disaster resumes after a two-month suspension caused by the rising number of Covid cases. Deborah French, then UK sales manager at Arconic, is to be asked what she knew of the danger posed by the plastic-filled panels that the first phase of the inquiry found were the main cause of the spread of the 14 June 2017 fire, which claimed 72 lives. The hearings have seen emails from an internal discussion she had about a spate of major fires involving similar panels in the United Arab Emirates in 2013, after which she told customers her company would continue to sell both its fire-retardant and non-fire-retardant panels. In one email released to the inquiry a colleague told her the fires “will impact yourselves and the need [to make the] fire retardant core more prevalent”. French is also expected to be asked about Arconic’s knowledge of how combustible its materials were, after emails from her technical colleagues showed that warnings were circulating internally that they were not suitable for high-rise buildings. Claude Wehrle, a technical manager at the firm who is refusing to give evidence to the inquiry, knew in the years before Arconic’s panels were sold for Grenfell that they were “dangerous” and showed “bad behaviour exposed to fire”, according to emails already exposed. French asked Wehrle in 2011 if she could send a client details of the different fillings – fire retardant (FR) and polyethylene (PE). He told her: “For sure you’re NOT allowed to diffuse to the customer those documents.” He told her the “FR core is done with 30% organic part and 70% mineral part. PE is only organic. As organic is the material that is going to burn in case of a fire, FR is better”. PE was the version sold for use at Grenfell. Wehrle is one of three witnesses who worked for Arconic before the disaster who have claimed that an arcane French law called the blocking statute means they cannot give evidence. The French government has said that is not the case. Bereaved people and survivors of the Grenfell fire submitted a petition with more than 18,000 signatures to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, last week, urging him to apply diplomatic pressure. The inquiry confirmed it would “empty-chair” the witnesses if they did not attend. A spokesperson said: “In January, the inquiry wrote to the representatives of Gwenaëlle Derrendinger, Peter Froehlich and Claude Wehrle to confirm that, as they are still declining to attend hearings, evidence relating to them will be considered at the hearings without them having the opportunity to respond.”
After initially refusing, Claude Schmidt, the president of Arconic’s French subsidiary which sold the Grenfell panels, has agreed to answer questions through an interpreter. The inquiry has already heard how Wehrle messaged Schmidt in 2009 about a fire in a building in Romania using similar panels. “Here are some pictures to show you how dangerous PE can be when it comes to architecture,” he wrote. The inquiry is to restart using Zoom video conferencing, in part because of the vulnerability to Covid of the 74-year old chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick. There was an outbreak among inquiry staff in December. Bereaved people and survivors have said they want a rapid return to in-person hearings. They say it would be wrong for key witnesses, particularly those from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the tenants management organisation, not to give evidence in front of residents. “Given the urgency of the inquiry’s work and for the reasons set out to core participants, the panel took the decision that an indefinite further delay was unacceptable, and that to proceed with remote hearings was therefore the only acceptable option available,” an inquiry spokesperson said. “Remote hearings are a temporary measure to be used only for as long as is absolutely necessary. As soon as it is safe to do so, limited attendance hearings will resume.”"
2021-02-07T15:00:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Revealed: Queen lobbied for change in law to hide her private wealth,"The Queen successfully lobbied the government to change a draft law in order to conceal her “embarrassing” private wealth from the public, according to documents discovered by the Guardian. A series of government memos unearthed in the National Archives reveal that Elizabeth Windsor’s private lawyer put pressure on ministers to alter proposed legislation to prevent her shareholdings from being disclosed to the public. Following the Queen’s intervention, the government inserted a clause into the law granting itself the power to exempt companies used by “heads of state” from new transparency measures. The arrangement, which was concocted in the 1970s, was used in effect to create a state-backed shell corporation which is understood to have placed a veil of secrecy over the Queen’s private shareholdings and investments until at least 2011. The true scale of her wealth has never been disclosed, though it has been estimated to run into the hundreds of millions of pounds.
Evidence of the monarch’s lobbying of ministers was uncovered by a Guardian investigation into the royal family’s use of an arcane parliamentary procedure, known as Queen’s consent, to secretly influence the formation of British laws. Unlike the better-known procedure of royal assent, a formality that marks the moment when a bill becomes law, Queen’s consent must be sought before legislation can be approved by parliament. It requires ministers to alert the Queen when legislation might affect either the royal prerogative or the private interests of the crown. The website of the royal family describes it as “a long established convention” and constitutional scholars have tended to regard consent as an opaque but harmless example of the pageantry that surrounds the monarchy. But documents unearthed in the National Archives, which the Guardian is publishing this week, suggest that the consent process, which gives the Queen and her lawyers advance sight of bills coming into parliament, has enabled her to secretly lobby for legislative changes. Thomas Adams, a specialist in constitutional law at Oxford University who reviewed the new documents, said they revealed “the kind of influence over legislation that lobbyists would only dream of”. The mere existence of the consent procedure, he said, appeared to have given the monarch “substantial influence” over draft laws that could affect her. ‘Disclosure would be embarrassing’ The papers reveal that in November 1973 the Queen feared that a proposed bill to bring transparency to company shareholdings could enable the public to scrutinise her finances. As a result she dispatched her private lawyer to press the government to make changes. Matthew Farrer, then a partner at the prestigious law firm Farrer & Co, visited civil servants at the then Department of Trade and Industry to discuss the proposed transparency measures in the companies bill, which had been drafted by Edward Heath’s government. The bill sought to prevent investors from secretly building up significant stakes in listed companies by acquiring their shares through front companies or nominees. It would therefore include a clause granting directors the right to demand that any nominees owning their company’s shares reveal, when asked, the identities of their clients. Three crucial pages of correspondence between civil servants at the trade department reveal how, at that meeting, Farrer relayed the Queen’s objection that the law would reveal her private investments in listed companies, as well as their value. He proposed that the monarch be exempted. “I have spoken to Mr Farrer,” a civil servant called CM Drukker wrote on 9 November. “As I had recalled he – or rather, I think, his clients – are quite as concerned over the risk of disclosure to directors of a company as to shareholders and the general public.
“He justifies this not only because of the risk of inadvertent or indiscreet leaking to other people,” Drukker continued, “but more basically because disclosure to any person would be embarrassing.” After being informed that exempting only the crown from the legislation would mean it was obvious any shareholdings so anonymised were the Queen’s property, Farrer, the correspondence states, “took fright somewhat, emphasised that the problem was taken very seriously and suggested – somewhat tentatively – that we had put them into this quandary and must therefore find a way out.” Drukker continued: “He did not like any suggestions that holdings were not these days so embarrassing, given the wide knowledge of, for example, landed property held. Nor did he see that the problem might be resolved by any avoidance of holdings in particular companies. It was the knowledge per se that was objectionable.” After being informed by Farrer “that he must now seek instruction” from his client, Drukker advised a colleague: “I think we must now do what you suggested we should eventually do – warn ministers.”
Three days later, another civil servant, CW Roberts, summarised the problem in a second memo. “Mr Farrer was not only concerned that information about shares held for the Queen, and transactions in them, could become public knowledge (since it would appear on the company’s register) and thus the subject of possible controversy,” Roberts wrote. “He regards any disclosure of beneficial ownership of shares by the crown, even if restricted to the directors of the company, as potentially embarrassing, because of the risk of leaks.” He continued: “Mr Farrer has accepted an invitation to go into the matter with us, but has said that he will not be able to do so for a few days, until he has taken instructions from his principals.” Secrecy clause By the following month the Heath government had developed an ingenious proposal through which the Queen’s dilemma might be resolved. “With the help of the Bank of England, my department have evolved the following solutions, which will appear in the bill,” wrote the Conservative trade minister Geoffrey Howe to a fellow minister. Howe proposed that the government would insert a new clause into the bill granting the government the power to exempt certain companies from the requirement to declare the identities of their shareholders. Officially, the change would be for the benefit of a variety of wealthy investors. “Such a class could be generally defined to cover, say, heads of state, governments, central monetary authorities, investment boards and international bodies formed by governments,” Howe continued. In practice, however, the Queen was plainly the intended beneficiary of the arrangement. The government intended to create a shell company through which a range of these investors could hold shares. It meant that any curious member of the public would be unable to pinpoint which of the shares owned by the company were held on behalf of the monarch. “My department have discussed this solution with the legal advisers to the Queen,” Howe noted. “While they cannot of course commit themselves to using the suggested new facility, they accept that it is a perfectly reasonable solution to the problem which they face, and that they could not ask us to do more. I am therefore arranging that the necessary provisions should appear in the bill.”
It would be three years before the bill and its secrecy clause would come into law. In February 1974 Heath called a general election, resulting in all legislation that was going through parliament being thrown out. However, the proposal was resuscitated by the subsequent Labour government under Harold Wilson and became law in 1976, with much of the original bill simply copied into the second edition. The exemption was almost immediately granted to a newly formed company called Bank of England Nominees Limited, operated by senior individuals at the Bank of England, which has previously been identified as a possible vehicle through which the Queen held shares. Shares believed to be owned by the Queen were transferred to the company in April 1977, according to a 1989 book by the journalist Andrew Morton. The exemption is believed to have helped conceal the Queen’s private fortune until at least 2011, when the government disclosed that Bank of England Nominees was no longer covered by it. Four years ago, the company was closed down. Precisely what happened to the shares it held on behalf of others is not clear. As a dormant company, it never filed public accounts itemising its activities. ‘A possible landmine’ The use of Queen’s consent is normally recorded in Hansard, the official record of parliamentary debates, before a bill’s third reading. However, no notification of consent for the 1976 bill appears in the record, possibly because it was only sought for the 1973 version that never made it to third reading. Howe, who died in 2015, appears to have disclosed the role of Queen’s consent – which is invoked when ministers believe a draft law might affect the royal prerogative or the private interests of the crown – during a parliamentary debate in 1975 in a previously unnoticed speech. “In relation to that draft legislation, as to any other, the advisers of the Queen, as they do as a matter of routine, examined the bill to see whether it contained, inadvertently or otherwise, any curtailment of the royal prerogative,” Howe said. Howe had been prompted to speak in the parliamentary debate during a row caused by the leak of high-level Whitehall papers to the Morning Star newspaper. The leak revealed the government’s intention to exempt the Windsor wealth from the companies bill. It was a major scoop for the communist newspaper, but the leaked papers did not establish whether the Queen had lobbied the government to help conceal her wealth. At the time, the Financial Times remarked that “a possible landmine for the Conservatives would be if Buckingham Palace in 1973 had taken the initiative in suggesting that disclosure of the Queen’s shareholdings should be excluded from the bill”. The newly discovered papers reveal exactly that. “At the very least, it seems clear that representations on the part of the crown were material in altering the shape of the legislation,” Adams said. When contacted by the Guardian, Buckingham Palace did not answer any questions about the Queen’s lobbying to alter the companies bill, or whether she had used the consent procedure to put pressure on the government. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Queen said: “Queen’s consent is a parliamentary process, with the role of sovereign purely formal. Consent is always granted by the monarch where requested by government. “Whether Queen’s consent is required is decided by parliament, independently from the royal household, in matters that would affect crown interests, including personal property and personal interests of the monarch,” she said. “If consent is required, draft legislation is, by convention, put to the sovereign to grant solely on advice of ministers and as a matter of public record.”
• This article was amended on 10 February 2021. An earlier version incorrectly described Geoffrey Howe as “trade secretary”. He was a trade minister at the time, not a secretary of state."
2021-02-07T15:00:13Z,uk-news,UK news,How Queen’s consent raises questions over UK democracy,"The Queen does not meddle in the affairs of parliament. That is a cornerstone of Britain’s system of constitutional monarchy. Or at least it is supposed to be. The Guardian’s investigation into the secretive power of Queen’s consent, whereby the monarch is provided with advance sight of draft laws and invited to approve them, casts this fundamental assumption into doubt. The investigation uncovered evidence suggesting that she used the arcane procedure to lobby the government to change a draft law in order to conceal her private wealth from the public for decades. The exact origins of Queen’s consent are unclear. There is evidence it was first invoked in 1728 in relation to maritime law, when King George II gave parliament permission to debate the suppression of piracy bill. “We don’t know very much. It’s not a modern development,” said Dr Adam Tucker, a senior lecturer in constitutional law at the University of Liverpool who was one of three experts to give evidence to a parliamentary committee examining the mechanism of consent in 2014. In its present incarnation, the procedure is supposed to apply to two categories of laws. The first are those that affect the fundamental powers of state known as the royal prerogative, such as the ability to declare war or conduct foreign affairs. While formally such powers are vested in the person of the monarch, in practice they are exercised by the government. The second category of laws in which consent is invoked is those affecting the revenues, assets or interests of the crown, principally referring to the historical landholdings known as the crown estate, the Queen’s estate, the Duchy of Lancaster, and Prince Charles’s estate, the Duchy of Cornwall. Current guidance from government lawyers states that this also encompasses properties owned by the Windsor family privately, such as Sandringham or Balmoral, as well as the Queen’s private investments. If government lawyers advise that consent is required, the minister handling the bill writes to the Queen’s private secretary, explaining how the law will affect her and formally requesting her approval. On occasions, ministers have stated that it was their “humble duty” to request her consent to bills, according to Whitehall documents. Copies of the draft law are enclosed with the request, which is also sent to the Queen’s private solicitors, Farrer & Co, who examine the draft bill and advise her. At least two weeks are given for the royals and their lawyers to scrutinise the draft law.
Buckingham Palace insists that the monarch’s role is “purely formal”. Declassified files show that from time to time the palace has complained that the Queen has not been given enough time to respond, or that the government has treated the procedure too casually. In 1983, Robin Butler, then an aide to the prime minister, warned that the procedure was “not a formality since clauses in such bills frequently have to be referred by the palace to the Queen’s solicitor for legal advice”. A similar provision for the Prince of Wales also exists for legislation that might affect his private estate, the Duchy of Cornwall. If consent is withheld, parliament is in effect blocked from completing its scrutiny of the law. “If Queen’s or prince’s consent is not signified (in a case where it is required), the question on third reading of the bill … cannot be put,” parliamentary guidance states.
Some constitutionalists have previously harboured suspicions about maintaining an anachronism like Queen’s consent in the 21st century. Tucker said: “It involves people reflecting upon the substance and the content of the legislation. It involves a delay of two weeks, while the Queen’s lawyers are given time to advise the Queen on the content of the legislation.” He contrasted the mechanism with that of royal assent, whereby the Queen formally approves laws at the end of the legislative process, rather than during it. “There is a real contrast between how serious, how substantive the two processes are.” Tucker and two other constitutional scholars told the 2014 parliamentary committee that the process had little or no democratic justification. Robert Blackburn, a professor of constitutional law at King’s College London, warned of “an inherent danger that a misguided future monarch or prince of Wales, holding strong moral views on the subject matter of a bill covered by the royal consent procedure, might believe he or she is entitled to impose his opinion on the matter”.
Rodney Brazier, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Manchester, wrote that the monarch had a unique right among Britons to approve proposed laws. “Why should a sovereign and a duke of Cornwall have that advantage, and why should a sovereign have even a theoretical ability to strangle legislation early in its life?” he said. Neither the government nor Buckingham Palace routinely release information disclosing what opinions the monarch offered when asked to approve draft bills. Previous attempts to understand even the basic functioning of the opaque procedure have been aggressively resisted. An academic who in 2011 requested the government’s guidelines on how consent is applied spent two years fighting a legal case before it was released. Six years ago the parliamentary committee recommended several changes to improve transparency, but little was done. Buckingham Palace said Queen’s consent had only ever been refused on the advice of ministers. “Whether Queen’s consent is required is decided by parliament, independently from the royal household, in matters that would affect crown interests, including personal property and personal interests of the monarch,” a palace spokesperson said."
2021-02-07T15:00:13Z,uk-news,UK news,How archaic process of Queen’s consent is still used on modern laws,"On 6 January 2020, a senior civil servant sent the Queen’s top aide, Sir Edward Young, a letter that was clothed in dry formality. The official, Georgina Collins, said she was writing on behalf of the environment secretary “to seek Queen’s consent to measures within the agriculture bill. This bill contains measures on future agricultural policy that affect the interests of the crown.” It was the first of four letters in similar tone that were sent to the palace by senior officials at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs over a period of 11 months. The most recent was dated 3 November. The letters reveal how the archaic parliamentary mechanism, which originated in the 1700s, is still being used in the present day to give the Queen – an unelected individual – the unique right to be consulted on draft laws that affect the crown and her private interests. In this case, the correspondence, obtained using the Freedom of Information Act, suggests the government gave the Queen a chance to screen the legislation because it could affect one of her most treasured possessions – the grand Sandringham estate in Norfolk.
As one of the country’s biggest landowners, the Queen is among the recipients of the biggest farming subsidies in England. Over the years she has received millions of pounds in taxpayers’ subsidies for her farm that sits on the estate. Last year the subsidy amounted to £936,000. A Sandringham spokesperson said: “Farming and conservation are at the forefront of the estate’s practices, and this annual subsidy supports Sandringham’s ongoing conversion to organic farming and commitment to maintaining the local environment and wildlife habitats across the estate.” The consent procedure requires the government to send draft legislation to the monarch – or, on occasion, the heir to the throne – so that they and their lawyers can examine whether it affects their personal interests, their private property or their public functions. The most recent example was the act passed on 30 December that implemented Boris Johnson’s post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union. Parliamentarians were told that the Queen had consented to the bill, although – as is customary – there was no explanation given in parliament about how she may have been affected. Another recent example is the agriculture bill.
The Queen and her family spend large amounts of the year enjoying, and running, the 20,000-acre Sandringham estate, where they traditionally spend Christmas. The estate, which includes prime farmland, has been owned by her family since it was bought by Queen Victoria in 1862. As well as producing crops such as wheat, barley, beans, and oats, her farm grows blackcurrants that are sold to make Ribena. It also sells lamb to a major retailer. Eight tenant farmers rent 9,000 acres from the estate. All of this means that the Queen has a special personal interest in the government’s agricultural policies. During her reign, she and her son – also a major landowner – have vetted at least eight parliamentary bills relating to agricultural issues. The latest occasion was last year when Johnson’s administration started to take the agriculture bill through parliament. His government hailed the bill as heralding the biggest shake-up of farming policy in England for 50 years. On 6 January, 10 days before MPs began debating the bill, Collins, an aide to the then environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, wrote to the palace explaining the “intent of the areas where we consider it requires the consent of Her Majesty”. She outlined specific measures that “will apply to the crown” or “affect the crown’s interests”. These concerned clauses changing the regulation of farming tenancies, promoting fair contractual relationships between producers and the business purchasers of their products, and empowering the government to collect data from farming operations. Senior Defra officials sent two further letters to the palace, on 27 October and 3 November, as the bill completed its final stages through parliament. These letters centred on the Queen’s notional powers under the royal prerogative to sign treaties relating to international animal and environmental standards. Peers were told on 9 November that the Queen had consented to the bill. Whether she lobbied behind the scenes for changes in the bill, as documents suggest she appears to have done on other occasions, is not known. She declined to respond when asked by the Guardian if she had made representations to the government. The answer may not be revealed until the files are released to the National Archives in two decades’ time."
2021-02-07T14:00:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Black and blue: the secret lives of BAME police officers,"Thirty years ago, in a nondescript hall in Bristol, an extraordinary event took place. Those who were there remember it with a mixture of pride and pain. In what is now the University of the West of England, black and Asian officers from all over the Metropolitan police area were talking about the racism they had encountered as they tried to build their careers and serve the public. One told of having abuse daubed on his locker in a secure area of the station, another of finding faeces in his helmet. Some described their shame and embarrassment at sitting silently as white colleagues used racial epithets about suspects or while shooting the breeze in the canteen. “Remarks like ‘Throw him a coconut’ and ‘Hey, my slave, good to see you, man’ were some of the least unpleasant,” noted an internal report produced by Scotland Yard. Black and Asian officers spoke of colleagues who resorted to racially offensive mimicry over the radio or who took just that little bit longer to respond to their appeals for help when they were in trouble. They told of “old sweats” or “John Wayne types” who were openly racist towards the public. “Words such as ‘spooks’, ‘nigger’ and ‘coon’ are in such general use throughout the service that one officer counted 230 instances in one week,” the summary said. Most accepted that the “proportion of outright racists in the Met was small”, but there was, they felt, “a lack of understanding” that blighted their careers. Each had previously thought theirs was a uniquely harrowing experience. Over those two days, they learned that they were sailing in the same black and blue boat in the same cruel sea. “Oh, God, I was mortified. It made me sick to my stomach,” recalls Shabnam Chaudhri, who joined the Met in 1989 and retired in 2019 after 30 years. “It was cathartic; liberating for people to be able to speak openly. Everybody had hope. Everybody believed that this was going to be the big change that was needed within policing.” Sultan Taylor, a genial man who rose to become an east London borough commander before retiring in 2016, has similar memories. “It was a shock at how widespread this issue of racism internally was.” Leroy Logan, whose early career and struggles as a black officer were recently portrayed in the BBC series Small Axe, recalls that even the journey to Bristol by coach – called the “wog wagon” by detractors – was emotional. “People were saying: ‘Is that how it is for you as well? Oh my gosh, it’s terrible, man.’ I thought: ‘Wow, the people are suffering.’ And in the meetings themselves, some people broke down, they cried. They were sobbing. It was really strong stuff.”
Strong enough to overcome the doubts of the many black and Asian officers who did not want to attend the event for fear it would further distance them from their white colleagues. They had been given no choice: the Met had made their attendance mandatory. But, once there, they showed what the summary described as “obvious delight” at knowing that the problems were out in the open. Jenny Donaldson, who joined the Met in 1983 and rose to inspector before retiring in 2015, was one of them. “I was quite against it,” she recalls. “I said: ‘There’s obviously a blacklist, and I’m on the blacklist.’ But it was like therapy. It was really cathartic.” The report that came out of the Bristol Seminars, as the event was known, was a true account. Taylor, having volunteered when it seemed management would write the summary themselves without input from those who had spoken, was one of the authors. It starkly juxtaposed the contrary view of a control group of white officers who refused to even see there was a problem and defended the toxic behaviour as “police culture”. But there is another reason that the seminars are remembered today – the crushing feeling of disappointment that followed. The initiative had been driven by one very senior officer, Wyn Jones, whose advocacy of it provoked strong internal opposition. When he left the Met, for unrelated reasons, the impetus went with him. Elements of the report, Looking Into the Recruiting and Retention of Officers, Particularly Black and Asian Officers, are said to have informed internal thinking, but the report was never published. No serious attempt to address the problems followed. Logan says it was painful to see hopes evaporate. “When he crashed and burned, the report crashed and burned.”
It is a failure of historic significance. Thirty years on from that historic event – more than half a century after Norwell Roberts, now celebrated as the UK’s first postwar black police officer, donned his uniform – black and Asian officers are still struggling to find their place in the police service. Few now say they hear racial slurs in their stations or find racist graffiti on their lockers or faeces in their helmets. In policing, as in wider society, the line has been drawn against such overt discrimination. But that hasn’t driven it out – witness the recent case in Hampshire where officers in one unit were found to have a “toxic, abhorrent culture”. They used offensive terms for women, black people, immigrants and disabled, gay and transgender people and referred to their black colleague using racist tropes and references to slavery. But such behaviour, once uncovered, results in disgrace and dismissals. However, having spoken to numerous black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) officers over a period of months – in an attempt to understand the landscape around them in the era of Black Lives Matter – it is clear that, 30 years later, the police service has failed to construct a level playing field. The Home Office says there were 9,174 BAME police officers on 31 March 2020 – an increase of 842 on the previous year and 7.3% of all officers. But that still represents only just more than half of the proportion of those it classifies as “other ethnic groups” in the population. The proportion of senior BAME officers has risen from a paltry 2.8% in 2007 to just 4%. These facts are known. Last year, the home secretary wrote to all chief constables and police and crime commissioners, urging them to do better. The national government has hopes to increase diversity in the police service as part of a plan to recruit another 20,000 officers. This is not a matter of altruism, for it is broadly accepted that policing diverse communities with non-diverse forces is divisive and ineffective. In London, where 44% of the population is believed to be black or from an ethnic minority, the problem is particularly acute. Sadiq Khan, widely expected to be re-elected as London mayor in May, has called on the Met – which has the most BAME officers of any force: 5,000 out of 32,600 – to raise its target for BAME officers from 19% to 40%. On past performance, that is a huge ask. It is virtually impossible to build diverse, effective forces if too few BAME officers sign up and too many – finding that hardships and unfairness still bedevil their careers – choose to leave. And problems occur on multiple levels, because even when they try to fit in, when they find a way to deal with the pushback they sometimes encounter in their communities for having joined the police, they face the prospect of having their lives destroyed by a discriminatory disciplinary system. In 2019, the National Police Chiefs Council found that Britain’s minority officers are more often referred for disciplinary examination – and more often exonerated. They are arbitrarily and unnecessarily pulled through an institutional mangle.
And the why, as set out by the police chiefs themselves, is revealing: “It begins with the BAME officer being referred to professional standards department (PSD) by their supervisor for low-level conduct allegations, with that supervisor failing to deal with the conduct allegation proportionately and at the earliest opportunity. This is either out of fear of being called racist or not having the knowledge to deal with the matters raised appropriately. As a result, BAME officers were often only made aware that their performance or conduct was in question when their supervisor informed them they had been reported to PSD.” So this is no longer the problem of Bristol, of graffiti on lockers and monkey noises on the radio. Instead, officers describe an “othering” that is quieter and more insidious. The tragedy here is not just the dashing of individual hopes and the degradation of policing capacity that affects us all, but also that the very act of treating black and white officers differently is senseless. One significant advance from the Bristol Seminars was the officer-to-officer connection that led to the formation by visible minority officers of the Black Police Association. But after speaking to a number of BAME officers for a radio documentary, it became clear to my producer, George Luke, and I that they are not in any way a cadre apart. They are just police officers. The same view of society and themselves that draws white officers to the job attracts them, too. And we realised one surprising thing. Regardless of their backstories – those who attended the seminars, those who have joined more recently, those who have had turbulent careers, those who haven’t – not one said they regretted their decision to become a police officer. All felt they had in some way contributed towards making the police service fit for purpose. All said, with realistic caveats, that they would recommend a policing career to a friend or relative. All had experienced the lows we knew, but also highs they wanted to speak of. Logan, whose celebrated, turbulent career saw him fight Scotland Yard in court – and win – told us: “I love the police. If my grandchildren decide they want to join, I’d encourage them. But I want to make sure that the Met police is a bit better positioned than it is now.” Andy George, the president of the National Black Police Association, negotiates daily the racial and religious issues that arise with being a Protestant officer of colour in the Police Service of Northern Ireland. There are tough days, but ask about the highs and he will talk proudly about his part in saving multiple lives – and sustaining injury – after a driver who had mowed down a girl was attacked by a crowd.
Taylor, who took his borough from being one of the worst performing to one of the best, said: “If you’re a frontline officer, dealing with burglary and preventing burglary, arresting burglars, you do get a buzz. If you’re an inspector running a team that’s doing well, you get it, too.” Donaldson remembered times on the street, and within the job itself, when she was singled out because of her skin, but also other times when white colleagues went out of their way to support her. There were cases that even now evoke pride: such as the time she spent supporting a mother whose 17-year-old son had been stabbed to death. Chaudhri recalled a forced marriage case. “We managed to secure the safe return of a victim who had been locked up and beaten up by the family members. There were those good times when you genuinely care for a victim of crime or robbery or in a murder case.” Kaelon Parkes, a 27-year-old constable who decided that the best way to capitalise on his talent for dealing with young people was to join the Met, spoke of the times when he wouldn’t swap his job, such as the day in the powder keg of Brixton, south London, when a street stop was spinning violently out of control and his intervention stopped what seemed to be impending disorder. “I still see people that shake my hand and say hello to me. I think you can be human about these things.” We asked numerous black officers: what do you really want? They talked of better training modules, more genuine appreciation of diversity within the forces that employ them, better leadership and more understanding from the public. But reading the yellowing pages of the Bristol report and talking to officers, the main aspiration seems basic and consistent. Pausing for breath at the end of a list of wishes, one said: “We just want to be coppers.” Black and Blue is on BBC Radio 4 on 9 February at 11am and 15 February at 9pm"
2021-02-06T21:45:53Z,uk-news,UK news,"Snow, ice and gale-force winds to batter Britain as Beast from the East II roars in","Snowy blizzards, heavy rain and gale-force winds are expected to batter large parts of the country on Sunday, setting up for a week of wintry conditions ahead as a weather front dubbed the Beast from the East 2 sweeps in from Scandinavia and Russia. Southern and eastern parts of England will generally see the worst of the weather, but there are yellow warnings for snow and ice across the length of Britain this weekend, which will remain in place until Wednesday. A more serious amber warning is in place for Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Kent. The Met Office said strong easterly winds – in some cases, reaching over 40mph – may lead to “blizzard conditions” and blowing and drifting of lying snow at times. This Beast from the East – a phrase used to describe wintry conditions in the UK caused by easterly winds from the near continent – is a result of cold air from Scandinavia and Russia combined with a weather front named Storm Darcy by the Dutch meteorological office. The best remembered Beast from the East hit Britain at the end of February 2018, bringing with it 10 days of heavy snow. This time round, daytime temperatures will remain in the low single figures in most parts of the country and some places will stay below freezing, with a considerable wind chill and widespread frosts making the air feel even more glacial. Parts of the UK may feel as cold as -5C on Sunday. The Met Office chief meteorologist, Paul Gundersen, said: “The UK is in for a notably cold and snowy period over the next week, with very cold air in place over the whole of the UK.” Significant and widespread snow is going to accumulate in Scotland and parts of eastern England, he warned. In parts of east Norfolk, east Suffolk, Kent and around the Thames estuary Gundersen said “we could see 5cm to 10cm of snow quite widely, with a chance that a few places could see 20cm or more”. Even central London can expect a few centimetres of snow, the Met Office says. Rain is expected to move westwards over the UK on Sunday, although it will increasingly turn to snow. Motoring services group the RAC is bracing itself for a sharp increase in breakdowns and “bumps” because of the “very hazardous” conditions on Britain’s roads, and is advising people to think “extremely carefully” before setting out on journeys. There are warnings some roads may become blocked, with the possibility of vehicles and passengers being stranded.
RAC spokesman Ben Aldous stressed that drivers who do go out need to make sure their vehicle is ready for the unusually cold weather: “This means checking oil, coolant and screenwash levels, as well ensuring the tyres have plenty of tread and are inflated properly,” he said. “Large amounts of snow on vehicles should be cleared before setting off to avoid it falling on to other road users.” The weather in the Midlands, Wales, south-west England, northern Ireland and western Scotland will be largely dry and bright, with sunny spells. However, even in these places, it will feel bitterly cold. By tomorrow, the average daytime temperature will range between only 1C (34F) and 4C across the country. Public Health England warned that such severe cold weather can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections among older people and those with heart and lung problems. It urged people to check on frail and elderly neighbours and relatives. “Make a call, or socially distanced doorstep visit if they live close by, to remind them of some simple but important health tips such as heating their home to at least 18C and to keep up to date with the forecast,” said spokesman Dr Owen Landeg. “It’s also helpful to check they have enough food and drinks and any medicines they need.”"
2021-02-06T18:56:15Z,uk-news,UK news,"Man, 24, stabbed in sixth incident in south London within 24 hours","A sixth stabbing incident within 24 hours has taken place in south London, with four of the attacks happening within 1.5 miles of West Croydon train station. Police said they were informed by the London ambulance service of a stabbing on London Road near the junction with Oakfield Road, Croydon – very close to the station – shortly after 3pm on Saturday. “Officers attended and a crime scene is in place,” the local Metropolitan police service said. “A 24-year-old man has been taken to a south London hospital. We await an update on his condition.” It did not comment on whether the assailant had been apprehended. Tensions between gangs periodically flare up on London Road, the centre of a police “microbeat” with one of the highest levels of violent crime in London.
The incident swiftly follows the launch of a murder investigation after a man was stabbed to death in a spate of violence that also left at least nine injured in incidents at five locations in just over two hours between 6.56pm and 9.12pm on Friday. One of two men stabbed at a property in Wisbeach Road died at the scene despite the emergency services’ efforts to save him. Officers were making door-to-door inquiries on Saturday as forensics experts investigated. A new violence suppression unit was set up for the area in the vicinity of West Croydon station in an attempt to make sure serious crime did not return to pre-lockdown levels after a steep fall after the imposition of restrictions. Police said there was not yet any evidence to suggest the first five stabbing incidents were connected and that they were being treated as isolated incidents. The Met said: “Following an assessment at hospital, the victim’s condition has been confirmed as non life-threatening and non life-changing.” The archdeacon of Croydon, Rosemarie Mallett, said the borough was “a very sad and traumatised place” on Saturday. “We pray for our emergency responders dealing with these harrowing incidents,” she tweeted. “We pray for all community groups working on issues of serious youth violence, especially as lockdown has made such work very difficult.”"
2021-02-06T17:46:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Labour criticises cuts after leaked MoD report says army low on troops,"Labour has called for the government to devise “a proper defence strategy” and criticised “a decade of decline” after a leaked Ministry of Defence report said the army is running low on battle-ready soldiers. The Daily Mail reported the Ministry of Defence’s “Infantry Battalion Soldier Strength Summary – January 2021” showed the prestigious Scots Guards, which has a working requirement of 603 troops, had just 339 soldiers available for operations. Col Richard Kemp, a retired British army officer, blamed the manpower crisis on poor pay, inadequate living conditions, and the outsourcing of recruitment to Capita. “Outsourcing recruiting to Capita was a disastrous decision, potential recruits faced months of unnecessary delays and struggled to meet a real soldier in the process,” he told the Mail.
“This contributed significantly to the current manning crisis. On top of that soldiers signed off in droves due to poor pay and appalling living conditions. While recently the army has taken major steps to resolve undermanning, the damage of the previous decade is so serious they face an uphill struggle.” The shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said the report “raises the alarm on the readiness of our military” and warned that the UK was vulnerable to exploitation – although it is not thought the country faces an invasion threat. “After a decade of decline our forces are over 10,000 below the strength ministers said are needed, with combat personnel indispensable for our defence and our commitment to NATO,” he said. “Britain can’t afford any more reckless cuts to our forces, so ministers must put personnel at the heart of their delayed defence review. Our adversaries will exploit continuing holes in our capability. The UK needs a proper defence strategy without further delay.” The UK military has base sites in Singapore, Brunei, Australia, Nepal and Afghanistan. It also has a military presence in seven Arab monarchies, including major deployments in Saudi Arabia and Oman. Troops are also in seven African countries, as well as a number of countries across Europe – some as part of NATO. Tobias Ellwood, a former defence minister who chairs the Commons defence committee, told the Mail: “Britain’s role on the world stage is at stake and our relationship with the US. Cutting our forces at the very moment president Biden is regrouping the western resolve to counter growing threats will compromise our ability to step forward as a valued and trusted ally.” An army spokeswoman said the force had achieved its target for infantry recruits in 2020 and continued to actively recruit. “We are confident the army has the numbers and talent required to protect the United Kingdom,” she said. “The Integrated Review is not yet complete and any reporting about army force structure is merely speculation.” The Integrated Review was billed by the government as the deepest and most radical re-evaluation of the UK’s place in the world since the cold war ended. Its findings were due last autumn but were delayed due to the pandemic, with Boris Johnson saying recently it was unlikely to be published this month. In November, the government set out a £16.5bn increase in defence spending over four years. In 2019, the Guardian revealed that the British army faced a recruitment crisis, with frontline combat units operating as much as 40% below strength after a steady decline in the number of soldiers in infantry regiments. A spokesperson for Capita said: “As has been widely acknowledged, the army recruitment contract has been completely turned around following a re-set in 2018. Over the past two years, targets have been consistently hit and the proportion of candidates getting through the process greatly increased. “Even through a pandemic, we are hitting targets. We have recruited thousands of excellent candidates for the army, supporting them to meet fitness targets and helping them achieve their dreams of learning skilled trades.”"
2021-02-06T15:29:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Murder investigation launched after spate of stabbings in Croydon,"Police have launched a murder investigation after a man was stabbed to death in Croydon, south London, part of an outbreak of violence that has left at least nine more people injured. Metropolitan police officers responded to five reports of stabbings at five locations across Croydon in just over two hours between 6.56pm and 9.12pm on Friday. One of two men stabbed at a property in Wisbeach Road died at the scene despite the emergency services’ efforts to save him. He has been named locally as Lavz, 22. The other had been taken to hospital prior to police arriving. Officers were making door-to-door inquiries on Saturday as forensics experts investigated. A resident said: “They tried really hard to save him but there was a lot of blood. There was blood everywhere, it looked like he was cut in the leg and they tried to stop the bleeding. “My husband was outside for 45 minutes and said his stepdad showed up. His mum was here crying and she was in pieces. It is terrifying, my son is 19 and I’m worried for him.” The Met said a group of males came to the address and the 22-year-old was stabbed in an ensuing altercation. His family came to the scene on Saturday but were too upset to talk to the media. Of the nine males wounded in all the incidents across the borough, none sustained life-threatening injuries, despite initial reports to the contrary. The Met said two people had been arrested, both relating to a stabbing in Dingwall Road at about 9.12pm. A man in his 40s was taken to hospital for treatment and subsequently arrested on suspicion of affray. Another man, 38, was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. The other incidents occurred on Chapman Road in Thornton Heath; Penwortham Road, Streatham; and Jay Gardens in Chislehurst. Lucy Martindale, founder of Operation Shutdown, a campaign group supporting bereaved families, has been providing support to the family of the deceased victim. She told MyLondon: “It’s devastating. You can imagine how all those families will be feeling today. Their lives will never be the same again. We keep having to say RIP to the victims until the next week when the next stabbing happens. People are getting too desensitised to it all. We can’t let it happen.” The force said there was not yet any evidence to suggest all the stabbings were connected and that they were being treated as isolated incidents. Three of the incidents occurred within 1.5 miles of West Croydon station, one of the most violent police “microbeats” in the capital. A new violence suppression unit was set up for the area in an attempt to make sure serious crime did not return to pre-lockdown levels after a steep fall following the imposition of restrictions. The Met’s gold commander, Ade Adelekan, said extra resources had been deployed in Croydon. “While work continues to investigate the motivation and circumstances of these four incidents, I can say that they are being treated as isolated,” he said. “However, that does not make this series of violent incidents any less shocking and I understand that residents in and around the areas where these incidents occurred will be rightly concerned.” Police were granted additional section 60 powers to stop and search people without suspicion until Saturday morning. Det Supt Nicky Arrowsmith said: “Sadly, tonight we have seen a number of needless and completely abhorrent violent altercations, including one that has tragically resulted in a loss of life.” She urged anyone with information to come forward as soon as possible. “Tackling violent crime in London remains the top priority for everyone in the Metropolitan police service,” she said. “We have dedicated resources working to prevent, deter and tackle violence in all its forms, day and night and are utilising all available tactics and powers.” She said the force would not be able to do so alone and needed to work closely with local communities to tackle violence. She called on anyone with information about crime, including people carrying weapons, to contact the police. The local MP, Labour’s Steve Reed, tweeted: “Absolutely horrific news that will devastate our community – thoughts with all those injured, and with the police and medical staff dealing with the situation.”"
2021-02-06T14:50:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Bidding war opens to decide the future of Edinburghâ€™s Royal High School,"When renowned Scottish architect Thomas Hamilton set about designing a home for Edinburgh’s Royal High School in the early 1800s, he cemented the city’s reputation as an “Athens of the North” with a Greek revival building still considered one of Europe’s finest. But despite being widely lauded and variously floated as a home for the Scottish parliament, a national photography centre and a military history museum, the building has lain empty since the school moved in 1968. Now, a decision by the city’s council to strip hotel developers of the site’s lease could see it back in action once again. The A-listed building (which means it’s of special architectural or historic interest and an outstanding example of a particular period, style or building type) on Calton Hill, has been at the centre of debate since 2009 when developers Duddingston House Properties won a competition designed to find a sustainable use for the site. But plans published in 2015 for a luxury hotel in partnership with London-based Urbanist Hotels provoked a backlash and the site has remained empty while heritage groups and the public fought the proposals. In January, after years of planning disputes and rejected appeals, the city’s council ended its deal with the developers and announced plans to place the lease on the open market. The site will not be made available for sale, but rather open to bids for sustainable long-term uses, a move which has been welcomed by heritage groups and campaigners. “The Royal High School is recognised as the very best Greek revival building in the world,” said Terry Levinthal, director of heritage and conservation charity the Cockburn Association. “Our greatest fear was that after years of [the current leaseholders] achieving nothing, they could be allowed another bite at the cherry. That would have been a very negative thing given the comprehensive dismissal of those proposals.”
One of the frontrunners in the upcoming bidding war is likely to be the Royal High School Preservation Trust, a campaign group established in 2015 to move St Mary’s music school from the west of the city. The group is financially backed by charity the Dunard Fund and has already achieved planning consent and council support for its proposal, but says it welcomes the chance to present a positive vision for the site in an open contest. “It’s not just a new home for a music school, it’s about expanding the cultural heart of Edinburgh,” said William Gray Muir, chair of the trust, of the group’s proposal which includes plans for a new concert hall, open public space to the front of the building, and the renovation of the attached western garden and pavilion for public use. “We hope to bring music to a wider audience but also to cement the future of the building within its setting, and give it a use consistent with its original conception as a cultural beacon for Scotland.” Levinthal said the Cockburn Association supported these “very merited” proposals. “As a principled use for the building, that struck us as being much more suitable than a luxury hotel,” he said.
It is not yet known if the hotel developers, who did not respond to a request for comment, will make a fresh bid for the building. However, council finance leader Rob Munn told the Scotsman that there were “a number of interested parties out there”. A report detailing the next steps in the process would be published in May, he said. For campaigners, the fate of the Royal High School, established as a free educational facility for rich and poor children alike with the ethos that all deserved to learn in an unapologetically lavish environment, represents a fight for the heart of Edinburgh, and indeed Scotland. “Its history gave it a sort of moral importance to the city, and said something about how we as Scots see ourselves: liberal; democratic; enlightened; outward looking,” said Gray Muir, who is optimistic about his group’s chances. “What we do with this building now will say an enormous amount about how we think of ourselves as a nation.”"
2021-02-06T07:00:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Grenfell survivors say inquiry witnesses must not give evidence 'from sofas',"Key witnesses at the Grenfell Tower public inquiry must not be allowed to give evidence “from their sofas”, survivors of the disaster have warned as hearings restart remotely over Zoom next week after a two-month Covid suspension. With witnesses due to appear from Arconic, which made the combustible cladding, and the tower’s owner, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Grenfell United said fully remote hearings meant traumatised members of the community would miss out on the catharsis of seeing figures with responsibility before the fire being held accountable in person. The inquiry last month decided to restart with fully remote hearings, although it has previously admitted video conferencing means witnesses “might relax and not feel the same pressure to be candid” or could be surreptitiously coached via text or email. Grenfell United is calling for a rapid resumption of in-person hearings, pointing out that some other inquiries and courts are operating in person. “We cannot allow RBKC and the tenant management organisation to give their evidence from their sofas, in their slippers into a computer screen,” said Ed Daffarn, a committee member of Grenfell United who escaped the fire. “That will not wash with the bereaved and the survivors. These are the people inside our community who perpetrated against us.” In an assessment in April of the problems with remote hearings, seen by the Guardian, the inquiry admitted: “It is very difficult … to ‘police’ the witnesses and make sure they are not being ‘fed’ information or being given other illegitimate support by third parties.” The assessment added: “Core participants and the wider public might be left with the feeling that … the witness had not been exposed to the intensity of questioning that a conventional examination would have achieved.” Daffarn said: “So many of us have been waiting for so long for these people to be held to account in public. In my mind I have seen it playing out a thousand times. I have seen the courtroom, I have seen the witnesses I want to see struggling under the pressure they will be put under with the answers they cannot give … We need to get these people into the sunlight so we can feel cleaned by it as well.” The inquiry will ask witnesses to swear that they are alone in the room before they give evidence, but a spokesperson admitted there was an element of trust that witnesses would not use other devices. “Remote hearings are a temporary measure to be used only for as long as is absolutely necessary,” they said. “As soon as it is safe to do so, limited attendance hearings will resume.” Deborah French, Arconic’s UK sales manager, will start giving evidence from Tuesday. Arconic’s plastic-filled panels were the main cause of the rapid spread of fire that killed 72 people on 14 June 2017. Three former employees of the US company’s French subsidiary are refusing to attend. They include Claude Wehrle, technical manager, who knew in the years before Arconic’s panels were sold for Grenfell they were “dangerous” and showed “bad behaviour exposed to fire”, according to emails already exposed. They have claimed that an arcane French law called the French blocking statute means they cannot give evidence. The French government has said that is not the case. Last week, bereaved people and survivors submitted a petition with more than 18,000 signatures to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, urging him to apply diplomatic pressure. The inquiry confirmed it would “empty-chair the witnesses” if they did not attend, reading out questions they would have faced and disclosing documents about their role. “They are using the silliest excuses,” said Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle died in the fire. “My lawyer said it was as if they were saying: ‘I can’t come to work because a unicorn hit my car.’ Its non-existent – it’s not even an excuse.” Arconic said: “The individuals who have declined to participate in the inquiry have taken the advice of separate counsel and AAP SAS does not have any influence on those decisions.”"
2021-02-05T18:25:36Z,uk-news,UK news,'Good on her': how Jackie Weaver became an internet star,"It was the distraction the nation didn’t know it needed: a poor-quality recording of an online meeting of a Cheshire parish council, called by two councillors “following the refusal of the council chairman to call such a meeting”. Normally such a congress would struggle to raise a quorum, let alone an audience of millions. Yet against all odds, December’s Extraordinary Meeting of Handforth parish council’s planning and environment committee went viral on Thursday night. It made a star of its doughty clerk, Jackie Weaver, who dealt with argumentative male councillors by kicking them off the Zoom call and barely blinking when being yelled at to “read the standing orders! Read them and understand them!” She kept her cool when one man dismissed her by saying “you don’t know what you’re talking about” and ignored the gales of laughter from the remaining men when a female councillor asked them to show Weaver some respect (she soon got her revenge with another remorseless click of her eviction button). By Friday morning, Vice had produced a 3,300-word analysis of the fateful meeting, T-shirts were available saying “You have no authority here Jackie Weaver” – the words of the council chairman, Barry Tolver, before she booted him off – and Weaver was holding court on BBC’s Woman’s Hour. Weaver – employed not by Handforth parish council but the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, apparently parachuted in to run the meeting amid accusations of poor behaviour by councillors – told the BBC she felt proud to have stayed calm in the face of what she described as bullying. “It’s harsh to take some pleasure from that, but I’m afraid when you are being bullied, if you can see that the other person has lost it, then there is the sense of: ‘I did OK there because I managed to hold it together,’” she said. “There is an element of bullying and bad behaviour in local councils and a lot of us are working very hard, and that includes central government, to try and do something about that.” She said at least 99.99% of parish council meetings were not that dramatic. “They are often less exciting than we might hope,” she said. But Tolver was unrepentant, saying he had a “reason to be angry”. He told the PA news agency that Weaver “had no status to speak other than when invited”, adding: “I cannot think of any other council meeting anywhere, that was taken over by an unqualified member of the public like this … Removing half the councillors from the meeting denied half of the voters of the village from being represented – it was an appalling attack on their democratic rights.” Quite how this niche meeting ended up being dissected across all mainstream TV channels and radio stations is largely down to the determination of a few Handforth residents who were appalled at the conduct on show. For the past two weeks, Anika York had been trying and failing to get media interest in the affair, wanting a wider audience for what she calls a “communication breakdown” between Handforth parish council members, which she thinks have been getting in the way of helping the community. “When personality clashes and belligerence get in the way of the council doing positive things for a community, their approach has to be questioned,” she said. Perhaps because the original recording was one hour and 20 minutes long, it was only when comedian Steven Morgan edited it down to 18 minutes and put a terrible bit of Clip Art on the front that it began to go viral. Morgan’s montage caught the attention of Shaan Ali, a young Labour member who says he likes to look for videos of council meetings in idle moment: “All of these videos are usually absolutely hilarious – old councillors struggling to use Zoom and amazing arguments.” He shared it with a group chat of other political activists, and one, Janine Mason, cut it to 30 seconds: perfect for a 2021 attention span. Add to that a boring Thursday night with all the pubs shut, and a viral sensation was born. The TV presenter and novelist Richard Osman tweeted: “Am busily writing Jackie Weaver into the next Thursday Murder Club novel,” while the Radio 1 Breakfast presenter Greg James described it as “The best British comedy in decades.” It was left to women in public life to point out the obvious: “Beyond the humour, the behaviour Jackie Weaver experienced is common place in all levels of politics,” said the Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan. “Good on her for sticking to it, but people doing their best in local politics, especially women, shouldn’t have to put up with that.”"
2021-02-05T18:02:26Z,uk-news,UK news,ONS: UK Covid infection rates remain high but show signs of decline,"Coronavirus infection rates remain high but are showing clear signs of declining in most areas of the UK, new data suggests. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests that about one in 65 people in England are estimated to have had the disease in the week ending 30 January, compared with one in 70 in Wales, one in 65 in Northern Ireland and one in 115 in Scotland. The week before the figures were one in 55, one in 70, one in 50 and one in 110 respectively. “Our modelling suggests that the percentage of people testing positive in England decreased in the week ending 30 January 2021 but remains high,” the team report, adding that declines were seen both in the percentage of cases which are thought to be down to the new variant of the coronavirus, B117, and those which are not.
Once again, the situation is not uniform across England, with the latest data suggesting that while the percentage of people testing positive for Covid overall has fallen in London, the south-east, north-west, north-east and the south-west, it has risen in the east of England and levelled off elsewhere. However, the team caution that there is a higher degree of uncertainty when it comes to regional data than national. The data comes as the latest R figure for the UK – reflecting the average number of people an infected person passes the virus to – was revealed to be between 0.7 and 1 for the UK and between 0.7 and 0.9 for England. If R is above 1 the epidemic is growing; below 1 it is shrinking. The ONS data suggests lockdown is having an effect, with the percentage of people testing positive for Covid falling in three of the four nations. But the drop is not as dramatic as might be expected from the fall in cases reported from the pillar I and II testing programme, or the positivity rate calculated by Public Health England from pillar II (community) tests. Among the factors that might contribute to the disparity is that the datasets refer to different metrics. The daily case data is largely based on positive tests among people with symptoms who have recently come forward for a test, while the ONS survey is based on testing of randomly selected households. The latter picks up both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections but these could have begun up to a few weeks before the test was conducted. Experts have previously suggested others factors might include changes in testing behaviour, or the growing use of lateral flow tests – which are less accurate – in pillar II testing. Steven Riley, a professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College London and a member of the government’s Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) said the new ONS data chimed with the latest React-1 results – another population surveillance study in England. “It’s good news that the overall trend is down, but it’s not clearly down in some of the regions,” he said, adding that there remained important differences between cases and infections. “We think infections are the most reliable indicator of future hospitalisations and deaths.”"
2021-02-05T17:16:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Another asylum seeker relocated from Napier barracks after court order,"An asylum seeker and victim of torture held in a controversial army barracks has been urgently rehoused following a high court ruling, lawyers have said. In the second such move this week, a high court judge ordered the relocation of the man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, from Napier barracks near Folkestone, Kent, into hotel accommodation. The privately run barracks has been used to accommodate about 400 asylum seekers since September and last month experienced a significant Covid-19 outbreak, affecting at least a quarter of the men inside. The legal team representing the rehoused claimant argued in written submissions to the court that he had been forced to sleep in the “overcrowded, unsanitary, and unsuitable” former army barracks and had been subjected to “prison-like conditions”. On Wednesday, the court ordered the relocation of the man within 24 hours, which has now been completed. The Home Office, which contracts the private firm Clearsprings to run the site, has been approached for comment. Clare Jennings of Matthew Gold solicitors, who represents the claimant, said: “No one should be subjected to the conditions at Napier barracks, and certainly not those seeking sanctuary in the UK having suffered unimaginable horrors. “A Covid outbreak at the barracks was all but inevitable. But the abject failure to take any meaningful steps to protect these men from catching Covid-19 is truly shocking. “Instead of protecting residents, the gates were locked and they were left trapped inside, with no option but to share bedrooms and facilities. “We welcome the court’s decision that our client should be moved immediately, but call on the secretary of state, Priti Patel, to do the right thing and close down these barracks.” The legal team said that after the Covid-19 outbreak, instead of immediately putting in place measures to protect residents, the asylum seekers had been locked in the barracks and the virus had been “allowed to run rampant”. An oral hearing will be held this month, where the court will rule whether the claims should proceed to a full judicial review. The court will be asked to consider whether the conditions in the barracks breach the claimant’s human rights and whether they meet his essential living needs as required by section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. The court will also be asked to determine whether the man has suffered inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to article 3 of the European convention on human rights, whether he has been lawfully deprived of his liberty and whether he has been falsely imprisoned. The barracks is not a detention centre but “initial accommodation”, purportedly intended to hold men for a short time as they await a decision on their claims for asylum before they are moved on. The men were previously free to come and go from the site to access services in the community, but the gates have now been locked since mid-January. The Home Office started housing asylum seekers at Napier barracks and a sister site at Penally barracks, in Pembrokeshire, in September. Ministers and officials have faced repeated warnings from humanitarian organisations and healthcare professionals over significant risks posed by Covid-19 at the sites, which have also been dogged by allegations of overcrowding and poor conditions."
2021-02-05T15:45:59Z,uk-news,UK news,Birmingham Indian restaurant to offer in-car lockdown meals,"With restaurants facing a Valentine’s Day of empty tables under lockdown restrictions, one eatery in Birmingham is launching an in-car fine dining experience for customers to enjoy three courses from their vehicle. Varanasi, a high-end Indian restaurant in the city centre, will serve a starter, main course, rice, naan and dessert on trays delivered direct to customers’ cars, in a venture thought to be the first of its kind in the country. “We thought people were getting tired of just getting a boring old takeaway now, so we thought let’s think of something a little bit out of the box, within Covid rules and regulations, to give customers a pleasant experience,” said Abdul Wahab, the general manager at the restaurant on Broad Street. The offering, first reported in Birmingham Live, is styled on business class aeroplane meals and will come complete with floral garnishing and a lemon fresh wipe.
“In business class, they like to serve you nice food, it’s nicely presented, so we thought, why not replicate the same idea?” said Wahab. “A lot of the time restaurants cook food and just slap it in the takeaway box and send it out. We are going to actually garnish everything and present it nicely so that when you get it, you’d want to eat it straight away.” The food would be presented as it would be in the restaurant, except everything – from the tray to the cutlery – is disposable, to keep contact with staff to a minimum, Wahab said, although he was unsure whether the items were recyclable. Customers have to phone in advance to order and pay for their meal to be brought out to their vehicle in a car park behind the restaurant, all of which Wahab insists is within the current coronavirus rules. “The lockdown rules say you can serve takeaway food and take food to customer’s cars, and that’s exactly what we’re doing,” he said. The restaurant does not own the car park, but says it has secured permission from the car park owner to use it for this purpose. Since the start of the third national lockdown on 6 January, restaurants have been required to close with the exception of takeaways (which can remain open until 11pm), click-and-collect and drive-through services. A Birmingham city council spokesperson said hospitality businesses were not allowed to provide food for consumption on their premises. Varanasi, which has been closed since the start of November, will be running its “business class dining” service on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from next week, just in time for what it hopes will be a Valentine’s Day rush. Wahab said: “Everybody will probably want to go out and get a takeaway on Valentine’s Day, so we thought why not take up the opportunity to grasp a bit of business while people are hungry to eat out?”"
2021-02-05T13:51:21Z,uk-news,UK news,"Digested week: falling ice, and other perils of New York's high life | Emma Brockes","Monday In his novel Upstate, the critic and novelist James Wood characterises the experience of walking through New York City as a feeling, mild but insistent, “that something is going to fall on my head”. In the summer, traditionally, the threat is from air conditioning units. (The Village Voice, Gawker, and the New York Times have all looked into this urban legend over the years, without coming up with much data – anecdotally, plunging air conditioners seem to account for about four deaths every 10 years.) In the winter, particularly in a week of heavy snowfall like this one, the danger is falling ice. If you’re lucky, a street will be blocked off by the fire department prior to a sheet of ice shuddering from an apartment roof and falling 30 storeys down, to eliminate whatever is on the sidewalk below it. If you’re unlucky, a small hazard sign will go up advising you to “watch out for falling ice” – precisely how is never specified; perhaps by walking with your neck craned upwards, braced to duck – leaving you to scurry as quickly as you can to the end of the block. The storm this week was one of New York’s biggest, depositing 43cm (17in) of snow. On Monday, everything shut and out we bundled, dragging our sleds two streets from our apartment to the most southerly edge of what is known, after snowfall, as suicide hill. Over and over my children launched themselves down what looked like a 90-degree slope, miraculously avoiding the passage of snowploughs at the bottom, teenagers hurtling down alongside them, and the occasional massive, falling dad. The sun came out today. It was one of those piercingly blue winter days in New York, joyous on the one hand, and on the other, the kind of weather that, as all New Yorkers know, starts to melt and loosen the ice 800 feet up. Time to look lively and get ready to run. Tuesday An instructor at the fitness group SoulCycle, who describes herself as an “educator”, managed to get an appointment to have the first shot of the Moderna vaccine, a fact that came to light when the super-fit 52-year-old posted a photo of herself receiving it on Instagram, along with the caption: “Now I can teach @soulcycle with a little more faith that we’re all gonna be okay.” Teachers in New York are indeed receiving the vaccine right now, but that job description doesn’t extend to a woman on a stationary bike shouting into a head mic at the few junior investment bankers who haven’t abandoned SoulCycle for – quite incredibly – the even more obnoxious spin franchise Peloton. Anyway, contrary to her caption, things very much weren’t OK for Stacey Griffith, who in spite of slamming up the hill and giving it all she had, after posting about the vaccine was promptly buried under a landslide of hatred, culminating in a drive-by shaming from Bill de Blasio, New York’s mayor. (“It doesn’t sound like someone who should have gotten vaccinated to me.”) In the last 10 days, Griffith’s position has, in the language of her trade, evolved into a soul journey that is next-level inspiring, with the slow dawning of just how much trouble she’s in. “In my profession of health and wellness as a teacher,” Griffith told the Daily Beast defiantly last week, “it’s my priority daily to keep my community and their respiratory systems operating at full capacity so they can beat this virus if they are infected by it. I can only teach to them if I am healthy myself.” By the beginning of this week, however, after a Damascene moment she can surely build out from to inspire generations of finance people on bikes, she wrote on Insta: “I want to apologize from the bottom of my heart for my recent action in receiving the vaccine. I made a terrible error in judgment and for that I am truly sorry.” Wednesday The Golden Globes announced their nominations today and the big story was the total shut out from all categories of one of the best shows of the year, Michaela Coel’s I May Destroy You. More amazing, perhaps, is that anyone pays any attention to the Globes in the first place, given the people who vote for them. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) is a group of entertainment journalists who flatter themselves they are friends with their subjects and that standing in the press pen constitutes “attending the Oscars”.
Why the HFPA overlooked the creator and predominantly black cast of I May Destroy You is unclear, although if Coel failed to mount an aggressive charm offensive, that will have damaged her chances. (The association also failed to acknowledge Bridgerton, a really bad show, but that didn’t stop Emily in Paris from prospering, and it makes one wonder if Bridgerton’s executive producer Shonda Rhimes was as reluctant as Coel to appease these terrible people.) A small insight into the town council drama of the HFPA: last year a lawsuit was brought by a Norwegian journalist, who sued the association for refusing her membership, saying she was blocked by other Norwegian and Danish members who wanted to keep celebrity coverage for their markets in Norway and Denmark entirely to themselves. Throw in a couple of murders, a brooding Scandi detective and lots of snowy locations and assuredly that’s a show I would watch. Thursday To Angelina Jolie in British Vogue, an interview of such startling sycophancy it would make the HFPA blush. The piece bears the byline of Vogue’s editor, Edward Enninful, who informs us, breathlessly, that over the course of a “remarkable day … and night … and day”, Jolie agreed “to let us into her world”. It is a world of style, beauty, lots of children, and the blandness of a family of dolls. How, wonders Enninful, has her tireless work for humanitarian causes changed her? (“I’m still just as angry about injustice, but whereas my younger self wanted to tear down the system, I’ve learnt I have to fight to try to change it from within.”) Asked to describe a typical day for her family, Jolie says: “I feel like I’m lacking in all the skills to be a traditional stay-at-home mom.” And yet, she says, “it may sound cliched, but you love and you try, and even if you burn the eggs, that doesn’t matter in the end.” I don’t blame Jolie for any of this – she replies in the register of the questions she’s asked – although on the matter of eggs, one assumes they are 100% handled by the housekeeper. Friday If you have $18m (£13m) to spare, you can move into a high floor at 432 Park Avenue, a 430-metre residential tower and one of the tallest apartment blocks in New York. The development always makes me feel sick – the idea of living that high in the sky – and according to the New York Times, some of the residents are starting to feel the same way. During high winds, apartments on the upper floors, all the way up to a 96th floor penthouse, “creak like the galley of a ship”. Wind sway can cause the elevator cables to “slap around”, and force shutdowns on blowy days. And it’s not just the acoustics. The private restaurant, which when the building opened in 2015 required each resident to spend $1,200 a year on service, has raised that figure to an annual $15,000. How lucky we are not to have these kinds of problems. Meanwhile, I can see the block from my window and make a mental note as I type: not to walk by it until the ice has melted and we are firmly in spring.

2021-02-05T11:28:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Insults and expletives turn parish council Zoom meeting into internet sensation,"A parish council meeting which descended into chaos – with councillors trading insults and ultimately getting booted off the Zoom call – has become an internet sensation and a metaphor for the UK’s woes under lockdown. A video of the Handforth council meeting in Cheshire showed it starting badly when one unseen councillor apparently muttered swear words under his breath as the clerk tried to bring the session to order. Things did not improve. The meeting quickly degenerated into rancour with councillors in the village near Wilmslow trading insults and ultimately being booted off the Zoom call by the clerk.
Footage of the extraordinary exchanges has been shared thousands of times on Twitter. The name of the heroically stoic clerk, Jackie Weaver, who was apparently parachuted in to run the meeting amid accusations of poor behaviour by councillors, became a Twitter trend on Thursday evening and spawned several memes. During the meeting, which took place on 10 December, the chair, Brian Tolver, was removed after refusing to recognise the legitimacy of the meeting. In the recording, he told Weaver, from the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, to stop talking, adding: “You have no authority here.” In response, Weaver removed Tolver from the Zoom call and placed him in a virtual waiting room.
After Tolver’s eviction, the vice-chair, Aled Brewerton, joined by another man, proceeded to shout at Weaver to “read the standing orders”. When their fellow councillor Susan Moore called for civility, the meeting erupted into semi-hysterical laughter and two further councillors, Brewerton and Barry Burkill, were removed.
The absurd scenes continued with confusion over Tolver’s Zoom username, in which he had labelled himself the “Handforth PC clerk”. Weaver said: “The chairman simply declared himself ‘clerk’ and notified everybody of the case. There is no way of stopping him from calling himself clerk. Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on.” Those remaining voted to not allow the three men back into the meeting, with one councillor, Cynthia Samson, likening one to a “laughing hyena”. The clips of the meeting were a hit with Twitter users, with more than 5,000 retweets and 32,000 likes. The TV presenter Richard Osman tweeted: “Am busily writing Jackie Weaver into the next Thursday Murder Club novel.” Interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, Weaver seemed to be enjoying her newfound fame, after her name was emblazoned on T-shirts saying “YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE JACKIE WEAVER”. She said she had been amused by some of the coverage of the meeting. “Clearly there’s amusement in the way somebody has just lost it,” she said. “It’s harsh to take some pleasure from that, but I’m afraid when you are being bullied, if you can see that the other person has lost it then there is the sense of ‘I did OK there because I managed to hold it together.’ “There is an element of bullying and bad behaviour in local councils and a lot of us are working very hard, and that includes central government, to try and do something about that.” She said at least 99.99% of parish council meetings were not that exciting. “They are often less exciting than we might hope,” she said. But Tolver was unrepentant, saying he had a “reason to be angry”. He told PA news agency that Weaver “had no status to speak other than when invited”. He added: “I cannot think of any other council meeting anywhere, that was taken over by an unqualified member of the public like this. “Removing half the councillors from the meeting denied half of the voters of the village from being represented – it was an appalling attack on their democratic rights.” Normally sedate and well-mannered bodies, parish councils are the lowest tier of local government in England. They have few powers but can play an important role in providing representation and consultation with district and county councils in matters such as planning, environment and recreation. The extraordinary outbursts followed a series of complaints about the conduct of some councillors in the village and allegations of unlawful decisions which have resulted in expenditure of public funds, according to a notice posted on the council’s website by David Brown, director of governance and compliance at Cheshire district council. “As monitoring officer in Cheshire East I have received a multiplicity of complaints and referrals,” it says. “These range from multiple complaints about councillors’ behaviour; to fundamental issues of governance and member/officer engagement. The most recent referrals relate to suggestions that some members of Handforth parish council have purported to take decisions that are plainly unlawful, and these decisions have resulted in expenditure of public funds.” At the end of the meeting, the councillors debated whether a recording of their discussions should be released. One councillor presciently replied: “I think if this goes viral … it’s going to start a war of words.” PA Media contributed to this report."
2021-02-04T23:30:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Kilmarnock: hospital under lockdown after 'serious incident' say Police Scotland,"A lockdown at an Ayrshire hospital has been lifted after police were called to a “serious incident” following reports of a stabbing at the site and another two “potentially linked” incidents in the area. Crosshouse hospital in Kilmarnock was placed under lockdown for about three hours and ambulances were diverted to University Hospital Ayr while officers dealt with the first incident. It is not currently known who has been injured. Police said they were also dealing with a second incident in Portland Street in the centre of Kilmarnock, about two miles from the hospital. Part of the town centre at the railway viaduct has been closed to traffic and the public were asked to avoid both areas. A third incident, a “serious road crash” on the A76, was also being attended by police. The incidents are not being treated as terror-related. Police Scotland said inquiries were at an early stage and that the areas involved have been cordoned off. The force added that there was no cause for concern to the wider community. In a statement on Twitter, the force said: “Police Scotland is currently dealing with 3 potentially linked incidents in the Kilmarnock area. The first occurred around 7.45pm outside Crosshouse Hospital, the second around 20 minutes later on Portland Street, and the third, a serious road crash, on the A76, around 8.30pm.” It was confirmed just before 11pm that the hospital lockdown had been lifted. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted: “My thoughts are with those involved in these very serious incidents in Crosshouse/Kilmarnock. Please help @AyrshirePolice do their job by following the advice to stay away from the areas affected.” The Scottish justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, described the hospital incident as “very serious” and urged people to follow police advice and avoid both areas. Dr Crawford McGuffie, the medical director of NHS Ayrshire and Arran, said said police had confirmed that the risk to patients, staff and visitors to the hospital was minimal. He added: “There remains a large police presence on the grounds of the hospital. “We would like to reassure anyone coming to the hospital, in particular to any patients or staff coming on shift, that Police Scotland have confirmed it is safe to do so. However, if you are worried, please speak to the on-site Police Scotland officers. “As this is a Police Scotland incident, we are unable to comment any further at this time.”"
2021-02-04T20:41:19Z,uk-news,UK news,EU's article 16 blunder has focused minds on Northern Ireland,"The EU’s aborted attempt to trigger article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol could be a blessing in disguise for Northern Ireland. Its decision to pull the emergency cord on an agreement that had introduced regulatory checks on some products travelling between Britain and Northern Ireland without notifiying Dublin or London was quickly reversed. In the blink of eye, many say it undermined the EU’s consistent commitment over the past four and a half years to the fragility of Northern Ireland’s peace process.
But it also concentrated minds and crystallised something that until then had not had the airtime it deserved during Brexit negotiations – the impact the protocol would have on a politically unstable region, one poorly equipped to deal with the shock of systemic new trading arrangements. Immediately after the Northern Ireland protocol was introduced on 1 January, supermarkets struggled with shortages and hauliers howled in protest over the mountains of paperwork needed to get goods across the sea. But this had little traction in Westminster or Brussels, where the only conversation in town was Covid. These were mere teething problems, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, told the Northern Ireland affairs committee two weeks ago. And now was not the time to be seeking an extension to the grace period on food, parcels, medical supplies and logistics. One week later, the tune has changed dramatically. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are looking for a de facto two-year transition period and Northern Ireland is right back at the centre of national politics.
Instead of looking for solutions, Johnson and Gove have seized upon the opportunity of the EU’s embarrassment and gone in guns blazing, demanding a two-year extension to the grace period, or else. They are cheered on by the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, and her party, who are calling for Johnson to be “the unionist we need him to be”. While the EU has made clear the protocol will not be scrapped, the issues raised by the first 35 days of its application are serious. The cross-community upset over disruption to everyday supplies has made people feel, in the words of one consumer, as if they are “being left behind”. They reflect a strong feeling in Belfast that the EU and the UK gave birth to a Brexit baby and virtually walked away without trying to get public buy-in or mitigate the shock of the new. Chief vet Robert Huey told reporters before Christmas he had just one week to show leniency on checks on animals and food, not the six-month grace period afforded to British businesses importing from the EU. Queen’s University professor of sociology, Katy Hawyard, has warned of the “duty of care” the EU and the UK have to the people of Northern Ireland amid Brexit trauma. Senior public figures not directly involved in politics in Belfast say the problems are caused by the “rigorous and inflexible” application of the protocol.
Why did British soil on plants from English nurseries have to be banned? Why were there questions marks over the right of British troops to transport equipment over the Irish border? Why was a BBC camera crew reportedly stopped on returning to Northern Ireland with camera equipment? Where is the creativity and the flexibility Michel Barnier promised?” asked one source. “It’s been a bad week in Northern Ireland,” one official told the Guardian. “It’s not just the issue of graffiti. It’s the controversy over the British army, it’s the problem with food, it’s the things everyone warned – that no matter what kind of Brexit you got, there were consequences in Northern Ireland. “The list of problems go to the issues of identity and the constitutional future of Northern Ireland. These are the issues that were at the core of the Troubles,” said the official. While the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland has called on people to step back from the brink amid a “febrile” atmosphere, a senior source said what was happening was exactly what was predicted by the PSNI given the political instability of the region. “The cumulative impact of all of these uncertainties on a volatile region like Northern Ireland are what is at play, and now the increased debate around the border poll, issues around the long-term instability of Stormont, unresolved issues around legacy, flags, parades, all of which feed into loyalism and create this volatility and hospitable environment for more extreme views,” said one security source. “Depressingly, this is exactly what we have been saying for years. We know terrorism threats don’t exist in a vacuum, they tend to be driven by issues in the economic space,” said the source. The police say there is no evidence of paramilitary involvement in the recent graffiti threats to border guards and the former taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. But concern of local leaders in mid-January was enough for the Northern Ireland Office to schedule a meeting in the second week of January with the Loyalist Community Council, which was launched in 2015 with the backing of the UDA, the UVF and the Red Hand Commando, over their concerns. And none of this seemed to be landing a response in Westminster or the EU, where Covid was sapping all the political energies. Article 16 has swiftly changed all that."
2021-02-04T19:24:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Northern Ireland police chief urges calm amid post-Brexit tensions,"The Police Service of Northern Ireland’s chief constable has urged people to step back from the brink of violence amid rising tensions over disruption to supplies of goods and food from Britain to the region since Brexit. Simon Byrne warned of a “febrile” atmosphere after 26 graffiti incidents were detected across Northern Ireland, and EU and local officials were withdrawn from Brexit check duties at ports in Belfast and Larne following threats. Byrne told a policing board meeting in Belfast: “It is now time for wise words and calm heads. We need to work together to look at a route map to normality because that seems to be the opportunity before us, to step back from the brink in terms of community tension.” Police have said there is no evidence that loyalist paramilitaries are involved in the unrest, instead blaming disgruntled individuals and small groups. The first minister, Arlene Foster, also urged restraint. “I do think it’s incredibly important that people do stay calm and that they focus their energies on constitutional politics and take things forward in that fashion,” she said.
Two days ago Foster launched a campaign to get the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit deal scrapped, but Sinn Féin continues to support it, saying disruptions to food supplies and online shopping are teething problems. “Constitutional politics is the way forward. I know people are very frustrated but they need to channel that frustration through constitutional politics so that we can effect change in that fashion,” Foster said. The Stormont finance minister, Sinn Féin’s Conor Murphy, said: “I think it is very clear that we do need to dial down the rhetoric and we’ve heard some comments which I think are dangerous from people who should know better on radio programmes yesterday.” Boris Johnson has said he is ready to override elements of the Brexit divorce settlement relating to Northern Ireland to prevent a trade barrier from developing in the Irish Sea. In the Commons on Wednesday, the DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr told the prime minister that the protocol had “betrayed” his constituents, making them “feel like foreigners in our country”."
2021-02-04T19:22:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Trident nuclear submarine replacement delayed by another year,"Britain’s £31bn replacement for its ageing Trident nuclear submarines has been delayed by another year owing the pandemic, raising fresh questions about whether the UK can rely on the existing fleet. Official documents released at the end of last year quietly confirmed that the current phase of the Dreadnought programme had been put back to March 2022, although the update was not highlighted and it was only spotted by a pressure group.
An SNP member of the defence select committee has now called for it to hold an inquiry into the Trident replacement programme, complaining about a lack of transparency. An annual update on nuclear replacement, released to MPs before Christmas, said that “recognising the high levels of uncertainty caused by the pandemic” and its impact on supply chains, “delivery phase 2 will continue until March 2022”. It did not say that this amounted to a one-year delay to the sprawling programme. This was spotted by David Cullen, of the Nuclear Information Service, who recalled a promise made a year earlier to conclude the work in March 2021. “Covid is going to be with us for a while, and nobody will be surprised if there are other delays to Dreadnought,” Cullen said, arguing that the relative secrecy suggested “this isn’t the behaviour of a department that is confident it can deliver on its promises”. The Dreadnought programme, first approved by Labour in 2007, has been repeatedly delayed by governments since. The first submarine was initially due to come into service in 2024, then 2028, and now the “early 2030s”, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) says. MoD officials told the Guardian that the delay to phase 2 – which sets the commercial and approval framework for the rest of the project – would not affect the final delivery date of the first replacement submarine. “The extension to the current phase is not expected to impact on in-service dates,” a spokesperson said.
However, Cullen said the MoD’s insistence on using the “early 2030s” formulation meant it was impossible to tell the exact impact of the delay. The four existing Trident submarines were originally built to last 25 years, meaning they would have been out of service between 2017 and 2024. Their life has been guaranteed by a series of extensions, but they will have to last well over 30 years. Two functioning submarines – one at sea and one ready to replace it – are the minimum necessary to maintain the continuous nuclear deterrent. Last year it emerged that two of the four vessels were out of action at the same time, one of which, HMS Vanguard, is still having its nuclear reactor refuelled at a cost of £200m. Britain prefers to shroud its nuclear programme in secrecy, but there have been accidents in the past. In 1998 HMS Vanguard, carrying 96 nuclear warheads and 135 crew, plunged into a deep dive following a power failure between Cornwall and the south of Ireland. The crew only managed to regain control through a backup power system. In February 2009, Vanguard collided with a French nuclear submarine, Le Triomphant, in a freak accident in the Atlantic. Details were initially hushed up, before it was leaked to a newspaper. Fortunately the accident happened at a relatively low speed. Ministers were told that at the time that nuclear safety had not been compromised. Martin Docherty-Hughes, an SNP member of the defence select committee, said: “It is simply unacceptable that we need to parse UK government statements for half phrases and words which the MoD could be using to cover its own backside.” He said he would be writing to the chair of the committee to demand an inquiry. An MoD spokesperson said: “The current phase of the Dreadnought submarine programme has been extended, but we remain on track for the first submarine to enter service in the early 2030s and within the allocated budget.”"
2021-02-04T17:43:22Z,uk-news,UK news,"Harry Dunn: Anne Sacoolas's diplomatic immunity in question, US court is told","Anne Sacoolas, the woman who fled the UK with her family after killing 19-year-old motorcyclist Harry Dunn in August 2019 was working for an intelligence agency at the time, a court in the US has been told. Downing Street on Thursday said she had been notified to the UK as a diplomat’s spouse with no role, and it had not been aware she was an intelligence officer. The revelations about her status came under cross examination at a civil court hearing in Virginia in the US where the Dunn family are seeking damages for their son’s death. Her precise employment status would impact the level of diplomatic immunity she enjoyed at the time she fled. The Virginia court was told by her lawyer John McGavin that her work was “especially a factor” in her leaving the UK. He also told the court she fled the UK for “security issues” and feared she would “not get a fair trial” if she returned to the UK. Asked what the specific reason for her departure was, he said he knew but was not at a liberty to say. Sacoolas, her husband Jonathan and three children left the UK in August 2019, days after Dunn’s death. Previously it had been reported that the husband of Sacoolas was a CIA intelligence officer working at the RAF Croughton base in Northamptonshire. It had been suggested that his wife had an intelligence background but was a dependent and not working at the time at the base. Any acknowledgement in the Virginia court that she was working for the intelligence agencies at the base brings into question the basis for the Foreign Office claim in 2019 that she enjoyed diplomatic immunity, and therefore could not be prosecuted and had to be allowed to leave the UK.
In originally accepting her departure from the UK, the government argued that the family of US staff employed at the RAF Croughton base in Northamptonshire enjoyed full diplomatic immunity. A 1995 treaty covering the base said only “administrative and technical staff” would have their immunity pre-waived, meaning they would not be immune from criminal jurisdiction for actions beyond their duties. The high court ruled last year that Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity because that deal – known as a waiver – did not include the dependants of US staff. So, if Sacoolas was at the Croughton site not simply in her capacity as the wife of a CIA operative, but was herself actively working at the site, her access to diplomatic immunity at the time of her departure arguably falls away. The Dunn family lawyer Radd Seiger called for an urgent investigation. It is also possible to argue that although she was employed by the CIA, she was not being employed by the CIA at Croughton. Sacoolas left the UK without the knowledge of police in August, but with the reluctant endorsement of the British Foreign Office. The Foreign Office said in a statement: “The UK high court has found that Anne Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity while in the country under the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations”. The long-running dispute has been kept going by the persistence of the family of Dunn and their lawyer Seiger. He said he was flabbergasted by the revelations in the court, and claimed there was pandemonium inside the Foreign Office and the US State Department. The strength of the campaign has led the UK government to request formally for her to be extradited to the UK to face charges of causing death by dangerous driving. The Dunn family’s lawyer in the US, Agnieszka Fryszman, told the court the British government had written a letter to the court to “endorse” their claim. The extradition rejection has been confirmed by the new Biden administration team at the State Department. The judge is due to give a ruling on 17 February."
2021-02-04T16:02:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Mother of boy filmed verbally abusing Chris Whitty confiscates his PlayStation,"A teenager who verbally abused Prof Chris Whitty in the street has had his PlayStation confiscated by his mother as punishment, it has been reported. The boy’s behaviour was widely condemned after a video emerged showing him repeatedly accusing England’s chief medical officer of lying about the pandemic. As Whitty was buying lunch at a Mexican food stall in a street in central London, the 15-year-old boy is heard saying to Whitty: “You’re a liar. You lie about the Covid-19 cases … stop lying to the TV, man.” The teenager, who has not been named, filmed himself making the false claims to Whitty and shared the video on TikTok. The video was later posted on Twitter by the Conservative MP Matt Vickers, who described the boy’s behaviour as “appalling”. Now his mother, 47, has joined in the condemnation and told the boy to record another video apologising to Whitty, according to an interview in the Mail Online. It quotes her as saying: “I was horrified when I saw how rude my son was to Mr Whitty. That is not how I have brought him up and not the behaviour that I expect from him.”
And she explained how she’d punished the boy, saying: “I have taken away his PlayStation, which is the thing he loves the most. I have not grounded him because he is already suffering enough from the lockdown and does not go out as much as he used to.” Whitty was more forgiving. When asked about the incident at Wednesday’s Downing Street briefing, he said the “young lad” appeared to be “showing off”. He added: “I didn’t think anything of it frankly, I was very surprised it was picked up by the media at all, as anything of any importance. “I’m sure he’ll become a model citizen in due course and hopefully more like Captain Tom, who was the kind of person who I think much more exemplifies the spirit of the UK.” The boy’s mother suggested her son’s video was a sign of the impact on the mental health of young people during the lockdown. She said: “He was trying to give a message across to Mr Whitty and make him understand what he and other youngsters are going through, but I’m very upset and angry with him over how he did it.” She told Mail Online: “He’s actually quite an intelligent boy.”"
2021-02-04T15:17:53Z,uk-news,UK news,Archaeologists unearth bronze age graves at Stonehenge tunnel site,"Bronze age graves, neolithic pottery and the vestiges of a mysterious C-shaped enclosure that might have been a prehistoric industrial area are among the finds unearthed by archaeologists who have carried out preliminary work on the site of the proposed new road tunnel at Stonehenge. One of the most intriguing discoveries is a unique shale object that could have been part of a staff or club found in a 4,000-year-old grave. Nearby is the resting spot of a baby buried with a small, plain beaker. Ditches that flank the C-shaped enclosure contain burnt flint, suggesting a process such as metal or leatherworking was carried out there thousands of years ago. Just south of the site of the Stonehenge visitor centre, archaeologists came upon neolithic grooved ware pottery possibly left there by the people who built the stone circle or visited it. “We’ve found a lot – evidence about the people who lived in this landscape over millennia, traces of people’s everyday lives and deaths, intimate things,” said Matt Leivers, A303 Stonehenge consultant archaeologist at Wessex Archaeology. “Every detail lets us work out what was happening in that landscape before during and after the building of Stonehenge. Every piece brings that picture into a little more focus.” The plan to drop the A303, which passes close to the stones, into a two-mile tunnel is hugely controversial, with many experts having said that carrying out such intrusive construction work would cause disastrous harm to one of the world’s most precious ancient landscapes and lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of artefacts. A legal challenge was launched against the £1.7bn plan late last year. Highways England and Wessex Archaeology, which is leading the exploration of the tunnel corridor, said they were working on the project systematically and sensitively.
During this preliminary phase, Wessex experts have hand dug and sieved almost 1,800 test pits and excavated and recorded more than 400 trial trenches. The next phase of archaeological excavations will begin later this year, lasting approximately 18 months and involving up to 150 archaeologists. Construction work on the tunnel is due to start in 2023. Near the planned eastern portal of the tunnel, the archaeologists discovered large amounts of debitage – waste material from the manufacture of flint tools – and ditches that may date to the iron age and could be associated with Vespasian’s Camp, a hillfort to the south. Close to the western end, two burials of Beaker people, who arrived in Britain in about 2,500BC, were found. One was an adult, buried in a crouched position with a pot or beaker. Also in the grave was a copper awl or fragment of a pin or needle and a small shale cylindrical object, of a type that is not believed to have been found before. “It is an oddity,” said Leivers. More detailed work will be carried out to find out what it is, but one theory is that it could be the tip of a ceremonial wooden staff or mace. Also found in the same area was a pit dating to the age of the Beaker people containing the tiny ear bones of a child and a very simple pot – a sign that this too was a grave. Usually Beaker pots are ornate but this one is plain, probably to reflect the age of the person who died A little farther south, the C-shaped enclosure was found. “It is a strange pattern of ditches,” said Leivers. “It’s difficult to say what it was, but we know how old it is because we found a near-complete bronze age pot in one of the ditches.”
Also in the ditches was a large quantity of burnt flint. “This suggests there may have had some industrial function,” said Leivers. “It could be metal or leatherworking, pottery manufacture, crop processing.” Another find was a group of objects dating to the late neolithic period – when the stone circle was built – including grooved ware pottery, a flint and red deer antlers.
For the time being the finds are in storage in Salisbury and will ultimately go on display in the city’s museum. The team accepts that all road schemes have an impact on an area’s archaeology. Andy Crockett, A303 project director for Wessex Archaeology, said: “There isn’t one option that would allow zero impact on archaeological remains; that’s true of every development you can think of.” He said the trade-off was that the sight of cars and lorries trundling along the A303 close to the stones would vanish and two halves of the world heritage site now split by the road would be reunited. Highways England said the amount of survey work that had been carried out was unprecedented because of the significance of the site. David Bullock, A303 project manager for Highways England, said: “There has been a huge amount of investigations so that this route can be threaded through so as to disturb as little as possible.”"
2021-02-04T13:22:47Z,uk-news,UK news,Anthony Grainger family to continue legal fight over fatal shooting by police,"The family of an unarmed man who was fatally shot by police have vowed to continue their fight for answers after the official watchdog dropped its investigation into the operation. Anthony Grainger, 36, was shot through the chest as he sat in a car in the village of Culcheth, Cheshire, by an armed police officer known as “Q9” in March 2012. Detectives believed Grainger and two others were planning to hold up a supermarket and had access to firearms on the evening of 3 March 2012. However, no weapons were found in the red Audi and a public inquiry found Greater Manchester police (GMP) entirely to blame for his death due to serious flaws in its operation. Grainger’s family have expressed their “great disappointment” after the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) ended its investigation into the senior officers who led the operation due to a failure to obtain “sensitive” material. Former assistant chief constable Terry Sweeney, former superintendent Mark Granby and a former chief inspector, all now retired from the force, were being investigated for gross misconduct regarding their command and control of the operation. But an IOPC spokesman said its investigation had been discontinued because “some of the material which may be relevant to the decisions to be made at the conclusion of any investigation, and to provide adequate disclosure to the officers, could not be disclosed”. The Grainger family said the investigation had been “doomed from the outset” because the IOPC had not been granted access to the crucial material. The family said that while this material remained secret no one could be fully investigated for the “failings and catastrophic errors” that led to the 36-year-old’s death. They added: “It has been left solely for the family to pursue this and our legal team will be challenging the validity of this undisclosed material in the high court next month. “We are now nine years on and our legal fight continues to get accountability and answers from GMP as to their failings.” Gross misconduct allegations against Steve Heywood, a former assistant chief constable, were dismissed in June. The IOPC said it had also dropped an investigation into a serving officer for failing to inform his superiors that two of the officers involved in the operation had failed a counter-terrorist specialist firearms officer training course. A third investigation looking at the force’s acquisition of a CS dispersal canister, not approved by the Home Office, which was used during the operation is ongoing, the spokesman said."
2021-02-04T12:27:54Z,uk-news,UK news,Piers Corbyn arrested over leaflets comparing vaccine programme to Auschwitz,"Piers Corbyn, the climate change sceptic and brother of the former Labour leader, has been arrested by police investigating leaflets likening Covid-19 vaccination efforts to the concentration camp at Auschwitz. The activist, 73, was arrested in Southwark on Wednesday on suspicion of malicious communications and public nuisance. Another man, 37, was arrested in Bow on suspicion of a public order offence, Scotland Yard said. Both men have been bailed to return on a date in early March. The Metropolitan police said the leaflet contained material that appeared to compare the Covid-19 vaccination programme with the Holocaust. Earlier this week the leaflets were described by a London council as an attempt to play on the fears of some residents, particularly people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds who are among those most at risk from Covid-19. They feature a sketch of the entrance to Auschwitz in which the gates’ infamous slogan “Arbeit macht frei” (Work sets you free) has been changed to read: “Vaccines are safe path to freedom.” Inside, there are baseless claims such as the conspiracy theory that some vaccines contain nanochip technology which will enable recipients to be electronically tracked. They bear the name of Corbyn, a weather forecaster, and that of his website, where the leaflets appear in digital form. The Evening Standard reported earlier this week that Piers Corbyn had confirmed he had been involved with designing the leaflets. He said: “A group of us came up with the idea. The Evening Standard was saying that vaccines will set us all free and it is not true.” Asked by the newspaper if the leaflets broke the law, he added: “Of course not.” Corbyn was found guilty in December of breaching emergency health regulations at an anti-lockdown protest in London’s Hyde Park. Last summer, he became one of the first people to receive a £10,000 fixed penalty under new coronavirus laws restricting public gatherings of more than 30 people."
2021-02-04T11:53:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Cornwall to stage rare performance of 14th-century Ordinalia cycle,"A medieval amphitheatre in the far south-west of Cornwall is to be the venue in the autumn for a rare rendering of one of the British Isles’ oldest works of drama. Hundreds of professional and amateur actors and backstage workers will be involved in putting on the 14th-century Ordinalia cycle – three plays that tell the story of the creation, the passion and the resurrection. If Covid restrictions allow, the cycle will be performed in its entirety in September for what is believed to be only the third time in 300 years. The actor, director and playwright Mark Rylance has given his backing to the project, though he is not expected to take part. “I am delighted to support this visionary project,” he said. “I have always been an avid supporter of community theatre and the benefit it brings, helping people to feel more confident, that they matter, and have a contribution to make, where they can be part of a larger wondrous and joyful thing.”
The plays are thought to have been written by the clerics of Glasney College in Penryn, west Cornwall, in medieval Cornish with Latin stage directions and form the basis of the modern understanding of the language. Originally performed to spread Christian ideas to the local population, the trilogy is made up of Origo Mundi, The Creation of the World; Passio Domini, The Passion; and Resurrexio Domini, The Resurrection. The University of Bristol’s drama department performed the cycle in Perranporth on the north coast of Cornwall in June 1969 and it was next staged in full by the community in St Just in Penwith, near Land’s End, in 2004. The trilogy will be re-enacted in St Just again in the autumn and the hope is that the sets, scripts, scores and costumes produced will allow the community to stage the plays every three years. The venue is the Plen an Gwari – Cornish for “playing place” – in St Just, one of the oldest working open-air theatre spaces in the UK. The artistic director, Jason Squibb, said: “We are incredibly passionate about resurrecting the Ordinalia trilogy in 2021 in the homeland of the medieval plays. Cornwall is renowned for its outdoor theatre spectacles and people come from all over the world to engage with Cornish culture in the fresh air and beauty of the landscape surrounding us. “For these performances, we will be combining the talents of top creative professionals in Cornwall and the magical setting of an ancient Plen, with audiences sat in the midst of angels and devils, surrounded by beautiful choral singing and watching the power of these epic, biblical stories unfold. It is going to be intensely uplifting.” The performances will form part of a two-week festival celebrating Cornish culture, heritage and language, and will include singing, dancing and wrestling."

2021-02-04T10:00:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Scottish ministers consider stringent land ownership tests,"Landowners could be barred from buying country estates or forced to sell off land if they are accused of neglect or abuse of power under proposals being studied by Scottish ministers. The Scottish Land Commission (SLC), an influential advisory body, has recommended that all large or important land sales in Scotland should be subject to a legally enforceable public interest test to make sure the sale has wider social or environmental benefits. In a detailed report to the Scottish government, the commission has told ministers any future sales involving estates over 10,000 hectares (24,710 acres), as well as any of economic or ecological significance, such as entire islands, should be included. If a land sale fails to satisfy the test, it could be allowed to go ahead with conditions attached such as selling off land for housing or a legally enforceable management plan, or in the most serious cases entirely blocked. It could include land and islands being inherited privately or a substantial transfer in shares; solicitors and owners could be legally compelled to notify the government of a private transaction. Hamish Trench, commission chief executive, said: “History has given us a pattern of land ownership in which localised ‘monopoly’ power can and does exist. This creates risks that run counter to the needs of a modern, dynamic economy.” With Holyrood elections due to be held in May, the report will increase pressure from land reform campaigners for tougher action on concentrations of land ownership. Community Land Scotland, an umbrella body for community-owned estates, has been lobbying party leaders to double the funding for community buyouts to £20m a year, and called last year for a public interest test to become law. The SLC has told ministers the concentration of land ownership in Scotland, particularly in the Highlands and uplands, is equivalent to the monopolies seen in business, where small groups of people wield excessive economic power. That could include lairds preventing new houses being built; landowners controlling key assets such as filling stations or boat slipways, or important cultural assets like local hotels and shops; or landowners who employ a majority of local people, stifling different activities. These tests would not be restricted to private owners. In a major study in 2019, the commission found that 70% of Scotland’s rural land, covering more than 4.1m ha was owned by 1,125 people or public bodies. Of those, 87 of the most powerful owners had holdings totalling 1.7m ha, including major agencies and charities such as Forestry and Land Scotland, a government body that inherited the Forestry Commission’s estates, and the National Trust for Scotland, as well as powerful hereditary owners such as the Duke of Buccleuch. In 2019, the Church of England’s investment fund became the largest private owner of Scottish commercial forestry. Wealthy Scandinavians have also emerged as significant forces in the Highlands, with Anders Povlsen, the billionaire owner of the Bestseller clothing group, now Scotland’s largest private landlord. He owns more than 89,000 ha in the north and the Cairngorms. Lisbet and Sigrid Rausing, multimillionaire sisters from the Rausing family, which established the Tetrapak global packaging company, own large estates near Inverness and Fort William, which they are rewilding.
Trench said the case for introducing much more stringent tests in Scotland was because its landownership laws are the weakest and least restrictive in Europe, not because the country is at the vanguard of best practice. A previous SLC study found that Scotland, and by implication the whole of the UK, was an outlier in Europe. Countries such as Finland, Austria, Sweden and Switzerland have limits on the size of country estates; licensing laws; strict residency rules; or prior approval for sales to foreigners. Thomas MacDonell, conservation director of Povlsen’s estates company Wildland, said the tensions over people owning large areas could be resolved if they met other public policy priorities: Povlsen has invested heavily in large-scale ecological restoration and invested in tourism infrastructure. In another change of approach, Buccleuch has voluntarily sold thousands of acres to local communities in Langholm and Newcastleton in southern Scotland. The Scottish government said it would study the proposals in detail, but further action could only happen after the election. Mark Tennant, chair of Scottish Land & Estates, the landowners’ organisation, said local communities already had significant rights to intervene in land sales under legislation introduced in 2016. Ministers would soon be empowered to force owners who block sustainable developments to sell their land. “It is in everyone’s interests that we move on from vague opinions and feelings to crystal-clear evidence of negative impacts that can be verified and acted upon,” he said. “Land businesses have embraced massive change and there are so many positive outcomes from multiple ownership models including public, private and community.”"
2021-02-04T06:00:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Undercover policing inquiry: Keir Starmer urged to give evidence,"A group of environmental campaigners want Keir Starmer to give evidence to the public inquiry into undercover policing amid questions over whether he was involved in a cover-up while he was director of public prosecutions for England and Wales. They are demanding to know if the Labour leader helped to conceal how the actions of undercover officers caused the wrongful prosecutions of themselves and other campaigners. Eighteen activists have issued a statement asking Starmer and others to give evidence to the public inquiry to “get to the truth about non-disclosure, prosecutions and miscarriages of justice that involved undercover police officers”. The inquiry is examining how police had sent at least 139 undercover officers to spy on more than 1,000 political groups since the inception of a secret operation in 1968. The Labour leader did not comment, but party sources said Starmer has not been called to give evidence so far. It is understood that he considers his response to the case involving the activists to be widely documented and a matter of public record. But the demand by the environmental campaigners could challenge Starmer’s political credentials as a radical lawyer. Before he became an MP, Starmer first built his reputation defending progressive activists and trade unionists in the 1980s and 90s, when he worked as a barrister. The lawyer turned politician used this past when he ran to become Labour leader last year. At the launch of his campaign, he promoted a video that described how he had defended striking miners, environmental campaigners and peace protesters in myriad cases. In the video, he said: “I’ve spent my life fighting for justice, standing up for the powerless and against the powerful.” Starmer’s role in the undercover policing scandal dates back to an episode where 20 activists were unjustly convicted of plotting in 2009 to occupy the Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station. Prosecutors were forced to abandon the prosecutions of another six activists in January 2011 after it was revealed that the campaigners had been infiltrated by an undercover officer, Mark Kennedy, who spied on leftwing activists for seven years. The initial convictions were also overturned by judges who ruled that crucial evidence gathered by Kennedy had been unfairly concealed from their original trial.
Starmer then commissioned a retired judge to conduct an inquiry, agreeing, his allies said, its remit with the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The judge, Sir Christopher Rose, primarily blamed a junior, regional prosecutor, while also concluding that other prosecutors and police were responsible for “failures over many months”. Rose’s report was silent on the exact role played by Starmer during the miscarriage, making no reference to whether, for example, the chief prosecutor knew about Kennedy and the withholding of evidence, or took part in decisions about abandoning what was a major prosecution. The power station case is a key part of the undercover policing scandal as it triggered a chain of events that exposed the long-running infiltration of political groups by undercover officers. Starmer headed the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in England and Wales between 2008 and 2013. Political arguments about the role played by undercover police resurfaced during the autumn when Labour split over the handling of the covert human intelligence sources (Chis) bill, regulating the future conduct of secret operatives and whether they are allowed to commit crimes to obtain information. Starmer led Labour’s frontbench into abstaining on the bill during its passage through the Commons, while the party’s left led by Jeremy Corbyn voted against. Insiders say Starmer was at the heart of decision-making on the bill, arguing existing practices needed to be put into law, while calling for further safeguards. The bill is expected to become law this month. The campaigners also list a series of unanswered questions, including whether Starmer helped bury evidence of other miscarriages of justice caused by undercover officers.
In June 2011, Starmer commissioned Rose to examine only the case of the activists who planned to occupy the Ratcliffe power station. But by the time Rose’s report was published in December 2011, there was growing evidence that the concealment of key evidence in trials of campaigners went beyond the case of the Ratcliffe activists, and could have affected a number of other trials. Rose concluded that the Ratcliffe case was a one-off. Starmer accepted Rose’s conclusion and said there was no need therefore to examine other prosecutions to see if other activists had been wrongly convicted. Subsequent investigations by campaigners and the media revealed much more widespread wrongdoing by the state, suggesting that many more activists over a number of years had been wrongly convicted. In 2014, Mark Ellison, a barrister commissioned by the then home secretary, Theresa May, reported that undercover officers who infiltrated political groups routinely concealed their activities in criminal trials. May commissioned the judge-led public inquiry to examine the activities of undercover officers since 1968. Led by retired judge Sir John Mitting, it started taking public evidence in November and is scheduled to last several years."
2021-02-03T16:50:27Z,uk-news,UK news,"MI5 was involved in 1972 conviction of trade unionists, court told","Three government departments including the Security Service, MI5, collaborated to help convict a group of construction workers who had gone on strike to try to improve their pay and safety measures, the appeal court has heard. Lawyers for the 14 trade unionists, including the actor Ricky Tomlinson, told the court that the “higher echelons of the state” were responsible for helping to get them unfairly convicted for offences arising out of a strike 47 years ago. They have been campaigning for years to clear their names, arguing that the establishment persecuted them to undermine the trade union movement. On Wednesday at the start of a two-day hearing, their lawyers alleged that covert state agencies had worked together to secure their convictions for offences including affray, unlawful assembly and conspiracy to intimidate. Tomlinson, then working in the building trade, was one of six men jailed after the 1972 strike. After his two-year jail sentence he left the construction industry having been blacklisted, and became a successful actor. Piers Marquis, the barrister for Tomlinson and another trade unionist, Arthur Murray, said the covert agencies gave a dossier on leftwing trade unionists to the makers of a “highly prejudicial” television programme that was broadcast in 1973 during one of the three trials of the men. He told Lord Justice Fulford that the ITV programme – called Red Under the Bed – unfairly influenced jurors when they decided to convict the men. Marquis described how a secretive unit within the Foreign Office, the Information Research Department (IRD), “played a significant part in the production of the programme”. The IRD was a cold war unit that spread anti-communist propaganda throughout the world. “Part of its remit was to provide anti-communist material to journalists for broadcast and dissemination,” he said. Marquis cited a memo from the head of the IRD who wrote “we had a discreet but considerable hand in the programme”, which was made by Woodrow Wyatt, a rightwing journalist. “Wyatt was given a large dossier of IRD background material with the agreement of the Department of Employment and the Security Service … It is clear from the programme that Mr Wyatt drew extensively on that material,” he said. He cited another official memo which showed that the then prime minister, Edward Heath, had commented after being shown a transcript of the programme: “We want as much as possible of this.” According to prosecutors in the original trials, the trade unionists intimidated other workers during the strike. Marquis said the programme sought to suggest that leftwing activists manipulated trade unions and used violence. He said the programme clearly referred to the defendants and associated them “firstly with communism and subsequently with the overthrow of the state by means of violence”. Marquis said: “At least three branches of government (the IRD, as part of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department of Employment and the Security Service) provided material to Woodrow Wyatt that directly impacted on the subject matter of high-profile and politically important criminal proceedings.” Danny Friedman QC, representing 12 of the pickets, said: “It is clear now that the higher echelons of the state bore responsibility for deliberate covert involvement in the production of the programme.” He said that in 1972 the trade unionists had taken part in the first nationwide strike of building workers to improve the safety of “unacceptably dangerous” construction sites. The case continues."
2021-02-03T15:17:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Police filmed carrying asylum seeker into Kent barracks against his will,"Police officers have been filmed carrying an asylum seeker against his will into a former army barracks site in Kent after he attempted to leave. Hundreds of men have been locked in at Napier barracks, near Folkestone, following a significant coronavirus outbreak, despite reassurances from the government that the site is not a detention centre. The Guardian understands that the man in the video attempted to leave the barracks on Wednesday morning by jumping the perimeter fence and demanded a transfer. The video shows two officers carrying him by his hands and feet back through the gate into the barracks before dropping him to the floor. The man is understood to have jumped the fence twice again, and was arrested after his third attempt. Kent police said he was returned to the barracks for a “Covid breach” but legal experts have questioned their authority to do this. A Kent police spokesperson said: “Kent police patrols were in the area of Napier barracks during the morning of Wednesday 3 February 2021 when they were made aware of a reported Covid breach. Officers attended and engaged with a man to explain and encourage him to follow government regulations and return to the site. “He refused and officers were required to use reasonable force to physically return him safely back inside and no enforcement action was taken. The same male was then later seen again outside of the barracks and when officers engaged with him, he assaulted an officer and was arrested and taken into custody. “Our officers will always engage with the public and ensure that people are aware of the current guidance and the need to stay safe.” The man who filmed the incident, who asked not to be named, said: “He jumped the door and asked for a transfer. When they carried him back in he was shouting. It made me feel afraid. After he was brought back in, he jumped over again and the police took him away in a big car.” The move to lock the camp came after at least 120 men tested positive for Covid-19 in mid-January. Men were initially told to self-isolate in their housing blocks, which hold about 28, but many of those who tested positive continued to roam around the camp and take part in communal meals. The Home Office then transferred some of the men who tested negative to hotels across the south-east of England to make self-isolation easier and told the remaining asylum seekers they would be reorganised into new bubbles. The barracks is not a detention centre but “initial accommodation”, purportedly intended to hold men for a short time as they await a decision on their claims for asylum before they are moved on. The men were previously free to come and go from the site to access services in the community, but the gates have now been locked for two weeks. There is a legal duty to self-isolate for those who receive positive tests and those who are contacted by NHS test and trace. Fines for those breaking the rule start at £1,000 and increase up to £10,000 for repeat offenders. Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister at Doughty Street chambers, said: “This is very troubling footage. These are not detainees. I am dubious that there is a legal basis for the police using force. “There is a power under the self-isolation regulations to use reasonable force to return somebody to the place that they’re supposed to be isolating but, as far as I know, people at the barracks were not given formal notifications to self-isolate and therefore there was no power of enforcement. “In any case, I can’t see how the police can have known who was legally required to self-isolate and who was not. We do not know the full facts but it is possible the police have unlawfully assaulted this man.” There has been an increased police presence at the site since Friday when a fire broke out in one of the housing blocks. Kent police has arrested 14 men in connection with the incident, one of whom was charged with assault. The Home Office started housing asylum seekers at Napier barracks and a sister site at Penally barracks, in Pembrokeshire, in September. Ministers and officials have faced repeated warnings from humanitarian organisations and healthcare professionals over significant risks posed by Covid-19 at the sites, which have also been dogged by allegations of overcrowding and poor conditions."
2021-02-03T14:09:22Z,uk-news,UK news,"Asylum seeker cannot remain at Kent army barracks, court says","An asylum seeker and potential victim of trafficking housed at the controversial Napier army barracks in Kent must be urgently rehoused in alternative accommodation within 24 hours after a high court ruling. Clive Sheldon QC, sitting as a deputy high court judge, on Tuesday ruled that the asylum seeker had made a strong case that the accommodation was inadequate for him and that the “prison-like” conditions and risk of contracting Covid-19 while there made it wholly unsuitable. Emily Soothill, a solicitor at Deighton Pierce Glynn, representing the asylum seeker, said the court’s ruling was important not only for the individual who brought the case but for others at Napier as it opened the door for more people to be transferred out of the barracks.
Lawyers are making urgent court applications for the transfer of at least four more asylum seekers from Napier, where more than 120 asylum seekers have tested positive for coronavirus. The asylum seeker who secured the court order arrived in the UK in August 2020. He has been accommodated in Napier barracks since September 2020 and, although the Home Office agreed to transfer him to alternative accommodation on 19 January 2021, they had still not done so two weeks’ later. The court heard evidence about the unsafe and insanitary conditions at the barracks, with 14 men sharing a room, lack of heating, poor sanitary conditions and the impact of a recent serious fire, which has forced the asylum seeker who brought the legal challenge to sleep on a mattress on the floor of another shared dormitory.
Following the fire last Friday, 13 asylum seekers have been transferred out of Napier barracks to Tinsley House immigration removal centre. It is understood they are accused of taking part in a protest at the barracks, also last Friday, and are on criminal bail. The government told the court that transfers away from the barracks were not possible while it was in lockdown due to the Covid outbreak, but the court agreed with the asylum seeker that exceptions can be made to Covid regulations to avoid further harm to the asylum seekers at the barracks and that the transfer needed to take place within hours. The ruling comes as an urgent complaint is being lodged with the UN special rapporteur on the rights of migrants and others asking them to take urgent action to ensure the UK government complies with international law. Barrister Jan Doerfel said he plans to lodge complaints to the UN on Wednesday. A former military chief, Nicholas Mercer, now a rector and previously the army’s top legal officer, has condemned the use of military barracks to accommodate asylum seekers. “As the home secretary well knows, refugees are entitled to special protection under international law,” said Mercer. “It is wholly inappropriate therefore to house them in disused army barracks which have been described by the Red Cross as “unsafe and unsanitary” and which violate the UN convention on refugees. Refuge is about seeking sanctuary in a place of safety but this treatment is nothing more than naked hostility to very vulnerable people.” Bella Sankey, director of Detention Action: said: “Priti Patel’s experiment with segregated refugee ghettos is a divisive poison to community relations and is re-traumatising survivors of genocide, rape and torture.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Asylum seekers are screened before being placed in asylum accommodation for vulnerabilities and safeguarding issues, and if necessary and appropriate will be placed in alternative accommodation. “All of our asylum accommodation sites are safe and secure, asylum seekers are provided with three meals a day and this is all paid for by the taxpayer.”"
2021-02-03T13:10:51Z,uk-news,UK news,The art of Big Jeff: beloved Bristol music fan shows another side,"He is a familiar and beloved figure on the Bristol music scene, a wild-haired, heavily bearded fan who can be spotted down the front at most gigs in the city rocking out to the upbeat numbers and swaying to the slower ones. But another side of Jeff Johns, aka Big Jeff, is being showcased at one of the cities most prestigious venues, the Bristol Beacon, formerly Colston Hall. On Wednesday an exhibition of his vibrant, dramatic paintings, which reflect both his love of live music and his struggles with anxiety, were unveiled. Called Big Jeff Johns â€“ Welcome to My World, the show includes paintings of some of the artists who have inspired him, including Gaelynn Lea Tressler, the folk singer, violinist and disability advocate and the Bristol-based trumpeter Pete Judge.
Others give a glimpse into his moods. Fear of Social Expectations, for example, features a large, alarmed eye, while Outcast includes a melancholy-looking character shoved to the edge of the painting. Within hours of the exhibition going live, his work was being snapped up. BBC Radio 6 Music DJ Mary Anne Hobbs bought one called Build. â€œSuch a powerful message as we look at the new futures we want to create for the planet,â€� she tweeted.
The exhibition is intended to instigate conversations about mental health and inspire people in similar situations to make art themselves. Johns, 38, said: â€œI use drawing and painting as a form of self-reflection. A lot of my work echoes my struggles around feeling like I donâ€™t fit into this world. Art for me has been about expressing emotions I canâ€™t explain another way.â€�
His career as a creator began after his grandmother, a tapestry artist, gave him some paints. â€œWhen I went to stay with her, I would sit in the early morning as she was working on her loom. I began painting as a way of dealing with lots of difficult emotions and struggling with the world around me. It came as a natural and cathartic release.â€� Johnsâ€™ first portrait â€“ Raggs â€“ was a study of the musician Rachel Aggs. Johns sourced the canvas from a charity shop and painted it from a blurry photo he had taken of Aggs at a Bristol gig. He had to paint on the kitchen floor of his flat â€“ and the vestiges of a footprint when he forgot it was there can be spotted on the painting. Raggs features in a collection of 14 paintings that have been hung in Bristol Beaconâ€™s Glass Room and can be viewed online. Over the next few months 20 more Big Jeff paintings will be shown.
In the late spring the paintings will be showcased as part of the Super Cool Drawing Machine exhibition, a celebration of the visual art created by a host of touring musicians, running from 20 to 23 May at Bristol Beacon. Exhibition curator Lee Dodds said: â€œWe have been working with Jeff for a couple of years now, after discovering his brilliant talent after he posted a photo of Raggs on Facebook. His paintings are uplifting and will definitely be popular with music fans and art collectors in Bristol and beyond.â€� Johns is missing live music but is getting on with painting. â€œIt has been difficult to be away from live music,â€� he said. â€œItâ€™s not just the music you miss but the faces. It will be great to get back.â€�"
2021-02-03T10:20:22Z,uk-news,UK news,Firm running asylum-seeker barracks in Kent stands to earn £1bn,"A company that runs the army barracks at the centre of a row over living conditions faced by asylum seekers stands to earn up to £1bn over 10 years for its government work, delivering multimillion-pound benefits for its owner. Clearsprings Ready Homes, owned by Essex businessman Graham King, runs Napier barracks in Kent, where hundreds of asylum seekers have told of poor conditions and going without heating and drinking water after a fire. Government disclosures show that the company has two 10-year contracts worth up to £1bn to operate asylum accommodation in Wales and the south until 2029. The contracts are particularly lucrative for King and his brother Jeff, who until recently shared control of parent company Clearsprings (Management) Ltd, part of a business empire that includes taxi services, a caravan park and a consultancy. According to accounts filed at Companies House, Clearsprings Ready Homes generated a £796,000 profit last year on sales of £68m, most of which comes from its work for the Home Office. Over the past four years, Clearsprings Ready Homes has paid out £4m in dividends to Clearsprings (Management) Ltd, controlled by Graham King. The latter company has paid its highest-earning director £4.5m since 2015 but declined to answer questions about who that was. Clearsprings (Management) Ltd also pays some of King’s other businesses for services. His consultancy business, Bespoke Strategy Solutions, made £1.75m in two years from Clearsprings (Management) which also paid King £13,000 for property rental in 2020 and paid £3,700 to taxi company Steve’s Cars, owned by the King brothers. In 2016, it put aside £213,580 after reaching a “settlement” with HMRC regarding its tax affairs. The Clearsprings Ready Homes website states: “We consider ourselves to be an organisation that punches above its weight and offers our customers a wide range of services they can depend on.” But elements of its track record tell a different story. Prior to the £1bn contracts Clearsprings Ready Homes won for its management of asylum centres, it earned £242m for “accommodation management services” between 2012 and 2019. In 2019, the company was named in a Guardian investigation that revealed asylum seekers were crammed into a network of “guest houses” overrun by cockroaches, rats and mice. The homes were run by a subcontractor of Clearsprings, which inspected the homes but left people living in them. But Clearsprings has been managing homes for asylum seekers or offenders on bail for much longer. In 2008, the company was accused by the Local Government Association of failing to consult local councils before opening bail units for offenders in a residential area of Kent. At the time, the company said: “We have always sought to work in partnership with other agencies and local government representatives.” Parliamentary records from Hansard show that Clearsprings has been running asylum centres since at least 2000, when it was described as “profiteering” in the House of Lords by Lord Greaves. Clearsprings Ready Homes’ current contract includes operation of the Napier barracks, where a fire started in one of the blocks at the site near Folkestone in Kent on Friday afternoon, prompting panic among the hundreds of asylum seekers housed inside.
Fourteen men have been arrested in connection with the fire, which Kent police say they believe was started deliberately. One of the men has been charged with assault. All but one of the blocks were left without heating and electricity according to multiple asylum seekers and volunteers who contacted the Guardian, leaving the men, many of whom have Covid-19, in freezing conditions. Drinking water supplies had not been replenished, forcing the men to drink non-potable water from the bathroom block taps, they said. The Home Office denied the allegations and said water and food had been provided throughout. As well as taxi services and accommodation for asylum seekers, the Kings’ business empire includes a caravan park in Canvey Island, Essex. In 2015, the Basildon Echo reported that the Thorney Bay Village had received £3.8m in housing benefit from the local council over two years for putting up homeless people in their caravans, which were described as being freezing cold. At the time, Holly King, representing the King family, was quoted as insisting the caravans were insulated. Clearsprings responded to questions about its finances but not about its record as a government contractor."
2021-02-03T07:00:52Z,uk-news,UK news,"Independence could cost Scotland's economy £11bn a year, forecast suggests","Scotland’s economy would shrink by at least £11bn a year if it became independent, more than doubling the damaging impacts of Brexit, a team of economists has forecast. The report from the London School of Economics and City University of Hong Kong found that quitting the UK’s common market would hit the Scottish economy two to three times as hard as leaving the EU, just counting the impact on trade alone. Suggesting that the worst economic effects would take several decades to take hold, the LSE’s Centre for Economic Performance said the impacts on its trade with both the UK and the EU would shrink Scotland’s economy in the long run by between 6.3% and 8.7%. That was equivalent to a loss of between £2,000 to £2,800 per capita a year: with Scotland’s population estimated to be nearly 5.5 million, that puts the losses at between £11bn and £15.4bn. The Scottish government, which is currently wrestling with the near collapse of Scottish seafood exports to the EU because of post-Brexit customs controls, currently spends around £14bn on the NHS each year. The authors stressed their analysis only covered the impacts of increasing trading costs, and excluded other economic or fiscal issues post-independence, such as cuts or increases in inward investment, changes in immigration, currency changes or tax changes. While it would be slightly better for an independent Scotland to rejoin the EU compared with staying outside both it and the UK, it would be extremely hard for EU trade to make up for all the substantial losses in UK trade. The UK is Scotland’s largest and most important trading partner, the report said, accounting for 61% of its exports and 67% of its imports – around four times greater than its trade with the EU. Independence would increase trading costs with the rest of the UK by 15% to 30%.
The report, Disunited Kingdom? Brexit, Trade and Scottish independence, concludes: “Changes in Scottish trade patterns following independence are likely to occur gradually, over a generation or more. Consequently, in the initial decades after independence, the rest of the UK will remain Scotland’s biggest trade partner.” Hanwei Huang, one of the report’s authors, said: “This analysis shows that, at least from a trade perspective, independence would leave Scotland considerably poorer than staying in the United Kingdom. “While many considerations will play a role in shaping the outcome of a second referendum, voters need to know what the likely costs and benefits of each course will be. This briefing contributes to that knowledge.” Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish government’s economy secretary, said the country would benefit enormously once independence had time to bed in and its government had full control of its economy. The similar-sized economy of Denmark was 20% larger per capita than the UK’s, and Norway’s 40%. She said EU membership had helped transform the Irish economy (Ireland joined the then European Communities in 1973, the same year as the UK, 50 years after independence), and the EU market was seven times that of the UK. “In the real world, through membership of the EU, independent Ireland has dramatically reduced its trade dependence on the UK, diversifying into Europe and in the process its national income per capita has overtaken the UK’s,” she said. “With our economic resources and advantages, control of economic policy and membership of the EU Scotland would be very well placed to grow the economy.”"
2021-02-03T06:00:51Z,uk-news,UK news,"A thousand young, black men removed from Met gang violence prediction database","One thousand young, black men have been removed from an allegedly discriminatory gangs database used by police in London, after a review found they posed no or little risk of committing violence, the Guardian has learned. The Metropolitan police’s gang violence matrix contains the names and details of thousands of people who police say pose a risk of committing gang violence. It then gives them a score showing how likely they are to commit gang violence. Community pressure led to scrutiny of the matrix, which had been operated in secret since 2011. These included concerns that it featured some young men who were not involved in gang violence and breached data protection laws, and claims of discrimination with most names being those of young, black males. Amnesty International has said the gang matrix, launched after the 2011 riots that the government wrongly blamed on gangs, was the product of the Conservatives triggering a “racialised” war on gangs that stigmatised black youngsters and left Britain breaking its human rights obligations. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who oversees the Met police, ordered the review of the names held on the gang matrix, which led to 1,000 young, black men under 25 being removed. The matrix now contains 2,305 individuals, a drop of 40% from its peak of 3,811 names in August 2017 who were assessed as being violent gangsters or in some cases at risk of gang violence. But eight out of 10 listed on the matrix are still from an African-Caribbean background, with some saying further reform is needed. Critics say those on the matrix can be subject to punitive measures across the public sector, covering employment, housing, driving licences and education. Dr Patrick Williams, a criminologist at Manchester Metropolitan University, who has researched the gang matrix, said some were placed on the list because of whom they were believed to know, not because of anything they had done: “People are on there because of their associations, not because of their behaviours. “It’s about where they live, the communities they are from, skin colour and their friends and family. We need answers how this could have happened. “The fact there were 1,000 whose personal details were held on the police gangs database, which meant their lives were blighted, confirms the database was flawed.” The campaigner Stafford Scott said: “It is indicative of the racist policing black Londoners have been facing. It is still discriminatory, the gang matrix is still tainted.” A 2018 review of the database for the London mayor found too many black people were on it compared with their likelihood of offending or their chances of being a victim, with 38% of those on the matrix assessed as posing no risk of committing violence. Khan’s administration says those removed from the gangs list have not offended since being taken off, as he attempts to fend off any criticism of going easy on crime with the London mayoral election due this May. A study of 473 people taken off the gang matrix found they faced no criminal charges in the six months before they were removed, nor the six months after. The London mayor said: “We simply cannot ignore the fact black Londoners have less trust in the Met and that is why my comprehensive overhaul of the Gang Violence Matrix is so important to improving the trust and confidence London’s diverse communities have in our police. “We know that gang-related violence still accounts for a significant proportion of the most serious violence in London and the Matrix is a necessary enforcement tool … but it’s vitally important that the police continue to evaluate, improve and communicate how it is used to address concerns from communities about the disproportionate number of Black Londoners and young men on the Matrix.” Met figures show that 69% of shootings and nearly one-quarter of homicides are believed to be linked to gangs. The gang matrix list for the London borough of Haringey was seen by the Guardian in 2018 and showed 40% of young people were scored as posing “zero” risk of causing harm. Following the 2011 riots that spread across England after starting in the Tottenham area of Haringey, police felt they needed better analysis of the threat from gangs. The then Conservative-led government blamed gangs for the violence, despite police believing only a minority of those involved were in gangs. Oliver Feeley-Sprague of Amnesty International said: “Nobody is suggesting that the authorities should ignore the threats posed by serious violence, but we have longstanding concerns that the gangs matrix is racially discriminatory and unfit for purpose. “Any ‘reform’ of the gangs matrix would need to be very substantial to avoid simply tinkering with a fundamentally discriminatory tool that has been used to unfairly target young black men, leading to greater mistrust of the police among affected communities.” The Met police said they had reformed how the matrix is used. A spokesperson for Britain’s biggest force said: “We do recognise that the GVM [gang violence matrix] remains a source of concern for some communities – and in particular for black communities whose trust and confidence we are determined to increase further … “We know that young men, and in particular young, black men, continue to be overrepresented on the GVM. Sadly, this is also reflective of the levels of violent crime that affect them – both in terms of victimisation and offending. “We are more transparent than ever with the public on our use of the GVM.”"
2021-02-03T06:00:50Z,uk-news,UK news,"Extend furlough or risk mass unemployment, industry and unions warn Sunak","Rishi Sunak has been warned by the leaders of Britain’s most influential business groups and the trade union movement that he risks plunging Britain into a period of mass unemployment unless he extends the furlough scheme. Before the budget on 3 March, both sides of industry told the chancellor that the economy was too fragile to end the wage subsidy scheme at the end of April and that he risked undoing the efforts to protect jobs over the past year if he did so. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said Sunak should not wait until the budget but should announce immediately that furlough – which has cost the Treasury almost £50bn so far – would remain in place until the end of the year. The government, she said, had a moral obligation to prevent a return to 1980s levels of unemployment.
“It would be a dereliction of duty of any government [not to extend furlough]. Nobody should think it is responsible or acceptable for any government to consign people to the dole queues,” O’Grady said. “The government must understand we need to work our way back to growth, and for that we need people in jobs. Otherwise we are going to end up with real, deep economic and social problems.” Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, called for a furlough extension from April to July and said the chancellor should not be fooled into thinking that the planned phased relaxation of lockdown restrictions meant the problems of business were at an end. “What one can’t do is say that once the vaccine rollout has happened, everything will be OK. That is not the case. You’ve got businesses in deep trouble, and still the possibility of flare ups in the virus. It’s not a case of just vaccinate and forget about it.”
Sounding the alarm as the government plots a road map for relaxing Covid restrictions this spring, the TUC and the BCC told the Guardian that a long-term plan was needed to repair the damage to the economy of a triple lockdown and the biggest annual contraction in the economy for 300 years. Extending furlough is also a central pre-budget demand of the CBI. The lobby group’s chief economist, Rain Newton-Smith, said an announcement was needed “sooner rather than later”. “If the government brought it to a sudden stop, that would almost certainly impact job decisions, just as we see hope on the horizon,” she said.
The warnings come as the Guardian launches a series of in-depth articles to look at the impact of the pandemic on employment in Britain, with millions of workers on furlough while coronavirus infections remain high, and as redundancies rise at the fastest rate on record. Representing millions of workers and thousands of businesses between them, the development comes as Boris Johnson’s government draws up plans for relaxing Covid restrictions this spring. Sunak has remained open to the possibility of fresh support measures to reflect lengthier restrictions than first envisaged, but O’Grady warned that an ideological tussle appeared to be gripping the cabinet over how to support Britain’s economic recovery from the crisis. “To cut back now would be a complete waste of all that effort, and it would be just obscene to confine a whole generation – particularly young people – to unemployment,” she said.
As the government’s flagship job support scheme, furlough has topped up the wages of almost 10 million jobs since its launch in March last year and is due to close at the end of April after several extensions. However, the Treasury’s own independent economics forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has said unemployment could spiral upwards once it expires to hit 2.7 million by the summer – more than double pre-pandemic levels. The government’s concern about the possibility of a spring surge in job losses was underlined by an announcement from the Department for Work and Pensions of a fresh financial support scheme to help 160,000 unemployed people find work. Announcing the measures on Wednesday, Therese Coffey, the employment secretary, said the plan to launch “digital job surgeries” would help jobseekers to improve their interview skills and offer advice to help people back into work quickly. “Our plan for jobs is helping us build back better and fairer, getting job support to people who need it right across Britain and levelling-up opportunity,” she said. The prime minister has said rapid deployment of the Covid vaccine will stand as the government’s most powerful economic recovery tool by enabling lockdown controls to be relaxed. Sunak batted away demands for further economic support last month by saying the Treasury had spent more than £280bn so far, while suggesting that the British economy had underlying strengths that could be unleashed as the vaccine is deployed and restrictions eased.
While the Treasury plans to refresh its Covid response in the budget, the chancellor has also suggested that many households saving money during the pandemic could help to kickstart the economy as the shackles on business and social life are removed. Marshall said businesses needed continued help from furlough to avoid lasting scarring from the crisis, as well as longer extensions to grant schemes, VAT cuts, business rates relief and funding for training staff. “Think of how much has been spent already. Stopping now would be akin to letting a marathon runner fall over within sight of the finish line, then not helping them over the line and giving them the support they need to recover,” he said."
2021-02-02T22:30:40Z,uk-news,UK news,Covid-19 hinders government hitting 'ambitious' target for new homes,"Covid-19 has knocked the government further off course from its housebuilding targets, a study has revealed, with only 94,000 new homes built during the first nine months of 2020. The first wave of coronavirus led to the temporary closure of construction sites last spring, leaving output well below the 300,000 new homes a year which the Conservatives pledged in their manifesto, according to research by the Resolution Foundation thinktank.
The government aims to deliver a million new homes by the end of the parliament, a target the Foundation described as “highly ambitious” even before the pandemic. Lindsay Judge, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: “If the government wants to hit its welcome target, it should turn to the social housing sector – which historically has provided up to one-in-three new homes – to provide the supply that millions of families in Britain need.” England’s annual housing output has only surpassed 300,000 on six occasions since the end of the second world war. Building activity plunged last March, when construction sites were closed as the coronavirus outbreak first took hold, causing private housing output to slump by 60% in April. However, construction rebounded once sites reopened with new safety measures in place, and output had returned to its pre-pandemic level by September. The thinktank warns that the housebuilding sector faces other challenges over the coming year. The housing market has boomed since the summer thanks to the stamp duty holiday, although house prices are expected to fall when the temporary tax cut ends on 31 March.
A decline in house prices, combined with rising unemployment and falling household incomes would suppress new private housebuilding activity in the short term, according to the Resolution Foundation. The UK’s ability to build new homes may also be restricted by availability of migrant construction workers, many of whom travelled home during the pandemic. The thinktank said this could be felt most keenly in London, where, before Covid, over half of construction workers were migrants, adding that it takes time to train new workers to fill the gap."
2021-02-02T20:25:03Z,uk-news,UK news,"Terror response report 'humbling', police chief tells Manchester Arena inquiry","A report on four terror attacks in 2017 made 103 recommendations about how officials could have better performed, the public inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing has heard. Its publication was a “humbling moment”, the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, Neil Basu, said in evidence on Tuesday. The inquiry heard that nearly 90% of the review’s recommendations had since been delivered. On day 58, the inquiry heard from just one witness, Basu, who is the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for UK counter-terror policing. He was senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing on the night of the Arena bombing and it was his job to assume national strategic command of the events and the investigative response. He declared the incident a terrorist attack at 12.56am on 23 May 2017 and effectively took responsibility for national strategic command from this point. Basu told the inquiry that, after the attack, the then prime minister, Theresa May, told him “you need to break the momentum” of terror attacks in the UK. Although an operational improvement review made 103 recommendations for how UK counter-terror operations could be improved, Basu said he still felt “we have the best counter-terrorism machine in the world in this country”. Basu began by expressing his “deepest sympathies” on behalf of Britain’s counter-terrorism network. “This is a network designed to stop there being victims and I have met far too many in my career. I know the terrible burden that not just the event but having to sit through inquests, criminal trials and inquiries has on those people, I know how brutal it is.” The inquiry heard he was not responsible for the immediate policing response to the attack which fell to Greater Manchester police’s gold strategic commander, the assistant chief constable Debbie Ford. Basu told the inquiry that it was only right that the local force is responsible for coordinating the police response, saying: “It would be wrong and idiotic for someone in London to try and make decisions about what was unfolding in Manchester.” The hearing was adjourned until Wednesday."
2021-02-02T19:36:51Z,uk-news,UK news,'The very best of us': nation pays tribute to Cpt Sir Tom Moore,"Tributes have flooded in from across the country – from both prominent figures and the public – after Cpt Sir Tom Moore died in hospital at 100 having testing positive for coronavirus.
Boris Johnson: “Cpt Sir Tom Moore was a hero in the truest sense of the word. In the dark days of the second world war he fought for freedom and in the face of this country’s deepest postwar crisis he united us all, he cheered us all up, and he embodied the triumph of the human spirit. “It is quite astonishing that at the age of 100 he raised more than £32m for the NHS, and so gave countless others their own chance to thank the extraordinary men and women who have protected us through the pandemic. He became not just a national inspiration but a beacon of hope for the world.” Matt Hancock, the health secretary: “I’m so sorry to hear that Cpt Tom has passed away in hospital. He was a great British hero that showed the best of our country and I send my best wishes to his family at this time.”
Ruth May, chief nursing officer for England: “On behalf of everyone in the NHS, I want to pay tribute to Cpt Sir Tom Moore who has been the model of all that has been good about our country’s response to Covid-19. “People rightly marvel at the tens of millions of pounds Cpt Sir Tom raised for the NHS, but for me his biggest achievement and most important contribution to helping my fellow nurses, doctors and all those in the NHS responding to coronavirus, has been how he brought the country together and gave us all a boost when we most needed it.” Keir Starmer, Labour leader: “This is incredibly sad news. Cpt Tom Moore put others first at a time of national crisis and was a beacon of hope for millions. Britain has lost a hero.” Priti Patel, the home secretary: “An inspiration to millions, not just in the United Kingdom, but around the world. A bright, kind light in the darkest of times. A British hero. I will never forget his undaunted optimism and how it helped us all to keep going. Rest in peace, Cpt Tom Moore.”
Singer Michael Ball, who recorded a No 1 charity single with Moore: “Rest in peace Cpt Tom Moore. A wonderful life so well lived and a hero and fighter to the very end. So very, very sad. Love and prayers for Hannah-I-M and all the family.” Dylan Jones, editor in chief of GQ: “Not only was Cpt Tom the oldest person ever to grace our cover, he was one of the most gracious. He was a hero, a genuine old-fashioned hero, and I feel blessed that we were in his orbit, albeit for a very brief time.”
The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby: “Cpt Tom was the very best of us. His courage, compassion, resilience, hope and generosity have been an inspiration to millions – and an example to us all. Where he walked a nation followed. I give thanks to God for such a long life, so well lived. May Cpt Tom rest in peace.” Spencer Pitfield, CEO of Paces in Sheffield, the charity that 10-year-old ‘Captain Tobias’ – inspired by Moore – raised money for: “I am truly saddened to learn of the passing of Cpt Tom Moore. Sir Tom was an absolute inspiration to us all – a true Yorkshire legend – my thoughts and prayers are with his family at this time.” Susan Henderson, a business support manager from Surrey: “Your light is needed elsewhere Cpt Sir Tom Moore, may you continue to shine bright. Thank you for being an inspiration in such challenging times, you really were our hero.” Nicholas Ridley, a chartered surveyor from London: “A sad day for his family and for an eternally grateful nation. He will live on in my heart and the hearts of millions of people for sure.” Emily Guest, from Hertfordshire: “What a wonderful man and he will be forever in our hearts. My daughters are young, but when I tell them of this time I will let them know of the man that raised so much for the NHS and gave us all hope that tomorrow will be a better day. May he rest in peace. Love to his family.”"
2021-02-02T18:59:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Video appears to show Chris Whitty being verbally abused in street,"Footage has emerged of England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, apparently being subjected to verbal abuse in the street, sparking condemnation. The video, which is undated and appears to have been uploaded after it was taken on a London street, was posted on Twitter by the Conservative MP Matt Vickers, who encouraged others to share it. “This is appalling, I really can’t believe this footage. Chris Whitty is doing all he can to help guide us through this crisis and should never be subjected to this abuse,” said the MP for Stockton South, who suggested the person who abused the UK government’s chief medical adviser should be made to volunteer on a Covid-19 ward.
A young man wielding a cameraphone can be heard and seen repeatedly telling Whitty “you’re a liar” as the adviser apparently waits for a takeaway lunch order at a street stall. The footage was taken at Westminster’s Strutton Ground market and uploaded to TikTok. Whitty does not respond and puts on a face covering as he waits, while the unmasked man taunts him. Vickers said in a statement: “The chief medical officer is working day in and day out to help guide our nation through this unprecedented crisis and I think all of us, no matter your political affiliation can agree the man is doing his absolute best.” He said it should also be remembered that Whitty was still working on the frontline as a practitioner across Covid wards. “As the clouds of this pandemic continue to part, I think those like Prof Chris Whitty will be seen as heroes who stepped up, did their job and led us through the darkest of hours. As for the young man in the video, the less said the better. Perhaps he should be made to volunteer on a Covid ward. Perhaps then he will feel a pinch of shame and embarrassment for his dangerous conspiracies and yobbish behaviour.” The abuse drew condemnation from supporters of other political parties. “Solidarity with Chris Whitty. Abusing and rejecting the views of experts is unacceptable and will cost lives,” tweeted Jack Summers, a Labour member who shared Vickers’ post. The incident comes against the backdrop of continued activism by Covid deniers who are seeking to spread misinformation on and offline. Healthcare and police chiefs warned last month that lives were being put at risk and the care of patients disrupted by a spate of hospital incursions from Covid deniers whose online activity is channelling hatred against NHS staff. Piers Corbyn, the climate denier and brother of the former Labour leader, is meanwhile facing a police investigation over leaflets likening Covid vaccination efforts to the concentration camp at Auschwitz."
2021-02-02T13:51:30Z,uk-news,UK news,"David Olusoga on the census: 'Some see it as a civic duty, and they're right'","As a child growing up on a council estate in Gateshead, the historian David Olusoga remembers his mother filling in a lengthy form about their family: ages, occupations, how they travelled to work, birthplace, language, religion, whether they owned or rented their home. “I wanted to know what this thing was,” he says. Now, he describes the census as “a snapshot taken every 10 years. It’s like somebody suddenly turns on the light – and you can see everybody, where they are.” On Thursday, Olusoga will explain the importance of the census in tracking the nation’s history to an online audience of 1.5 million schoolchildren. “There are more than two centuries of everybody sitting down on a particular day and answering questions. The whole country, 27 million households, will be taking part in this national tradition,” he said. He will explain what the census is, how it works and how it is used by historians, so that children can understand the experience of watching their parents sitting down at a computer for the first digital census. “It’s the bedrock, the firm ground you stand on when looking at social history,” he says. The 2021 census will be held on 21 March, with Scotland holding a separate census next year. The exercise has taken place every 10 years since 1801, with the exception of 1941 when Britain was at war. Households are required by law to answer questions about their accommodation, occupations, education, ethnicity, religion and marital status, or face a £1,000 fine. Some questions are voluntary. The Office for National Statistics is hoping that 75% of households will fill in the questionnaire online, although hard copies will be available on request. In 2011, 94% of households returned census forms. Olusoga, professor of public history at Manchester University, the author of Black and British: A Forgotten History, and the presenter of BBC Two’s A House Through Time, dismissed concerns about state intrusion. “No one finds it an intrusion when an NHS ambulance turns up, or when their children are given free education by the state. I think these are ludicrous libertarian arguments. “We need to understand society so we can better plan. How do we build infrastructure, how do we plan for hospitals, the provision of education, without knowing who’s in the country? “The state does not demand a huge amount of us in this country. Every 10 years, [we are asked for] basic information to allow the state to better run our society and better provide for our society. It’s such a small ask. “Maybe this is old-fashioned but some people see this is a civic duty, and they’re quite right.” Much of Olusoga’s live online lesson will focus on the lascars, sailors from the Indian subcontinent, south-east Asia and the Arab world who served on British ships from the 16th century until the second world war. “These were people caught in the ebb and flow of the empire, the cheap labour that lubricated the greatest trading nation the world had ever seen,” said Olusoga. Some put down roots in British port cities. “In some ways very little has changed. Conditions and safety at sea has got better, but who is manning the great container ships that move around the world today? It’s poor people from Nepal and Vietnam and from other countries where economic prospects are slim.” Before the pandemic, Olusoga regularly spoke to children in schools. “Children don’t like to be talked down to. They’re interested if you can explain things in a clear and linear fashion,” he said. Britain’s global story, “involving billions of people over four centuries, is critical to understanding the Britain that we live in today”. The school history curriculum allowed schools some choice in what to teach, particularly at A-level. But “the lack of focus on the empire in schools reflects the society those schools serve. We don’t think very much about the empire.” This year’s census was likely to reveal unexpected aspects of Britain. “We’re going through something quite profound that has disrupted our lives,” said Olusoga. “That will be reflected in the census but not in ways I or anyone can easily predict. There are always surprises.” David Olusoga’s lesson, Equality, Representation and the Census is part of the Census 2021 Let’s Count primary school programme. It will air on the Census 2021 YouTube channel on Thursday 4 February at 11am."
2021-02-02T13:50:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Northern Ireland suspends Brexit checks amid safety fears for port staff,"Brexit checks on animal and food products arriving into Belfast and Larne ports have been suspended amid fears over the safety of staff, Northern Ireland’s agriculture ministry has said. The decision came after Mid and East Antrim borough council agreed on Monday night to remove 12 of its staff at Larne port with immediate effect, following an “upsurge in sinister and menacing behaviour in recent weeks”. A spokesman for Stormont’s Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) said: “On the basis of information received today and pending further discussions with the PSNI [Police Service of Northern Ireland], Daera has decided in the interests of the wellbeing of staff to temporarily suspend physical inspections of products of animal origin at Larne and Belfast. “The situation will be kept under review and in the meantime full documentary checks will continue to be carried out as usual.” Edwin Poots, Northern Ireland’s agriculture minister, tweeted that he had taken the decision to withdraw staff at the ports in consultation with them. PSNI assistant chief constable Mark McEwan said force officials would meet partner agencies to discuss the situation. “The safety of staff working at points of entry is of the utmost importance to us,” he said. “Where we have any credible information we will share that with our partners and take appropriate action. “We have increased patrols at Larne port and other points of entry in order to reassure staff and the local community.” The Northern Ireland protocol came into force on 1 January to avoid a border on the island of Ireland but many have been dismayed by the burden it has placed on businesses. The UK Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, the Irish government and European commission have been working behind the scenes to establish a way of making the protocol work after its bumpy start and those efforts are expected to be redoubled with Gove taking an urgent question on the issue in parliament at 12.30pm on Tuesday. Tensions over checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea for supermarkets and food services have surfaced in loyalist communities in the past two weeks, with graffiti threatening officials.
Mid and East Antrim borough council said the situation had caused “extreme distress and worry to staff” at Larne port who had been assisting officials from Daera and UK Border Force with checks. It said it had “no option but to withdraw them from their duties in order to fulfil its duty of care and carry out a full risk assessment”, working with the PSNI and Daera. Last week, graffiti appeared on a wall near the port warning that all border officials were targets. It is also understood staff reported that individuals had been spotted taking down their number plate details. Two days ago, police launched an investigation into graffiti in south Belfast threatening the former taoiseach of Ireland Leo Varadkar if he “set foot in Ulster”. Peter Johnston, the mayor of mid and east Antrim and a councillor with the Democratic Unionist party, said: “We have seen what I would describe as deeply troubling graffiti and a very notable upping of community tensions towards the NI protocol, particularly in recent days. “The health and wellbeing of our staff is always this council’s number one priority and that is why the decision has been taken to withdraw them from their work at the port with immediate effect until we have very real assurances and full confidence that they can go about their duties without fear, threat or concern for their wellbeing.” One diplomatic source told the Guardian that unforeseen consequences of the protocol were stoking tensions. “Where is the flexibility and the creative solutions that the EU called for during the Brexit negotiations? Every day there are new twists and complications and these are touching the notions of identity and sovereignty, which are hugely sensitive were the cause of past conflicts,” the source said.
Since 1 January, traders in Northern Ireland have been subjected to a litany of checks on goods and in particular food being sold from Great Britain, with sanitary and phytosanitary checks at Larne, Belfast and Warrenpoint posts. But there have been concerns raised over the impact of a ban on soil coming from Britain in the form of plant imports for garden centres, which was imposed on the grounds of the risk of importing pests. Soil on farm machinery has long been considered a risk with dirty tractors and farm parts returned or destroyed about six times a year to prevent eel worm entering the island of Ireland, the Northern Ireland chief vet, Robert Huey, said before Christmas. However, few expected this strict rule to now apply to sales to plant nurseries. Jonathan Whittemore, of North Yorkshire firm Johnsons of Whixley, has called for urgent action over rules the firm “didn’t see coming”, telling the BBC on Monday he feared losing £500,000 a year because of sales barrier to the region."
2021-02-02T11:45:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Teenager emerging from 10-month coma has no knowledge of pandemic,"A teenager who is emerging from a 10-month long coma has no knowledge of the coronavirus pandemic despite having caught the disease twice. Joseph Flavill, 19, was hit by a car while walking in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, on 1 March last year, three weeks before Britain’s first national lockdown began. He has spent months in a coma after he suffered a traumatic brain injury but is slowly beginning to recover and has started responding. His aunt, Sally Flavill Smith, told the Guardian: “He won’t know anything about the pandemic as he’s been asleep for 10 months. His awareness is starting to improve now but we just don’t know what he knows. “I just don’t know where to start with it. A year ago if someone had told me what was going to happen over the last year, I don’t think I would have believed it. I’ve got no idea how Joseph’s going to come to understand what we’ve all been through.” She said the family have tried to explain over video call that they’re unable to be with him in person due to coronavirus restrictions, but haven’t attempted to explain the scale of the pandemic. “When he’s awake in his room, he’s not going to have any idea why he’s there. We do talk about it on the phone, and we try to make him aware that we really want to be there holding his hands, but we’re just unable to do it [because of Covid]. “But we try to keep it as simple as possible, we don’t really have the time to go into the pandemic hugely – it just doesn’t feel real does it? When he can actually have the face-to-face contact, that will be the opportunity to actually try to explain to him what has happened.” The teenager, who was treated at Leicester General hospital and has now been moved to Adderley Green care centre in Stoke-on-Trent to continue his recovery, has started moving his limbs when asked and is engaging with family and friends through blinking and smiling. Flavill Smith said the teenager is able to follow commands such as touching his left and his right ear, move both of his legs, and answer yes and no through blinking, while his first smiles have brought the family to tears. “We’ve still got a long journey ahead, but the steps he’s made in the last three weeks have been absolutely incredible,” said Flavill Smith. He has caught Covid twice during his recovery from the accident but recovered on both occasions. Flavill’s mother, Sharon, was able to visit her son on his 19th birthday in December but had to remain socially distanced and wear full PPE the entire time. “At that point, Joseph wasn’t as aware as he is now, and I think she felt incredibly sad because she wasn’t sure that Joseph could even see who she was. She’d been waiting for months to be able to go and see him.” Before the accident, Flavill, from Tutbury, Staffordshire, was a sporty and active teenager and was due to receive his gold Duke of Edinburgh award in May. Through their Joseph’s Journey campaign, the family have raised over £30,000 to support the teenager in his long-term recovery."
2021-02-02T11:35:03Z,uk-news,UK news,"UK weather: snow may cut off rural areas in north of England, says Met Office","Parts of northern England have had heavy snowfall overnight and the Met Office has warned that rural communities are at risk of being cut off and that widespread travel disruption is likely. The warning came after the Met Office described last month as the coldest January in the UK since 2010, bringing an average temperature of 2.2C. It had also been the coldest calendar month since March 2013, which also recorded an average temperature of 2.2C. The coldest January on record was 1963 with a mean temperature of minus 1.9C. Hundreds of schools, which were open to vulnerable children and those of key workers, have closed in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Oldham, Greater Manchester. Heavy snow forced coronavirus vaccine appointments in parts of North Yorkshire to be rescheduled. An amber weather warning for snow came into force across much of South Yorkshire, and parts of Derbyshire, West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester at 3am on Tuesday and was to last until 1pm. Overnight, vehicles became stuck on the eastbound M62 near Rochdale, Lancashire, between junction 21 for Milnrow and junction 22 for Denshaw, leading to a temporary closure of the carriageway. In the early hours a lorry jack-knifed on the same motorway westbound between junctions 23 and 22. Lancashire police said emergency services had been called to numerous collisions, and warned motorists to make only necessary journeys. Overnight, Derbyshire police also said crashes were “rolling in” on the roads as High Peak, Dales, Chesterfield and north-east Derbyshire had heavy snowfall. Forecasters said motorists who used the roads were at risk of becoming stranded, while rail and flight cancellations were likely. Power cuts and disruption to mobile phone coverage were also expected, and rural communities faced being cut off completely.
The snow was expected to move north over the course of Tuesday morning, before clearing and becoming brighter from the south in the early afternoon. Over the next seven days, much of Scotland is also bracing for icy and snowy conditions. Elsewhere, there is a yellow weather warning for rain and snow across Co Derry and Co Antrim in Northern Ireland in force until midday on Tuesday, meaning flooding is possible. An alert for snow and ice is also in place from central Scotland down to the Midlands until midnight on Tuesday, which is likely to affect public transport and motorists. Between 5cm and 10cm of snow could fall over higher ground in southern Scotland and northernmost counties in England with the possibility of 20cm or more across the highest roads. Jason Kelly, the Met Office’s deputy chief meteorologist, said: “While the south of the UK hangs on to the milder air for much of this week as we approach the weekend, the area of low pressure responsible for the snow across the north of the UK will clear, allowing colder air to push south and west across much of the country. Further snow is expected for most parts of Scotland on Friday, while Saturday will be cold for all.”"
2021-02-02T06:00:28Z,uk-news,UK news,'We felt like we were animals': asylum seekers describe life in UK barracks,"Hasan Hamed almost didn’t make it to the UK. Trembling, he couldn’t bring himself to step into the boat in Calais, having paid £3,000 to make the crossing. The smuggler told him: “Either get in now or you lose your money.” Hamed, 32, from Yemen, was dealing with multiple traumas by that point. He had been jailed and tortured by Houthi fighters in his home country after he refused their efforts to forcibly conscript him. “The Houthis imprisoned me naked for one week and deprived me of sleep,” he said, describing various tortures he was put through, including having to sleep under a blanket smeared with excrement and threatened with rape. Hamed escaped to Saudi Arabia, where he was subjected to labour exploitation and given only a fraction of the wages to which he was entitled from working as a salesperson. Once again he fled, paying smugglers to help him cross from Turkey to Greece. “One of my friends drowned on that journey. It took them 15 days to recover his body from the sea,” he said. When Hamed reached the UK he was placed in temporary accommodation by the Home Office before being taken to Napier barracks in Kent. Napier and Penally barracks, in Pembrokeshire, which between them hold more than 600 men, were handed over from the Ministry of Defence to the Home Office in September to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers. The barracks, which are run by the private contractor Clearsprings, have been criticised for crowded conditions, limited access to healthcare and legal advice and, more recently, a significant Covid-19 outbreak in which more than one in four of the 400 residents at Napier were infected. Many of the asylum seekers who have ended up at these sites have fled from the risk of torture, persecution and death in their countries of origin. In many cases, those who sought to harm them represented an armed force of some kind, making the military environment of the barracks traumatising for them. “It is hard to describe the effect of being surrounded by security after going through the things I went through. I thought a lot about suicide in Napier but the only thing that stopped me was the effect that would have on my family,” Hamed said. “I only went out a few times in my three months in Napier because of the far right protesters. I could see the hatred in their eyes. One of them started to accelerate towards me in his car one time when I left the barracks and was walking on the wrong side of the road.” Hamed is now out of the barracks and in a hotel in London. He tried to get an appointment with a counselling service in Dover while he was in the barracks, but he was not offered one until he moved to London. “The worst thing in the barracks is the emptiness of waiting, just waiting inside four walls,” he said. Matin, 26, from Iran, said mental health among Napier residents was so poor that there had been multiple suicide and self-harm attempts. “The first impression I had was it looked like a prison. There were fences, security guards walking around, I was really depressed,” he said. “There is no support for mental wellbeing. We have one nurse on site, in case you get a cold or flu. People are getting more and more frustrated.” Matin said there was no privacy in blocks holding 28 people of varying nationalities, and language barriers made negotiations over the two showers and two toilets they share challenging. “The toilets and showers are often out of order, or there’s no water, or no flush. The showers are cold. Or they are so dirty I don’t want to use them,” he said.
Matin said he was told by Migrant Help, the Home Office-contracted charity that is supposed to provide assistance to the men, that he would be out in a month, but he had been there for three and a half months and counting. He said he had received no communication from the Home Office on the progress of his asylum application. Last October he met the immigration minister Chris Philp, who was visiting Napier and described the camp as a “fine place”. “It’s true we have a roof above our heads … but this is what many animals have,” Matin said. “We really need reassurance and safety. The Home Office do not provide this.” Matin was one of at least 120 people at Napier who contracted Covid-19 in mid-January. He said efforts to encourage the men to self-isolate in their blocks were poor and the management appeared to adopt a policy of treating the entire site as one “big house”. “We were all terrified. We had some people who wanted to open the doors at night. A few people preferred to sleep outside. Some people didn’t want to use the toilets and showers. Last night I saw a guy in his 50s, he was shaking out of fear,” he said. “When you walk round the camp, you can hear the coughing, the sneezing all over the block. I was waiting for this to happen. It was inevitable.” Another asylum seeker, Taha, said that when he was moved to Napier he was told he was on his way to a hotel. “When we arrived we were so scared and thought it was detention, because it looks like detention.” He said he was told he would be in the camp for no more than a month, but after a couple of months he stopped believing this. “We felt like we were animals in a closed place,” he said. “Mentally, problems became more difficult for all people because we’re scared of being in detention.” Taha described a hunger strike held at the end of last year. “We wanted a clear answer from the Home Office as to how long we are going to stay here. But again, no answer, and the manager here said he didn’t have contact with the Home Office.” Another asylum seeker, Mohamed, was taken from London to Penally last September in the middle of the night. “They came and took me from my hotel at 3am. We went to another hotel in Wembley and about 50 asylum seekers were put on a bus. Nobody told us where we were going. We kept seeing airport signs on our journey and thought they were going to put us on a plane to deport us. We travelled for eight hours without a stop. There was a toilet on the bus but everyone was using it and I was worried about Covid so avoided it.” He said one of the worst things about Penally was the flashbacks and nightmares it triggered about the situation from which he had fled in a war-torn country in the Middle East. “We are human beings, not terrorists. We came here because of war. I swear to God I would not leave my country if I could stay there safely.” Mohamed was one of a group of asylum seekers who created a union at Penally – CROP, or Camp Residents of Penally. “Home secretary Priti Patel said we should be grateful for the accommodation in the barracks,” he said. “How can we be grateful? The conditions here are against humanity.” The Home Office has previously said it is meeting all its statutory duties to accommodate asylum seekers, and insisted the barracks sites are safe and secure. Philp, the immigration compliance minister, has previously said: “The government takes the wellbeing of asylum seekers extremely seriously. We are required by law to house asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute, and we provide safe, warm, Covid-secure, suitable accommodation, where they receive three meals a day while their claims are being processed.” • Names have been changed at the request of the interviewees"
2021-02-02T06:00:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Former immigration minister criticises use of barracks to house asylum seekers,"The Conservative former immigration minister Caroline Nokes has accused the Home Office of using barracks accommodation for asylum seekers to make the country appear to them “as difficult and inhospitable as possible”. She said asylum seekers should not be “segregated into a ghetto” in barracks accommodation, but instead placed in supported accommodation where they have access to a range of facilities. Nokes is among a group of backbench Conservative MPs with barracks in their constituencies who have raised concerns about their use to house asylum seekers. Others include Damian Collins, whose Folkestone and Hythe constituency includes Napier barracks, and Richard Fuller, the MP for North East Bedfordshire, where there is a new barracks-style development close to Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre. There is growing concern about the conditions inside the barracks. Inhabitants say they are freezing cold and filthy, with poor quality drinking water and food so bad they refuse to eat it. There have been Covid outbreaks, hunger strikes and suicide attempts. The decision to hold several hundred asylum seekers in the barracks has triggered a raft of legal actions as well as outcry from human rights charities including the Red Cross, Care4Calais, Detention Action and Medical Justice. Military barracks in remote locations have never before been used to accommodate asylum seekers, many of whom have survived torture and other forms of persecution before fleeing their home countries. Some of those tortured in military or prison facilities at home have said the barracks have triggered nightmares and flashbacks. “We as a nation can do better than this,” said Nokes, who was immigration minister in Theresa May’s government between January 2018 and July 2019. “The Home Office really needs to get its act together. They need to revamp the accommodation contracts and put in place more contracts for supported accommodation. She has been vocal about her concerns not only about Home Office plans to establish barracks-style accommodation on Ministry of Defence land in her own constituency of Romsey and Southampton North, but also about wider barracks policy and the approach to asylum seekers. “I don’t think the Home Office is listening to me. I think they have become very blinkered,” she said. “Barracks are not a short-term quick fix. They have failed.” She said she was surprised that the Home Office was moving forward with barracks plans while a handful of legal actions were under way to challenge their use. “Is now the time to introduce even worse accommodation when we don’t know what the outcome of the legal challenges will be? Better to hold fire until such time as we have seen the outcome. That doesn’t appear to be the Home Office strategy,” she said. It is understood that the use of one barracks-style accommodation, an officers’ mess at RAF Coltishall in Norfolk, is winding down. Around 40 asylum seekers are accommodated there. The Conservative MP for Broadland, Jerome Mayhew, said the community had been taken by surprise when the Home Office moved asylum seekers in there last May, but had been supportive. “Whilst the centre is undoubtedly well run, it is generally accepted that its rural location makes it unfit for anything but emergency use as an asylum centre, so I am glad that the Home Office has committed to closing the facility as soon as the Covid crisis is past,” Mayhew said. At least five legal challenges are under way – two relating to Penally barracks in Wales, two relating to Napier barracks in Folkestone, and one relating to Yarl’s Wood. They focus on the lawfulness or otherwise of providing such accommodation for asylum seekers, breach of asylum seekers’ human rights, false imprisonment, deprivation of liberty, and failure to conduct vulnerability assessments. Sue Willman, of Deighton Pierce Glynn, who is representing several asylum seekers at Napier barracks, said: “We have issued a judicial review against the home secretary challenging her decision to detain three asylum-seeker clients, each of whom is either a victim of torture or trafficking or both.” Toufique Hossain, director of public law at Duncan Lewis solicitors, which is bringing legal challenges at Napier and Penally, said: “The government’s strategy to segregate asylum seekers in collective ex-military/detention sites across rural and remote parts of England and Wales is yet another feature of its harsh, dehumanising immigration policy. “Our clients have been subjected to detention and interrogation in their countries. They have fled having experienced rape, sexual abuse and torture. These military camps are obviously retraumatising.” The immigration compliance minister, Chris Philp, said: “These sites were previously used to house military personnel – to suggest they are not good enough for asylum seekers is an insult. They are provided with three meals a day, and have their basic needs catered for. “The damage and destruction at Napier Barracks put lives at risk, including staff and emergency service workers. This is totally unacceptable and I would like to thank the police and fire service officers who had to put themselves in harms’ way.”"
2021-02-01T20:11:56Z,uk-news,UK news,Teenage leader of neo-Nazi group is UK's youngest terror offender,"The teenage leader of a neo-Nazi group has been convicted over offending that began at the age of 13, making him the youngest person in the UK known to have committed a terrorist offence. The boy, from Cornwall, who cannot be identified, appeared before the Old Bailey in London via video link on Monday and admitted 12 offences – two of dissemination of terrorist documents and 10 of possession of terrorist material. At 13 he downloaded a bombmaking manual and began gathering terrorist material. Later in the same year he joined the neo-Nazi cult Fascist Forge, and at 14 he went on to share far-right extremist ideology in online chatrooms. The court heard that the youth, now 16, led the British branch of the now banned neo-Nazi terrorist organisation Feuerkrieg Division (FKD). The group idolises mass murderers such as those who carried out far-right terrorist attacks in Norway, the US and New Zealand in recent years. FKD encourages so-called “lone wolf” attacks. Between October 2018 and July 2019, the boy collected a significant amount of far-right material and was active on online platforms, expressing racist, homophobic and antisemitic views. He talked about gassing Jewish people, hanging gay people and wanting to “shoot up their parades”, the court heard. Naomi Parsons, prosecuting, said police searched the property where the boy lived with his grandmother following reports that he was constructing a weapon. No weapon was found but officers discovered a Nazi flag and well-known Nazi slogan on the garden shed, as well as several manuals about making weapons and instructions on how to kill people on his phone and computer. “The age is the alarming factor and his conduct betrays a maturity beyond his chronological age,” Parsons said. In a police interview, the defendant said he had made racist, homophobic and antisemitic comments “to look cool”. It was claimed that he was in touch with a 14-year-old Estonian boy who founded the FKD and was responsible for vetting and recruiting members and propaganda. They used encrypted messages to discuss their hatred of particular groups. The defendant then set up FKD GB and recruited five British members from online platforms, including Paul Dunleavy, 17, from Rugby, who was jailed last year for preparing acts of terrorism. The cell wanted to enact “white jihad” and the genocide of people who were not white, the court heard. In mitigation, Deni Matthews said the defendant had a “simply dreadful childhood”, and everything he did was in order to “seek approval” from others online. The judge Mark Dennis said he would need to consider whether the teenager had been immature or naive before passing sentence. He said: “I need to assess a person of this age who sends these messages, [and] whether this is true beliefs or the product of firstly grooming but then self-aggrandisement and the other matters.” The boy was granted bail subject to strict conditions including residing at his home and attending youth offending services, along with a ban on using computers without police permission and bans on using any private browsing mode, encryption software or virtual storage devices such as the cloud. The boy will be sentenced on 8 February."
2021-02-01T16:29:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Body of baby on Wirral golf course 'may have been there for weeks',"The body of a baby boy discovered at a golf course in Wirral may have been there for several weeks, Merseyside police said. Police are continuing to treat the death as unexplained after an initial postmortem on Monday was inconclusive in determining the cause of death, according to DCS Lee Turner. Officers are trying to find the boy’s mother to check on her welfare and safety, and to see if she needs medical help. “Clearly it will be as distressing for her as it is for anyone reading,” Turner said. “We just want to build a timeline of what’s happened throughout the pregnancy to lead into this event where the little boy has been left in the location that he’s been recovered in.” The boy’s body was discovered by a couple walking their dogs on a public footpath through Brackenwood golf course in Bebington on Friday. Police believe the body may have been there for at least four or five weeks but cannot be sure due to recent cold weather. The golf course has been closed to golfers under lockdown restrictions. The body was discovered in a wooded area off the public right of way. Turner described the case as “absolutely awful”. He said the police wanted to extend support to the baby’s parents and other family members and give the boy some “dignity in death”. “Any death of a baby is tragic. When a baby is recovered in this set of circumstances, I think it touches everybody,” he added. Forensic tests are taking place but may not prove conclusive in determining when or how the baby died, unless the boy’s mother came forward, Turner said. Anyone with information should call police on 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
2021-02-01T15:33:44Z,uk-news,UK news,'Weâ€™re in fine fettle': joy on Isle of Man as Covid lockdown ends,"The White House Hotel, a pub in the seaside town of Peel on the west coast of the Isle of Man, was bustling with life hours after the island’s coronavirus lockdown was lifted. “It’s wonderful to be back in here,” said George Kneale, a 75-year-old blacksmith, as he sipped a pint of beer. “We’re in fine fettle. Having that bit of water between us and the UK can really help sometimes.” Peter Halsall was doing a bit of shopping when he spotted that the pub was open. “It seemed rude not come in. It feels wonderful.” One of the pool players in the pub, Feeagh Joughin, 19, said there was a “real buzz” around the island. He puts the Isle of Man’s success in the battle against Covid down to its size: the population is about 85,000. “It’s all about scale, isn’t it? When you’re smaller you can sort anything out.”
The Isle of Man brought in a “circuit-breaker” lockdown on 7 January following a cluster of Covid cases. On Monday, the restrictions were lifted after the government declared no community transmission was taking place. Social distancing measures have been lifted and face coverings are no longer required. There are no time limits for exercise or leisure activities and non-essential shops have reopened, as have schools, nurseries, colleges and entertainment venues. At Davison’s cafe and ice cream parlour on Peel promenade, pots of homemade vegetable and red pepper soup were bubbling away. Ian Davison, the director of the business, said the mood was jolly. “People are glad to be back. They don’t have to wear masks or worry about social distancing. It’s as if a weight has been lifted over everyone’s shoulders.” Davison said he believed the Isle of Man’s government had done a good job. “I think they have been more proactive than Boris Johnson.” The island, a self-governing British crown dependency, has not been untouched by Covid-19: there have been more than 400 cases and 25 deaths. But it maintains strict border controls and, most agree, has reacted nimbly to challenges posed by the virus. The chief minister, Howard Quayle, praised the way islanders had responded. “There’s a collective determination, a sense of duty and community spirit. The public have followed all the rules.” He said many groups and individuals had done their bit, ranging from the rugby club that had carried out food deliveries to the arts staff who joined test-and-trace teams when their venues were closed. Emma Callin, the head of VillaGaiety, which runs a theatre and cinema in the island’s capital, Douglas, dropped off her children before heading into the office to help with a rush for tickets. “We’re expecting all our events to be very well attended,” she said. “People are keen to get out again.”
The Broadway Cinema will reopen from Friday and is showing films including the fantasy drama Come Away. Travel restrictions mean that, for now, the live productions only feature local people, but there is enough talent on the island to keep people satisfied. Forthcoming attractions include a community production of The Wizard of Oz and a ballroom competition. “I know people are feeling very proud at what we’ve achieved,” said Callin. “The community is small, we know each other well and are good at looking after one another. It feels like we’re back to normal today.” The rules are being strictly enforced. Dale McLaughlan, a 28-year-old who crossed the Irish Sea from Scotland on a jet ski to visit his girlfriend on the Isle of Man, was jailed for four weeks for breaching Covid-19 laws. There are also stringent rules on isolation and an efficient test-and-trace system.
Adrienne Burnett, the headteacher at Ballakermeen high school in Douglas, said the school knew how fortunate it was to be fully open. “That sentiment applies equally to our students too; they have returned determined to make the most of being in classrooms with their teachers and peers. It is very noticeable how focused the whole school is today. I didn’t realise quite how much I missed the buzz of a full school with boisterous laughter and lots of cheerful faces.” Back over on the west coast, Peel Golf Club was busy. The secretary, Sue Milne, said members had been able to carry on playing during lockdown but in tightly controlled circumstances. “But we’ve been completely open again today, which has been wonderful. The first golfers teed off at daybreak. I know it’s very difficult for people elsewhere who are still in lockdown. We are in awe of how lucky we are.”"
2021-02-01T14:44:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Harry says Mail on Sunday underplayed gravity of false claim as libel case settled,"The Duke of Sussex has accused the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online of underplaying the seriousness of an error in a story about his relationship to the British armed forces as the two sides formally settled a high court libel claim. Harry had sued Associated Newspapers over two articles published in October, which claimed he had snubbed the Royal Marines and “not been in touch … since his last appearance as an honorary marine in March”, citing “informed sources”. On 27 December, the Mail on Sunday printed an apology, accepting the duke had been in touch with the Royal Marines, and said it had made a donation to the foundation managing the duke’s Invictus Games. Harry has accepted an apology and “substantial damages” from Associated Newspapers over the “baseless, false and defamatory” allegations. He was awarded £2,500 costs – well short of the £35,000 Harry’s legal team had claimed it would require to produce the 1,100-word statement read out in court on Monday. In a separate order, Mr Justice Nicklin said the original draft had been “unduly tendentious” and had featured criticisms of Associated which were subsequently removed by agreement. Nicklin called the £35,000 claim for producing the statement, a common means of a successful claimant publicising their vindication in a defamation case, “manifestly disproportionate”. He added: “No litigant of ordinary means would reasonably consider spending such a sum on this exercise.” In a brief remote high court hearing on Monday setting out details of the settlement of the claim, the solicitor for the duke, Jenny Afia, said the apology – published before the final conclusion of the settlement – “used wording which significantly underplayed the seriousness of the accusations made against him” and “did not expressly acknowledge that the allegations were false”. In a pre-prepared statement, Afia also said the apology “incorrectly stated that the defendant had made a donation to the Invictus Games Foundation”. Afia said that while Associated Newspapers had offered to make a donation directly, Harry had decided to make a donation of the amount received in damages directly to the Invictus Games Foundation himself “so he could feel something good had come out of the situation”. While Afia acknowledged the wording of the apology was agreed between the two parties, she said it “did not, therefore, accurately represent what happened in that respect”. A spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said on Monday: “The Mail on Sunday and Mail Online publicly admitted in open court that they pushed a completely false and defamatory story. And they’ve apologised for questioning the Duke of Sussex’s commitment to the Royal Marines and British armed forces”. The spokesperson said: “The truth is that the duke’s commitment to the military community is unquestionable.” Harry and the Duchess of Sussex have stepped up their war on what they view as irresponsible reporting by parts of the media since they stepped down from senior roles in the royal family. In December, Meghan settled a privacy claim against an insolvent British paparazzi agency that took pictures of her and the couple’s young son Archie when out for a walk near their home. She is still in a separate court battle with Associated, suing the Mail on Sunday over alleged privacy and copyright breaches after it published a letter she sent to her father, Thomas Markle. Her lawyers are applying for “summary judgment”, in which part of her case would be resolved without a trial. If she is unsuccessful the case will go to full trial in the autumn. ANL claims Meghan intended the letter to be used as part of a “media strategy”, which the duchess has denied. In documents filed with the high court shortly before Christmas, the duke’s lawyers said Harry had been “personally affronted” by the articles, which had “caused huge damage to his reputation”. The Mail on Sunday article, published on 25 October, claimed “exasperated top brass” were considering a replacement because Harry “has not been in touch by phone, letter nor email since his last appearance as an honorary marine”. It also alleged the duke had not responded to a personal letter from Lord Dannatt, a former head of the British army. However, Harry’s lawyers said in court documents that the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online “disregarded the claimant’s reputation in its eagerness to publish a barely researched and one-sided article in pursuit of the imperative to sell newspapers and attract readers to its website”."
2021-02-01T00:01:52Z,uk-news,UK news,'I couldn't be prouder': Swampy and 16-year-old son in HS2 tunnel protest,"Veteran environmental activist Dan Hooper, known as Swampy, who is one of nine protesters in a tunnel in central London to raise the alarm about the environmental destruction they believe the high speed rail project HS2 will cause, is in the tunnel with his 16-year-old son, it has emerged. The activists have been in the tunnel close to Euston station since Tuesday to raise awareness of the climate emergency and to try to halt work on the HS2 project which is under way in the Euston area. They argue that many ancient woodlands will be destroyed by the project. HS2 says it is planting 7m new trees. There are concerns about their safety in the honeycomb of tunnels, dug beneath a busy London square. On Sunday they brought a legal challenge against the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), saying the work of the eviction team was endangering them. There have been a number of collapses, and mud pouring into the tunnels.
The eviction team say they are extremely concerned about the safety of the tunnels, and have a team of experts including paramedics monitoring the situation. HSE said they are in contact with the team and are being updated. Rory Hooper helped his father, 47, dig the secret HS2 protest tunnel under Euston Square Garden. Dan Hooper said he was happy for Rory to help with digging the tunnel but was hesitant when he asked to join the protesters underground for the eviction process. “To begin with, I didn’t want Rory to be in the tunnel for the eviction, but he was absolutely adamant that he would stay down there with me for it.
“He did help dig it and it is his future at stake, and that of other young people like him, so I couldn’t really argue. He reminds me of what I was like at his age and I just couldn’t be prouder of him.” He said he was impressed with his son’s climbing abilities. “He is already becoming a better climber than me so yes, he will probably become better at digging and tunnel dwelling than me as well. But don’t tell him that, I don’t want him getting a big head. “He already likes to wind me up that I’m past it and I must admit, tunnels do seem to have become less comfortable than they were a few decades ago, but I think he’ll find that there’s some life in the old dog yet.” Hooper lives with his partner and their three children in Tipi Valley, an eco-village in west Wales. The family live a sustainable life growing vegetables, using solar panels for electricity, composting waste and filtering water from a nearby stream.
As a seasoned tunneller his advice to Rory and other members of the underground crew is: “Safety first always, a good food supply, plenty of nutritious food, but some tasty treats as well, and games to play, like cards, because you’re going to be down there a long time and don’t want to get bored. And try to build a good and respectful relationship with the people evicting you, however much you might disagree with them. “Above all else, when it gets hard, remember why you are doing it. Think of the beautiful ancient trees you’ve been living in and are protecting by your actions.” Hooper said that protests such as this one “can turn the tide and get the climate emergency under control”. He said that although the government was now planning a new road building programme along with the HS2 project the anti-roads protests that he and others were involved with in the 1990s had halted much of that programme. Rory said: “I’ve always been aware of what Dad did years ago, before I was born. But it’s only since visiting HS2 sites with him this summer and seeing the beautiful ancient woodland they’re destroying that I’ve properly understood what it is to feel so passionate about trying to stop it. “Growing up in an eco-village, I’ve had a strong connection to nature all my life. I was always happier climbing trees than being in school. But I never dreamed I’d wind up doing this. Most people have never actually set foot in an ancient woods. They are alive with so many animals, in a way that nowhere else is. You can’t just plant one, it takes hundreds of years to become like that. They are magical places and there are so few of them left. I can’t just let them be destroyed without trying to save them.” His mother is not in the tunnel with Hooper and her son but is checking up daily on them by phone. “Mum is really proud. She tells me on the phone and I can feel it. She likes me to ring her every day. I know she worries about me but also she knows that I am safe with Dad.” As for the day-to-day life underground, he said: “It’s more fun than I thought. I actually love it underground. It’s really peaceful.”"
2021-01-31T17:23:50Z,uk-news,UK news,"Met Office warns of ice, flooding and snow in next few days across UK","Wild weather over the weekend that brought sub-zero temperatures, storms, flooding and widespread icy conditions looks set to continue into the early part of the week in some areas of the UK. By Sunday evening there were 80 flood warnings in place for England and six flood alerts across Wales. The Met Office issued a yellow warning for ice and snow in Orkney and Shetland, while much of Wales saw ice and snow. Wet and snowy weather is forecast for much of the country into the middle of the week. The warnings come as new government proposals could entitle homeowners in flood-hit areas to discounted insurance premiums if they install flood protection measures. Plans under consultation could also allow insured householders able to claim money to cover the damage and make their homes more resilient. On Saturday, Chesil Beach on the Isle of Portland in Dorset was hit by storms that breached sea defences, leading the Environment Agency to issue a flood warning for the area and warn people to take care along beaches and coastal footpaths. In Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, a children’s playground was partly submerged, while in Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire, water rose up the tow path along the river. This week, more snow is likely across northern England, parts of Wales and Scotland with up to 5cm of snow likely at lower levels and up to 10cm on higher ground. After a cold but settled day on Monday, the Met Office is predicting a heavier band of rain to arrive overnight on Monday across a swathe of the UK from the south and west, said Met Office meteorologist Luke Miall. “From Monday night into Tuesday, we’ve got a weather system coming up from the Atlantic, bringing heavy rain to southern and western parts of the UK,” he said. “As it bumps into that cold air for Northern Ireland, Scotland, northern England, and perhaps north Wales, these are the areas that are likely to see that rain turning quickly to snow.” Travel across a large part of England and Wales north of the M4 corridor could be disrupted by snow and ice, including on trans-Pennine routes. On Wednesday, the wintry weather is expected to move up the country, with the risk of snow across Scotland and northern England, he said. “Some areas could actually see a couple of days of snow falling, not necessarily all the time,” he said."
2021-01-31T16:01:51Z,uk-news,UK news,'We'd be lost': parents fight to save Welsh schools facing closure,"The parents who send their children to primary school in the Carmarthenshire village of Mynyddygarreg have a very challenging job. They are home schooling, keeping their families safe, juggling work commitments – and at the same time fighting against the proposed closure of the cherished village school. “I feel I’m living a nightmare,” said Cara Young, a parent governor and the mother of two children, Dewi, seven, and Millie, four. “I’m helping teach the children, working full time and trying to work through the closure consultation document. It’s really unfair that this is hanging over us while the pandemic is happening.” Many hundreds of parents across Wales will sympathise with the sentiment. The primary, Ysgol Gynradd Mynyddygarreg, which has 38 pupils, is one of a string of village and town schools threatened with closure. Other high-profile campaigns include the fight over the fate of a 10-pupil school in Abersoch, north Wales, where many blame falling numbers on the large percentage of homes turned into holiday lets and retreats. A consultation for another school, Ysgol Talwrn, which has 40 pupils, on the island of Anglesey is also under way. Parents and campaigners argue that the loss of village schools can have devastating consequences for communities and harm the growth of the Welsh language. Many are calling for all consultations to be halted until the pandemic is over.
“For us it is the centre of village life,” said Young, who herself attended the school in Mynyddygarreg, “There is such a warmth about the school. After school everyone goes to the park. The older children look after the younger ones. My son cried when I explained what is happening. It’s such an important part of the community. The rugby club, chapel and groups and clubs use it. We’d be lost without it.” The school has two classrooms, two teachers, two support staff and a shared headteacher. In its consultation document, Carmarthenshire county council accepts pupil numbers are stable but says the condition of its building is poor and modernising it could not be justified. It proposes shutting the school and moving children to a new larger school in the nearby town of Kidwelly. The consultation was launched on 11 January – after the Welsh lockdown began – and ends on 21 February, before the school will have reopened.
Sarah Davies, who has two children at the school, said: “I’ve had three members of my family in hospital with Covid. I’m also working from home and home-schooling the children. I’m spinning plates and it’s starting to affect my mental health. When I tried to speak to the children about the consultation they were completely unconsolable. They’re terrified about what is going to happen.” The school faced closure in the 2000s but was kept open by a high-profile campaign spearheaded by the late Welsh rugby player Ray Gravell, its most famous former pupil. Sue Woodward, the chair of governors, said she thought the rationalisation plan was a false economy. “When you lose such an important community amenity you lose such a lot. I don’t think the council is taking that into account.” Pupils at the school are taught in Welsh and Woodward said there was a danger some parents might send children to English-medium schools instead. Ffred Ffransis, a prominent member of the pressure group Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg – the Welsh Language Society – said: “ If they lost the school in the village, current or future parents could opt for English-medium education. And the village would lose its focus for Welsh-language activities. “Closing a school does not kill off a community immediately – but is a suspended death sentence.” Carmarthenshire council said it could not comment while the consultation was taking place but was following Welsh government guidelines. A Welsh government spokesperson said, “Local authorities are responsible for planning school places and they must ensure that there are sufficient schools providing primary and secondary education in their area. Local authorities are able to undertake consultations during the pandemic and should take all steps possible to engage with communities.”"
2021-01-31T12:56:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Asylum seekers tell of dire conditions at Kent barracks after fire,"Asylum seekers at a former army barracks have said they have been left without electricity, heating and drinking water since a fire broke out on Friday, while volunteers say they have been blocked from providing donations. The fire started in one of the blocks at the Napier barracks site near Folkestone in Kent on Friday afternoon, prompting panic among the hundreds of asylum seekers housed inside. Fourteen men have been arrested in connection with the fire, which Kent police say they believe was started deliberately. One of the men has been charged with assault. Since Friday, heating and electricity in all but one of the blocks has been off, according to multiple asylum seekers and volunteers who contacted the Guardian, leaving the men, many of whom have Covid-19, in freezing conditions. Drinking water supplies had not been replenished, forcing the men to drink non-potable water from the bathroom block taps, they said. The Home Office denied the allegations and said water and food had been provided throughout.
Charities have attempted to provide warm blankets and food to the men in the last 48 hours but say they were turned away by police officers and staff who are on the site, which is being treated as a crime scene. Kent police denied refusing donations and said staff on site were responsible for dealing with volunteers. It comes as the Red Cross calls on the government to remove all asylum seekers from former barracks unless it can immediately address the unsafe and unsanitary conditions the men are being held in. One asylum seeker at Napier barracks told the Guardian: “Since a few distressed people lost control and made a wrong choice to set one block on fire, there has been no electricity, hot water or drinkable water. It’s extremely dark and cold at nights. People can’t take a shower and we have to drink water from the toilet tap. The staff have gone except security guards and police. “We don’t know what all of us have done that we’re being punished like this. There are sick people here and they also have to sleep in darkness with no heating. Why should the actions of a few affect all of us?” The Red Cross, the largest independent provider of support to people seeking asylum and refugees in the UK, interviewed 101 asylum seekers held at Penally barracks in Wales for a report into conditions and makes 22 recommendations for change. The confidential report, intended to advise the government, states that barracks accommodation can never be an appropriate form of housing for people claiming asylum, because “the majority of people seeking asylum have lived in adverse and insecure conditions, often for prolonged periods. Many people have been held against their will in prisons and other military buildings. Many have experienced abuse, violence and/or torture on these sites.” The report identifies many specific concerns about life for asylum seekers in the barracks including one person making 11 requests for medical assistance before some was given and another waiting in pain for 20 days before being seen by a doctor. Almost half – 44% – said they felt unsafe at the barracks, while some received death threats and were racially and verbally abused by rightwing protestors. The report finds that some of food was served raw leading to food poisoning. “We call for urgent and immediate changes to take place starting with the closure of all sites in either Ministry of Defence bases or immigration detention estates. We do not call for this lightly,” the report states.
At least 120 men at Napier barracks have tested positive for coronavirus this month, prompting panic among residents, some of whom took to sleeping outside in sub-zero temperatures for fear of infection. The Home Office has transferred some men to hotels in the south-east of England to ease pressure on the site and to allow for easier self-isolation. A total of 14 people have so far been arrested following the fire and one man has been charged, police announced on Sunday. Mohammed Ali, 31, has been charged with assault by beating, using or threatening unlawful violence and criminal damage. A spokesperson from Care4Calais, which assists the men on the site, said: “The residents have now been without heating for over two days and the camp is freezing cold. Many people are very sick with Covid and there is no doctor on site. Last night our volunteers took blankets to the site following pleas from the men but these were refused at the gate. “It is essential that steps are taken to urgently review management of the site and provide appropriate care for those who are trapped inside.” On Friday the remaining men received communications from Clearsprings, the private contractor that runs the site on behalf of the Home Office, informing them they would be moved to other blocks to allow for “further deep cleaning” and to help control the spread of Covid-19. Charities and volunteers said the correspondence left the men distressed as many were hoping to leave the site, where most have been held for four months. The Home Office said power was lost due to the fire but had been restored to most of the site and electricians continued to work on it. A spokesperson said: “The Home Office is meeting all its statutory duties to accommodate asylum seekers. The Napier barracks site is safe and secure and we are working with our provider to repair the damage that has been done. Food and drink had been available to service users throughout. “There are formal investigations taking place and the police have made arrests.”"
2021-01-31T06:45:30Z,uk-news,UK news,"Muslim boy, 4, was referred to Prevent over game of Fortnite","A four-year-old boy’s referral to the government’s anti-extremism Prevent strategy after talking about the popular Fortnite video game at his after-school club has prompted fresh calls to abolish the controversial scheme. The boy, who is from the West Midlands and is a Muslim, was referred to Prevent in September 2019 after saying that his father had “guns and bombs in his shed”. However, transcripts of a conversation with a club worker reveal that the reference to weaponry was linked to Fortnite. The child’s mother believes that if her boy were white and not a Muslim he wouldn’t have been considered at risk of radicalisation. In the first (anonymous) interview from a parent of an under-six referred to Prevent, she described her upset at police turning up at the family home at 10.30pm. “It could have gone really wrong. I worry armed police could have come to my house and, you know, arrested the parents, with social services getting involved.” Although the mother says she was told by an after-school care worker that the case had been referred to Prevent, police sources state that the matter was ultimately never recorded as a counter terrorism issue and not entered into the de-radicalisation programme’s database. The case has amplified disquiet over the scheme, which has been labelled anti-Muslim and called discriminatory and divisive. Last week, the anti-extremism strategy was criticised again after the appointment of William Shawcross, a former head of the Charity Commission, to lead the ailing review of Prevent that was announced two years ago this month. He has made a number of contentious comments about Islam. Almost 10 years ago, when he was director of neoconservative thinktank the Henry Jackson Society, he said: “Europe and Islam is one of the greatest, most terrifying problems of our future.” Meanwhile, figures obtained under freedom of information laws by the Observer reveal that the four-year-old is one of 624 under-sixes referred to Prevent between 2016 and 2019 . During the same period, 1,405 children between the ages of six and nine were also referred to the scheme. The scale of referrals is linked to the obligation on public bodies, including nurseries and schools, to report concerns about radicalisation, which in itself had provoked fears that the scheme had become too intrusive.
The case will raise fresh questions over why the government’s review has yet to fully start. Following the four-year-old’s referral, it was soon established that he had been at his father’s house the previous night, where his cousin was playing Fortnite, which has more than 350 million registered players and involves characters collecting guns and bombs. After making the Fortnite comment, he told a worker at the care club about his cousin playing the game. “The office sent me all the information, including the transcript of that conversation. It’s quite clear he mentioned Fortnite,” said his mother. “He’s just a little boy with an imagination. The teachers should know in this setting that [children] have imagination. They know exactly what kids are like, and what young boys are like. I do think that if it was a white boy, they wouldn’t have actually gone to that extreme of referring him to the Prevent scheme.” Latest Home Office figures reveal that the largest number of referrals related to far-right extremism. The police officer who turned up at the boy’s house appeared, according to the mother, uneasy but explained he had to “follow the Prevent flowchart”. She added: “But he was in the same place as me really. You know: ‘Why have they done this?’. He said if they had any major concerns, they wouldn’t have sent him by himself.” Referrals thought to pose a real risk are escalated to the Channel programme, which involves counter-terrorism police. Between 2017 and 2019, only 42 of the under-sixes referred to Prevent were moved on to Channel. “Prevent gives a bad image of Islam. For people who don’t really know much about Islam and Muslims, they just believe what they hear in the media, it is all very negative,” said the mother. A spokesman for counter terrorism policing said: “The public would rightly expect public service workers to act upon legitimate concerns that a child may have seen firearms or bombs at their home, and that is what happened in this case. “A local frontline police officer spoke to the child’s mother and quickly realised that this was a report made with good intent but that no further action was required, and the incident was therefore closed. “This was never recorded as a counter terrorism case or dealt with by counter terrorism policing. Prevent referrals are only made when it is proportionate to do so, and on this occasion it wasn’t, so none was recorded. “Although a Prevent referral was not appropriate in this case, radicalisation is a real concern affecting thousands of young people all over the UK.” Layla Aitlhadj, director at the community outreach project Prevent Watch, said: “It’s difficult to fully appreciate the impact this experience can have on a family.” She said that rather than Shawcross’s review pressing ahead, her group wanted the scheme to be abolished. A spokesperson for the Muslim Council of Britain, said: “These latest figures and the example of the four-year-old Muslim boy reaffirm our view that Prevent is a flawed policy, presenting fundamental issues that must be subjected to a robust and truly independent review. ”Rosalind Comyn, Liberty policy and campaigns manager, said: “We should all be free to express ourselves and go about our daily lives without being monitored for what we think or believe – and to grow up in a society where we feel safe to express our thoughts and opinions. “That’s why it’s so worrying that hundreds of children barely old enough to tie their own shoelaces are being profiled as potential future criminals based on things like the video games they play or the perceived views of their families.” The counter terrorism policing spokesperson also cited a new website to help parents, friends and family understand more about Prevent, and how to find help if they’re worried about someone. Commenting on the Prevent policy, not the case, a Home Office spokesperson said: “Where someone is concerned a child may have been deliberately exposed to harmful terrorist narratives, it is right that they refer them to the necessary authorities. Prevent is first and foremost about safeguarding, and through this referral, the child will be able to receive the vital support they need.” • This article was amended on 5 February 2021 to include a statement from counter terrorism police that the incident was not dealt with by counter terrorism officers or recorded as a counter terrorism case."
2021-01-30T19:43:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Body of baby boy found on golf course in Wirral,"Police have launched an investigation into the “unexplained” death of a baby whose body has been discovered at a golf course. The body of the baby boy was found on Friday in a wooded area at Brackenwood golf course in Bebington, Wirral, Merseyside police said. Extensive inquiries into the whereabouts of the baby’s mother to check her welfare and offer any support, as well as an extensive search of the area by specialist officers, are under way. A postmortem examination is due to take place on Monday. The cause of death, when the baby died and how long the body had been there was still unclear, a force spokesman said. “I would ask anyone who has any information which could assist us with that to contact us as a matter of urgency,” DCS Lee Turner said. “This is obviously a very distressing incident but I want the public to be reassured that we will do everything in our powers to investigate what has taken place. I would ask that people avoid speculating about what has happened until the full facts are known. “At this stage, all we can say is that the body of what appears to be a full-term baby boy was discovered in a wooded area on the golf course yesterday and police were alerted.” Anyone with information should call police on 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
2021-01-30T14:16:27Z,uk-news,UK news,Arrest of photographer at Kent protest raises press freedom fears,"Concern is growing over press freedom following the arrest of a photographer after he took and shared photos of a protest at a former military barracks controversially housing asylum seekers. Andy Aitchison, 46, documented a demonstration outside Napier barracks in Folkestone, Kent, on Thursday morning as protesters threw buckets of fake blood at the doors of the site amid allegations of overcrowding, poor hygiene, significant risks posed by Covid-19, and limited access to healthcare and legal advice. Aitchison spent several minutes covering the brief protest, during which signs were held saying: “Close Napier now” and: “There will be blood on your hands” after at least 120 men at the barracks tested positive for Covid this month. Five police officers arrived at Aitchison’s nearby home six hours later and arrested him on suspicion of criminal damage, in front of his children. In an interview with the Guardian, he said: “I really feel like they’re trying to clamp down on the freedom of the press. The government is cracking down on people who are saying things they don’t want them to say, and that’s not right.” Aitchison’s photos were used in a number of press reports, as well as the Guardian’s photographs of the day. The freelancer who shoots for Getty and regularly has his pictures published by national media, was taken to a police station and remained in a cell for almost seven hours after having his fingerprints and DNA taken. Officers gave him a detective thriller as well as golf, fishing and motorbike magazines to keep him occupied. He said he had told the police in his interview: “I’m a photographer. This is what I do for work. These pictures have already been published and I will be paid for them.”
Remarking on the seemingly bizarre nature of the situation, he added: “From the start I just thought, what’s going on? I was there for work and haven’t committed criminal damage.” Pamela Morton, the National Union of Journalists national freelance organiser, said the union was “extremely concerned” at Aitchison’s arrest. “Andrew was present solely as a journalist and took no part in the protest,” she told the Independent, which first reported the news. “News gatherers are key workers and it is their role and duty to report on matters of public interest. The police should not be seeking to interfere, prevent or restrict what journalists record in this way.” Ian Murray, executive director of the Society of Editors, told the Guardian: “This is very concerning. We are constantly told journalists, including press photographers, are an essential part of our democratic system in this country and a free media is to be protected. “But words are not enough. It is actions that count and arresting press photographers is not something that should be happening in a liberal democracy.” The protest came before a fire at the former military barracks on Friday, which the home secretary, Priti Patel, suggested was set deliberately. Kent police have launched an arson investigation. Under the terms of Aitchison’s bail, he is not allowed to go near Napier barracks. He said he was frustrated at not being able to document the fire and events afterwards but respected the conditions to avoid further arrest. “It feels like if you’re photographing someone doing something wrong, rather than doing something about it they’ve tried to shut it down,” he said. Kent police said they were called following a report of a protest in Shorncliffe, Folkestone, at around 8am on 28 January. “Officers attended and a 36-year-old man from the Dover area was arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage,” a spokesperson said. “Further inquiries led to the arrest of a second man, aged 46, in Folkestone at around 3pm the same day. Both men have been released on bail until 22 February.” The force said the blaze caused a significant amount of damage to at least one part of the site, where hundreds of asylum seekers have been living. Five men have been arrested following the fire. A 31-year-old was arrested on suspicion of assaulting a security guard on Friday evening, the force said. A further four men were arrested in connection with the incident the following morning. Patel said on Friday: “The damage and destruction at Napier barracks is not only appalling but deeply offensive to the taxpayers of this country who are providing this accommodation while asylum claims are being processed. “This type of action will not be tolerated and the Home Office will support the police to take robust action against those vandalising property, threatening staff and putting lives at risk.”"
2021-01-30T13:49:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Titanic: plan scrapped to retrieve radio that sent distress calls as ship sank,"The coronavirus pandemic has sunk plans to plans to retrieve and exhibit the Titanic’s radio equipment, according to a court filing made by the firm that own’s the historic wreck’s salvage rights. RMS Titanic Inc cited the “increasing difficulty associated with international travel and logistics, and the associated health risks to the expedition team”. It also it had to lay off high-profile experts in the Titanic field: Dave Gallo, PH Nargeolet, Bill Sauder and William Lange. The Atlanta-based company also said that it’s gone nearly a year without its primary source of revenue after virus restrictions closed exhibits of its vast collection of Titanic artifacts. Only some of the exhibitions, which are scattered across the country, have reopened. But they’re seeing limited attendance. The company, however, maintained that it’s financially secure. The firm said the radio expedition remains a top priority and will “take place as soon as reasonably practicable”. The company has argued that exhibiting the radio will help sustain the ship’s legacy while honoring passengers and crew. Known in 1912 as a Marconi wireless telegraph machine, the radio sent distress calls to nearby ships that helped save 700 people in lifeboats. But even without the pandemic, the expedition has been far from guaranteed. The firm has been in an ongoing court battle with the US government over whether the undertaking is legal. Lawyers for the US government have argued that the mission is barred under federal law and an international agreement with Britain. The attorneys say the company must seek the government’s permission to remove the radio because the sunken vessel is a recognized memorial to the roughly 1,500 people who died. The luxury ocean liner was traveling from England to New York in 1912 when it struck an iceberg and sank. It was discovered in 1985 about 2.4 miles (3.8km) below the surface of the North Atlantic."
2021-01-30T12:19:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Man held on suspicion of racially abusing West Brom player,"Police have arrested a man suspected of racially abusing West Bromwich Albion footballer Romaine Sawyers on social media. West Midlands police said a 49-year-old man from Kingswinford, near Birmingham, was questioned in custody on Friday evening. The force’s football hate crime officer is also investigating reports of another racist comment towards the Saint Kitts and Nevis international. West Brom contacted police after Sawyers, 29, was sent a racist message during Tuesday’s 5-0 defeat to Manchester City. A club statement said: “Albion will offer Romaine the relevant support required at this time and continues with its long-standing commitment to help rid football of racism.” The Albion boss, Sam Allardyce, also offered his support to the midfielder and questioned what could be done to stop online abuse. He said: “It leaves a big question about whether reporting it is enough. Romaine – or any black person across the country – should not have to be open to any type of abuse on social media. “He is extremely upset, as anybody would be. More than Romaine have suffered throughout football in the last few days. “Social media sites need to act in a more responsible way. We have to do our best to cut this out.” On Monday, the government held talks with current and former footballers about tackling discrimination and abuse. The government plans to introduce new laws on online abuse this year and the Premier League has launched its own online abuse reporting system. In a separate incident, the Manchester United players Axel Tuanzebe and Anthony Martial were racially abused on social media after Wednesday’s 2-1 home defeat by Sheffield United. No arrests have been made in connection with the incident. A spokesperson for Facebook, which also owns Instagram, said on Friday: “There is no place for racism on Instagram and we are committed to removing it when we find it. “We know there is more to do and we will continue to work closely with clubs, players and football authorities to investigate instances of discrimination and collectively tackle this issue.” Twitter also released a statement, saying: “Racist behaviour has no place on our service and when we identify accounts that violate any of the Twitter rules, we take enforcement action. “We have proactively engaged and continue to collaborate with our valued partners in football to identify ways to tackle this issue collectively and will continue to play our part in curbing this unacceptable behaviour – both online and offline.”"
2021-01-29T21:52:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Explainer: what is article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol?,"Under Brexit’s Northern Ireland protocol, all products are normally permitted to be exported from the EU to Northern Ireland without checks, as NI remains in the single market for goods and continues to operate under EU custom rules. The protocol was a resolution to the sticky Irish border question and was designed to avoid a return of checkpoints along the politically sensitive frontier and minimise potential disruption of cross-border trade. However, amid a row over vaccine delivery shortfalls, the EU has invoked article 16 of the NI protocol which allows the EU or UK to unilaterally suspend aspects of its operations if either side considers that aspect to be causing “economic, societal or environmental difficulties”.
The mechanism, which was created as a temporary measure, is only supposed to be triggered in the face of “serious” problems, but there is no definition of what “serious” entails. If one side triggers article 16, the other side is open to take rebalancing action in response. The move is seen as part of the EU’s efforts to place controls on the export of Covid vaccines amid its escalating row with AstraZeneca over its supply contract. From a UK context, the NI protocol could present a back door for exporters to circumvent those controls and move vaccines into the UK unchecked, as trade from the EU into NI – as well as trade from NI to GB – is unrestricted under the protocol. Triggering article 16 in respect of the movement of the vaccines closes that back door."
2021-01-29T18:25:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Priti Patel suggests fire at Kent asylum seeker site started deliberately,"The home secretary, Priti Patel, has suggested that a fire at a former military barracks used to house asylum seekers was set deliberately as she comes under mounting pressure to shut the site. Images posted online showed thick smoke billowing from one of the blocks at Napier barracks near Folkestone. The facility has the capacity to hold 400 people but in recent days some have been transferred to hotels after a Covid-19 outbreak. Kent fire and rescue service said eight fire engines had been sent to the barracks to deal with the blaze, and advised people living and working in the surrounding area to close their windows and doors as a precaution against smoke. Kent police said there were no reported injuries and “enquiries remain ongoing to determine the cause of the fire and establish whether any offences have been committed”.
But pre-empting the conclusion of any police investigation, Patel said in a statement: “The damage and destruction at Napier barracks is not only appalling but deeply offensive to the taxpayers of this country who are providing this accommodation while asylum claims are being processed. “This type of action will not be tolerated and the Home Office will support the police to take robust action against those vandalising property, threatening staff and putting lives at risk. This site has previously accommodated our brave soldiers and army personnel – it is an insult to say that it is not good enough for these individuals.” Military personnel have not been accommodated on the site for years. Clare Mosley, founder of Care4Calais, said: “For a British home secretary to accuse and castigate ordinary people when the facts of this incident are not yet even known is shocking and disturbing. It shows a senior government minister operating at the gutter level of gossip and hearsay, and at a time of heightened anxiety and tension across society, she should be ashamed of herself. “But make no mistake, this not simply a careless, off-the-cuff emotional response. It is a misleading, opportunistic smoke screen concocted to deflect attention from the multiple warnings she has had about what was clearly going to happen at Napier barracks.” Earlier on Friday, several organisations including Freedom from Torture, Choose Love/Help Refugees, Detention Action, Doctors of the World and Helen Bamber Foundation wrote to the home secretary urging her to close the barracks. Thousands of people signed a petition urging Patel to shut the site, which has been dogged by allegations of overcrowding, poor hygiene, significant risks posed by Covid-19, limited access to healthcare and legal advice, and cover-ups. At least 120 men at the barracks have tested positive for coronavirus this month, prompting panic among residents, some of whom took to sleeping outside in sub-zero temperatures for fear of infection. There are 16 blocks in the camp, most of which hold up to 28 people. The blocks have two toilets and showers and the men eat together in a communal canteen. One asylum seeker at the site said: “Some of us are really scared. The roof is on fire and parts of it fell down. The firefighters arrived at the camp. They turned off all the electricity here and some of us are really frightened. Everything is out of control. People are watching the block burning. “The security guards, the staff and the camp managers escaped. Now we are all in the camp without the staff, without anyone else.” On Friday the men received communications from Clearsprings, the private contractor that runs the site on behalf of the Home Office, informing them they would be moved to other blocks to allow “further deep cleaning” and to help control the spread of Covid-19. The correspondence said there were still men on the site with Covid-19 and they must continue to stay there. Until the recent outbreak, the men had been able to come and go from the barracks. The men were told that once moved to a new block they would be in a new “bubble” and must not mix with people outside their designated bubble. Several protests have taken place over the conditions and lack of communication from authorities over the length of the men’s stay. Many claim they were told they would be there for no more than a month and have now been there for four months."
2021-01-29T17:18:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Stansted deportation flight protesters have convictions quashed,"Fifteen anti-deportation activists who were prosecuted under counter-terror legislation for blocking the takeoff of an immigration removal flight from Stansted airport have had their convictions quashed. In a judgment handed down by the court of appeal on Friday afternoon, the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, said: “The appellants should not have been prosecuted for the extremely serious offence under section 1(2)(b) of the 1990 Act because their conduct did not satisfy the various elements of the offence. “There was, in truth, no case to answer.”
The ruling came more than two years after the 15 protesters were convicted following a nine-week trial of endangering the safety of an aerodrome, an offence under the 1990 Aviation and Maritime Security Act that carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. It was the first time the terror-related offence, passed in 1990 in response to the Lockerbie bombing, had been used against peaceful protesters. The defendants said they were relieved by the decision. May MacKeith, 35, said that the time from their arrest in 2017 to Friday’s ruling put into perspective the experiences of people caught in the UK’s hostile environment immigration system. “It was frightening,” she said. “But all along, despite the draconian charge, we knew that our actions were justified. We’ve never doubted that the people on that plane should never have been treated that way by our government.” Of those due to be deported on the flight, 11 were still in the UK, with three granted leave to remain. In their appeal, lawyers for the defence argued the legislation used to convict the group was not only rarely used but also was not intended for the kinds of peaceful actions undertaken by their clients. They said the prosecution stretched the meaning of the law by characterising the lock-on equipment they used to blockade the runway as devices used to endanger life. Weighing the argument, Burnett said in his judgment: “The closure of the runway was undoubtedly disruptive and expensive, but there was no evidence that it resulted in likely endangerment to the safety of the aerodrome or of persons there. “The [deployment] of an unspecified number of police officers when the terrorist threat was severe may have increased the risks within the terminal, but there was no evidence to enable an inference to be drawn that endangerment was likely. “There may have been a slightly enhanced risk of a police officer slipping en route to the aircraft, but it would stretch both language and common sense to say that there was likely endangerment, both in terms of the probability of this happening and the seriousness of the consequences if it did happen.” Burnett added: “Both the crown’s case and the summing-up collapsed the distinction between risk and likely danger and treated the offence as if it were akin to a health and safety provision.” The defendants, all members of the group Stop Deportations, had taken part in a peaceful action that stopped a chartered deportation flight to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone from taking off on 28 March 2017. Members of the group cut a hole in the airport’s perimeter fence before rushing on to the apron at Stansted. Four protesters arranged themselves around the front landing gear of the aircraft, locking their arms together inside double-layered pipes filled with expanding foam. Further back, a second group of protesters erected a 2-metre tripod from scaffolding poles behind the engine on the left wing. One of them perched on top of the makeshift structure, while others locked themselves to the base to prevent it from being moved. In the moments before police arrived they were able to display banners, including one that said: “No one is illegal.” Although members of the group received suspended sentences or community orders, UN human rights experts wrote to the UK government expressing concern over the application of “security and terrorism-related legislation to prosecute peaceful political protesters and critics of state policy”. On Friday, rights groups including Amnesty International and Liberty welcomed the ruling. But Raj Chada of Hodge Jones & Allen, who represented the defendants, said questions remained as to why the then attorney general, Jeremy Wright, had authorised the use of the charge in the first place. He said: “It does make me uncomfortable that a British cabinet minister has authorised a terror charge against political opponents, that the lord chief justice has decided is completely inappropriate. The appellants should be told, why was this charge used in this way? What information did the attorney general have?”"
2021-01-29T15:36:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Welsh woman marks 110th birthday with viral TikTok fame,"She is the oldest person in Wales and now she may be the oldest person on TikTok. Amy Hawkins has become a star of the social networking site after her great-grandson posted a video of her singing on her 110th birthday. The former dancer made her debut on the site earlier this week singing the music hall song It’s a Long Way to Tipperary and her family have posted several videos since, including one in which she performs a dance with her 14-year-old great-grandson Sacha Freeman. Hawkins said on Friday the experience had “brought us all together” as views of the videos continued to rise. “I suppose it’s nice,” she said of her newfound fame, adding she was struggling with her hearing despite being “only 110”. Four generations of her family live together in their home in Monmouthshire, in south Wales, and Hawkins’s daughter, Rosemary Morris, said she was glad they could be close by during the Covid-19 pandemic. Morris said: “I can’t imagine how awful it must be for old people on their own without anybody to come to or hug. It just doesn’t bear thinking about, to be honest.” She said the family had always had a close relationship. “And I think that’s really why Sacha did it because he knows a lot of his friends in school aren’t seeing their grandparents. He doesn’t even see them any more because there’s nobody in school.” Sacha worked behind the scenes of his great-grandmother’s fame and also appears in one video. Morris said: “He decided it would be a good idea to put grandma on the TikTok to share her with everybody else, basically. She was a dancer back when she was 14, which was an awful long time ago. She does not quite understand what TikTok is but she does the internet. But I suppose it is a lot to cognise at 110. “She is aware of [the success] and she understands to a certain extent. She takes it in her stride really. She is not terribly fazed. She has always been very quiet and shy and retiring. She is not flamboyant in any way, shape or form.” Hawkins turned 110 on Sunday and celebrated surrounded by her family. She was born Amy Evans in Cardiff on 24 January 1911, but spent most of her childhood in nearby Newport. She had five brothers and a sister, Lillian, who is 101. In her youth, she was a dancer and toured with a dance troupe. In 1937, she married George Hawkins, a sign-writer, and they lived in Newport. During the second world war, Amy Hawkins served as a fire-watcher for her local neighbourhood, meaning she was responsible for keeping an eye out for fires lit by Axis bombs. In an interview with the South Wales Argus to mark her 110th birthday, Hawkins was asked if it was more than just coincidence that she and her sister had lived past 100. She joked that it was because they “never go to the doctors”."
2021-01-29T15:17:44Z,uk-news,UK news,"Scotland's draft budget fails to tackle challenge of Covid, say critics","The Scottish government’s draft budget “bakes in inequality”, according to campaigners and opposition parties who say the measures announced on Thursday fail to use available powers to meet the economic challenges of Covid. With no change to income tax rates and a council tax freeze, both of which benefit wealthier households, unions described the public sector pay offer as “a slap in the face” for those who had worked on the frontline through the pandemic. Setting out her draft budget to MSPs on Thursday afternoon, Scotland’s finance secretary, Kate Forbes, said she would mitigate the UK government’s “ill-judged” public sector pay freeze, announcing a 3% increase for those on salaries up to £25,000, and a 1% increase for those on higher incomes. While Forbes defended the move as “progressive” on Friday morning, GMB Scotland estimated the 3% rise “won’t amount to more than a tenner a week for most”, while the STUC said it meant a real-terms pay freeze for thousands of public sector workers earning above £25,000 a year, including most teaching staff, firefighters and civil servants.
Peter Kelly, the chief executive of the Poverty Alliance, said: “In the midst of a rising tide of poverty across Scotland, yesterday’s budget should have signalled a drive toward economic and social renewal. It contained some very welcome actions like the landmark Scottish Child Payment, but ultimately failed to meet the scale of the challenge that is facing our communities”. He argued that unfreezing the higher-rate tax threshold would result in lost tax revenue that could have put cash into lower-income families’ pockets. Scottish Labour’s interim leader, Jackie Baillie, said: “The SNP said that this budget would be the most important in the history of devolution, but all we got on Thursday was baked in inequality. No matter how big the crisis and how deep the inequality, the SNP will continue to plough on with unfair tax policy and pay freezes which benefit the wealthy to the detriment of the vast majority of working people.” The co-leader of the Scottish Greens Patrick Harvie – whose support the SNP minority government has relied on pass previous budgets – said the draft budget was “not as green or progressive as is needed to provide a fair and green recovery from the pandemic”. “Of the already announced five-year spending on things like green jobs and energy efficiency, this year’s allocation seems short, while again the government seems unwilling to use the tax levers it has to rebalance the economy and tackle poverty.” Forbes told MSPs on Thursday it was a time for “stability, certainty and targeted support”, pledging an “exceptional response” to the pandemic, with extra funding for the NHS, local government and to promote jobs and skills."
2021-01-29T13:00:01Z,uk-news,UK news,The reckoning: the toppling of monuments to slavery in the UK,"The toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol was a bittersweet moment for 23-year-old Nasra Ayub. The community activist, who has always called the city home, remembers the long-standing campaigns to remove iconography of Colston in schools, public buildings and spaces. She graduated from the University of Bristol feeling disheartened by how little movement there was to remove tributes to those involved with slavery.
Then the Colston statue fell during last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests, and institutions and the local council finally acted.
The University of Bristol announced a review of buildings linked with slavers, and investigated its own crest; Bristol Cathedral and St Mary Redcliffe church removed stained glass windows of Colston; the Colston statue at Colston’s girls’ school was removed and the school was renamed Montpelier high school; the Colston Tower was renamed Beacon Tower; and Colston Hall was renamed Bristol Beacon. It wasn’t just Bristol that experienced an unprecedented public reckoning with monuments to slavers and colonialists. Guardian analysis suggests that across the UK about 70 tributes have been removed or are in the process of being removed. “It’s taken a long time; it took people risking their lives and risking criminal status in order for this to happen when it didn’t need to,” Ayub said. While she is pleased how quickly things have changed in the city, she said: “It proves that everyone has been sitting on their hands.” In Birmingham, the city council said it was reviewing the “appropriateness of local monuments and statues” on land under council control. In December, the council announced six new names, including Respect Way, Humanity Close and Inspire Avenue, to better reflect the community.
Nikhwat Marawat, the co-founder of The Delicate Mind in Birmingham, a community organisation that works with the Muslim diaspora to reshape perspectives on mental illnesses, believes without proper historical interrogation, the removal of statues will feed into a “culture war”. “There are people on the left and the right who will want to solidify their position,” he said. “You need to meet in the middle. You need to have this dialogue, and lexicon of understanding, to know why this history took place and look into how we can bring people together.” Residing in Birmingham for most of his life, Marawat, 28, only recently understood how slavery had shaped his home: “Whenever I saw these names like James Watt and Matthew Boulton, I didn’t know about the long-term effects that they’d had on people who were slaves, or colonisation. “As you’re growing up, I think a lot of British history isn’t well interrogated in the curriculum, so we’re not really taught about the good and the bad that has happened in our country.”
He notes British identity has evolved into a “constant state of flux”, citing how British rule in India led to a steady migration of many classes of south Asians to Britain in the 17th century: “You have to interrogate and look at your history properly.” But Marawat disagrees with comments on “censorship” made by Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, in relation to the removal of statues. “It’s complete nonsense to say you’re being censored because you are writing in a national newspaper, you’re a member of parliament, you have media opportunities. So don’t talk to me about being censored. It’s just a complete fallacy.” Two days after the Colston statue was brought down, a statue of Robert Milligan was removed from the Docklands in east London. A couple of days later, the University of East London, where 49-year-old Kellie Golbourne is a full-time student, removed a statue of Sir John Cass. The university later announced it was also renaming the Cass School of Education and Communities.
“For me, this is about change. Something that you think was a permanent fixture has had some movement, and that makes me feel that more can be moved,” Golbourne said. Golbourne, who grew up in Bristol and has lived in east London for 20 years, remembers performing at Colston Hall as a little girl and seeing his name everywhere. Despite this, “Colston never came up in my history teaching. I would have never known and I didn’t know who Colston was until the statue came down.” The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, quickly announced a city-wide review of all landmarks associated with slavery or colonialism after Colston fell, while many Labour-led boroughs also announced reviews and consultations. Ayub said anti-racism must not end with the toppling of statues. She welcomed organisations announcing plans to address structural inequalities, but said there was still a long way to go before the UK was a more equal society. She added that the protests, and the movement they sparked, spoke to “the power of protests”. “People try to tell me what’s the point of protesting? What’s the point of taking direct action? Well, here you go.” • This article was amended on 1 February 2021 to correct the spelling of Matthew Boulton’s surname."
2021-01-29T12:13:59Z,uk-news,UK news,Family wins lawsuit against NHS trust over womanâ€™s decomposed body,"The family of a woman whom they suspect was killed has won a lawsuit against a health trust that allowed her body to decompose to the point that experts were unable to rule out third-party involvement in the death in a first-of-its kind ruling. In a judgment handed down on Friday, Judge Andrew Saffman concluded that Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS trust had breached human rights laws by failing to preserve Emily Whelan’s body, and awarded the family damages. Matthew Gold, the solicitor for the Whelan family, said it was the first time a court had ruled a hospital had a legal obligation to ensure a body did not badly decompose to prevent a breach of article 8 of the European convention on human rights, the right to respect for private and family life. Six members of Whelan’s family, including her mother and siblings, said the experience had a devastating impact on their mental health, leading to post-traumatic stress. Speaking after the ruling, Whelan’s mother, Caramella Brennan, said: “The Leeds NHS trust has failed to accept any responsibility for its role in this terrible incident and the impact it has had on us. The trust has fought the family right through the case. The family’s conviction in wanting to hold the hospital to account for its unacceptable conduct has been vindicated by the court. We could not have done more to respect our memories of Emily and the role she played in all our lives.” Whelan, 25, was found unresponsive in her bedroom in Leeds on 7 November 2016 and taken to Leeds general infirmary. Her family was told that Whelan, who had epilepsy, had experienced a seizure. She died in hospital the next day, with an initial cause of death given as a hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury – lack of oxygen to the brain – after a cardiac arrest. The underlying cause of the cardiac arrest was not determined. Whelan’s family immediately suspected foul play and told police they believed an individual known to her had questions to answer. After 10 months, a forensic postmortem was ordered. But when the pathologist came to examine the body, it had decomposed, hampering his ability to conduct a thorough investigation. A police investigation concluded there was no third-party involvement. Gold said: “To permit a body to so badly decompose that it becomes unrecognisable is not just morally repugnant it is now unlawful. The family’s long and hard fight against the Leeds NHS trust has been vindicated and will hopefully, as the judgment points out, result in mortuaries improving their practices to ensure that this does not happen again.” Whelan’s body was stored at the Leeds mortuary, managed by the trust, for a month before being transferred to Bradford. The court heard evidence that the body was already decomposed when it was received by the Bradford mortuary. The Leeds trust had denied this. A forensic postmortem instructed by the coroner was carried out by Dr MS Lyall on 11 October 2017, almost a year after she had died. Lyall said he “carefully considered” whether Whelan’s death could have been caused “by injuries inflicted by another person”. He said his examination of the body was “severely hampered by changes of decomposition”."
2021-01-29T12:04:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Former high court judge to take over Dawn Sturgess inquest,"The retired high court judge Lady Heather Hallett is to take over the inquest of Dawn Sturgess, who died in the Wiltshire novichok poisonings, the Guardian has learned. Hallett will preside over what will be a high-profile and politically sensitive hearing after Sturgess’s family successfully challenged the way a local coroner had planned to limit the scope of the inquest. Now a crossbench life peer, Hallett was a senior judge in the court of appeal and sat as a coroner at the inquests into the deaths of the 52 victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings. High court judges are occasionally assigned to particularly contentious inquests, notably Lord Justice Scott Baker, who conducted the Princess Diana inquest. It is understood a lawyer working alongside her will be Martin Smith, who is currently solicitor to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse and was involved in the Alexander Litvinenko inquest. Litvinenko was a former Russian spy who, according to a UK public inquiry, was probably murdered in London on the personal orders of Vladimir Putin. A pre-inquest review hearing will take place on 30 March where submissions will be heard by Hallett at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. There is no date for the full inquest. The former Russian spy Sergei Skripal was the target of the initial novichok attack in Salisbury on 4 March 2018. He, his daughter, Yulia, and a police officer, DS Nick Bailey, were poisoned but survived. In June 2018, Sturgess, a 44-year-old mother of three, and her partner, Charlie Rowley, were poisoned in Amesbury, eight miles north of Salisbury, after he found a fake perfume bottle containing novichok. Rowley recovered but Sturgess died on 8 July. The following year the senior Wiltshire and Swindon coroner, David Ridley, said as part of the inquest he would consider the actions of the Russians Anatoliy Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin. They were allegedly the agents on the ground, working under the aliases Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov respectively, who carried out the attack on Skripal. Ridley maintained Sturgess’s death was too remote from the attempted murder of Skripal to allow the scope of her inquest to widen to look at elements such as the possible role of Moscow. Sturgess’s family launched a judicial review, with their lawyers arguing it was “inconceivable” that Chepiga and Mishkin operated in “a bubble”, and claiming the operation must have been authorised by the Russian state – possibly right up to Putin. The legal team also said the bottle of nerve agent may have been deliberately left behind as part of a campaign to undermine security in the UK. After the two-day judicial review two high court judges quashed the coroner’s ruling, saying: “There is acute and obvious public concern not merely at the prima-facie evidence that an attempt was made on British soil by Russian agents to assassinate Mr Skripal and that it led to the death of Ms Sturgess, but also at the fact that it involved the use of a prohibited nerve agent exposing the population of Salisbury and Amesbury to lethal risk. “There has been, and (to be realistic) there will be, no criminal trial in which the details of how this appalling event came to occur can be publicly examined.” Their ruling was sent to the coroner in July last year. Since then there has been no public statements about the case. Sources with knowledge of the proceedings have told the Guardian that Hallett will oversee it. No date for the inquest has been revealed."
2021-01-29T11:19:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Digested week: not even Joe Biden can alleviate my printer rage | Emma Brockes,"Monday The first full week under President Biden and life undergoes an immediate improvement: save for a few pieces about plunging membership at Mar-a-Lago, there are almost no photos of Himself on the front pages. The daily anger spike is gone, leaving in its place a flat, sour, hungover feeling, and a sense of not knowing quite what to do. The answer, in my house, is to find other things to be angry about. I don’t mean the craven failure of the Republicans to back impeachment, or, from afar, the spectacle of Boris Johnson trying to look contrite. As ever, frustration and uncertainty work their way out via indirect means, and on Monday morning – as on every Monday morning – it comes down to my turbulent relationship with my printer. For years, these rage spirals came roughly once every few years on the unhappy occasion of my having to print out a manuscript. Then came the pandemic and with it the demands of remote learning. Now, at least once a week, I am left cursing at the machine while composing, in my head, a slim volume on anger management entitled What I Talk About When I Talk About Printers. Briefly: I dispensed with colour cartridges, got the tiny black-and-white laser jet everyone said would change my life and still it torments me – this week, by sucking printed pages back into the mechanism and printing new pages on top of them. “Jesus actual Christ,” I yell, with five minutes on the clock and half the day’s worksheets unprinted. “$20!” calls a child from the next room. Why can’t Elon Musk, rather than faffing about with unnecessary space travel, apply himself where he’s needed and do something about printers? Tuesday “Oh my God, have you seen Fauci?!” Everyone is saying it. The face of Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US and a man whose expressions have, over the last 12 months, held up a daily mirror to the torture of the Trump presidency, is suddenly everywhere, smiling. It’s like he’s doing a victory tour, talking about science, basking in the light of an administration not run by an idiot. For a moment, I permit myself the fantasy that Fauci and Biden can save us, before getting online for a live chat with my insurers and remembering where I am. The new president may defeat Covid but it seems unlikely he will solve the problem of American healthcare, something I think about while being told I am responsible for most of a $1,600 bill relating to a brief trip to hospital last summer. There is, he says, a $100 cap on outpatient visits; if I’d been admitted and run up more charges, my insurers would’ve met them. As it is, I’m on my own. “Also,” types the agent, “the hospital you visited was out of network, so we don’t cover 20%.”
This is the typifying experience of emergency medicine in the US: a trip via ambulance to an ER, prior to which you are supposed, somehow, to find out if the ER is in-network, and if not, to call back 911 and ask for a different provider. “Oh I see hahahahaha,” I type, hysteria rising, and in need of a human-to-human moment. “I’m having very unhappy thoughts about how healthcare works in this country, but of course, that’s not your fault.” “…” Wednesday With democracy restored, it’s time for some lighter reads on my nightstand. I’m ripping through Avid Reader, Robert Gottlieb’s memoir of publishing in its heyday in New York and it is divine; full of bitchy and luvvie-ish anecdotes about the great and the good of Gottlieb’s list at Knopf. Here is good old Lauren Bacall, who couldn’t get herself to write her memoir at home so Gottlieb lent her an office, to which she turned up, dutifully, each day to file like a pro. Here is the vileness of Roald Dahl, who in Gottlieb’s telling, was so disgusting to junior staff at Knopf that, after a particularly monstrous letter from Dahl detailing all sorts of unreasonable demands, Gottlieb called his bluff and invited him to walk (he did); ditto Salman Rushdie, who Gottlieb accuses of behaving “atrociously”, particularly during the fatwa. In amongst the stars there are untrustworthy agents, lifelong best friends and lots of summers with people who have houses in Italy.
There is a single thing I resent him for; it’s one thing to confirm my suspicions about Dahl or Rushdie, quite another to try to ruin Katharine Hepburn for me. The two came together to work on a book about the making of The African Queen, during which Hepburn was, writes Gottlieb, entirely professional. Observing her socially, however, he concludes she was vain, peevish, attention grabbing and prone to tantrums. One day, a mutual friend reports to Gottlieb that Hepburn has invited her to a dinner with Michael Jackson, which they both see as “just another symptom of Kate’s vulgar and pathetic desperation to stay up to date and in the limelight”. Imperious – OK; vain, it goes with the territory. But vulgar? Never! I won’t have it. Thursday I’m trying to organise an opinion about GameStop, but as I do every few years when a big investment story comes round, I just get depressed that I didn’t buy any stock. In this particular tale, it is hard to know who to root for, or rather, who to boo at; the evil hedge funds, left with multibillion-dollar exposures after plucky day traders drove up the stock price and foiled their short trades. Or, wait, should we hate the day traders for trolling the market into a state of volatility, which will end up hitting us all in the 401K?
I have no idea. There is one interesting aspect of this story, which is that the hatred of finance people in general and hedge funders in particular seems to have reached such a popular peak that it may finally start to impact recruitment. For decades, legions of smart graduates have been lured into finance, foregoing more traditionally high-status and socially useful careers. This year is different; with the pandemic raging, Fauci a national saviour, and doctors on the frontline rightly applauded as heroes, applications in the US for medical school – that formerly desirable profession lately perceived by ambitious 22-year-olds to be dowdy and underpaid – are way up. Friday It’s the kids’ second and final in-person day of the week at school, where, while art and music are suspended, PE rages on. It won’t get them into med school, but some lingering jock chauvinism makes me insist they enjoy PE, or at least not abjectly hate it. “Yay! It’s PE!” says one of my six-year-olds, conscientiously following the script. “Yay!” I say. “I love PE!” “Me too!” She looks at me slyly. “PE’s my favourite subject.” “OK, let’s not lose our heads.”

2021-01-28T23:30:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Study reveals depth of BAME health inequality in England,"The health impact of belonging to some ethnic minority groups is equivalent to being 20 years older than your actual age, England’s largest ever study of health inequalities in BAME communities has found. Not only are people from these groups often poorer and more likely to suffer from underlying health conditions, they are also more likely to report worse treatment when visiting their GP surgery, and insufficient support from local services, such as housing and social care. The study, which surveyed almost 1.4 million adults aged over 55, provides fresh insights into why people of black and south Asian ethnic backgrounds have a greater risk of death from Covid than white people. It found that for almost all ethnic minority groups, health-related quality of life was worse compared to white British people, with the average health of 60-year-olds belonging to five of the groups – Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Arab, and Gypsy or Irish Traveller – similar to that of an average 80-year-old.
Only Chinese people and black African men appeared to have better health outcomes than average. However, researchers said this could simply be down to the way age was recorded in the dataset, and the fact that many minority ethnic groups tend to have comparatively young populations, which could have skewed the results. “Covid really is a health crisis within a bigger and more longstanding health crisis that we have not been paying enough attention to,” said Dr Ruth Watkinson, a research associate at the University of Manchester, who led the study. “It is going to be really important that, as we move beyond the pandemic, we don’t start to look away again, and that we put health equality and equity right at the heart of any efforts to build back better.” Although health inequalities between different ethnic groups in the UK are known to exist, much of this data is based on surveys conducted more than 16 years ago, which also contained barely any information about smaller minority groups such as Arab and Irish Traveller communities. The new study, published in The Lancet Public Health, analysed responses from those registered at GP practices across England from July 2014 to April 2017. This included more than 150,000 people who self-identified as belonging to an ethnic minority group – the largest ever sample. They were questioned about their experiences of visiting their GP practice, and how aspects of their daily lives – such as walking, washing and dressing, doing housework, or visiting friends or family – is affected by their health. The researchers investigated what the cause of these disparities might be and found that, although social deprivation was more common among ethnic minority groups, this couldn’t fully explain the findings. “We saw that, consistent with other findings, people from many ethnic minority groups are more likely to have certain long-term health problems, and a greater number of them,” said Watkinson. “But on top of that we saw these different layers of disadvantage building up, so people from some ethnic minority groups are also more likely to report that they had a poor experience when they went to their GP practice.” Dr Arif Dasu, who works at a GP surgery in Avenham, Preston, a socially deprived area near the city centre, said the problem boiled down to a lack of funding, engagement and insight on the part of government and services. “Previous and older generations, in particular, suffered with having to overcome racial, communal, social and language barriers. I have seen and heard some patients report feeling that they are less likely to be taken seriously than a Caucasian or white British person. This has led to a lack of trust in the services and government,” he said. He added that many first generation south Asians predominantly settled into a lower working-class background and health was not always their highest priority. Mashkura Begum, a charity worker who has previously spoken of the devastation caused by Covid-19 in the Bangladeshi community in the West Midlands, believes as well as the social determinants there is systemic inequality. Begum, who is a trustee at Saathi House, an inner-city women’s organisation, and public contributor at National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), said: “Very few ethnic minorities are involved in the design, discussion or delivery of the service they are service users of. Language barrier is used as a common factor, however in reality there is a cultural inertia by the health leaders to make the necessary changes.” Previous data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggested that black people have a fourfold higher risk of dying from Covid than white people, but that there were significant differences between ethnic groups, and men and women. Such stratification of ethnicity in data reporting is essential if we are to truly understand the picture of health for the diverse UK population, said Ore Odubiyi, director of BME Medics, an organisation committed to improving diversity and inclusion in healthcare. “By highlighting specific ethnic groups found to have significantly lower health-related quality of life, this study elucidates an issue with terms such as BAME, [which are] used so widely in UK data collection methods. The aggregation of many distinct people groups gives rise to much potential to obscure and even erase the health impacts experienced by certain people groups – in this case, significant age-related health disadvantages in Gypsy and Irish Traveller, Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Arab ethnic groups,” she added. Analysis has found that vaccination rates for the Covid-19 jab in England are much lower among ethnic minorities aged 80 and above than their white counterparts. Experts and politicians have expressed growing concerns over vaccine scepticism within minority ethnic groups, prompting the government to launch a targeted publicity campaign to increase confidence. Ministers have pledged a fund worth more than £23m to try and quell the spread of misinformation about the vaccine."
2021-01-28T18:06:28Z,uk-news,UK news,No 10 pulls 'sexist' Covid ad showing all chores done by women,"The government has been lambasted for apparent sexism after issuing a social media advertisement showing women, but no men, undertaking domestic chores – including home-schooling. On Thursday, the government attempted to distance itself from the official social media ad which urged people to “Stay Home. Save Lives”. The poster (above) depicted women cleaning and ironing as well as home-schooling. The lone man, meanwhile, was depicted lounging on a sofa. The image was withdrawn, but only after it had gone viral and drawn criticism and dismay from critics. The government said the ad did “not reflect” its “view on women”. Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, chair of parliament’s women and equalities select committee, tweeted the image and commented: “Someone signed this off.” That the image was published was indicative of a government with a blind spot on gender equality, said Mandu Reid, leader of the Women’s Equality party. “This kind of typecasting makes my blood boil – the people who produced this are dinosaurs,” she said. “It provides further evidence of the crisis of imagination and competence at the heart of government which has already resulted in women being expected to work, teach and care for children without any support.” She added: “The government needs home-schooling on the impossible realities of Covid parenting, otherwise it will be more than their artwork that is stuck in the 1950s.” The row comes at a time when twice as many mothers as fathers say they will have to take time off with no pay due to school closures or a sick child, raising further fears that the economic fallout of the pandemic is falling disproportionately on women’s shoulders. A May report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the UCL Institute of Education revealed that mothers in England were more likely than fathers to have lost their jobs during lockdown, and were able to do only one hour of uninterrupted paid work for every three hours done by men. The prime minister’s spokesman said: “We have provided information for the public throughout the pandemic … [the ad] does not reflect our view on women and we have removed it.” Parenting blogger Anna Whitehouse said: “Showing a man lounging about while women (and girls) ‘do it all’ may bear some truth but it can’t be the blueprint from the top. How did this get signed off in 2021?” Labour’s Yvette Cooper tweeted: “A message from the government to the nation’s women and girls!! In 2021. Turns out 1950s sexism is spreading fast too.” Felicia Willow of the Fawcett Society asked why it took a public backlash to point out that these images are not acceptable. “With women bearing the brunt of the pandemic’s impact at home and at work, the government needs to urgently prioritise their interests, not peddle tired and unhelpful stereotypes,” she said."
2021-01-28T17:02:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Welsh government urged to develop 'route map' to Covid recovery,"The Welsh government is being urged to develop a “route map” to recovery prior to its three-weekly review of its nationwide “alert level 4” restrictions. Covid rates are continuing to fall across Wales and the R number is believed to be below 1 but the Labour-led government is not expected to make significant changes to the lockdown when it announces the conclusions of its review on Friday lunchtime. The Welsh Conservatives have called for the government to work on a “route map” out of lockdown. The party’s Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: “I believe politicians of all stripes want this lockdown to be the very last and we will work with the Welsh government to do whatever it takes to ensure this is the case. “We’d encourage Labour ministers to start work developing a route map out of lockdown, which should include crucial targets concerning the rollout of coronavirus jabs, falling numbers of infections and the reopening of schools and businesses. “This has been a difficult period for our country, but as the vaccination rollout picks up pace and the finish line is in sight, it is for ministers in the coming weeks to lay out a roadmap to economic and societal recovery in Wales.” The Welsh government brought in its level 4 restrictions before Christmas – ahead of the English lockdown – as Covid rates soared. Though the seven-day rate has dropped below 200 per 10,000 people and the R number may be as low as 0.7, the government has been warned by its chief medical officer, Dr Frank Atherton, that the virus could surge again if restrictions are lifted too soon.
On Thursday, the Welsh government revealed a revised testing strategy that looks forward to the possibility of people eventually being tested to allow them to attend events such as sports matches or festivals. It says: “As we move forward with the vaccine rollout and towards lower prevalence of the virus, later in 2021, we will look to see how testing can further support a return to normality. “As we move from pandemic to endemic, our approach will evolve and could involve testing to enable people with a negative result, or those who demonstrate the required level of antibodies in their system, to attend work and normal daily activity; attend a cultural or sporting event; travel internationally; meet friends and family.” The strategy also says the government will examine whether testing of asymptomatic contacts of people with Covid could allow them to remain in work or education as an alternative to isolating for 10 days. Meanwhile, the owner of a tanning and beauty salon in Cwmbran in south Wales has been issued with a £1,000 fixed penalty notice for breaching Covid-19 regulations. Gwent police raided Euphoria Tanning Hair and Beauty earlier this month and found that tanning beds had just been vacated and beauty treatments had clearly been taking place. The force released CCTV footage showing eight people scuttling fro the premises via a fire exit as police arrived. Three customers also received fixed penalty notices."
2021-01-28T12:41:01Z,uk-news,UK news,UK police officer denies sending offensive George Floyd meme,"A police sergeant has denied a charge of sending a grossly offensive meme of George Floyd to colleagues in a WhatsApp group. The trial of Sgt Geraint Jones, 47, from the Devon and Cornwall force in south-west England, will take place in Plymouth in March. It is alleged the image of Floyd, whose death in the US prompted worldwide protests over racial injustice, was altered and sent to fellow officers and staff. Jones is alleged to have shared the image on 30 May, five days after Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He has been suspended from duty since June. The officer, from Torquay, made his first court appearance on Thursday via video link before the district judge Jo Matson, who was sitting in Plymouth. He was represented by Jamas Hodivala QC of Matrix Chambers. Matson said she would hear the trial herself at Plymouth magistrates court on 19 March. Jones is charged with sending the image by means of a public electronic communications network, an offence contrary to section 127 of the Communications Act 2003. Section 127 makes it an offence to send a message that “is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character”. The case was investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which said before the hearing: “An altered image of George Floyd’s arrest in Minneapolis was shared within a WhatsApp group that included a number of other police officers and staff. “Our investigation began in June 2020 following a referral from the force. At its conclusion in October we sent our investigation report to the Crown Prosecution Service, which has authorised the charge.” The IOPC has also investigated other officers who received the allegedly offensive meme for potential disciplinary offences. It will make those findings public after the conclusion of criminal proceedings, which take precedent. The Guardian revealed in June that an investigation had been launched into the sending of the image. Jim Nye, a Devon and Cornwall assistant chief constable, said in June: “Devon and Cornwall police wholly appreciate the concern our communities will have regarding an investigation of this kind. I would reassure them that I, and the chief constable, will do everything possible to ensure the matter is dealt with effectively and in a timely manner.” Floyd died after a US officer knelt on his neck in an incident that was caught on video, and which convulsed the US and led to more than 250,000 protesting in the UK against racial injustice."
2021-01-27T20:39:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Government lawyer tells court MI5 officers could authorise murder,"Government lawyers have told a court that MI5 officers could authorise an informer to carry out a murder under controversial powers that ministers want to see continued contained in a bill that passed the Commons hours later. The admission came in a court of appeal hearing on Wednesday when Sir James Eadie, representing the government, was asked if there was “a power for a Security Service officer to authorise an agent to execute an extremely hostile individual”. Eadie, defending MI5’s current policy for handling confidential informants, said “there would be the power to do that” under 1989 Security Service Act and the royal prerogative that effectively governed the intelligence agency prior to that. Critics immediately seized on the stark statement to demand the government accept an amendment to the covert human intelligence sources (Chis) bill being debated in the Commons on Wednesday afternoon. David Davis, a former Conservative minister, told MPs that the government’s lawyers had acknowledged in court “only this morning” that MI5 “would authorise one of their informants to carry out murder as part of his activities”. The MP was speaking in support of a Lords amendment that called for the creation of a banned list of crimes – including murder, torture and serious sexual offences – that could not be carried out undercover informants working for spies or police. Ministers, however, argued that an explicit list of banned crimes could risk the safety of confidential informants, because it would allow terrorists or organised criminals to create tests to unmask informants. Michael Ellis, the solicitor general, said: “Were we to place explicit limits on the face of the bill that would create the risk to the operational tactics involved and to the safety of the covert human intelligence source and the general public at large.” The minister also said that the bill would be compliant with the Human Rights Act, and that MI5 or police could not breach it. “Any authorisation which is not compliant with the Human Rights Act would be unlawful.” A few minutes later the Lords amendment was defeated by 363 to 267, with Davis and one other Conservative Cheryl Gillan voting against the government. The result prompted the Sinn Féin MP John Finucane, whose father Pat was murdered at home in north Belfast in 1989 by loyalist gunmen, to accuse the government of ignoring “legitimate opposition” to the bill. “The reality of this legislation, as shown through the court of appeal in the last two days, is that there will be no effective oversight to the most serious of crimes committed by state agents,” Finucane said. The Chis bill aims to put into law for the first time the policy governing the state’s handling of informants, partly because a series of legal challenges had been made the previous approach of relying on a partially-secret written policy. A three-day hearing in the court of appeal is determining whether the old policy was lawful. Although the arguments in court will be largely superseded by the legislation, if the government were to lose the case, it could mean the informants policy will be illegal in Scotland where Holyrood has refused to give its consent to the bill. A second amendment passed by the Lords earlier this month, which would have banned the use of children as undercover informants – particularly in drugs gangs – was also overturned by 361 to 267. The Home Office said it was not appropriate to comment on ongoing legal proceedings. A spokesperson added: “The use of covert agents is an essential tool for our security and intelligence services.” • This article was corrected on 27 January 2021.

2021-01-27T20:13:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Grenfell cladding firm president agrees to give evidence at inquiry,"A senior executive at the firm that made the combustible cladding used on Grenfell Tower has agreed to give evidence to the public inquiry after refusing to do so for the last seven months. Claude Schmidt, the president of Arconic Architectural Products, the French company that supplied the plastic-filled panels that were the main cause of fire spread, was one of several witnesses wanted for questioning by the inquiry into the disaster who had refused, citing an arcane French law. A deputy solicitor for the inquiry, Cathy Kennedy, told survivors and the bereaved on Wednesday that Schmidt had finally agreed to give evidence when the inquiry restarts next month after it was closed down before Christmas following a Covid-19 outbreak. Two other witnesses who used to work for the firm, Claude Wehrle and Peter Froehlich, are still holding out, as is Gwenaëlle Derrendinger. They have all cited the rarely used French blocking statute that is intended to prevent the transmission of French commercial secrets in foreign legal and administrative proceedings.
The counsel to the inquiry Richard Millett QC, had urged the witnesses to “do the right thing”, and the minister for building safety, Stephen Greenhalgh, said they should “step up to the plate”. The French government made a public statement saying it did not believe the law was applicable. Grenfell United, the families group, mounted a campaign to demand that all Arconic witness attend, including placing a poster truck outside the French embassy in London displaying an image of the burned-out tower as the central white band on the French tricolour flag. The inquiry has already seen internal Arconic emails that show how in 2009, Wehrle shared with colleagues images of a burning tower fitted with similar panels to those it sold to Grenfell “to show you how dangerous PE [polyethylene] can be when it comes to architecture”. In 2015, he emailed colleagues: “PE is dangerous on facades, and everything should be transferred to fire-resistant as a matter of urgency.” A spokesperson for the French embassy in London, speaking when their refusals became public last autumn, said: “We have asked Arconic to shoulder its responsibility in this matter. “We have informed the inquiry and the UK Foreign Office of our position. [The purpose of the blocking statute] isn’t to obstruct the emergence of the truth or to guarantee immunity for French nationals. This is not a way to evade responsibility.” The inquiry is due to restart on 11 February in remote form with witnesses being cross-examined online. The first two weeks will be dominated by witnesses from Arconic, including Schmidt and the UK sales manager, Deborah French. In March it will hear for a second time from an executive from Kingspan, the Irish construction materials company that made some of the combustible insulation. Adrian Pargeter, its head of technical and marketing, is being recalled after he admitted giving “erroneous” evidence last year. This related to how in 2018, after the 14 June 2017 fire, the company presented evidence to a parliamentary select committee about the fire performance of a rival non-combustible mineral wool insulation. Kingspan has told the inquiry Pargeter “gave certain erroneous answers” and “wished to correct his evidence”. Kingspan has said the error emerged from a misunderstanding by the inquiry about which fire test data it had sent the MPs. It said it carried out two tests, one of which contained deliberate imperfections weakening its fire performance. Counsel to the inquiry assumed this was the test sent to MPs and in questioning Pargeter, accused Kingspan of thereby deliberately misleading MPs. Kingspan has denied this and said the test results sent were of a “very robust” structure that still failed, but Pargeter did not correct the inquiry’s misunderstanding."
2021-01-27T19:56:50Z,uk-news,UK news,"Manchester Arena security firm not to blame for staff's inaction, inquiry told","The firm responsible for stewarding and security at Manchester Arena was not to blame if its staff “missed opportunities” to prevent the bombing, the public inquiry into the attack has heard. Jonathan Laidlaw QC, representing Showsec, said on Wednesday that “primacy” for safety lay with the state and the police rather than the firm. He added that the firm “was not seeking to shift blame or to scapegoat” either. Two of the Showsec stewards, Kyle Lawler and Mohammed Agha, who were present at the arena, were alerted to suicide bomber Salman Abedi’s suspicious presence roughly 15 minutes before the blast. Lawler and Agha, who were 18 and 19 at the time, were informed by a member of the public that Abedi, all in black and with a large rucksack, looked “dodgy” but neither passed this on to the control room. Both men told the inquiry they were “conflicted” and unsure what to do. The inquiry heard both stewards were part of a large, casual workforce, paid the minimum wage, with their training comprising largely of unpaid, online learning, done in their own time with it being possible to complete important training modules with a single click. If the two stewards were found by the inquiry to have failed, Laidlaw said this failure could not be attributed to a lack of proper training provided by the company. Laidlaw said Showsec’s role, as a provider of “crowd management services” was subordinate to that of the police and SMG, operators of the arena, and its staff had no right to stop or search anyone in public areas outside the arena, including the foyer where the bomb was detonated. He said Greater Manchester police, with their experience in counter-terrorism, should have taken charge of safety at the arena and that a proper risk assessment by police “may well have identified the cracks in a system” prepared by two private firms. Laidlaw admitted that a “breakdown in communication” had occurred with SMG over checking of the mezzanine area where Abedi hid for almost an hour. The inquiry also heard from Home Office representative Cathryn McGahey QC who said the government would start a public consultation on “Martyn’s Law”, named after a victim, by the end of February. Among other provisions, the law calls for mandatory bag searches and metal detectors for large public venues. The hearing continues."
2021-01-27T19:08:52Z,uk-news,UK news,Inquest finds mother took overdose after removal of benefits,"A severely mentally ill young mother died from a deliberate overdose after the removal of her disability benefits left her destitute, trapped in a months-long state of high anxiety and haunted by suicidal thoughts, an inquest has concluded. The coroner, Gordon Clow, said Philippa Day’s long struggle with the benefits system had been a “stressor” in her decision to take the overdose in August 2019. She was found unconscious at home by her sister and father, and died in hospital two months later after not recovering from a coma. Clow delivered a devastating critique at Nottingham coroner’s court on Wednesday of the handling of her benefits claim by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and its private contractor, Capita, outlining 28 specific instances where “systemic errors” had led to failures by benefits officials. The coroner said he would issue a formal prevention of future deaths notice to the DWP to ensure it improves its benefit assessment systems in a range of areas, including inadequate staff training, especially in dealing with mentally ill claimants, poor record-keeping and inability to swiftly correct “obvious” administrative errors. Clow told the court that while Day’s experiences with the DWP had been the “predominant factor” in her decision to take an overdose, he was unable to conclude that she had intended to take her own life, not least because of a previous history of deliberate overdoses. The case will intensify concerns over the DWP’s handling of benefit claims by vulnerable people. A report by the National Audit Office last year revealed at least 69 suicides could be linked to problems with benefit claims since 2014, and that the DWP had failed to investigate many of the cases properly or learn from them. Recent cases include Errol Graham, 57, who was found starved to death in 2018 after his benefits were withdrawn when he failed to attend a jobcentre meeting, and Jodey Whiting, 42, who took her own life in 2017, just days after her benefits were withdrawn. Day, a 27-year-old single mother from Nottingham, had a long history of mental illness, and had suffered from type 1 diabetes since childhood. Her often chaotic life had been marked by self-harm, suicide attempts and multiple stays in psychiatric hospitals. She took illicit drugs, though was not dependent on them. Her family described Day as an intelligent, beautiful and “effervescent” woman, who was able to connect well with other people. She had borne her trauma well, loved her young son, and had ambitions to train as a mental health nurse. In the months before her death she had endured a gruelling battle over her disability benefits after they were erroneously cut from £228 to just £60 a week. After they were reinstated, Day – who was agoraphobic – became increasingly anxious as officials insisted she report in person to a benefits assessment centre to be retested. Day’s community psychiatric nurse Tessa Rand had pleaded with an official at the private outsourcing firm Capita to reassess Day at home, saying her patient was “terrified” and in “immense distress” at the prospect. The official refused, and instead asked for written evidence as to why a home visit was needed. Just days later a letter from the DWP warning Philippa that she would lose her benefits if she did not attend the face-to face assessment was found next to her unconscious body, and notes left on her computer said her dealings with DWP made her feel “trapped” and “isolated from the world.” Day’s sister Imogen told the inquest the refusal of a home visit was the “straw that broke the camel’s back”. On several occasions Philippa had discussed her struggles with the benefit system with Imogen, telling how they had exacerbated her suicidal thoughts and left her in despair. The court heard a recording of a phone call made by a clearly distressed Day in June 2019 in which she pleaded with a DWP benefits official to reinstate her benefits “to give her something to live for” because she was hungry, penniless and in increasing despair. “I’ve been waiting for six months now. I’m literally starving, I can’t survive for much longer,” she told the official. Audibly crying, she added: “[I’m in] £5,000 debt. Nothing to eat. I’ve lost all my [benefit] premiums … I cannot survive … without any money. I need something to live for.” Over the next week Rand and Day made a series of frantic telephone calls to officials to try to reinstate her personal independence payment (Pip) claim, which had been cancelled in January, the inquest heard. A backdated payment of just over £2,000 was finally made on 18 June. The DWP privately acknowledged a series of failings in its handling of Day’s claim in a draft internal process review dated October 2020, requested by the coroner. They include a failure by officials to properly record Day’s calls, or record on her claim file the additional support she was entitled to as a result of her mental illness. Following the verdict, Imogen Day said: “As our family made clear in evidence given at the inquest into the death of my sister, we believe that Pip’s treatment by the DWP had a direct impact on her mental state and in the end is the reason for her death. “She was in despair because of the depths to which she had sunk, she could see no way out of the debt and the poverty in which she was living. Pip’s poor mental health meant she was not able to handle the battle with the DWP for the reinstatement of her benefits. The stress of the conflict with the DWP made her even more ill.” The DWP said it would respond to the coroner’s request for a prevention of future deaths report in due course. A spokesperson said: “This is a deeply tragic case. Our sincere condolences are with Miss Day’s family and we will carefully consider the coroner’s findings.” • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

2021-01-27T14:11:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Sturgeon questions whether Johnson's trip to Scotland 'essential',"Nicola Sturgeon has questioned whether Boris Johnson’s planned trip from London to Scotland on Thursday is “genuinely essential”, suggesting his visit makes it harder to convince the public to stick to travel restrictions. At her daily briefing, where she also said the UK government’s hotel quarantine plan for travellers did not go far enough, Scotland’s first minister said that while she was sure Johnson and his advisers would take care to make sure no laws were broken, “we all have to make judgments on what we genuinely think is essential”.
Sturgeon said: “People like me and Boris Johnson have to be in work, for reasons I think most people can understand, but we don’t have to travel across the UK. Is that really essential right now? We have a duty to lead by example, and if we are going to suggest that we don’t take these rules as seriously as we should it gets harder to convince other people.” She insisted she was not saying the prime minister was not welcome in Scotland. Sturgeon said she was concerned that the UK government’s quarantine plan for international travellers from high-risk countries did not go far enough, describing it as “minimal” and claiming it left “far too many points of entry for the virus”. She said would not pre-empt the prime minister’s announcement on Wednesday afternoon, but added: “I do have a duty at this point to say that I am concerned that the proposal does not go far enough and I’ve made that point very strongly in the four nations discussions that we’ve just had today.” Sturgeon said while the Scottish government would initially emulate the UK government’s steps on enhancing quarantine arrangements, “we will be seeking urgently to persuade them to go much further and indeed to move to a comprehensive system of supervised quarantine”.
She said that given all the practical issues involved, her preference was for consistent quarantine rules across the UK, but that if no agreement could be reached her government would set out its own additional measures next week. She said the public should not be booking holidays overseas. The Welsh government raised similar concerns and urged a joint approach by the four nations. A Welsh government spokesperson said: “We do not believe the approach as set out by the UK government goes far enough. Further discussions on the details of the proposals will take place as soon as possible.” Sturgeon paused her briefing for a few moments of silence to remember those who have lost their lives to Covid-19. Referring to the UK death toll of more than 100,000, she said: “These numbers should make anyone in a position of authority – and I know they certainly make me – think very hard about what we could have done and what lessons we must continue to learn.”"
2021-01-27T10:42:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Hinkley Point C costs may rise by Â£500m on back of Covid crisis,"The Covid-19 pandemic could delay construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactor by six months and raise its costs by £500m, according to its developer. The fresh delays are expected to take the cost of the UK’s first new nuclear power plant in a generation to £23bn, EDF Energy said, and put back its launch to the summer of 2026.
Before the coronavirus outbreak, Hinkley Point was expected to start up by the end of 2025, at a cost of between £21.5bn and £22.5bn. However, EDF Energy, which is owned by the French state, said the pandemic had caused delays of three months last year and was expected to lead to similar delays in 2021. “Ten months after it began, we are still facing the full force of the pandemic,” Stuart Crooks, the managing director of Hinkley Point C, said in a video message to employees. He said that despite increasing the number of workers on the 160-hectare (400-acre) site in Somerset from below 2,000 to more than 5,000, physical-distancing requirements “still limit the number of people we can safely have on site at any one time”. The Covid-19 delays have led to the second major cost increase for Hinkley in under two years after EDF Energy said in 2019 that construction costs had climbed by up to £2.9bn because of delays. Hinkley Point’s costs have risen by £5bn in the last five years. It will cost almost double the amount to build as first thought in 2008, and will begin generating electricity almost a decade later than the original start date of Christmas 2017. Crooks said: “None of this extra cost is carried by British consumers.” The rising cost of the project will be shouldered by EDF Energy, which agreed a guaranteed price of £92.50 for every megawatt-hour of electricity produced by Hinkley. That price remains unchanged by the delays.
EDF Energy is still estimated to make a return of between 7.1% and 7.2% on its investment, which will be paid back through energy bills. The nuclear plant is expected to add between £10 and £15 a year to the average energy bill for 35 years, making it one of the most expensive energy projects undertaken. The government is in talks with EDF Energy to build a second nuclear reactor project with its junior partner, China’s CGN, at Sizewell in Suffolk to consolidate what it has learned from the construction of Hinkley Point. However, ministers are unwilling to repeat a similar financing deal for Sizewell after fierce criticism from MPs, consumer groups and green activists, and hope to find a new funding framework to support the plans."
2021-01-27T10:38:05Z,uk-news,UK news,Facebook apologises for flagging Plymouth Hoe as offensive term,"Plymouth Hoe is one of the most well-known sites in the UK’s seafaring history, the spot where Sir Francis Drake reputedly finished a game of bowls before heading out to fight the Spanish Armada. But Facebook has found itself in hot water after challenging some posts from local people who innocently mentioned the Hoe, mistakenly thinking they were using a misogynist term. The social media company has apologised for its mistake and promised to take steps to ensure residents and visitors can use the term in relation to the Devon landmark. It has argued that some words can be slurs or offensive if used in certain ways and certain contexts, but not in others – but admitted it was at fault in this case. The problem emerged when some Plymouth Facebook users spotted that their posts were coming under unexpected scrutiny. The administrator of one Plymouth Facebook page warned its users to be careful when mentioning the Hoe. “Just a quick post to say anyone living Plymouth h o e, please don’t write it as one word,” they said. “Facebook are saying it’s harassment and muting people and giving them a Facebook ban. It’s not us doing that.” One Facebook user claimed they had their comment removed on several occasions and added: “Now I am writing Oe.” Another said: “Someone asked me where I swam in Plymouth and I replied “Plymouth H O E. I got told off for bad language and could not comment for two days.” A third added that when she mentioned the Hoe, she received a message: “Are you sure you want to post this, it may be deemed offensive to some?” The Visit Plymouth website describes the Hoe as enjoying a “breathtaking panorama” with “unbeatable views across Plymouth Sound”. It is the “perfect place to spend a sunny day, enjoying a picnic on the grass or taking a dip in the art deco Tinside lido”. At the eastern end is the Royal Citadel, the most impressive 17th-century fortress in Britain and for many years England’s most important defence against attack from the sea. The name derives from the Anglo-Saxon word hoe – a sloping ridge shaped like an inverted foot and heel. A Facebook spokesperson said: “These posts were removed in error and we apologise to those who were affected. We’re looking into what happened and will take steps to rectify the error.”"
2021-01-26T20:36:18Z,uk-news,UK news,CPS accused of 'systemic illegality' in charging rape cases,"The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has been accused of “systemic illegality” in its approach to charging rape cases in a landmark judicial review into how the crime is prosecuted. On the opening day of the hearing at the court of appeal, lawyers for the Centre for Women’s Justice (CWJ) and End Violence Against Women (EVAW) accused the CPS of “raising the bar” for rape prosecutions, which they argued had led to a steep drop in the number of cases being charged. Reports of rape have increased by almost a third in the four years to March 2020, but in the same time period the number of rape prosecutions has more than halved, falling 60% to the lowest figure on record.
Phillippa Kaufmann QC, acting for the CWJ and EVAW, told the court that since 2016 the CPS had rolled back progress made “in improving the volumes of cases that were prosecuted” while Sir Keir Starmer was the director of public prosecutions and Alison Levitt QC, his principal legal adviser, was in post. Kaufmann argued that a focus from 2009 until 2016 on “the merits-based approach” – which explicitly dictates a prosecutor should treat evidence as if it will be heard by an unprejudiced jury, rather than the “bookmaker’s approach” where a prosecutor tries to second-guess a jury – had produced “positive feedback”. She said: “[B]ecause as women see that the CPS is taking these events as seriously, that what they’re doing is producing results, their confidence to come forward necessarily grows.” She added that prosecutors were trained to “put aside myths and stereotypes” and to recognise that even in instances where there was “no corroboration” of the complainant’s accusations, “it was still possible to prosecute”.
The CPS took a decision to change this policy in 2016, implementing a “target” to improve the rape prosecution rate and removing references to the “merits-based approach” from guidance, she said. The CPS’s director of legal services, Gregor McGill, also carried out a “roadshow” to try to improve the conviction rate, she added. In 2018 the Guardian reported that CPS prosecutors were urged in these training sessions to put a “touch on the tiller” and take a more risk-averse approach to prosecuting rape by weeding “the weak cases out of the system”. The CPS has consistently denied a change in approach. Kaufmann said the CPS’s actions amounted to “systemic illegality”, adding: “The roadshows in the context of the conviction rate target and the changes to the guidance […] inevitably would have left some prosecutors so confused that [they] would have been left thinking the bookmaker’s approach now applies. [O]thers would have become so risk-averse that they ended up taking decisions not to prosecute where the evidential threshold was established and crossed.” The court heard that the change in policy was based on “the basis of a confusion, [that] prosecutors were misapplying the merits-based approach by treating it as a separate and lesser test then the full-code test”, applied by prosecutors when deciding to charge all cases. For a case to be charged under the code it must have a “realistic prospect of conviction” and be in the public interest. Kaufmann told the court that the CPS had not properly consulted on the change and had failed to consider its public sector equality duty, which states that public bodies must consider the impact of decisions on people protected under the Equality Act.
In written submissions, lawyers for the CPS have argued that the case is not suitable for legal challenge and asked the court of appeal to dismiss the claim. Tom Little QC said the term “merits-based approach” (MBA) had been removed out of a concern that some prosecutors were using it as a lower standard, adding: “The concern was that people were being prosecuted when the case ought not to have been charged.” The roadshows and removal of MBA guidance “did not result in any substantial change in the application of the evidential test in the code for Crown prosecutors”, and “did not give rise to a systemic risk that prosecutors would apply a bookmaker’s test”, he argued. In the documents Little argued that a 2019 report from the CPS inspectorate concluded prosecutors correctly used the code in 98% of cases out of 250 where no further action had been taken. A CPS spokesperson said: “There has been no change of approach in how the CPS prosecutes rape. Our skilled prosecutors are experienced and highly trained to make sure criminals can be brought to justice. No matter how challenging the case, whenever our legal test is met, we always seek to charge. “Independent inspectors have found no evidence of a risk-averse approach and have reported a clear improvement in the quality of our legal decision-making in rape cases. The principles of the merits-based approach are enshrined in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, which guides every charging decision. “Along with the police, we remain committed to making real, lasting improvements to how these horrific offences are handled.” The judicial review hearing, before the Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett, Lord Justice Holroyde and Lady Justice Elisabeth Laing, comes after a government end-to-end review into how rape is investigated and prosecuted was announced in March 2019. This is the third court hearing, after the case was originally dismissed by the high court in March 2020, a decision later overturned at an appeal hearing in July 2020. It is expected to last for two days with the court due to hear from CPS lawyers on Wednesday."
2021-01-26T19:05:33Z,uk-news,UK news,William Shawcross’s selection for Prevent role strongly criticised,"William Shawcross, a former head of the charity watchdog who has made controversial comments about Islam, is to lead the struggling review of the government’s anti-radicalisation programme Prevent. The review, announced in January 2019, has been beset by delays. It has taken 13 months to appoint Shawcross to lead it, after the government’s first choice, Lord Carlile, was forced to step down in December 2019. The government initially committed in law to complete and respond to the review by August 2020 but removed this requirement in new legislation. Civil liberties and human rights organisations such as Amnesty International have been calling for an independent review of Prevent for some time, saying it fosters discrimination against people of Muslim faith or background and inhibits legitimate expression. The appointment of Shawcross, who chaired the Charity Commission between 2012 and 2018, was met instantly with criticism over previous remarks he has made about Islam.
In 2012, as a director of the neoconservative thinktank the Henry Jackson Society, he said: “Europe and Islam is one of the greatest, most terrifying problems of our future. I think all European countries have vastly, very quickly growing Islamic populations.” The Charity Commission for England and Wales under Shawcross’s tenure was accused of institutional bias against Muslims by the Claystone thinktank, while Muslim groups have highlighted as concerning comments he made in his book Justice and the Enemy, which appear to support use of torture and the detention camp at Guantánamo Bay. Dal Babu, a former senior Muslim officer in the Met police, condemned the appointment. Babu, who described Prevent as a toxic brand in 2015, said: “Shawcross is a man who has demonstrated lack of independence in matters involving the Muslim community and sadly this is a missed opportunity to develop an effective [programme] that safeguards our children.” A spokesperson for the Muslim Council of Britain said Shawcross’s appointment was a “Trumpian” move. They said: “Once again, the government is making it clear it has no interest in truly reviewing the policy. William Shawcross is singularly unfit to be a neutral and fair assessor of this government policy, which has been criticised for unfairly targeting British Muslims, given his frightening views about Islam and Muslims. “It is ironic that a policy supposedly charged with preventing extremism is to be scrutinised by a person who holds hostile views on Islam and Muslims, who has links to people with extreme views on us, and who defends the worst excesses of the so-called ‘war on terror’.” The home secretary picked Shawcross, who is a fellow with the rightwing thinktank Policy Exchange, over Nazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor in the north-west who is from a Muslim background. Afzal was interviewed for the final stages of the process. On Tuesday he pointed out on Twitter that the Telegraph had reported that Shawcross was ministers’ favoured candidate a week before they were interviewed, which did not “suggest a fair fight”. He added: “I threatened to withdraw my application at that stage as I was just in race to give public impression that it was open selection. But I didn’t go to Eton (just humble comprehensive) nor was I best mates with ministers. Independence means a different thing to me. I’m not disheartened.” The Prevent strategy includes a statutory duty for schools, NHS trusts, prisons and local authorities to report any concerns they have about people who may be at risk of turning to extremism. Supporters of the strategy say statistics prove that it does not target one community in particular and has successfully diverted vulnerable individuals from being radicalised and becoming terrorists. The independent review is supposed to consider the strategy, delivery and future of the Prevent programme. Following his appointment, Shawcross said: “I intend to lead a robust and evidence-based examination of the programme, to help ensure that Britain has a clear and effective strategy to protect vulnerable people from being drawn into terrorism.” Just 11% of referrals to Prevent were ultimately deemed to be at risk of radicalisation, most recent figures showed. Home Office data showed there were 6,287 referrals in the year to 31 March, up 10% compared with the record low in the previous year. Ultimately, 697 were deemed at risk of radicalisation and taken on by the government’s Channel programme for specialist support. A Home Office spokesperson said: “There was a full and open recruitment process to find the new independent reviewer of prevent. “A panel, led by an independent chair, assessed the candidates and found that Mr Shawcross met the criteria and possessed the right range of skills and experience to conduct this important review.”"
2021-01-26T18:39:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Unite union apparently doubles expenditure on hotel project to £74m,"Unite, Labour’s most generous backer, appears to have more than doubled its planned expenditure on a controversial construction project in just five years. Amid concern over the cost of building the hotel and conference centre in Birmingham, leaked accounts indicate that the union spent £74m up to the end of 2019. In 2015, media reports claimed the project was expected to cost £35m. It comes days before the union, headed by Len McCluskey, holds a special meeting of its ruling body to discuss claims that the cost of the project has spiralled out of control. Unite has declined to comment directly on the figures, saying it would be inappropriate to do so before the executive council meets.
The contract to build the 170-room hotel and conference centre was awarded in 2015 to the Flanagan Group, a Liverpool company run by an associate of McCluskey, who is the union’s general secretary. Another contract on the project was given to a company owned by the son of Joe Anderson, Liverpool’s mayor. The leaked document, called an AR21, was signed off by McCluskey in early December and then again by the accountants BDO. It was supposed to be filed over the summer. A note in the accounts says: “Included in land and buildings above is £74.0m (2018: £42.6m) of assets in the course of construction for the National Education and Conference Centre & Hotel in Birmingham. No depreciation has been charged on these assets on the basis that they are not yet available for use.” The document also states that “the conference centre and hotel is operated by Blackhorse HCC Ltd which owns 76%”. McCluskey and four executive council members of the union are directors of Blackhorse. One source with knowledge of the document said the union was declaring spending of £74m to date on the project. The accounts do not show any evidence of a re-evaluation of the property. The Flanagan Group is under investigation by Merseyside police in connection with Operation Aloft, an inquiry into the sale to developers of council-owned land in Liverpool. Paul Flanagan, the head of the group, was arrested in September on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery. Joe Anderson and his son David have also been arrested. The union vehemently denied any wrongdoing following allegations in the Times. A spokesperson said there was no connection between the Merseyside investigation and the Birmingham project and McCluskey had nothing to do with the tendering process. On Friday, executive members will expect to hear from McCluskey and other key officials about the building project, which includes a Marriott-branded hotel, a conference room, an education centre and regional offices for the union. The media reports in 2015 quoted Unite officials saying the building would cost the union £35m, money it would recover by hiring out conference facilities and by holding its own conferences on the site in Birmingham Science Park Aston. McCluskey, who is stepping down next year, was one of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s closest allies and has criticised his successor, Sir Keir Starmer, over his decision to pay damages to ex-staffers who said the party had not dealt with antisemitism. Unite has cut its support to Labour since the decision. Labour will be watching the leadership contest closely, with two candidates from the left, Howard Beckett and Steve Turner, expected to stand. Gerard Coyne, a Starmer supporter who narrowly lost to McCluskey in 2017, said this month he would stand again. Asked to comment on the figures, Coyne said: “Spiralling costs, poor reporting and contractual questions mean there must now be a full, externally-led and published review into Unite the Union’s Birmingham conference centre and hotel project. If this had been a public sector build then unions would have been making the same demand.” A Unite spokesperson defended the project, saying: “These continuing efforts to create the impression that something untoward has occurred with the construction of our Birmingham facility are pathetic. This is a world-class facility, which will provide conference, education and hotel facilities for our entire union and help regenerate a neglected part of the UK’s second city. “In a sector beset with blacklisting and insecure working, we are also extremely proud that this facility was built using unionised labour, as determined by our executive council. The costs and management of the project will be considered by our executive on Friday. It would be completely inappropriate for Unite to enter into discussion of these with the media beforehand.”"
2021-01-26T17:59:47Z,uk-news,UK news,"Man accused of murdering Libby Squire 'only wanted to help', court told","A 26-year-old man accused of raping and murdering student Libby Squire “only wanted to help”, a jury has heard. Pawel Relowicz told Sheffield crown court that he had consensual sex with Squire on the evening she disappeared, but said she was not “a target”. He denies raping and murdering the 21-year-old in Hull, east Yorkshire, on 1 February 2019. The court had earlier heard that he drove her to Oak Road playing fields, where he raped and murdered her before putting her into the River Hull. Her body was recovered about seven weeks later in the Humber estuary. Speaking through an interpreter, Relowicz told the court that he was “looking for a woman to have easy sex” on the night of 31 January but said he just wanted to help Squire, whom he had found drunk and distressed in the street after being refused entry to a nightclub. In cross-examination on Tuesday, Richard Wright QC for the prosecution asked Relowicz: “And though you told us yesterday that you were looking for easy sex, this drunk, hypothermic, lost girl was not the easy sex you were looking for?” Relowicz, who worked as a butcher in Malton, North Yorkshire, replied: “She wanted my help and I only wanted to help her.” He told the jury that he offered Squire, a philosophy student at the University of Hull, a lift home. After describing how he could not get an address out of Squire, Relowicz told the court he stopped near Oak Road as he thought she was going to be sick. Relowicz said she asked for a hug and they ended up kissing before they had sex on the ground near his car. The defendant said she tried to kiss him again but he turned away and she scratched his face. He told the court that he then drove away and saw her behind his car shouting at him not to leave her. Wright asked Relowicz why he did not say this to the police when he was arrested five days after Squire disappeared. He said: “it was not a deliberate decision. I had two children and a wife and I didn’t want her to find out I had cheated on her. “I didn’t do anything to Libby. I didn’t kill her, I didn’t rape her and I left her where I said I left her.” The trial continues."
2021-01-26T17:31:39Z,uk-news,UK news,"Lockdown may have played part in rise of domestic child killings, says Met","The pressures of lockdown may have played a part in a rise in children killed in domestic homicides, Britain’s biggest police force today said. A total of 12 children were killed in 2020, in London, up from 7 the previous year. The Metropolitan police said all domestic child killings were being reviewed and a decline in mental health caused by restrictions to combat the pandemic, may have been a factor. Overall homicides in the capital fell from 150 in 2019 to 126 in 2020, with a big fall in teenagers killed. But domestic homicides rose from 16 in 2019 to 22 last year. Of those 12 were children aged 12 years or younger, where the suspect was a family member, usually a parent or guardian. Commander Dave McLaren said he could not discuss individual cases with reviews under way to see if children could have been better protected and whether any warning signs were missed. McLaren, asked if lockdown had been a factor, said: “It is fair to say that mental health has played a part in a number of those crimes this year and it isn’t a massive leap of faith to say that lockdown, has an impact on all of us in terms of our wellbeing. “So I’m sure the impact of lockdown on the mental health of individuals, will have had an impact across the board.” He added: “In terms of those cases, we have to see those reviews through and better understand the circumstances surrounding each of them before we get to the point of drawing a conclusion that there’s a direct correlation with lockdown.” Among children killed last year were Dylan Freeman, found dead at in Acton, west London, on 15 August. His mother Olga Freeman, 40, denies her son’s murder but has admitted manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility, a plea the prosecution accepted. Dylan was found covered by a duvet with toys placed beside him. In April 19-month-old Pavinya Nithiyakumar and her three-year-old brother, Nigish, were killed by their father Nadarajah Nithiyakumar. He has been ordered to be detained indefinitely in a psychiatric institution. In 2020, most types of serious crime fell, with knife crime down 27%. But some serious crime categories did not, despite the months of lockdown when fewer people were on the streets. The Met said the number of incidents where guns were fired increased, from 266 in 2019 to 288 in 2020. Knife crime with injury and grievous bodily harm fell during lockdown, then rose once restrictions lifted as simmering gang tensions boiled over. Commander Jane Connors said: “As the restrictions were lifted, as we came out through May, June, July, and into the early part of August, we did start to see that the offence levels rose above pre-Covid levels. “And that predominantly is because there were more people out on the streets, but also because some of the gang tensions that had been playing out on social media and people not able to take their reprisals, we did start to see a slight rise in some of the knife injuries that we were seeing.” The force is monitoring social media as part of a raft of measures to thwart similar rises in violence when current lockdown measures are lifted. McLaren said:“During the first lockdown, as a once-in-a-career situation, we were pretty unsure as to how crime trends would react coming out of lockdown. “We saw that there were tensions that were growing between different groups, factions, gangs, that did ultimately result in an increase in firearms discharges in the months when we came out of lockdown. He added: “As you would expect during this current lockdown, we are absolutely attuned, have learned from the previous lockdown and have activity ongoing just now to make sure that we are on the front foot targeting those individuals who we think may be a threat so that we don’t see that same rise when we come out of this current lockdown.”"
2021-01-26T17:28:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Skilled Commonwealth migrants still facing 'unlawful' deportation,"Dozens of highly skilled migrants from Commonwealth countries are still facing deportation almost two years after the court of appeal ruled the Home Office was acting unlawfully in refusing them leave to remain, according to a new report. In 2018, MPs and immigration experts criticised the use of the controversial section 322(5) of the Immigration Act, which was designed in part to tackle terrorists and individuals judged to be a threat to national security. The act was used to accuse highly skilled migrants, including teachers, doctors, scientists and engineers, of lying in their applications – either for making minor and legal amendments to their tax records, or having discrepancies in declared income. It was hoped that a court of appeal ruling in April 2019 – known as the Balajigari case – would resolve the situation. The court ruled that the Home Office had been acting unlawfully by not giving this group of migrants an opportunity to explain tax discrepancies before refusing them leave to remain. However, a new report from the NGO Migrants’ Rights Network (MRN), published on Wednesday, finds that at least 70 of these cases have “fallen through the cracks” since. All of the cases are from Commonwealth countries, including Pakistan, India and Nigeria, and all have been in the UK for 10 or more years, and have built a life, family and career here. As a result, authors of the report have accused the Home Office of “racially discriminatory immigration policies”. Although more than 90% hold a postgraduate degree from the UK and nearly a quarter have postgraduate qualifications, many are now on the verge of destitution, forbidden from working, using the NHS, renting property or receiving benefits. Four out of five have had no “minded to refuse” letter, a Home Office warning providing migrants the opportunity to explain any discrepancies. The Home Office’s own internal guidance to case workers specifies that section 322(5) should only be triggered in cases involving “criminality, a threat to national security, war crimes or travel bans”. But the discretionary section also allows the Home Office to refuse an applicant by inferring that their “character and conduct” make them undesirable to be allowed to live in the UK. Ahmed Tilal Pasha, 38, from Pakistan, has lived, studied and worked in the UK since 2003 and had been working as a sales consultant. His problems began in 2015 when the hostile environment rules relating to a discrepancy in his tax return prevented him from being granted indefinite leave to remain. He said the tax return was filed by his accountant and that he was innocent of any deliberate error. He is living with his wife, who has a life-threatening heart condition, and their five-year-old daughter and three-year-old son in one room. “I’m not allowed to work, we have sold everything we have. I’ve lost my job, I’ve lost my dignity and I’m mentally exhausted,” he said. MRN and Highly Skilled UK, a support group that represents workers, are now calling for a reassessment of the decisions in the remaining cases and an end to the use of “good character” references under rule 322(5) for non-criminal acts. They call for all highly skilled migrants with pending indefinite leave to remain applications to be granted the rights to work in the UK and visit family overseas. Katharine Thane, the senior advocacy officer at MRN and a report author, said: “The criminalisation of these highly skilled Commonwealth migrants of colour is endemic of the government’s enforcement of hostile environment policies. The policies have made it impossible to build a life in the UK – and local authorities are picking up the bill to now support these families to survive. Leaving this group in legal limbo for non-criminal acts shows that we have not yet learned the lessons from Windrush.” Kevin Foster, minister for future borders and immigration, said: “To equate these cases to Windrush is wrong and inflammatory. In 2019 the court ruled our use of these immigration rules was appropriate and we were justified to expect a full and convincing explanation about glaring discrepancies between their visa applications and their tax records. “Our review found 88% of those refused under 322(5) claimed in their visa applications their earnings were more than £10,000 a year higher than was shown by their tax records – these are not small mistakes in tax records. “The majority of the cases have either been concluded or are being actively reconsidered – the courts timescales are beyond our control, but we are working to resolve these outstanding cases fairly and as quickly as possible. Those awaiting the outcome of their application are not destitute, they have been granted permission to study or work while their cases are reconsidered.”"
2021-01-26T17:27:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Cutting crime: 31 Met officers face fines for haircuts at police station,"The Metropolitan police says that 31 of its officers broke lockdown rules to have a haircut in a police station while on duty. The Met, Britain’s biggest force, said each officer would face a £200 fixed penalty notice after their trim turned into an embarrassing brush with the law. Under the rules for the national lockdown in England, barbers and hairdressers cannot operate because of fears the proximity to their clients could aid the spread of the highly infectious Covid-19. The haircutting took place at Bethnal Green police station, east London, on 17 January, the Met said. The force said it received allegations that a professional barber had been operating at the police station. An investigation was launched with 31 officers identified as having sat in the barber’s chair, in breach of Covid regulations, and having had their haircut. Police chiefs have decided they should be issued with a fine. The Met said the investigation had identified two officers as being involved in organising the marathon haircutting session. They have been notified that they face an investigation for misconduct. The incident is embarrassing in a number of ways for the Met. The latest lockdown saw the police commissioner, Cressida Dick, announce a crackdown on rule breakers among the public as infection rates sky rocketed. Last week nine Met officers were fined for having breakfast together and the government wants police to lead the charge on stricter enforcement. DCS Marcus Barnett, a local police chief, said: “It is deeply disappointing and frustrating that my officers have fallen short of the expectation to uphold Covid-19 regulations. Although officers donated money to charity as part of the haircut, this does not excuse them from what was a very poor decision. I expect a lot more of them. “It is right therefore [that] officers should each face a £200 fine, as well as misconduct action for those two who organised this event. “Quite rightly, the public expect police to be role models in following the regulations which are designed to prevent the spread of this deadly virus. I hope this action proves that police are not immune to enforcement of the rules, and we are prepared as an organisation to take action if we see officers have behaved irresponsibly.”"
2021-01-25T20:52:16Z,uk-news,UK news,Manchester Arena inquiry hears of 'unacceptable' security failures,"A series of “unacceptable and unjustified” security failures occurred before the Manchester Arena bombing, the public inquiry into the attack has been told. The inquiry heard lawyers’ closing statements on chapter seven, relating to security at the venue. The arena is operated by SMG, who employed the company Showsec to provide security and stewarding services there. Duncan Atkinson QC, representing seven of the families who were bereaved by the attack said: “The evidence has shown a security operation that was under-resourced, malcoordinated and insufficiently focused on counter-terrorism and especially the threat from person-borne improvised explosive devices. “This made the arena an attractive target for terrorists and led to a series of missed opportunities to prevent, deter, detect and/or mitigate the attack.” Suicide bomber Salman Abedi killed 22 people and injured hundreds in the attack on 22 May 2017 after an Ariana Grande concert. Atkinson said the evidence showed that “costs concerns were prioritised ahead of the provision of all reasonable measures to address the risk from terrorism ... they were focused on the risk of the audience, not to the audience.” Peter Wetherby QC, representing seven more families, said it was “blindingly obvious” that SMG, an “enormous corporate enterprise”, should have employed a dedicated counter-terrorism expert to look after the arena. He added: “SMG took the money for ensuring security and public safety in the City Room [the arena’s foyer] but very plainly failed to discharge those responsibilities.” Wetherby was also critical of the government’s lack of urgency over venue security. He told the hearing that the government’s failure to set out a timetable for change had raised the risk of “further outrages”. A planned new law to improve venue safety in the wake of the arena bombing has been delayed by Covid-19. The inquiry continues."

Keon Lincoln was set upon in the street in Handsworth, Birmingham last Thursday afternoon. Police believe a group of youths were behind the unusually violent attack. The victim was so young that he was taken to Birmingham Children’s Hospital, where he died. On Monday his mother Sharmaine Lincoln appealed for information to bring his killers to justice and told of her heartbreak and devastation. She said her son loved his family and friends. Four youths remain in custody with detectives from West Midlands police trying to determine why Keon was shot and stabbed to death, with a gang motivation being one line of inquiry. Sharmaine Lincoln said: “I heard the gunshots and my first instinct was ‘where’s my son?’ Those were the first words I said. Then a few minutes went by – I found out that there was somebody up the road and ... it was my boy. “What he could have done to warrant this type of brutality makes no sense. How do you live after your child’s been taken away from you? It’s every parent’s worst nightmare. He can’t have been taken like this and nobody is punished for it.” Family friend Pastor Neville Popo said the violence had to stop, condemned what he termed “black on black violence” and added: “It’s not just the Lincoln family that are suffering traumatic pain today, but I would imagine the parents of those who committed the crime will also be devastated by what took place.” Four youths aged 16, 15 and and two 14-year-olds remain in custody after being arrested in connection with the investigation. Another 14-year-old has been released under investigation. DCI Alastair Orencas, said: “The answer to this investigation lies in the community. In the 24 years that I’ve been serving in the police service, and I don’t say this lightly, this is the most gratuitous use of violence seeing a combination of knife and gun attack which ultimately killed Keon. “We know that the nature of this crime, where it involves a young man that has lost his life and young men that have committed the crime, means that the information and intelligence is highly likely to rest with the younger community but also their parents. “I know it’s not easy to come forward but there is a moral obligation – imagine this was your friend or your son, you’ve got to come forward.” Orencas added: “There are multiple offenders involved in broad daylight. I simply don’t believe there isn’t information out there that can help me with the inquiry.”"
2021-01-25T16:44:23Z,uk-news,UK news,"Man, 19, who groomed and murdered schoolboy jailed for life","A 19-year-old man who groomed and then beat a schoolboy to death in some woods in Cheshire has been jailed for at least 28 years, for what the judge described as a carefully planned, premeditated murder. Matthew Mason, who killed 15-year-old Alex Rodda with a wrench after paying him more than £2,000 in an attempt to stop him revealing their sexual relationship, was sentenced to life imprisonment on Monday at Chester crown court. Sentencing Mason, Judge Stephen Everett said he was a selfish individual who had deliberately chosen the “devastating weapon” and secret spot in woods outside Ashley, near Altrincham, on 12 December 2019. He said that Mason, who was older and more emotionally mature than his victim, had groomed and encouraged the relationship with Rodda by sending him an explicit photo and a video.
“This was carefully planned and ruthlessly carried out, showing no empathy and a callous disregard for Alex, his family and friends,” the judge told Mason. Alex’s father, Adam Rodda, described his son as a loving boy with many school friends in a statement to the court. Lisa Rodda, Alex’s mother, said: “When you lose your child in the most horrific and brutal circumstances, as parents you really do experience hell.” Mason admitted beating Alex to death but denied murder, saying he had experienced a loss of control during the killing after being blackmailed by the younger teenager. The trial heard they had a brief sexual relationship before Alex told Mason’s then girlfriend that the older teenager had sent him explicit photos and messages. Mason, who lived with his family on a farm near Knutsford, Cheshire, claimed Alex had tried to attack him before his death. Mason told jurors he had asked friends and family for money to pay Alex but did not tell them what it was for. He said he was embarrassed and worried after having sex with the younger boy, adding that he thought it was wrong “because he was a male and, secondly, his age”. Evidence showed that Alex had been struck at least 15 times in what was described by the prosecution as a “brutal” attack. The court heard that after the attack Mason left the scene and went to a friend’s farm to clean up, and then to two pubs where he met friends – in part to form an alibi. The court heard Mason, who returned to the scene later that night, was arrested the following day after refuse collectors discovered Alex’s body. Mason was found guilty of murder by a majority of jurors at Chester crown court on 7 January."

Christopher Cox, from Cranleigh, in Surrey, is due to appear in court next month to face two counts of inciting prostitution for gain and one count of controlling prostitution for gain. The CPS believe the charges to be the first in relation to “sex-for-rent” allegations, where accommodation is offered free in return for sex. Revised CPS legal guidance was published in January 2019 to assist police and prosecutors considering such allegations. Claire Prodger, a senior crown prosecutor, said: “Following an investigation into so-called ‘sex-for-rent’ allegations, the CPS has authorised Surrey police to charge Christopher Cox with two counts of inciting prostitution for gain and one count of controlling prostitution for gain. “This is a complex case and we have reached the decision following a careful review of all the evidence gathered during this period. The charges arose out of an investigation by ITV researchers, passed to police in 2019, which resulted in further criminal inquiries.” Cox is due to appear at North Surrey magistrates court on 24 February."

The four, aged 21-36, appeared at Bristol magistrates court amid tight security after police warned demonstrators would be breaching lockdown restrictions if they gathered outside the court. A handful of people were detained outside or spoken to by police while scores of other supporters of the â€œColston Fourâ€� took part in a virtual protest, which was disrupted when someone â€œhijackedâ€� the feed and digitally scrawled the N-word across a speakerâ€™s face. Rhian Graham, 29, Jake Skuse, 36, and Sage Willoughby, 21, all from Bristol, and Milo Ponsford, 25, from Bishopstoke, Hampshire, are accused of â€œwith each other and others unknown without lawful excuseâ€� damaging the statue and plinth. The bronze memorial to the 17th-century slave merchant was pulled down during a Black Lives Matter protest on 7 June last year, before being dumped in Bristol Harbour. It was recovered from the water by Bristol city council. During the 15-minute hearing, the district judge Lynne Matthews said the case could be dealt with in a magistrates court but all four exercised their right for the case to be heard in a crown court. The four were given unconditional bail and told to appear before Bristol crown court on 8 February. Speaking ahead of the court hearing, a spokeswoman for Avon and Somerset police said anyone planning to attend to protest against the case would be breaking the law. Insp Rob Cheeseman said: â€œWe fully recognise the important right to freedom of expression and right to assemble but there is a deadly virus which has killed more than 90,000 people in the UK which simply cannot be ignored.â€� A virtual demonstration was disrupted during a speech by Dr Shawn Sobers, an academic.

2021-01-25T13:03:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Teenage asylum seeker in UK wins legal battle over 'unlawful' age assessment,"A Sudanese teenager who sought asylum in the UK as an unaccompanied child when he was 15 but was judged by the authorities to be 20 has won a legal battle against the council which was found to have “unlawfully” assessed his age. The boy, who is now 17 and cannot be identified for legal reasons, fled his village in western Darfur aged 11 having become separated from his parents during attacks by the Janjaweed Arab militia, and travelled to Libya, where he was forced to work in slavery on a farm. When he arrived in the UK in February 2019, having crossed the Mediterranean in a small boat with other refugees to Italy before travelling on to Spain, France and Belgium, he was initially treated as an adult by the Home Office, an upper tribunal hearing was told. The teenager, identified as AM in court documents, was placed in adult accommodation for three months. When Wirral council subsequently carried out an age assessment, he was judged to be “aged over 18 and likely to be aged 20”. AM’s case was taken up by lawyers who challenged the finding during the course of a two-day judicial review hearing in December. In a critical judgment against Wirral council, which was handed down earlier this month, Judge O’Callaghan, sitting in the upper tribunal immigration and asylum chamber, ruled the local authority’s assessment was “fundamentally unfair” and that the age assessment was “conducted unlawfully”. The ruling said the council’s age assessment “failed to abide by the procedural safeguards … establishing the ‘minimum standards’ of fairness”, criticised the council’s use of an unsuitable interpreter and said the reliance on physical appearance was “wholly incapable of sustaining the weight placed upon it”. The judgement said: “In the circumstances and being aware that an assessment as to age cannot be concluded with 100% accuracy I find, on balance, that the applicant is a young person aged under 18 and that he is truthful as to the date of his birth.” Unaccompanied child refugees in the UK are cared for by local authorities as looked-after children and as such are legally required to be in education or training until they are 18. The judgment ensures AM will be treated as a child in his asylum claim. Edward Taylor, a solicitor at Osbornes Law who has represented many young asylum seekers in age disputes and acted for AM, said: “Age assessment is a traumatic process for vulnerable young asylum seekers and should only be carried out where there is significant doubt over the individual’s age. I would urge all councils to review their practices in light of the judgment, in the interests of vulnerable individuals such as AM, and to better use public funds.” Taylor added: “I do feel that some local authorities feel pressure from a lack of resources, but of course at the forefront of their minds should be the vulnerable young person in front of them, and whether they may be a child as claimed. “I also worry about the many young individuals who do not manage to obtain legal advice, especially when there is a strict three-month deadline to bring a court challenge to an age assessment.” A spokesperson for Wirral council said the authority took its responsibility to help those seeking asylum in the UK very seriously and would be reviewing its processes. “Making an age assessment and doing it well is complex. This presents a national challenge for all children’s services. We regret not doing this work as well, on this occasion, as we would like. “However, we can confirm that the young person concerned has at all times, upon arrival in the Wirral area, been supported by the authority and received education and continues to do so.”"
2021-01-24T15:00:01Z,uk-news,UK news,Burns Night goes virtual: 'It might be even bigger this year',"It’s the night when Scots emerge from mid-winter hibernation, says the Burns scholar Pauline Mackay. On the poet’s birthday, 25 January, or thereabouts, thousands of societies, clubs and groups of friends across Scotland and around the world gather to celebrate the life and work of the national bard Robert Burns. The ritual elements of a Burns supper – addressing those gathered with his poem To a Haggis, completing several rounds of toasts and reading from the funny, sexy, radical diversity of his work – have remained constant since the first event was held by nine friends in 1801, five years after his death. “It’s always a lovely celebration at a difficult time of year, and I think that’s why people are going all out this year to celebrate in the depths of a hard lockdown,” says Mackay, a lecturer in Robert Burns studies at the University of Glasgow, whose new book, Burns for Every Day of the Year, offers daily glimpses into his life, times and works. “There are so many drives to get people together virtually, it might be even bigger this year.” Mackay’s colleagues at the Centre for Robert Burns Studies have sent out invitations to 2,000 addresses in more than 140 countries, including Scottish societies, pipe bands, Burns clubs, Scottish country dance group, museums, schools and universities, to contribute to their #VirtualBurnsNight. The aim is to create a map of Burns suppers around the world.
More than 2,600 tickets were sold to a UK and overseas audience for the National Trust for Scotland’s Burns Big Night In on Saturday, hosted by the DJ Edith Bowman from the cottage in Alloway, south Ayrshire, where the poet was born. On the opposite coast, a rotary club in Burntisland, Fife, welcomed more than 500 guests from around the UK and across the Atlantic after moving its traditional supper online. St Andrews University has 1,200 alumni and friends registered for its Global Burns Night on Monday, which features contributions from staff and students, including the rising star of Scots language poetry, Len Pennie. Nor is the momentum limited to Scotland: in Vancouver, Canada, the singer-songwriter Bruce Couglan was joined by 250 guests for his virtual celebration of the bard and his ballads last Friday. Couglan, who has toured Scotland a number of times, says: “You don’t have to be Scottish to love Robbie Burns. There is something universal about his work that has intrigued people of all walks of life for over two centuries. His words echo with such humanity and compassion that they’ve helped inspire sweeping social reform.” Mackay says: “He’s a poet who travels very well,” noting that Auld Lang Syne – with its sentiments of togetherness and friendship – is one of the world’s most famous songs, and especially poignant at a moment when separation is being endured on a global scale. “He has been translated into hundreds of different languages since the 19th century. A part of the reason Burns is celebrated all over the world is that his work is so diverse. He writes on everything: love, friendship, sex, politics, religion. He could write very seriously, but also with great humour.”
No Burns supper would be complete without a haggis, and the Scott Brothers family butcher in Dundee has seen a steep increase in demand for its post-a-haggis service this year. “There’s a little extra sentiment because of all that’s going on this year,” says the manager, Graeme Cairns. “We’ve had a steady stream of orders, with messages saying ‘sorry we can’t be with you this year but we’ll be together soon’.”"
2021-01-24T14:41:39Z,uk-news,UK news,Welsh language centre partners with Duolingo in million speaker goal,"An online language course created five years ago following a letter published in the Guardian is to be used to help reach a government target of a million Welsh speakers by 2050. Duolingo launched its Welsh language course in January 2016 and so far more than 1.5 million people around the world have been taught through it. Now Duolingo and the National Centre for Learning Welsh have announced they will work together to help the Welsh government reach its 1 million target. The Welsh government minister Eluned Morgan, whose portfolio includes the Welsh language, welcomed the partnership, saying: “We’ve set a goal of a million Welsh speakers by 2050, around a third of Wales’ current population, and in recent years we’ve seen a surge in demand for Welsh in early years and school-age learning.”
According to the latest government figures, 872,200 people in Wales speak Welsh, which is just under 29% of the population. The Duolingo Welsh course was launched after a language tutor, Richard Morse, and a Welsh learner, Kathy Dobbin, wrote to the Guardian suggesting the idea. Morse gathered a team of Welsh speakers and created the course, which launched on St Dwynwen’s Day, the Welsh equivalent of St Valentine’s Day, in 2016. Welsh is now the fastest-growing language being learned on Duolingo in the UK, with 474,000 people actively being taught. There are tens of thousands of learners in the US, and even one in Antarctica. Morse said he was pleased at how successful it had been. “There is a large Welsh diaspora, especially in England,” he said. “Also within Wales there are many older people remembering their parents or grandparents not transmitting the language to them because of the mistaken belief that the children’s English would suffer. “Within Wales there are many parents with children in Welsh-medium schools, a growing sector, who are time poor and don’t have the time to go to conventional classes but who want to learn some Welsh to help their children’s education. Duolingo’s focus on small discrete bits of learning to be done on a daily basis fits with so many people’s complicated lives.” Morse said he was surprised at the lack of official interest in the course in the first couple of years but he believed that the current Welsh government was more engaged. Efa Gruffudd Jones, the chief executive at the National Centre for Learning Welsh, said: “Creating and promoting opportunities for our learners to practise and enjoy their Welsh is an important part of our work at the National Centre and we’re delighted to be working in partnership with Duolingo.”"
2021-01-24T13:24:48Z,uk-news,UK news,"Snow brightens UK landscapes, but Covid precautions 'still necessary'","The gloom of lockdown was lifted on Sunday by the unfamiliar glow of snow in large parts of the UK, but police reminded the public to confine snowball fights to back gardens and household bubbles only. By midday on Sunday, much of the the UK including London, was blanketed in a thick layer of snow, with weather warnings for snow and ice extending to southern England. The Met Office put a yellow weather warning in place stretching from coast to coast in southern England and ending just south of Manchester. “Snow seems to bring out the big kid in everyone,” tweeted the minister for sport Nigel Huddleston with a video of him lobbing a snowball at a camera.
MPs from all parties posted snowy scenes with glee. “Who didn’t have some fun this morning?” said Lib Dem justice spokesperson Wera Hobhouse. While Labour’s Alex Davies-Jones posted: “Do you wanna build a snowman?” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, was also out enjoying the weather. He posted a video of his family’s golden retriever Luna spinning around the garden as the snow fell. “Luna is loving the snow and hoping it settles,” he said. But several police forces, such as Wandsworth in London, urged the public to confine snowman building and snowball fights to back gardens. Kingston police in west London urged people to stay inside. It tweeted: “It’s so beautiful to watch the snow fall from the comfort of your own home. Plus there’s a pandemic going on. #StaySafe in the #snowday by playing in the back garden!” Police in Rutland and Surrey questioned why people were sledging during lockdown. Gwent police in south Wales warned the public not to break the lockdown rules. “Please stay home, and do not meet up with other households,” it tweeted. Several forces, including Sandwell in the West Midlands, urged drivers to stay off the roads unless absolutely necessary. Merton police in south-west London went for humour, tweeting: “Sorry to be ‘that grumpy relative’ but with the snow coming down the way it is, please drive carefully. And if you’re going to have a snowball fight, please stick to your bubbles. Also do not eat yellow snow.” The Met Office warned the public to expect more snow and icy patches on untreated roads and pavements, with journeys by road and rail likely to be affected. The bad weather forced the closure of Covid testing centre in Lichfield, Brent and three mobile testing sites in Birmingham. It also prompted police to close Richmond Park in west London to traffic. Several roads were closed due to snow, including one lane of the A38 in Burton, Staffordshire. And the frozen conditions prompted a points failure in Wembley disrupting Southern rail services. The Met Office said: “Outbreaks of snow will continue over parts of north Wales, the Midlands, East Anglia and south-east England with some further significant accumulations causing disruption. Wintry showers will also affect western parts with local temporary accumulations and a risk of ice.” A similar warning is in place down the east coast of Scotland and covering most of the island of Ireland. The showers of sleet and snow are expected to die out, with a heavy frost due to set in across most parts of the country on Sunday evening."
2021-01-24T10:45:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Met police officer faces new hearing over death of mentally ill black man,"A senior police officer cleared of misconduct over the high-profile death of a mentally ill black man is to face fresh disciplinary proceedings because of failings in the original case, the Observer can reveal. After a misconduct meeting last year the officer – who has not been named – was told they had “no case to answer” over the death of Kevin Clarke, who was restrained by up to seven officers in south London in 2018. Clarke’s family and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) were, however, not notified about the hearing, where they would have been legally entitled to ask questions. Now the officer – after initially refusing – has signed an order agreeing to have the high court quash the original verdict, paving the way for fresh disciplinary proceedings. Clarke, 35, who was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia as a teenager, had been observed by police officers for 13 minutes while suffering a mental health episode as he lay on playing fields in Catford, south-east London. When he attempted to get to his knees he was restrained and handcuffed.
Police video reveals Clarke repeatedly told officers: “I can’t breathe.” An ambulance was called and Clarke was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at Lewisham hospital. An inquest verdict last October concluded the decision to restrain Clarke was inappropriate and contributed to his death. Cyrilia Davies Knight, solicitor for the Clarke family, said: “The family are pleased that the misconduct meeting will now take place again allowing them the opportunity to exercise their right to be present and ask questions. “But it was outrageous that the officer initially disputed the application to quash the misconduct decision, despite knowing there was a clear breach in the regulations.” His family also want other officers involved in the restraint of Clarke to face misconduct proceedings, saying they were “shocked and dismayed” this had not happened despite the evidence that emerged during the inquest. The development in the Clarke case coincides with a submission of evidence into the UN’s investigation into “systemic racism” and rights violations committed by police against black people. Launched in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the submission by the charity Inquest argues that entrenched issues of racism and policing are also evident in the UK. Clarke’s case is among a number, it says, that demonstrate law enforcement’s negative stereotyping of black people, noting that Clarke had displayed no signs of aggression towards officers who restrained him for 33 minutes. The 22-page document refers to a recent survey that found 85% of black people in the UK did not believe they would be treated the same way by police as a white person. Recent figures reveal that 7.7% of prisoners in England and Wales are black, despite being 3.4% of the population, and that black people are twice as likely as white people in the UK to die in custody. Of those deaths in custody, the use of force is a feature in more than twice as many cases as other deaths in custody. “Through an analysis of our casework, Inquest has identified that the racial stereotype of ‘big, black and dangerous’, ‘violent’ and ‘volatile’ when woven into the culture and practice of the police has been a recurring feature of deaths involving the use of force and restraint by police in the UK,” adds the submission. Deborah Coles, director of Inquest, said: “The UK claims transparency for its law enforcement and legal processes but our work tells a different story. We see a repetition of deaths of black people in police custody, raising concerns about structural racism, state violence, neglect and impunity.” Coles said she hoped the eventual UN report would make concrete recommendations to the UK. The Met said that a senior officer had apologised for the failure to notify Clarke’s family of the misconduct meeting."
2021-01-24T09:00:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Lissie Harper: ‘We had a lot to look forward to’,"At first glance Lissie Harper’s artfully curated Instagram page reflects an idyllic life. Photographs of her cuddling her cat and walking in meadows sit alongside others featuring holidays abroad, her hen night and her wedding to her childhood sweetheart, Andrew. Yet, the words accompanying some of the posts reveal her true story, one of grief and loss which began 18 months ago when Andrew, a police officer, was killed in the line of duty. Next to a picture of herself staring out to sea, Lissie notes: “Grief is like living two lives. One is where you pretend that everything is all right, and the other is where your heart silently screams in pain.” Accompanying a photo of her and Andrew kissing on their wedding day, posted on the anniversary of his funeral, she’s written: “‘I miss you’ doesn’t even come close to the hollowness that has encapsulated me these past 14 months. My life is missing its brightest spark.” The future she had envisaged as they exchanged vows in a stone temple in the grounds of a Georgian manor house in front of family and friends in July 2019 was obliterated a month later when Andrew was called out to reports of a quad bike theft in Sulhamstead, Berkshire. As he tried to stop three teenagers, his feet became tangled in a tow rope attached to the back of their getaway car and he was dragged along country lanes for more than a mile, suffering catastrophic, unsurvivable injuries. He was 28 years old. On a biting cold January afternoon, Lissie, is curled up on the sofa in her cosy 17th-century cottage in Oxfordshire explaining to me over Zoom how she’s coped in the aftermath. She lets out a long sigh. “I had two choices: sit and rock in the corner and fall apart or keep going.” Her support network is strong, she says, comprising close family, lots of friends and Andrew’s “amazing” colleagues. While the lockdowns have been tough because she can’t see people or take trips to distract her, in other ways she welcomed a break from the intense media interest that Andrew’s death and the subsequent court case of the three teenagers attracted. She excels at overthinking, she says. Her solution? “Keeping busy.” Lissie studied art at college and in her late 20s, after jobs painting ceramics and designing wedding cakes, she started a business, hand printing her work on to clothing and accessories. In recent months, however, she’s pushed herself out of her creative comfort zone and has become increasingly well-versed in the law – because she’s intent on introducing a new one. Harper’s Law, named after her husband, proposes a life sentence with a mandatory minimum term for anyone guilty of killing an emergency worker (including police officers, firefighters and paramedics among others) while committing a crime. Lissie’s decision to campaign for Harper’s Law – which has its fair share of critics – was born out of her frustration at the length of the sentences given to the young men who killed Andrew. Following a trial at the Old Bailey, the trio were cleared of murder, but convicted of manslaughter. The driver, Henry Long, 19, was jailed for 16 years, while his passengers, Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both 18, were sentenced to 13 years each. For Lissie, their punishment did not fit the crime – a view also held by the popular press and the attorney general Suella Braverman, who referred the jail terms to the court of appeal to consider whether they were too lenient. But just before Christmas, the appeal was dismissed by the judges, who said they fell within sentencing guidelines. It was another significant blow for Lissie. She had sat through the hearing, an ordeal heightened by the fact that at the same time Long, Bowers and Cole were asking the judge to reduce their manslaughter sentences (they failed). Their faces were beamed into the panelled court room in London’s Royal Courts of Justice via a live link from Belmarsh Prison. They appeared to Lissie to have no remorse. “It’s all a game to them, really. They haven’t changed; they were sitting there like nothing really matters.” Lissie is softly spoken and measured as she talks, but there’s a flash of the anger deep inside her when she explains how she tries not to think about her husband’s killers because – and here her voice rises and quickens – “I will never understand them.” She grew up in Oxfordshire with her older sister, younger brother and parents, Simon, who owns a car restoration company, and Julie, who works at a pet-rehoming centre, and began dating classmate Andrew at secondary school. They enjoyed what she calls “a simple life” filled with country walks, socialising with friends and family, and watching films. Andrew – whom she describes as “upbeat, kind and always joking about” – shared her love of travel and they took a career break in their mid-20s, visiting 14 countries, including Sri Lanka, Bali and Australia, over seven months. On their return they bought their one-bedroom cottage, enchanted by the wood-burning stove and beamed ceilings (they checked that Andrew, who stood at 6ft 5in to Lissie’s 5ft 3in, could clear them before they put in an offer). In 2017, on a trip to Sorrento, Italy, Andrew proposed as they walked along a cliff path at sunset. “We had a lot to look forward to,” Lissie says. The Court of Appeal’s decision strengthened Lissie’s determination to see Harper’s Law become a reality. In her view, the ruling “said it all – these are the guidelines that judges are working from and it’s not enough”. Lissie, who is working in conjunction with the Police Federation of England and Wales on the campaign, suggests that Harper’s Law might create a “separate conviction” or “new offence” to murder and manslaughter. She emphasises that they are not seeking whole-life sentences and have yet to decide what the mandatory minimum term should be.
She’s been working hard on building cross-party support, meeting the home secretary Priti Patel, and the shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds, among others. Lissie said: “We don’t want this to be some kind of political battle – that’s not what it’s about. I’m quite positive about the support we’re getting from both sides.” After the court of appeal’s decision, Patel reiterated her support, saying: “Robert Buckland [the justice secretary] and I are working together to look at the changes we can bring in law. We owe it to them [Andrew’s family] to give them justice.” As soon as it’s possible, the campaign team hopes to meet with lawyers and civil servants to thrash out the finer details, before publication of a final draft. “Writing a law is very complicated, I’ve come to know,” Lissie laughs. “We want to get that spot on and then we can use all the support we’ve got, including the cross-party support, to do the more political side of things.” Lobbying politicians, mugging up on the legal system, appearing on TV and radio to publicise her mission… It’s a far cry from what she thought she’d be doing at 30. She exhales loudly. “Yes! It’s a whole different world, going into the House of Commons and everything. At certain points I’ve thought it’s strange for me to be pushing this so much, but it has to be someone who’s really passionate about it and for whom it’s personal.” She’s buoyed up by the 750,000 people who’ve signed a petition calling for Harper’s Law, although she realises support for it is not universal. The former deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Stephen Roberts, has said it won’t act as a deterrent and that judges should be able to exercise discretion. Others believe victims should be treated equally, emergency worker or not. Lissie rejects these points. “We’re not saying that a police officer deserves more, it’s not about that. It’s about giving them a level of protection that they don’t have and also, potentially, it being some kind of deterrent. At the moment there’s nothing, and there’s little respect. Anything to make people want to carry on doing these dangerous jobs… I think it’s the least we can try and do. “If people lead a life of crime and see their friends or family commit a crime, go to court and get a lenient sentence, that will have some kind of effect in terms of, ‘They did that, they got away with it.’” Some lawyers point out that guilt in offences of manslaughter is wildly variable, ranging from the horrific circumstances of Andrew’s death to the throwing of a bottle into a crowd which kills an emergency worker. “That will be very finely written into the legal side of things,” Lissie says. “If something is an accident, then it will be dealt with by different legislation. There’s got to be a level of culpability, a level of intent – somebody has to go out and commit a crime and sod what happens to anyone – that’s the key to this sort of legislation.” When Lissie used to worry about the dangers of Andrew’s job, she consoled herself by thinking that he was always “so strong, capable and fearless”. Ultimately, these attributes couldn’t save him. “That’s why I’m pushing for Harper’s Law,” she says, “to give protection to the people who protect us.”"
2021-01-24T06:44:38Z,uk-news,UK news,Sworn enemies: the real story of Old Bailey clash that ruined Oscar Wilde,"He was the brilliant lawyer whose brutal 1895 cross-examination of Oscar Wilde in one of the most famous trials in British history led to the Irish dramatist’s imprisonment for homosexuality, and to his ultimate ruin. Now a previously unpublished letter reveals that Sir Edward Carson’s attack on Wilde in the Old Bailey was partly personal – a loathing that went beyond his job in defending the Marquess of Queensberry in the ill-fated libel case. Long after Carson’s death in 1935, the son of one of his friends confided in a 1950 letter: “I was never able to get Carson to admit that Wilde possessed any ability at all. ‘Ah,’ he used to say angrily, ‘he was a charlatan.’” Carson’s disdain left no room for even a grudging acknowledgement of the genius whose comic masterpieces include The Importance of Being Earnest and Lady Windermere’s Fan.
The letter, written by the earl of Birkenhead, has been unearthed by Wilde’s grandson, Merlin Holland, in researching a BBC Northern Ireland documentary, Edward Carson and the Fall of Oscar Wilde. The programme includes contributions from actors Rupert Everett, who made the 2018 film The Happy Prince about Wilde’s tragic final years in exile, and Simon Callow, who has given dramatic readings from the libel trial. Holland was taken aback by the letter. He had always struggled to understand why Carson was so vicious towards Wilde in court, considering they had played together as children in Ireland, meeting again as students at Trinity College, Dublin, and in London. As the respective sons of a surgeon and an architect, Wilde and Carson were both born in 1854 to affluent Irish Protestant families in Dublin, and lived just a few streets apart. Their epic Old Bailey clash followed Wilde’s decision to sue Lord Queensberry, who accused him of being a “sodomite” after discovering that his son, Lord Alfred “Bosie” Douglas, was Wilde’s young lover. At the Old Bailey, Carson repeatedly questioned him over his “improprieties” with young men, including a “boy you might pick up in the street”. Exasperated, Wilde replied: “I recognise no social distinctions at all of any kind; and to me youth, the mere fact of youth, is so wonderful that I’d sooner talk to a young man for half-an-hour than be… well, cross-examined in court.” Holland told the Observer that Birkenhead’s letter reveals the extent of Carson’s loathing: “His distaste for Oscar betraying his own social class – consorting with people from the lower classes, as he’d have seen it – was almost as strong as his feelings of disgust about what Oscar had done.” The case led to Wilde’s conviction for gross indecency and two years in prison from 1895. Once the toast of London society, he died in abject poverty in Paris in 1900, aged 46. Carson went on to enjoy a glittering political career as the leader of unionism, and architect of Irish partition, and was dubbed “father of Northern Ireland”. Holland’s books on Wilde include the Irish Peacock & Scarlet Marquess, the definitive account of the libel trial. In making the documentary, he stumbled across the letter in the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland in Belfast. It was written by the second earl of Birkenhead to Montgomery Hyde, one of Wilde’s biographers and a noted collector, who had contacted him requesting information for a book on Carson, who was a friend of the first earl. When Wilde heard who would be cross-examining him, he clearly feared the worst, telling his lawyer that Carson would “no doubt perform his task with all the added bitterness of an old friend”.
But Birkenhead’s letter suggests that, with his friends, Wilde made light of his fears: “When Wilde was told he was going to be opposed by Carson, his old and by no means successful rival [as students], he thought this a great joke and went round telling all his friends, ‘I am going to be cross-examined by old Ned Carson.’ Wilde’s optimism … was fully justified by his dialectical superiority and it was not until Carson had abandoned … argument and produced one after another [of] his damning witnesses, that Wilde collapsed.” Holland was all the more astonished by the letter as Birkenhead was his own godfather, and he had no idea that he had known Carson: “It would have been totally fascinating to be able to talk to him about that disastrous trial.” Following Wilde’s imprisonment, his wife, Constance, left England with their two sons and changed the family name to Holland. In the documentary, his grandson discusses the family’s shame: “I can remember my mother saying to me in the 1950s, ‘If anybody asks you if you are the grandson of Oscar Wilde, you just say yes and conveniently change the subject.’” He noted that the trial might have had a different outcome if Carson had taken up Wilde’s invitation to dine with him at his Chelsea home, but a date was never set: “What if he had dined with him, as Carson was known to have refused either to defend or prosecute people from whom he had taken hospitality? Had he come to dinner, he would never have appeared for Queensberry. “This is one of the great what-ifs of history and not generally known. One has to admire Carson for doing a very good job, and I don’t personally feel any resentment towards him.” The documentary, a BBC Northern Ireland (NI) film for its new arts season, is available on BBC iPlayer ahead of its screening on BBC One Northern Ireland on 1 February, 10.45pm."
2021-01-23T21:26:51Z,uk-news,UK news,UK asylum seekers told claims at risk if they ‘misbehave’,"People held at temporary Home Office refugee camps are being threatened that their asylum claims will be harmed if they “misbehave”, according to testimony from site residents. A series of statements from asylum seekers inside the camps, anonymised to protect them from possible reprisals, allege they have been told by staff employed by private contractors that their asylum application will be jeopardised for speaking out about conditions or going on hunger strike. One alleged he was told that if he complained about the food his name would be added to a “blacklist” that contractors shared with the Home Office and would “affect his claim”. Others said they were told their asylum claim would be impaired if they did not return to their accommodation – a disused military training camp – by 10pm. Asylum is a human right backed by the UN Refugee Convention and assessed in the UK using agreed screening processes and Home Office immigration caseworkers. Refugee groups familiar with the camps described the issuing of asylum threats as “systemic” and called on the Home Office to stop private contractors “weaponising” asylum applications from persons fleeing persecution or conflict. Under instruction of the home secretary, Priti Patel, the Home Office has hastily developed a network of temporary accommodation to hold individuals as they wait for a decision on their claims for asylum. Two military barracks in Kent and south Wales and a number of hotels were seconded by the Home Office last September with their day-to-day running outsourced to a private contractor called Clearsprings. Another refugee camp opened in Bedfordshire last week and more are planned. One resident at Napier barracks near Folkestone, which holds 400 men and is currently in lockdown following a large Covid outbreak, alleged they were told by staff that their asylum claims would be harmed if they pressed ahead with a hunger strike over camp conditions. “If you request something that you believe is your right, they [staff] threaten you and say we will tell the Home Office, and it will affect your claim,” he added. A Whatsapp message from another Napier resident revealed they had been told by staff that if they told the media about concerns with their accommodation their asylum claim would be impacted. Others at Napier claimed staff had introduced a night curfew and warned that anyone breaching it risked undermining their claim for asylum. “Residents have reported that if they are not back by 10pm, the staff will inform the Home Office and it will affect their claim,” reports a witness statement. At Penally barracks in Pembrokeshire, where another 200 asylum seekers are staying in heavily criticised conditions, residents allege they have received similar threats. One claimed that between 30 and 40 individuals linked to an organisation set up by residents to assist others had received letters warning that any misbehaviour would be reported to the Home Office. “We are very worried that our asylum claim will be affected by your actions,” he told the Observer. Another asylum seeker at a facility run by private firm Clearsprings said they felt intimidated. “You are not aware of your rights. You are afraid of doing or saying anything. They tell us it will affect our claim,” one said in a witness statement. A letter seen by the Observer also revealed that those at Penally who are deemed to have breached regulations stipulating “they behave at all times in a reasonable manner” would be reported to the Home Office “and a copy of this letter will be held on your file”. Maddie Harris from Human for Rights Network, which documents violations against asylum seekers, said: “We have consistently heard from asylum seekers that their asylum applications are being weaponised by private contractors tasked with running these accommodations on behalf of the Home Office.” She added: “The Home Office must immediately ensure its contractors are not threatening or intimidating those they are responsible for protecting and ensure accountability for staff members who are responsible for this treatment.”
Jennifer Blair, who works with survivors of torture and human trafficking as co-head of legal protection at the Helen Bamber Foundation, said that relations were deteriorating between residents and staff. “Tensions are increasing between residents and staff and there are reports that some residents have been left feeling very fearful and unable to safeguard themselves.” Blair added that the mental health of residents was reaching “crisis” point and that regular reports of self-harm or suicidal ideation were being received from the camps. Chris Philp, the immigration compliance minister, said: “We expect all asylum seekers in receipt of asylum support to abide by the conditions of that support and current UK law. “The government takes the wellbeing of asylum seekers extremely seriously. We are required by law to house asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute, and we provide safe, warm, Covid-secure suitable accommodation where they receive three meals a day while their claims are being processed.” Clearsprings declined to comment."
2021-01-22T19:39:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Prince Harry says social media misinformation is threat to democracies,"Prince Harry has said that “time is running out” for social media companies to address misinformation which he believes is a threat to democracies. He has called for more accountability for platforms, accusing them of shunning responsibility, and highlighted both the role that they played in the US Capitol riots earlier this month and the treatment of the Rohingya population in Myanmar. Prince Harry, who also spoke about the online “harassment” that he and his wife Meghan have faced, told website Fast Company: “We have seen time and again what happens when the real-world cost of misinformation is disregarded. “There is no way to downplay this. There was a literal attack on democracy in the United States, organised on social media, which is an issue of violent extremism. “It is widely acknowledged that social media played a role in the genocide in Myanmar and was used as a vehicle to incite violence against the Rohingya people, which is a human rights issue. “And in Brazil, social media provided a conduit for misinformation which ultimately brought destruction to the Amazon, which is an environmental and global health issue. “In a way, taking a predominately hands-off approach to problems for so long is itself an exercise in power.”
Prince Harry, 36, said that “we are losing loved ones to conspiracy theories, losing a sense of self because of the barrage of mistruths, and at the largest scale, losing our democracies.” He added: “The answer I’ve heard from experts in this space is that the common denominator starts with accountability. “There has to be accountability to collective wellbeing, not just financial incentive. “It’s hard for me to understand how the platforms themselves can eagerly take profit but shun responsibility.” The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped down as senior royals last March and moved to Los Angeles with their son Archie. Meghan, 39, has previously spoken of the difficulties of coping through pregnancy and the early stages of motherhood amid the pressures of press interest in her public life as a member of the royal family. On the treatment they have faced from sections of the media, Prince Harry said: “I was really surprised to witness how my story had been told one way, my wife’s story had been told one way, and then our union sparked something that made the telling of that story very different. “That false narrative became the mothership for all of the harassment you’re referring to. It wouldn’t have even begun had our story just been told truthfully.”"
2021-01-22T18:31:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Unite calls special meeting over alleged overspend on £50m building project,"Unite, Labour’s most generous backer, is organising a special meeting of its ruling body to discuss an alleged overspend on a multimillion pound construction project funded by the union. The executive council will convene on Friday 29 January to discuss a seven-storey hotel and national conference centre in Birmingham funded by the union. The contract to build the project was awarded to the Flanagan Group, a Liverpool company run by an associate of Len McCluskey, the union’s general secretary. Another contract on the project was given to a company owned by the son of Joe Anderson, Liverpool’s mayor. The Flanagan Group is under investigation by Merseyside police in connection with Operation Aloft, an inquiry into the sale of council-owned land in Liverpool to developers. Paul Flanagan, head of the group, was arrested in September on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery. Anderson and his son David have also been arrested. Following a report in the Times, the union vehemently denied any wrongdoing. It said there was no connection between the Merseyside investigation and the Birmingham project and that McCluskey had had nothing to do with the tendering process. Executive members will expect to hear from McCluskey and other key officials about the building, which includes a 170-bedroom Marriott-branded hotel, a conference room, an education centre and regional offices for the union. Reports in 2015 said the building would cost the union £35m, money it would recover by hiring out conference facilities and by holding its own conferences on the site in Birmingham Science Park, Aston.
According to the Times, in 2012 senior members of the union had been told that the total cost of the Birmingham development would be £7m, but that the total costs were now more than £50m. A leaked email to executive members on Thursday said: “Following on from the statement circulated last weekend regarding the Birmingham project, a special meeting of the executive council has been convened for Friday 29th January commencing at 12 noon.” Another email sent last week to executive members said a proposal to discuss the Birmingham project in March would be brought forward after the allegations in The Times. McCluskey, who will step down next year, was one of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s closest allies and has criticised Sir Keir Starmer over his decision to pay damages to ex-staffers who said the party had not dealt with antisemitism. Unite has cut its support to Labour since the decision. Labour will be watching the leadership contest closely, with two candidates from the left, Howard Beckett and Steve Turner, expected to stand. Gerard Coyne, a Starmer supporter who narrowly lost to McCluskey in 2017, said this month that he would stand again. Unite said the union was proud of the conference facility, which was a sensible investment for the future, and that there were “misrepresentative reports” relating to the general secretary’s election later this year. “At every stage of this facility’s development there have been clear and consistent tendering requirements, with progress reported regularly to the union’s executive council,” Unite said. “Figures have been reported that are inaccurate and used without verification. The figure of £7m, for example, is a misunderstanding in one of the minutes of an executive council meeting. “There is an attempt to create an impression of a connection between Unite and the criminal investigations taking place in the city of Liverpool on the basis of no evidence whatsoever. There is absolutely no link between the union or any of its officials with those investigations.” It added: “Unite’s Birmingham complex is a world-class facility, built to the highest standards using unionised workers and it will help to regenerate a derelict area of England’s second city. Those who seek to misrepresent this project do so to advance their own agenda relating to the election for general secretary which will take place this year. They have an established disregard for the truth. “Unite is focused solely on protecting its members during the current pandemic crisis. It does so effectively because its financial strength and democratic governance is second to none in the trade union movement.”"
2021-01-22T17:58:57Z,uk-news,UK news,Organisers of London wedding attended by 150 face Covid fine,"The organiser of a lockdown-breaching wedding at an ultra-Orthodox Jewish girls’ school in north London attended by more than 100 people has been condemned by community leaders. Police discovered about 150 guests celebrating the wedding on Thursday evening. The windows of Yesodey Hatorah school in Stamford Hill had been covered to stop people seeing in when officers arrived. It was initially thought that up to 400 had attended. Many guests fled when police arrived after receiving reports of a large gathering. Five people were handed £100 fixed penalty notices for breaching Covid regulations and the organiser could face a £10,000 fine, the Metropolitan police said. The lockdown breach was swiftly condemned by the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis. “This is a most shameful desecration of all that we hold dear. At a time when we are all making such great sacrifices, it amounts to a brazen abrogation of the responsibility to protect life and such illegal behaviour is abhorred by the overwhelming majority of the Jewish community,” he tweeted. A spokesperson for the school said: “We are absolutely horrified about last night’s event and condemn it in the strongest possible terms. We lease our hall to an external organisation which manages all lettings and, as such, we had no knowledge that the wedding was taking place. We have terminated the agreement with immediate effect. “We are investigating how this shocking breach has happened and have no plans to re-lease the premises to any third party. We deplore the actions of anyone in any community breaking the law and risking people’s lives in this way.” The Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations, an umbrella organisation representing ultra-Orthodox groups, said in a statement: “We are shocked and deeply saddened by last night’s events which are shameful for our community. There are no excuses for anyone to endanger the community and the wider public in such a careless manner. “We will continue to work with the police and the community and we reiterate the importance everyone has to play in order to protect the NHS and save lives.”
The Board of Deputies of British Jews condemned the wedding as a “flagrant and disgraceful breach of Covid-19 regulations, which goes against Jewish teaching that preserving life is of the highest value”. Marie van der Zyl, the board’s president, said: “The reckless and dangerous behaviour of those behind this event does not represent the attitude of the vast majority of British Jews, including from within the strictly Orthodox community, who are fully aware of the terrible toll of this pandemic.” Yesodey Hatorah is a faith school serving Stamford Hill’s Haredi Jewish community, which is the largest in Europe. It is in the borough of Hackney, which has a Covid infection rate of 625.43 cases per 100,000 people, compared with an average rate in England of 471.31 per 100,000 people. DCS Marcus Barnett, the local area commander, said: “This was a completely unacceptable breach of the law, which is very clearly in place to save lives and protect the NHS – an NHS that is under considerable pressure at a time when Covid-19 has killed nearly 100,000 people. “This is a deadly and very dangerous disease. We can all see that and we must act responsibly. People across the country are making sacrifices by cancelling or postponing weddings and other celebrations and there is no excuse for this type of behaviour. My officers are working tirelessly with the community and we will not hesitate to take enforcement action if that is required to keep people safe.” The mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, said the incident was a “deeply disturbing incident at a time when in Hackney we have seen the largest number of deaths reported since last April”. He added: “Unfortunately, similar events have taken place even at this venue before and we need to be really clear how unacceptable it is.” There have been reports of breaches of lockdown restrictions in ultra-Orthodox communities in the UK, US and Israel over the past 10 months, including weddings and funerals attended by large numbers of people. Ultra-Orthodox Jews have suffered disproportionate numbers of deaths during the pandemic, partly as a result of large intergenerational households and difficulties in transmitting messages to communities reluctant to engage with the internet or mainstream media."
2021-01-22T17:17:16Z,uk-news,UK news,UK weather: country due sub-zero temperatures as Arctic air sweeps in,"Britain is braced for sub-zero temperatures as a cold blast of Arctic air sweeps the country in the aftermath of Storm Christoph. The Met Office said snow and ice would cause travel disruption in large parts of the country as temperatures drop as low as -10c in Scotland and -7c in parts of northern England. The freezing conditions are likely to hamper the cleanup effort from Storm Christoph, which caused the flooding of about 550 properties in northern England and Wales. Care home residents were among those evacuated in several areas across Cheshire this week, while a helicopter crew rescued a family trapped in their home because of fast-flowing flood water in Wales. Forecasters warned that river levels remained “exceptionally high” in parts of northern and central England, where a month’s worth of rain fell on already-saturated ground in just 48 hours in some areas. Dr Kate Marks, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said the record river levels could bring flooding at the weekend, particularly along parts of the River Severn, with the risk of damage to buildings in some communities. She said the north-west of England, which was badly hit by Storm Christoph, faced further flood damage next week with more rain on the way. She added: “We urge people to keep away from swollen rivers and not to drive through flood water – it is often deeper than it looks and just 30cm of flowing water is enough to float your car.” Yellow weather warnings are in place for snow and ice across Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and large swathes of north and west England from 4pm on Friday until 10.30am on Saturday. In England, one severe flood warning, indicating danger to life, remains in place at the River Dee at Farndon but a further 137 flood warnings have been issued. Natural Resources Wales has issued a severe flood warning for the Lower Dee Valley from Llangollen to Trevalyn Meadows and three flood warnings for other parts of the country. Storm Christoph brought record breaking levels of rain to parts of England. Provisional figures show Honister, in Cumbria, received 123.8mm of rainfall on Tuesday, a new daily rainfall record for this winter. Redcar and Cleveland received more than its average January rainfall in just a 48-hour period. Steve Willington, Met Office chief meteorologist, said large parts of the UK would see snow and ice into the weekend. • This article was amended on 29 January 2021. An earlier version referred to Met Office rainfall data from “Cleveland, in North Yorkshire”. This has been corrected to Redcar and Cleveland, the unitary authority area that lies within the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire."
2021-01-22T14:46:38Z,uk-news,UK news,People-smuggling gang members jailed over Essex lorry deaths,"The two ringleaders of the people-smuggling gang responsible for the deaths of 39 Vietnamese people who suffocated in a sealed refrigeration container as they were transported across the Channel from France have received prison sentences of 27 and 20 years. Ronan Hughes, 41, who ran a haulage company and organised the lorries and drivers to transport the migrants, was sentenced to 20 years at the Old Bailey on Friday. He pleaded guilty last year to 39 counts of manslaughter and conspiring to bring people into the country unlawfully. Hughes, an Irish haulier, alternated between legitimate shipments of waffles, soft drinks and wine from warehouses across Europe and illegal smuggling of alcohol, cigarettes and people. His co-conspirator Gheorghe Nica, 43, a Romanian lorry mechanic who helped coordinate the transport of the migrants, and who was found guilty last year of manslaughter and people-smuggling, was sentenced by Mr Justice Sweeney to 27 years in prison. Maurice Robinson, 26, the lorry driver from Northern Ireland who collected the container containing the 39 people from the port in Essex in October 2019, and also pleaded guilty last year to manslaughter and people-smuggling, was sentenced to 13 years and four months.
He was paid £25,000 in cash to pick up the container and had been instructed by Hughes to open the lorry trailer to give the migrants air shortly after collecting it from Purfleet docks, but he found they were all dead. He waited 20 minutes before calling emergency services. A cloud of steam that emerged from the trailer, caught on CCTV, “spoke volumes of the heat that was still inside the trailer”, the judge said. The victims were 28 men, eight women and three children, two of them aged 15. When it became obvious that there was insufficient oxygen they made desperate attempts to escape through the roof of the lorry, and tried to call emergency services in Vietnam. As they began to die inside the dark container, where the temperature had risen to 38.5C, they recorded farewell messages for their relatives. They died “excruciatingly slow deaths”, the judge said, of asphyxia and hyperthermia, or overheating. Sweeney said there was a need for deterrent sentences because “the control of immigration, which affects the social fabric of our country, our economy and our security is an area of considerable public concern”. Lorry driver Eamonn Harrison, 24, also from Northern Ireland, who collected the migrants in northern France and drove the container to Zeebrugge, was found guilty of people-smuggling and 39 counts of manslaughter in December. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison.
The four defendants charged with manslaughter all said they had not intended harm to the victims, but the judge noted that the conspiracy was committed for financial gain. Christopher Kennedy, 24, another lorry driver from Northern Ireland who was involved in earlier people-smuggling runs bringing Vietnamese migrants from Northern Ireland, was sentenced to seven years. The trial exposed for the first time a complex and lucrative operation which has for years illegally brought Vietnamese people into the UK. Each passenger paid smugglers between £10,000 and £13,000 to be brought from northern France. The prosecution described the people-smuggling conspiracy as “sophisticated, long-running and profitable”. The trial focused on four people-smuggling runs by the gang in the space of just a fortnight in October 2019 which, if they had all been successful, would have brought more than 80 Vietnamese migrants into the UK and netted the organisers £800,000. The families of many of the victims had mortgaged their land to pay fees of up to £30,000 to people smugglers to take them in stages to the UK; the trial only focused on the final leg of the journey between France and Britain. Relatives said the victims had hoped to take up work in restaurants and nail bars in Britain, and planned to send their earnings home to help support their families. Parents of one of the youngest victims, Nguyen Huy Hung, who was 15 when he died, paid tribute to their “peaceful and smart” son. “He loved football very much and he loved UK teams as well as the Champions League. He was also a good player. He always dreamed of going to the UK and he tried very hard to study at school as well as learning English for that purpose. His loss is so sudden for us. He did not have a chance to fulfil his dream,” they said in a statement. Some of the victims reassured their anxious families that they had paid extra for a so-called VIP journey to the UK – which meant the lorry driver was helping them to cross the border, and there was no need for them to break into vehicles and stow themselves away. However the involvement of the lorry drivers offered them no protection when too many people were packed into one container. The chief constable of Essex police, Ben-Julian Harrington, said this was the biggest operation in his force’s history. “On 23 October 2019 we were called to a scene that no officer could ever have prepared for. Every person in that trailer had left behind a family. They had been promised safe passage to our shores and they were lied to. They were left to die, all because of the greed of the men who have been sentenced today.” The home secretary, Priti Patel, said: “The inhumanity of these callous people smugglers and their dangerous organised criminal networks has rightly been reflected in the sentencing today.” Valentin Calota, 38, a pickup driver from Romania, who collected migrants from the lorry drop-off spot in Essex and drove them to London during an earlier consignment, was sentenced to four and a half years. Alexandru Hanga, 28, who performed a similar role on one occasion in October 2019, and who last year pleaded guilty to conspiracy to assist unlawful migration, was sentenced to three years in prison."
2021-01-22T13:04:05Z,uk-news,UK news,"Census to go ahead in England and Wales in March despite Covid, says ONS","The Office for National Statistics has insisted the 2021 census for England and Wales will go ahead in March, despite the possible risk of spreading Covid. The agency said the impact of coronavirus and Brexit meant it was more important than ever to conduct the census as planned on 21 March. It added that postponing it would cost an estimated £360m. A team of 30,000 field workers, who will be sent to homes to remind people to complete the forms, will be given regular lateral flow tests for the virus to mitigate the risks. The head of the census, Pete Benton, said: “They’ll be tested twice a week for coronavirus. And of course, they won’t go out if they have a positive test. We’re just working through the details of that at the moment.” The ONS is hoping that at least 75% of the UK’s 26m households will complete the survey online. But it anticipates that about 6m households will require follow-up visits to offer reminders and advice. Benton stressed that the field workers would be issued with PPE and would not enter anyone’s home. He said: “It’s really no different from somebody delivering a parcel or a takeaway meal. Staff will be safe and socially distant and we’ve judged the risk to be manageable. “There’s never been a more important time to have a census. We’ve been living with coronavirus for a year, which has had all kinds of impacts, and we’ve just left the European Union. Understanding where we are now as a nation really is fundamental to how we plan our way forward and how we monitor progress. And so it’s critical to understand who we are, and the census will paint that picture now.” He added: “Our paramount consideration is: can we keep the public safe? Can we keep our field staff safe? And can we produce good statistics? And the answer to all of those questions as we reviewed it with experts is: yes, we can.” Benton said the visits would be no longer than “just minutes”. He added: “Some may need some advice about how to access this system, we can provide that advice verbally. And for those that want it we can hand over a paper questionnaire, or if they prefer they can phone our call centres to order one. So it’s a very brief conversation.” The ONS will not impose any age limit on those conducting the field work. Benton said: “It’s up to people to choose to apply, people will make their own judgment. We’re not putting constraints on that. The requirement is for people to be able to use a phone, and to be able to have a polite conversation on the doorstep.” This week, Glastonbury music festival was cancelled for a second year and there have been fresh calls to reschedule the already postponed Tokyo Olympics. And last year Scotland’s census was postponed until March 2022. But the ONS decided against postponing the census. A delay would involve waiting a year, because the census needs to take place in late March to allow sufficient hours of daylight for field workers to conduct doorstep visits. Benton said the decision to go ahead was approved by the Cabinet Office. Asked if the government could yet call it off, Benton said: “I’m not expecting that to happen. We’ve continued to work with government and ensure that we are continuing to adhere to government guidance.” Tony Vose, a former census worker, questioned the decision. He said: “I can see no justification in not postponing the 2021 census whilst in the middle of this crisis. Many of the part-time staff are likely to be over 60. How can the government issue instructions on safety measures to avoid spreading Covid-19, and be complicit in letting this go ahead? “There is no logical reason why this cannot be postponed in the same way that the elections in May 2020 were.”"
2021-01-22T12:56:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Scottish environment agency still struggling against cyber-attack,"Officials at the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) have warned a cyber-attack that led to the theft of thousands of confidential documents and shut down key operations has still not ended. The ransomware attack on Sepa, where criminals seized about 1.2GB of confidential data in an attempt to extort money for its return, began on Christmas Eve. The thieves have begun posting the stolen data online and are continuing to demand a payment from Sepa. The agency estimates at least 4,000 documents have been taken but says it may never know the true extent of the theft. It includes personal information about Sepa staff, contract and procurement documents, pollution permits, enforcement notices and commercial work with overseas agencies. Terry A’Hearn, Sepa’s chief executive, said the attackers were believed to be international cybercriminals who had deliberately targeted the agency. Sepa had rejected demands for a fee to remove the stolen data from the internet, he said. “We’ve been clear that we won’t use public finance to pay serious and organised criminals intent on disrupting public services and extorting public funds,” A’Hearn said. Sepa has been forced to prioritise a handful of essential services, including flood protection and priority anti-pollution operations, and has been unable to carry out nearly all its routine work. That included updating recent rainfall data on its flood warning website, which published four flood alerts on Thursday linked to Storm Cristoph. Cybercriminals routinely attack public agencies in an attempt to take control of sensitive computer systems or steal data, and then extort money to release the systems or delete the stolen material. In 2017, tens of thousands of businesses and public bodies in up to 100 countries worldwide, including scores of hospitals in the UK, were hit in the WannaCry ransomware attack that exploited weaknesses in Microsoft Windows systems. A’Hearn said that four weeks after the attack started, Police Scotland and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre had still not been able to resolve it. Sepa said in mid-January many of its computer systems would be badly affected for months, and some may need to be replaced. “Sadly we’re not the first and won’t be the last national organisation targeted by likely international crime groups. We’ve said that whilst for the time being we’ve lost access to most of our systems, including things as basic as our email system, what we haven’t lost is our 1,200 expert staff. “Through their knowledge, skills and experience we’ve adapted and since day one continued to provide priority regulatory, monitoring, flood forecasting and warning services. Whilst some systems and services may be badly affected for some time, step by step we’re working to assess and consider how we recover.”"
2021-01-22T10:14:04Z,uk-news,UK news,G7 in Cornwall: joy and concern as Carbis Bay chosen to host summit,"Carly White was taking her sons, Harry, eight, and Finley, two, for their daily stroll on Carbis Bay beach. A seal bobbed up as she pondered the prospect of world leaders including Joe Biden heading to this faraway corner of Cornwall for the G7 summit in June. “I’m excited, surprised and nervous. It will be a boost for the economy. The bars, restaurants and hotels are excited but I’m imagining road blocks and loads of police armed with guns. There is bound to be disruption. By and large, Cornish people don’t relish change.” White’s wedding reception took place at the Carbis Bay hotel and estate, the main site for the summit. “It’s odd to think of some of the most powerful people in the world sitting there,” she said. The announcement that Carbis Bay (population about 4,000) will host the summit has been greeted with a mixture of joy and concern in the far south-west of Britain.
The UK government and Cornwall council highlight the economic benefits but there are also worries. Will the ring of steel that will be thrown around the village cause mayhem? How will Biden’s cavalcade negotiate these tiny lanes? Will the broadband cope? Might the influx of delegates, entourages and media cause a Covid spike? And what about the protesters who will flock here? “There will be short-term pain, there’s no doubt,” said Glenn Eldridge, who owns the Ocean Sports Centre on the beach. “But we’ve had so many challenges over the last year. I think we’ll cope.” Eldridge was checking on his six-person Hawaiian canoe. “Wouldn’t it be amazing if Angela Merkel came and had a trip out on one of these?”
Linda Taylor, the Conservative councillor for Lelant and Carbis Bay, loves the idea of Air Force One landing at Newquay airport on the north Cornish coast but hopes the US president will slow down, fall into the Cornish way and do things “dreckly”, a south-west version of “directly” – which, like the Spanish use of mañana, means at some unspecified future time, or possibly never. “I’d like a nice cup of coffee with Mr Biden to get to know what he is all about.” The world leaders might be surprised at the sight of their destination at the moment. The estate, where visitors pay the best part of £1,000 a night for beachside lodges, has the feel of a building site rather than a luxury retreat. A two-storey spa extension featuring a new gym, treatment rooms and infinity pool is under construction. For understandable reasons, nobody is saying exactly where the leaders will sleep. The lodges have hot tubs and spectacular views over the Atlantic but are not huge and not particularly private. It is hard to picture Biden, Merkel and Boris Johnson relaxing in their respective hot tubs a few metres apart.
Not all recent online reviews for the resort have been kind. One guest complained: “Pool closed, spa closed … random people pacing back and forth what is supposed to be a private walkway.” The resort is not popular with all neighbours. The main hotel building is a traditional 19th-century affair but the modern beachside development has been compared by some to a tacky Spanish resort – “Costa Del Cornwall”. One wag nicknamed the concrete sea defences the “Trump wall”. Carbis Bay Hotel was awarded the AA eco hotel of the year in 2019, a spokesperson for the hotel said, and was the “first hotel in the world to install pathways made from recycled ocean plastics along with onsite CHP (combined heat and power units) providing huge carbon savings which highlights our commitment to the bay, our environment and our community. We work closely with our local community, providing year round employment opportunities and supporting local businesses.”
But Hugo Tagholm, the chief execuitive of the marine conservation charity Surfers Against Sewage (SAS), which is based a few miles up the coast, expressed delight that the summit would be staged on the ocean. “It’s an incredible opportunity for Cornwall. Decisions made here at the G7 and later at Cop26 [to be held in Glasgow in November] will set the world’s course on how we tackle climate change, protect the world’s environment and create a more sustainable future.” In the nearby harbourside town of St Ives, which will also be used during the summit, Raven Williams, the owner of the Common Wanderer shop, which sells environmentally sustainable clothing, was pleased at the idea of Biden’s visit. “I guess the general feeling was that Trump was a knob. Biden may not be welcomed as a hero but I guess will be received well as someone who appears more rational and progressive.”
Fisher Aiden McClary, who was helping land a catch of mackerel, said he did not think he would see much benefit. “Not unless they come down here to buy fish off the quay. I don’t expect we’ll see Boris here.” The editor of the St Ives Times & Echo, Toni Carver, said the summit was a coup for the local Tory party. “But local opinions seem very mixed. Some think it will be far too early in the post-Covid period – if we are in it by June – and will constitute a spreader risk.” Bert Biscoe, an independent Cornish councillor and a bard of the Gorsedh Kernow, which maintains the Celtic spirit of Cornwall, was in sanguine mood. “Let’s hope that the unique resonances, inspirations and light of Kernow [Cornwall] lead the seven and their guests to find common ground which encourages equality, urgent environmental action, social justice, unity and peace.” A rough guide to Carbis Bay for G7 attendees Where’s best to take a walk? There is a lovely stroll into St Ives from Carbis Bay with spectacular ocean views across to Godrevy lighthouse, said to have inspired Virginia Woolf. There are prehistoric field systems, glimpses of shipwrecks if the tide and weather conditions are right, and signs of the area’s mining past. What about if they want to take in some art? The quality of the light has drawn artists here for hundreds of years. Tate St Ives exhibits artists who lived and worked here, including Ben Nicholson and Alfred Wallis. The Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden, set in the artist’s former studio, is a treat. Any chance of a massage to de-stress if negotiations get tough? The Carbis Bay hotel has candlelit treatment rooms, including one for couples. The hotel invites you to “sit here in your fluffy robe, holding a hot mug of herbal tea or glass of Ruinart champagne, and just … relax.” A revitalising swim in St Ives Bay is an option but watch out for the special forces’ boats and battleships. The surf may be up at Porthmeor beach. Or sit on the balcony with a romantic Rosamunde Pilcher novel. She was born down the road and the hotel appears as the Sands hotel in some of her work. What if they run out of batteries/face masks/other essentials? There is not a wide range of shops in Carbis Bay but they could try Lilliput Stores on the main drag (free deliveries for orders over £25). The Carbis Baypharmacy is next door. If they need to go bigger, there is a Tesco supermarket on the road into St Ives. What if they feel peckish? This is Cornish pasty land, obviously. You do not have to go far to find one of the county’s most famous culinary creations. The family-run Becks fish and chip shop is well regarded – cod £5.60, chips £2.55, mushy peas 90p, pickled onion 45p. The Spanish restaurant La Casita can rustle up a paella, tapas or a pizza."
2021-01-22T05:42:36Z,uk-news,UK news,Freeze expected on heels of flooding damage from Storm Christoph,"Temperatures could drop as low as -10c in the coming days as Storm Christoph gives way to colder winter weather. It comes after hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes because of flooding and the body of a man was recovered from a river in Cardiff. Emergency crews including specialist divers found the man in the River Taff after being alerted by a member of the public. Care home residents were among those evacuated after floods in several areas across the north-west of England and Wales following days of heavy rain. A Met Office forecaster has said that it is going to be “more wintry now” as the storm moves away to the east. Craig Snell explained: “We’re losing the rain but gaining some colder and possibly some wintry weather too.” A yellow weather warning for ice is in place along a large part of western coasts until 10am on Friday. The alert – which stretches from the Scottish Highlands, down to the north west of England and into Wales, as well as covering Northern Ireland – says there is the possibility of injuries from icy conditions on ground which is already wet. An additional yellow warning for snow and ice is in place across northern parts of Scotland until Friday lunchtime. Into the weekend, temperatures could drop to minus -10C overnight in parts of Scotland, and could dip as low as -7 in parts of England, Snell said. “It will be feeling cold, I think that certainly that will be something that we will all be noticing it will be colder than it was to start the week.” In England, Cheshire bore the brunt of Storm Christoph and a severe flood warning, signalling danger to life, came into effect at Farndon on the river Dee where water levels were expected to peak on Thursday evening, according to the Environment Agency. Much of Northwich town centre was under water and residents of two Northwich care homes were evacuated by dinghy and taken to hotels in what the local council said was “a safe and socially distanced manner”. There were also evacuations in Warrington, Chester, Ellesmere Port and Tattenhall.
There were 21 people were rescued by boat from Lea Court nursing home in Warrington by Cheshire fire and rescue. Many roads in the county remained blocked by flood water on Thursday evening. There had been fears that thousands of homes in south Manchester would be inundated by the River Mersey in the early hours of Thursday morning, but flood defences held up. On a visit to Withington golf club in the Didsbury/Northenden area of Manchester, Boris Johnson said recent improvements to the region’s flood defences had averted a much worse situation. “We’ve put £60m into the Greater Manchester area’s flood defences and there’s another £20m on the way,” Johnson said. “Here in Didsbury they’ve managed to protect 10,000 homes by what they’ve done.”
Didsbury mosque provided shelter in its prayer hall for uprooted households. “Praise Allah that the floods weren’t as bad as people feared and no one in the area has been reported missing,” said the mosque’s receptionist, Abdul Sakkah. “Only three people came in the end but we had a big hall in which to provide shelter for up to 155, and we provided breakfast and hot drinks for those who stayed overnight.” Almost 170 flood warnings were in place across England on Thursday evening but some severe warnings had been downgraded.
In Wales, properties were evacuated in Bangor-on-Dee and residents were told not to return despite river levels slowly dropping on Thursday afternoon. Mid and west Wales fire and rescue said it had attended more than 100 flooding-related incidents and its swift water rescue teams had retrieved 13 people from vehicles in flood water. In Wrexham, north Wales, emergency services worked overnight to prevent flood water from causing damage at an industrial estate where a crucial part of the manufacture of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine takes place. Wockhardt UK, which has the UK government contract to “fill finish” the Covid vaccines, said no vaccines had been damaged or lost. A major incident was declared in the village of Skewen in Neath, Port Talbot, after at least eight streets flooded and 80 people needed to be evacuated. It is thought the flooding may have been caused by a collapsed mine shaft. Homes were also flooded in Knighton and Borth, in mid Wales, and Crickhowell, in south Wales
Debbie Hollingworth, a full-time carer in Ruthin, north Wales, said the ground floor of her cottage had been flooded with 45cm (18ins) of water. “I didn’t think to put a mask on as it all happened so quickly and I was just trying to work out what to save. When I saw the fire service rescue team were all wearing masks, I thought: oh God, I should’ve put mine on,” she said. “I went to my sister’s who we are in a bubble with, but unfortunately she is also in a flood risk area so we will have to get emergency accommodation if there’s any more [flooding]. “It’s been a nightmare but the community has come together and displayed great spirit. Local people donated two-tonne sandbags and people were posting on the local Facebook group offering temporary accommodation.”
The Met Office said 87.8mm of rain fell in 24 hours at Capel Curig in Caernarfonshire. Between 19 and 21 January, Aberllefenni in Gwynedd had 188mm of rain, more than the average rainfall for Wales for the whole of January, 156.89mm. In Denbighshire, north Wales, a bridge over the River Clwyd collapsed. Dozens of roads across Wales were closed. In Carmarthen, south-west Wales, people were treated for the effects of fumes after using a generator to pump water from their homes.
With heavy snowfall across much of Scotland closing roads in the Highlands and the Queensferry crossing near Edinburgh, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency issued four flood alerts across large areas of the north and north-east. Three yellow weather warnings have been issued by the Met Office, including an ice warning in place until 10am on Friday covering western Scotland, north-west England, Northern Ireland and much of Wales."
2021-01-22T00:01:32Z,uk-news,UK news,"Union stopped firefighters helping with Covid effort, say inspectors","The union representing firefighters hampered efforts to deploy the emergency service into potentially life-saving scenarios during the coronavirus pandemic with outdated and unnecessary practices, independent inspectors have said in a damning report. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) asked firefighters not to volunteer to support the NHS test-and-trace system and the Covid-19 vaccination programme, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) said. The action stemmed from an agreement put in place by the union, the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) and the national employers designed to determine the additional activities firefighters would carry out in support of the fire and rescue services’ response to the pandemic. Inspectors said the agreement became “more of a hindrance than a help” and prevented or delayed some chief fire officers from deploying the right people with the right skills to better support communities. The FBU insisted on “tortuous” negotiations for every single additional duty requested of firefighters, which led to significant delays and in some cases refusal to help, the inspectorate said. Asked whether lives were lost or put in danger as a result of the lengthy negotiations, Zoë Billingham, inspector of fire and rescue services, said: “As a direct result of the position the trade union adopted, the ability of the fire service to deploy firefighters into potentially life-saving activities was limited and delayed.” The FBU general secretary, Matt Wrack, branded the report a “political and biased attack on firefighters”. “It is neither evidence-based nor an independent report and is instead full of untruths and omissions, and we totally reject it,” he said. He added: “Our priorities throughout this pandemic have been to ensure firefighters can safely support their communities, the NHS, and the care sector. That means protecting their health but also the services they work in which continue to respond to emergencies. A service with 11,000 fewer firefighters than a decade ago cannot afford for this virus to run rampant through fire stations. “The FBU wants firefighters to continue supporting the pandemic response but sadly it seems the inspectorate, doing the bidding of the government and fire chiefs, is more intent on attacking our trade union and helping to undermine the terms and conditions of firefighters.” The inspectorate said the FBU was currently telling members not to volunteer with the vaccine rollout, framed by ministers and healthcare professionals as a race against time to tackle the spread of the new, more transmissible variant of Covid-19. Billingham said: “This is deeply regrettable. It’s not what the public expect of the fire service they generally hold in such high admiration, and we doubt it’s what firefighters want either; they’re dedicated, public-spirited professionals who told us they want to help.” Inspectors revealed the fire service in Greater Manchester was asked to help with the test-and-trace system at a local level – knocking on people’s doors to tell them they had been in contact with an infected person – but union negotiations took 12 weeks to conclude, throughout which time the fire service could not assist. The union told firefighters not to deliver food parcels to people who were shielding because it did not fall within the agreement negotiated on delivering essential items, the inspectorate said. Billingham said it was not appropriate for the FBU to have been given the ability to delay or veto the “reasonable and safe deployment” of firefighters to assist the public during a national emergency."
2021-01-21T16:31:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Storm Christoph: Boris Johnson visits flood-hit Manchester,"Boris Johnson has made a visit to Didsbury in Manchester to speak to Environment Agency officials after the area was hit by severe flooding from Storm Christoph overnight. Speaking to reporters at Withington golf club, the prime minister said recent improvements to the regionâ€™s flood defences had averted a much worse situation. â€œWeâ€™ve put Â£60m into the Greater Manchester areaâ€™s flood defences and thereâ€™s another Â£20m on the way,â€� he said. â€œHere in Didsbury theyâ€™ve managed to protect 10,000 homes by what theyâ€™ve done.â€�
Five severe flood warnings remained in place in the UK on Thursday afternoon, after hundreds of properties in Greater Manchester and Wales were evacuated overnight. Emergency crews including specialist divers were searching the River Taff in Cardiff after a member of the public reported seeing a body in the river below Blackweir. South Wales police said: â€œShortly after 9am this morning, a call was received from a member of the public concerning the discovery of what appears to be a body in the River Taff. A cordon has been put in place while emergency services attend the scene.â€� Three â€œsevereâ€� flood warnings for danger to life issued by the Environment Agency remain in place: for the English River Dee at Farndon, the River Bollin and Agden Brook at Little Bollington and the River Bollin at Heatley. The GM Strategic Coordination Group for Storm Christoph and the Environment Agency have stood down severe flood warnings for Didsbury and Northenden, meaning people evacuated from their homes can return. Two more warnings were issued by Natural Resources Wales for Bangor-on-Dee, where up to 30 people were evacuated from their homes, and Lower Dee valley from Llangollen to Trevalyn Meadows. Another 200 flood warnings were in place across Wales and the north of England, with up to 11.8in (30cm) of snow predicted in northern areas, including for large stretches of the River Irwell and the River Roch.
With heavy snowfall across much of Scotland closing roads in the Highlands and the Queensferry crossing near Edinburgh, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency issued four flood alerts across large areas of the north and north-east. The alerts, the lower of the three tiers of warning, cover Orkney, Sutherland and Caithness in the north, and a substantial area south of Inverness covering the Cairngorms across to Kinlochlaggan, and the whole of the north-east including Moray, Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen. In Wales, emergency services worked overnight to prevent flood waters damaging an industrial estate where a crucial part of the manufacture of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine takes place. Wockhardt UK, which has the UK government contract to â€œfill finishâ€� the Covid vaccines, has laboratories, production lines and warehouses in Wrexham Industrial Estate. The company said it had experienced â€œmild flooding resulting in excess water surrounding part of the buildings across siteâ€�. It added: â€œAll necessary precautions were taken, meaning no disruption to manufacturing or inlet of water into buildings. The site is now secure and free from any further flood damage and operating as normal.â€�
Mark Pritchard, the leader of Wrexham county borough council, said teams worked to ensure no vaccine was lost. He told BBC Radio Wales: â€œWe had an incident at Wrexham Industrial Estate, the Oxford vaccination is produced there and the warehouse where it is stored, obviously I canâ€™t tell you where it is, but we had to work in partnership to make sure we didnâ€™t lose the vaccinations in the floods.â€� Thousands of people in Greater Manchester were assessing damage to their homes and businesses after about 2,000 properties were affected by flooding in East Didsbury, West Didsbury and Northenden on Wednesday night.
Nick Bailey, assistant chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said the region had â€œavoided the worstâ€� but maintained that asking people to evacuate was the right measure. Dawn Docx, the deputy chief fire officer of Greater Manchester fire and rescue, said: â€œItâ€™s been an incredibly busy night for our firefighters and throughout yesterday. Our advice remains the same, please take extra care if you are out on the roads today and only travel if itâ€™s essential. If water is above ankle deep, do not even try to go through it.â€� Ben Lukey, of the Environment Agency, said some parts of the region had recorded 200mm of rain â€“ more than a monthâ€™s worth â€“ on Tuesday and Wednesday and some rivers had reached record levels.
The Environment Agency said many rivers were at â€œdangerously high levelsâ€�, but by 7am on Thursday Manchester city council said it believed water levels for the River Bollin and for the River Mersey in Northenden and Didsbury had peaked. An amber warning for rain in Greater Manchester was replaced by a yellow warning for ice. Motorists were being urged to take care, with many roads shut and rail services disrupted. North Wales police declared a major incident in the early hours of Thursday in Bangor-on-Dee, tweeting: â€œSevere flood risk: Emergency services are asking residents of Bangor-on-Dee to evacuate properties and proceed to Ysgol Sant Dunawd immediately. Do not try to leave the area yourself. 4Ã—4 vehicles will be utilised by emergency services to evacuate residents from the school.â€�
Natural Resources Wales said the Dee was at its highest recorded level since the water gauge became operational in 1996. Some residents in Ruthin, north Wales, were also evacuated and staying with relatives or being put up by the local authority. North Wales police said its officers were helping the fire service with the evacuation in Ruthin, Denbighshire, and urged people to avoid the area after a bridge over the River Clwyd collapsed. The force tweeted: â€œOfficers have been called to assist Denbighshire CC and NWFRS [North Wales fire and rescue service] in Ruthin, where some homes are being evacuated. Regrettably, people who do not live locally are driving to the area to â€˜see the floodsâ€™. Please do not stretch our resources by adding to the problem.â€� In Carmarthen, south-west Wales, people were treated for the effects of fumes after using a generator to pump water from their homes.
In south Wales, Rhondda Cynon Taf council said there was a landslip on the mountainside above the village of Pentre but it did not believe there was an immediate threat to the area."
2021-01-21T15:39:03Z,uk-news,UK news,UK police officer charged over offensive George Floyd meme,"A police officer has been charged with a criminal offence for allegedly sending a grossly offensive meme of George Floyd to colleagues in a WhatsApp group. Sgt Geraint Jones, 47, from the Devon and Cornwall force in south-west England, will appear in court later this month. The image of Floyd, whose killing by police in the US sparked worldwide protests over racial injustice, was alleged to have been altered and sent to fellow police officers and staff. The officer is alleged to have shared the image on 30 May, five days after Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Guardian understands a white fellow officer in the same force reported the image within 48 hours of it being sent. Jones has been suspended from duty since June. Section 127 of the 2003 Communications Act makes it an offence to send a message that “is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character”. The case was investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. The watchdog said: “Sergeant Geraint Jones, aged 47, is charged with sending the image on 30 May last year by means of a public electronic communications network, an offence contrary to section 127 of the Communications Act 2003. “An altered image of George Floyd’s arrest in Minneapolis was shared within a WhatsApp group that included a number of other police officers and staff. “Our investigation began in June 2020 following a referral from the force. At its conclusion in October we sent our investigation report to the Crown Prosecution Service, which has authorised the charge.” The officer is scheduled to appear at Newton Abbot magistratescourt on 28 January. The IOPC has also investigated other officers who received the allegedly offensive meme for potential disciplinary offences. It will make those findings public after the conclusion of criminal proceedings, which take precedent. The Guardian revealed in June that an investigation had been launched into the sending of the image. Jim Nye, a Devon and Cornwall assistant chief constable, said in June: “Devon and Cornwall police wholly appreciate the concern our communities will have regarding an investigation of this kind. I would reassure them that I, and the chief constable, will do everything possible to ensure the matter is dealt with effectively and in a timely manner.” When the investigation became public, Catrin Evans of the IOPC said: “It will be of considerable public concern that such an image was apparently shared among colleagues by a serving police officer.” Floyd died after a US officer knelt on his neck in an incident that was caught on video, and which convulsed the US and led to more than 250,000 protesting in the UK against racial injustice."
2021-01-21T15:33:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Bell-ringing and air-punching as Covid jabs begin in Whalley Range,"Aneet Kapoor had not slept a wink when he arrived at Whalley Range cricket and tennis club at 7am on Thursday. “It was the excitement that kept me awake,” said the pharmacist, who has spent the last six weeks working dawn to dusk to turn the clubhouse into south Manchester’s latest vaccination centre. “I just couldn’t wait to start.” Around 200 people had been booked in for their first Covid jabs, adding to the 4.6 million UK citizens who have received at least one dose. One of them was Kapoor’s 79-year-old father, Sunil, a former market trader described by his son as “the Asian version of Del Boy”. The extended Kapoor family cannot wait to hug again: they live in three houses within 300 yards of each other and have missed their Friday night dinners. Kapoor had the honour of injecting his father with 0.5ml of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab. “It was an emotional moment. It’s been a very difficult year. I live very close to my dad, only a few doors away, but at some points over the last 10 months it’s felt like we’ve lived 4,000 miles away,” he said. “It feels now like there’s light at the end of the tunnel.” Almost half of residents in Whalley Range are from black or minority ethnic backgrounds, largely of Pakistani, Indian or Caribbean heritage. Vaccine scepticism is high, with misinformation spread on social media by religious influencers and Covid sceptics. “Naturally there is apprehension in the community. A lot of things in social media don’t always help,” said Kapoor, who had commissioned a videographer to make a short film on Thursday documenting the vaccination process for his nervous customers. False rumours have spread that the vaccine is not halal and contains pork or other animal extracts. “We’ve been able to reassure them that isn’t true.”
Despite Whalley Range’s multicultural mix, Sunil was the only person of colour to be vaccinated in the first few hours of Thursday morning. Many of those who turned up lived 10 miles away or more, with one 79-year-old driving from Lymm, half an hour’s drive away in Cheshire. Kapoor’s brother Maneet welcomed them all as “vaccine heroes”, and a volunteer rang an old school bell each time a newly inoculated patient emerged from the clubhouse. Margaret Dooley, 73, was thrilled to be there: “When I got the text yesterday I was jumping up and down. I got on the phone and told everybody: ‘I’ve had the invitation!’” Dooley, who used to run a bridal shop, desperately wants to hold her grandchildren. One was born a few days into the first national lockdown and another in October. Rosie, her eldest grandchild, is four, and they miss each other terribly. It has been a very tough time, with her daughter contracting Covid shortly before giving birth. Having been in contact with her, Dooley had to isolate for a fortnight, and she regrets not having been able to help more. “I managed, but the worst bit was not being able to help my daughter. I feel like crying now, remembering how I would FaceTime her and she was saying, ‘I can’t breathe’.”
William Coulburn, 83, a retired engineer, has also had a hard lockdown. He lives with his 76-year-old sister, who broke her neck in May. He is looking forward to life returning to normal. “It’s been a bit boring at times,” he said. “The television have been playing more repeats than you can shake a stick at. Normally I go to the library a lot but with that shut all I really have is the TV.” Albert Taylor, 77, a retired train driver from Marple in Stockport, said he felt “tickety-boo” to have been vaccinated. His gammy knee, a legacy of years of running marathons, was giving him much more pain than the jab, he said.
He was looking forward to getting back to the pub, complaining that at the moment “you can’t go fishing, can’t go out for a pint”. To tide him over, his son had turned his camper van into a speakeasy. “We’ve been having a drink in there until they get it all sorted out.” Not everyone being vaccinated in Whalley Range was over 70. Three pharmacists from around Greater Manchester were among the first visitors on Thursday, including one 26-year-old. They qualify for vaccines as frontline health and social care workers. Karen Eaton, 58, has worked in a pharmacy in Baguley throughout the pandemic and has felt vulnerable at times. “We’ve had customers come in when they shouldn’t have, while they were waiting for test results, and then we’ve had to do quite a few deep cleans. Then there are the customers who won’t wear a mask.” For Peter Marks, one of five pharmacists delivering the jabs on Thursday, it was a big day. He had a photo on his phone of his first patient punching the air after receiving her jab. “It was lovely. I feel like I am part of making history.”"

2021-01-21T06:46:10Z,uk-news,UK news,"Thousands evacuated as Storm Christoph hits Manchester, Wales and Merseyside","Hundreds of people were told to leave their homes overnight as Storm Christoph caused widespread flooding across the UK. Some 2,000 properties in the East Didsbury, West Didsbury and Northenden areas of Greater Manchester were ordered evacuated on Wednesday night because of rising water levels, the city council said. People were also asked to leave their homes in parts of Ruthin and Bangor on Dee in North Wales, and Maghull in Merseyside. It comes as heavy rain and snow continued to fall across England and Wales, with many rivers at “dangerously high levels” according to the Environment Agency.
Four “severe” flood warnings for danger to life were issued by the agency for the river Mersey at Didsbury and Northenden, and in Maghull. A fifth was issued by Natural Resources Wales for Bangor on Dee. Boris Johnson earlier urged people to heed the flood warnings and evacuate their properties when told to do so. The Lib Dem councillor Richard Kilpatrick said he was among those who had to evacuate overnight after police came knocking on doors in The Beeches in Didsbury, with the local mosque opening its doors. He told Manchester Evening News: “The atmosphere has been a mixture of anxiety and disbelief I think. I helped door knocking to inform residents.
“We are fine and spirits are high. We just don’t expect it to happen here, the defences have always been enough.” North Wales police said its officers were helping the fire service to evacuate homes in Ruthin, Denbighshire, and urged people to avoid the area. The force tweeted: “Officers have been called to assist DenbighshireCC and NWFRS in Ruthin, where some homes are being evacuated. “Regrettably, people who do not live locally are driving to the area to ‘see the floods’. Please do not stretch our resources by adding to the problem.” The force also urged residents of Bangor on Dee to head to Ysgol Sant Dunawd for shelter after the severe flood warning was issued for the area. Wrexham Council said it was “working with partners to address any need for temporary rest centres for residents likely to be affected”.
Meanwhile residents in Maghull were advised to leave their properties as soon as possible after a severe flood warning was issued, Sefton council said. A council spokesman said heavy rain had led to raised water levels and flooding from the River Alt which was set to increase. “Water levels at Dover Brook, near the river Alt, reached 2.5m today, which is unprecedented for that area, modelling from the Environment Agency, including anticipated overnight rainfall, will take that level to 3.5m,” the spokesman said. Downing Street said Covid-secure facilities would be available for any people forced to evacuate as a result of the weather. Johnson said steps were being taken to ensure the transport and energy networks were prepared so that electricity outages would not be “severe” and that there were sufficient supplies of sandbags. He told reporters: “There are some times where I have been to scenes where, alas, people have decided not to obey the advice and not evacuated. It is their right not to do so if they choose – it’s always people’s right to stay wherever they are. “But it really is advisable – follow the advice. If you are told to leave your home then you should do so.” The Environment Agency has issued a further 191 flood warnings across England, with 228 less severe flood alerts, mainly across the Midlands and north of the country.
In Wales, 48 flood warnings and 57 flood alerts are in place, while six flood alerts are in force in Scotland. Almost the whole of England, Wales and Northern Ireland are subject to yellow weather warnings for rain until Thursday morning, with a more serious amber warning stretching from the east Midlands to the Lake District. The amber alert warns of the risk of flooding and deep flood waters which could pose a risk to life, and there are further warnings for snow and ice in Scotland. An amber warning for snow in parts of southern Scotland warned around 30cm could fall in areas above 400m, with up to 10cm likely to accumulate in lower regions until 8am on Thursday."
2021-01-20T14:47:08Z,uk-news,UK news,‘Palace Four’ drawn into Meghan’s dispute with Associated Newspapers,"Four former employees of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex could have evidence shedding light on the circumstances of Meghan’s letter to her estranged father, the high court has heard. Any role of the so-called “Palace Four” required further investigation, and was one of the reasons the duchess’s privacy action against the Mail on Sunday should proceed to a full trial, the newspaper’s publishers argued. Meghan, 39, is suing Associated Newspapers Ltd (ANL) over publication of extracts from her 2018 private letter to Thomas Markle, 76, reproduced in February 2019 in five articles in the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online. Her lawyers are applying for “summary judgment”, which would see part of her privacy case resolved without a trial, and argue that the judge, Mr Justice Warby, should find in her favour as ANL has no real prospect of success. On the second day of the hearing, Antony White QC, for ANL, said “oral evidence and documentary evidence is likely to be available at trial which would shed light on certain key factors in the case”. One issue was the circumstances in which the letter was drafted, “which we now know involved the Kensington Palace communications team, a curious feature for a wholly private letter”, he told the judge. ANL claims Meghan intended the letter to be used as part of a “media strategy”, which the duchess has denied. White said a letter from lawyers representing the “Palace Four” indicated they would be able to “shed some light” on the drafting. The four are Jason Knauf, the then communications secretary to the royal couple, who ANL believes “was involved” in the wording of the letter; the former communications staff members Christian Jones and Sara Latham; and the former private secretary Samantha Cohen. The letter from lawyers on behalf of the four, sent to the legal teams of both parties, said none of them welcomed involvement in the case, which had arisen only as a result of duties in their respective jobs at the material time. “Nor does any of our clients wish to take sides in the dispute between your respective clients. Our clients are all strictly neutral,” it said. “They have no interest in assisting either party to the proceedings. Their only interest is in ensuring a level playing field, insofar as any evidence they may be able to give is concerned.” But they would provide assistance to the court if they could, it said. The letter went on to say it was their lawyers’ preliminary view “that one or more of our clients would be in a position to shed some light” on “the creation of the letter and the electronic draft”. They might also be able to shed light on “whether or not the claimant anticipated that the letter might come into the public domain”, and whether or not Meghan “directly or indirectly provided private information” to the authors of the unauthorised biography of the couple, Finding Freedom. Justin Rushbrooke QC, for Meghan, said in written submissions that the letter from the so-called Palace Four contained no information supporting ANL’s claims that Knauf co-authored the letter at the centre of the dispute. Meghan’s case is that Knauf provided feedback on a draft but no wording. Rushbrooke said the claim that there might be “hypothetical” evidence from the former palace staff was not enough to proceed to trial and that Meghan’s letter was “self-evidently” private. “If a letter of this kind isn’t on the face of it private, confidential and deeply personal, it’s difficult to see how any letter could be,” he said. To have a trial “in order to defeat the obvious” was “just surreal”. He added there was no evidence the letter was part of a “media strategy”. Meghan is seeking damages from ANL for alleged misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act. Mr Justice Warby reserved judgment, and will publish his ruling at a later date."
2021-01-20T14:24:11Z,uk-news,UK news,Outer Hebrides islands put into lockdown as Covid takes hold,"About 1,000 islanders on Barra in the Outer Hebrides are taking a “robust and responsible” approach to being placed in full lockdown from midnight on Tuesday, as a coronavirus outbreak spreads to affect about 16% of the population. Having kept the virus off the 11-mile-long island since the pandemic began, there are now 45 positive tests with a further 140 individuals self-isolating. Although islanders were already observing a voluntary lockdown as the outbreak spread rapidly since taking hold in the second week of January, Nicola Sturgeon announced on Tuesday that the islands of Barra and Vatersay, which are connected by a causeway, would go into tier 4, the highest level of Scotland’s five levels of Covid controls. The rest of the Western Isles will remain in level 3, indicating the Scottish government is willing to target specific areas within local authorities. Barra councillor Donald Manford said that locals were “shocked but not surprised” by the outbreak: “We’d held it at bay for 10 months, and you hope you are doing the right things, but when the second wave came and was spreading so quickly, it was foolish to believe we could avoid it forever.” Asked whether he was aware of the source of the outbreak, the NHS Western Isles chief executive, Gordon Jamieson, told BBC Radio Scotland: “There has been some mainland travel, which had only to be essential, and we know there have been some gatherings on Barra that were outside level 3 restrictions.”
Although two residents have been taken off the island for treatment, local health officials said they were confident in levels of assessment for patients remaining on Barra. Those who have tested positive are receiving daily calls and have been given small pulse oximeters to monitor their oxygen levels. Barra’s health infrastructure is limited to a care home with 10 beds – where all residents and staff have already been vaccinated – and a hospital with five beds, both in the same building. There are currently no plans to introduce patients needing Covid care here because of the proximity to elderly residents. Those who do require more intensive treatment can be transferred to Stornoway on Lewis or to the mainland, with weather for landing being monitored carefully in coordination with the Scottish ambulance service. Meanwhile, islanders have been urged to self-isolate immediately if they experience symptoms, and to be vigilant in particular for loss of or changes to taste or smell, which have been common factors in this outbreak. Residents have also been advised to take extra care when using communal contact facilities such as cash machines, and to reduce visits to those essential shops that remain open. The local coordinating group is scaling up a home delivery service, which has already been supporting those who are shielding and the island’s significant number of elderly residents.
The owners of Castlebay post office posted a heartfelt notice on their Facebook page, informing residents that they would be reducing opening hours. “We are both medically vulnerable, one of us extremely so, together with many others on the island, who like us are scared and very wary of how to proceed,” it read. Setting out a series of precautionary measures, such as having only one customer inside the premises at a time, it concludes: “May God keep us all safe. Better days will come.” For Donald Manford, the community spirit born out of geographical isolation can only assist residents through this current health challenge. “Everyone, even if they don’t know each other, knows who each other are. Where you can, you look out for each other, that’s a natural way to live and exist.”"

2021-01-20T09:28:07Z,uk-news,UK news,"Silvertown tunnel an ‘assault on health’ of locals, warn doctors","Doctors and healthcare workers have warned that plans for a new four-lane tunnel under the River Thames in east London represent an “assault on the health” of families in the surrounding area. The group of 25 GPs, nurses and specialists – including experts in child health and respiratory disease – say the £2bn Silvertown tunnel project will funnel more traffic through some of the most deprived and polluted boroughs in the country – with a devastating impact on people’s health. “We all view the proposal to build this tunnel as an assault on the health of east Londoners and on the climate,” the medics state in a letter. “The Silvertown tunnel as proposed will funnel traffic, including heavy freight vehicles into areas of deprivation which already suffer disproportionately from so many adverse social determinants of health.” The medics, including local GPs and registrars from some of London’s leading hospitals, also say the huge road-building programme is incompatible with London’s efforts to tackle the climate emergency. “It is now widely accepted that without drastic action the planet is hurtling towards catastrophic, irreversible climate change,” they write. “Given these threats to the health and wellbeing of our population we cannot see the rationale behind building another road crossing across the Thames. New roads just increase traffic and with it, pollution.” The letter was written to the mayor of Tower Hamlets, John Biggs, asking him to join other local political leaders in opposition to the scheme. Biggs said that “on balance” he supported the scheme which he claimed – “with appropriate mitigation” – offered “the prospect of a solution to the terrible air quality and congestion at the Blackwall tunnel.” He added: “Both Transport for London and Tower Hamlets council have taken great steps in the last few years to clean up our polluted air and remain committed to continue this through our wide ranging transport policies.’’ Plans for the tunnel, spearheaded by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, have faced opposition from a growing list of MPs, councillors, environmentalists and residents in recent months. They argue it will increase pollution, drive up car use and increase emissions for years to come – all as the climate crisis accelerates. The shadow climate change minister, Matthew Pennycook, whose Greenwich and Woolwich constituency would contain one end of the tunnel, called on Khan, a Labour mayor, to reverse the plan. Lyn Brown, the Labour MP for West Ham, where the other end of the tunnel would be, has also called for the project to be scrapped. The rising cost of the scheme has come under scrutiny. In September, the Guardian revealed that the project could cost nearly £2bn over the next three decades if it goes ahead. The figure – which includes the construction, maintenance and operation of the tunnel as well as interest payments on the debt – is more than twice the original estimate. In June, a report from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, backed by some of the UK’s leading climate scientists, found that the development was incompatible with the Greater London Authority’s aim to become carbon-neutral by 2030. Last month, the mother of nine-year-old Ella Kissi-Debrah, who a coroner ruled died from air pollution in 2013, called on the mayor to rethink his plans for a new tunnel warning it would drive up toxic air with a potentially devastating impact on young people’s health. But Khan’s administration has repeatedly defended the scheme, saying it was essential to improve river crossings in east London that are “antiquated and worn out”. A spokesperson for the mayor said anyone who had been caught in traffic due to a problem in the Blackwall tunnel would know “there is an urgent need for another river crossing in this part of London”. They added: “The new tunnel will mean fewer idling vehicles and better local bus services, including double deck zero-emission buses which currently can’t operate across the river because of the restrictive size of the Blackwall tunnel.” In their letter, the doctors say building new roads always leads to more cars and argue the £2bn cost of the Silvertown tunnel should instead be used to boost walking and cycling and subsidise public transport. “Cycling and walking have huge direct and indirect benefits on health in that the exercise itself improves cardiovascular fitness and decreases obesity and increasing the proportion of active travel reduces pollution.”"
2021-01-20T06:00:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Sadiq Khan: London missed out on early share of vaccine,"A simplistic formula used to distribute coronavirus vaccines that did not take into account the size of GP practices has meant fewer people receiving one in London, according to the mayor, Sadiq Khan. While areas such as Slough and Newcastle have successfully immunised 100% of their elderly care home residents, London is lagging behind in the vaccine race even as cases remain among the highest in the country.
GP practices there were supplied similar amounts of the Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines as elsewhere without taking into account the number of registered patients, it is understood. City Hall sources said that GP networks in London tended to be larger, meaning there were fewer doses per patient. But ministers had acknowledged the error, and the mistake was being corrected, they added. Figures from NHS England showed that London had the lowest number of people – 388,437 – who had received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine despite being one of the largest NHS regions in England with a population of nearly 9 million. The leading English region, the Midlands, had administered 713,602 first doses to its population of 10.6 million. People in north-east England and Yorkshire, whose population is similar to London’s at 8.6 million, had received 633,837 first doses. On Monday alone the number of people being immunised in London was the second lowest in England, at 21,228, with only the south-west lower at 16,612. The Midlands achieved 32,560 and the north-east 23,153.
Khan told the Guardian that “the government’s original distribution formula meant that London missed out on its early fair share of the vaccine”. He said that he had been told the supply model would be swiftly revised after a crisis meeting with vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi last week. “Zahawi has assured me that supply and distribution will increase, and an amount of the vaccine that reflects our size, density and the level of need in our city is delivered,” the mayor said. “It’s absolutely vital that vulnerable Londoners are given access to the life-saving vaccines as quickly as possible.” Downing Street struggled to explain the regional differences in vaccination rates, insisting on Tuesday that all areas “have had full access to supply”. The prime minister’s spokesperson also confirmed that places lagging behind would be offered extra vaccine stocks. “We will put more supplies into the areas that have more to do,” Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said, adding: “Some areas have had different logistical challenges than others.” Other factors are constraining vaccination rates in London, including what City Hall said are “higher levels of hesitancy” about taking the jab, in particular among the capital’s black, Asian and minority ethnic population. Research has shown that up to 72% of black people said they were unlikely or very unlikely to have the jab. Across the UK, 4.26m jabs have been administered, putting the country ahead of much of the rest of the world. But GPs in England have said their ability to provide inoculations is dependent on central supply from the NHS. At times appointments have had to be cancelled at short notice when deliveries failed to materialise – and as recently as last week some areas had not received any doses of the vaccine, although NHS sources said this had now been corrected. Ministers want to inoculate the first four priority groups by mid February, comprising care home residents, the over-70s, NHS and care workers, and those with serious underlying health conditions. This week the government said it had begun writing to those in their 70s inviting them to be vaccinated. Later, however, the Department of Health and Social Care said Zahawi did not give any commitments to revise the distribution formula for the vaccine. “Vaccines are being distributed fairly across the UK – including London – to ensure the most vulnerable are immunised first, and all GPs will continue to receive deliveries as planned,” it said. More GP practices would start immunising people in the next few days, the spokesperson added."
2021-01-19T19:25:25Z,uk-news,UK news,What has the Grenfell inquiry revealed about building materials?,"A new regulator that could prosecute companies making dangerous building materials has been announced by the government, prompted by evidence given at the Grenfell Tower inquiry. Here we look at some of the key issues that were raised by the hearing … What is the problem with building products? After the Grenfell Tower fire, it emerged that hundreds of tower blocks were wrapped in similar combustible materials that builders and building inspectors believed were being used in line with regulations. They have now been deemed dangerous and must be stripped off, leaving leaseholders and the government with multibillion-pound bills. What has the public inquiry into the 2017 fire revealed about how this happened? From as early as 2007, some construction material companies set up fire safety tests to artificially improve results and deliver certificates that would reassure builders they performed safely in a fire. Test rigs were set up according to the manufacturer’s instructions rather than fully independently. Materials companies also lobbied certificators and building inspection bodies to get the widest possible access for their products. Some were aware that their materials were more dangerous than the test results or marketing brochures let on. This cemented conclusions drawn by Dame Judith Hackitt, whom the government asked to review building safety in 2018. What did Hackitt say? She said the whole system needed major reform and that residents’ safety needed to be a greater priority through the entire life cycle of a building – from design and construction, through to when people were living in their homes. She found that methods for testing, certification and marketing of construction products and systems were not clear, and called for “a more effective enforcement, complaint investigation and market surveillance regime at a national level for construction products”. How long has the government known about this problem? In 2014, Brian Martin, a senior building safety official at the Department for Communities and Local Government, said in an email that he was aware of “reliable” claims that several buildings had been erected with combustible polyisocyanurate insulation in high-rise cladding. “Apparently people are under the impression that PIR is a material of limited combustibility (which it isn’t),” he wrote to a building safety certificator. “The purpose of my email is a friendly warning. You might want to double check with your inspectors and plan checkers that they are on top of this.” How does this change regulation of building materials? It doesn’t change the building regulations, which still allow combustible materials to be used on buildings up to 11 metres. But it looks likely to intensify scrutiny of the testing of products and the claims that manufacturers make for them. The Construction Products Association said: “We are awaiting further details from government and look forward to supporting its development and implementation.”"
2021-01-19T19:24:21Z,uk-news,UK news,New watchdog will be able to ban dangerous materials used at Grenfell,"Companies that make dangerous building materials such as those used at Grenfell Tower could be prosecuted and their products banned by a new watchdog announced by the government. The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the new regulator for construction products was prompted by evidence at the public inquiry into the west London fire of “dishonest practice by some manufacturers … including deliberate attempts to game the system and rig the results of safety tests”. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the regulator would have “strong enforcement powers including the ability to conduct its own product-testing when investigating concerns”. Offences could be punished with fines or imprisonment, currently for up to three months. It would be funded with up to £10m and be part of the Office for Product Safety and Standards “to encourage and enforce compliance”. But the announcement was dismissed as “too late” by campaigners representing hundreds of thousands of leaseholders trapped in unsellable high-rise homes that used dangerous materials similar to those used at Grenfell, where the 14 June 2017 fire cost 72 lives. “It’s good news for buildings to be built in the future but this regulator does literally nothing for the buildings that already have these materials on them,” said Rituparna Saha, the co-founder of UK Cladding Action Group, which represents some of the estimated 175,000 homeowners whose buildings have applied for £1bn in government grants to meet repair bills. Grenfell United, which represents bereaved and survivors from the fire, added: “A new regulator doesn’t fix what is out there already. It’s been three and a half years and the government still hasn’t come up with a plan to get dangerous materials off homes.
“Kingspan, Celotex and Arconic [which made combustible cladding materials used on Grenfell] have faced no consequences – they are still making profits … Consequences for companies involved in Grenfell would be the best way for the government to send a message it was serious about cracking down. This is not an industry that deserves a clean slate.” Whitehall sources have said the government is exploring the best way to exclude companies that “have played the system” from future contracts funded with taxpayer money. The public inquiry into the disaster heard last year how in 2013 executives for Celotex had known that “in the event of a fire [its insulation] would burn” and that in 2009 a manager at Arconic, which made the plastic cladding panels, had shared images of a burning tower fitted with similar panels “to show you how dangerous PE [polyethylene] can be when it comes to architecture”. Celotex has said it was not a manufacturer’s responsibility to meet building regulations, but admitted “unacceptable conduct on the part of a number of former employees”. Arconic told the inquiry it was entitled to expect the UK regulatory regime to maintain safety and that its product had been “misused”. One executive at Kingspan, which also made insulation, said in an email that customers worried about the safety of its product could “go fuck themselves”. The firm has apologised for “process shortcomings and unacceptable conduct”. “The Grenfell inquiry has heard deeply disturbing allegations of malpractice by some construction product manufacturers and their employees, and of the weaknesses of the present product testing regime,” said Jenrick. “We are establishing a national regulator to address these concerns and a review into testing to ensure our national approach is fit for purpose. We will continue to listen to the evidence emerging in the inquiry, and await the judge’s ultimate recommendation – but it is already clear that action is required now and that is what we are doing.”
Building inspectors approved the materials for use on Grenfell and the new regulator is an attempt to tackle the sale of dangerous products higher up the supply chain rather than leaving it solely to local council officials to check what is being used on each site. In common with most products, building components already have a CE safety mark. Arnold Tarling, a surveyor and building safety expert, said checks should in theory have been carried out by trading standards inspectors but they rarely visited building sites. He also questioned whether £10m would be enough to fund checks of “millions” of building products, with fire tests for example costing as much as £60,000 each. The government said the new regulator would “in due course” start work “in shadow form” and then operate with new powers after the building safety bill was passed."
2021-01-19T17:34:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Scottish parliament rejects Westminster's 'spy cops' bill,"The Scottish parliament has rejected a controversial bill from Westminster that potentially allows undercover agents to commit crimes, after Labour MSPs again ignored Keir Starmer’s policies. Scottish Labour’s MSPs voted alongside the Scottish National party, Scottish Greens and the Lib Dems to refuse legislative consent by Holyrood for the so-called “spy cops” bill after a short debate on Tuesday afternoon. Holyrood’s rejection of the bill means it will not cover Scotland once it comes into law, potentially leaving Scottish police and intelligence agents unable to mount covert operations that could involve them committing criminal offences to protect their cover.
The covert human intelligence sources (Chis) bill has been introduced at Westminster because criminal activity by police or spies in the UK is currently unregulated. A forthcoming case at the court of appeal in London will rule later this year on whether the current rules regarding undercover agents are lawful. Humza Yousaf, the Scottish justice secretary, told MSPs that if the appeal court ruled they were unlawful, that could force Holyrood to introduce emergency legislation to authorise criminal activity by police or spies in Scotland. Hinting this raised fresh questions about the remit of UK ministers to influence Scotland’s independent criminal justice system, Yousaf said the UK government had rejected his attempts to reach a consensus. Starmer has told Labour MPs and peers to abstain on the bill, despite widespread anxieties that it gives undercover police, intelligence agents and soldiers immunity from prosecution for any criminal offence, without prior approval from a judge. Labour has already split over the bill at Westminster: two frontbenchers resigned in October after 34 Labour MPs rebelled, and Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general under Jeremy Corbyn, tabled amendments that were rejected by Labour peers on Starmer’s orders.
Starmer argues that Labour would need to introduce similar legislation if it was in power. Neil Findlay, a Corbyn-supporting Labour MSP who campaigned for a Scottish public inquiry into the undercover police officers who infiltrated protest groups, said the UK government’s proposals were “a human rights scandal waiting to happen”. Speaking in favour of a Scottish government motion to reject the bill, Findlay indicated Labour at Holyrood were opposed to the legislation on principle. “[We] should be rejecting this because it is an affront to our democracy and an affront to our legal system,” he said. Yousaf said the SNP was opposed to the bill chiefly because it failed to include pre-authorisation for any criminal acts from a judge, despite repeated Scottish government appeals for it do so. In a vote, only the Scottish Conservatives voted to support the UK bill, arguing that rejecting it could leave police and the intelligence services unable to use any covert informants or undercover agents."
2021-01-19T17:03:36Z,uk-news,UK news,"Scotland's lockdown will last until at least mid-February, says Sturgeon","Scotland’s lockdown will continue until “at least the middle of February”, Nicola Sturgeon has told the Scottish parliament, with no definite date for a full return to schools and nurseries. The current level 4 restrictions, which have been in place since Boxing Day and include a “stay at home” message in law, were extended following a meeting of the Scottish cabinet on Tuesday morning. Scotland’s first minister acknowledged how “difficult, distressing and damaging” the ongoing disruption to early years care and schooling has been, but added that her cabinet’s “reluctant judgment” was that community transmission of the virus is too high to allow a safe return to education settings until mid-February “at the earliest”. She told parents that this date remained under review. Sturgeon said that there was some evidence that restrictions are beginning to have an impact on transmission rates, even of the faster-spreading variant, but that these emerging trends needed to continue before any relaxation of lockdown could be considered. Sturgeon was also challenged by opposition leaders about the slower pace of Scotland’s vaccine distribution. The country is understood to have received more than 700,000 doses to date, and – according to comparable figures up to Monday – vaccinated 264,991 people with first doses, around 6% of the adult population, while England has reached 8%, Wales 6% and Northern Ireland 8.7%. Earlier on Tuesday, the chair of BMA Scotland’s GP committee, Andrew Buist, said that patients were becoming increasingly anxious and practices frustrated at the patchy nature of the rollout. He told BBC Radio Scotland: “The workforce is there and that’s why it is so incredibly frustrating when the patients want the vaccine, we are very keen to give it to our patients, but we just don’t have the vaccine in our fridge.” Sturgeon told MSPs that the reason why Scotland’s figures were overall lower than England’s is because her government had decided to focus first on the more time consuming and labour intensive vaccination of elderly care home residents, more than 90% of whom have now been inoculated – a much higher proportion than in England. The Scottish Conservative’s Holyrood leader, Ruth Davidson, asked Sturgeon to explain why it seemed that 400,000 doses of the vaccine had yet to reach GP practices. Sturgeon countered that the Westminster government was “briefing and spinning misleading figures on supply” and that her own government was prevented from being transparent about such figures by UK ministers last week. She said: “We are now picking up pace with the over-80s. We are not behind our targets.” This includes offering the first dose to all care home residents and over-80s by the start of February, extending to all over-70s, and all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable, by the middle of that month. The Welsh first minster was also challenged on the pace of distribution on Tuesday. Mark Drakeford was forced to repeatedly deny that his government was operating what opposition politicians have claimed is a “go slow” rollout. Drakeford promised seven out of 10 care home residents and people aged over 80 would have received their first doses by the end of the week. He said that Wales remained on course to meet its target of vaccinating all members of the top four priority groups by mid-February. Wales continues to face criticism for lagging behind England and Northern Ireland in the pace of its vaccination programme, but Drakeford said: “The race we are in is the race with the virus, between infection and injection, not a race with other countries.” However, Drakeford warned that there was a “fragility” in the supply chain for both the Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines. He flagged up production issues at a Pfizer plant in Belgium and the loss of a batch of 26,000 Oxford doses earmarked for Wales that did not arrive this week because of a problem with the batch."
2021-01-19T13:04:14Z,uk-news,UK news,'Eye watering': top police officer laments rate of stop and search on young black men,"There is “widespread dissatisfaction” with the police among black communities with it being clear young black men are being disproportionately stopped and searched at an “eye-watering” rate, a former senior police chief has said. Mike Cunningham, who retired last month as chief executive of the College of Policing which sets standards for law enforcement, said stop and search was the “totemic” issue and called for “humility” from police leaders faced with sustained criticism after a tumultuous year. He said law enforcement had achieved a lot but had much more to do on the issue. In an interview to mark his retirement from policing after 32 years, including stints as chief constable of Staffordshire and HM Inspector of Constabulary, Cunningham told the Guardian: “It is absolutely starkly clear that there is a widespread dissatisfaction with policing from black people. And, I don’t think anybody should try to dress that up and say, ‘it isn’t real, it’s a mistake, it’s a perception’. Something more needs to be done.” Race exploded as an issue last year after police in the United States brutally killed George Floyd. It triggered demonstrations worldwide, with the scale of protest in the UK shocking British police leaders. Over 250,000 people demonstrated during lockdown, a figure that otherwise could have been higher. It tapped into simmering discontent at stop and search by police, especially in London, with a string of incidents caught on video where innocent black people were stopped, and sometimes handcuffed, sparking claims of racial profiling. Cunningham said the rate at which young black men were stopped remained “eye watering”. He said: “What I mean is, the numbers of particularly young black men who are stopped and searched, compared to white men, is still huge in some parts of the country.” The latest official figures show black people are nine times more likely than white to be stopped by police in England and Wales. In London, black young men are 19 times more likely to be stopped than the general population, according to analysis of official data by University College London. The Met says young black men are disproportionately perpetrators of knife crime. Cunningham said: “You only have to listen to what black communities are saying. This is still a big problem in terms of community trust and community confidence.” The Metropolitan police are to run a six-month pilot recording the ethnicity of people stopped in their cars in a move aimed at halting the alleged targeting of people for “driving while black”. It follows a spate of cases last year when people were stopped and found to be innocent. Cunningham said claims of racial profiling could not be dismissed and more work was needed to understand the reasons for disproportionate stop and search figures affecting black people across England and Wales. He said of police officers: “If you work in an area where there has been a lot of knife crime, and it has been the case that the perpetrators and victims are both young black boys and men, then that could well lead officers from their operational experience to think, ‘well, actually this is how I need to address this problem’.” Asked if that meant being more likely to stop people of a certain colour, Cunningham said: “Yeah … who is most likely to be carrying knives in this place? Well the most knife crime that I have seen is perpetrated by young black men and that takes them in that direction.” He said stop and search was a vital crime-fighting tool, but it would not solve violent crime: “There is evidence to show that it has a short-term effect and can be of use. But there is no evidence to say it’s a long-term solution to serious violent crime. “To look for a long-term solution through stopping and searching people is not the way to address it.” He said policing had improved its stance on race since he joined in 1987. He said it was not just stop and search causing problems for the legitimacy of policing: “There are serious issues also about how we recruit black people into policing, how people from minority ethnic backgrounds thrive in policing, feel included in policing. “There are still lots of very, very clear voices that are telling us that we haven’t done enough, and I think we have to accept that. There’s no point people at the top of policing like me just saying ‘that’s not true’. “These are evidence backed, committed people who want to say there is something not yet right around race and policing. And I think it is absolutely incumbent upon the leadership of the service to respond to that in an open way with some humility to try and understand what more needs to be done, because unquestionably more does need to be done.”"
2021-01-19T12:17:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Statue of fossil hunter Mary Anning to be erected after campaign,"A statue to Mary Anning, a fossil hunter and palaeontologist once “lost to history” but now considered a significant female force in science, is finally to be erected after a crowdfunding campaign by a teenage girl. Evie Swire, 13, was nine years old when she first heard of Anning, who was born into a humble family in 1799 near Evie’s Lyme Regis home in Dorset. The schoolgirl was outraged to discover there was no statue. Now, despite setbacks due to the coronavirus pandemic, Evie’s campaign has raised £70,000 – enough to commission the statue. It is hoped it can be unveiled in Lyme Regis in May 2022 on the anniversary of Anning’s birthday. Anning grew up hunting for fossils in the nearby cliffs to sell to supplement her family’s meagre income. She was responsible for many pioneering finds, including one of the first ichthyosaurus skeletons, and became immensely knowledgable in the then emerging field of palaeontology. But her finds were often credited to the male collectors to whom she sold her fossils. Her disappointment and frustration was evident in one surviving letter in which she wrote: “The world has used me so unkindly, I fear it has made me suspicious of everyone.” She died aged 47. Evie launched the “Mary Anning Rocks” campaign with her mother, Anya Pearson. Its patrons include Sir David Attenborough, the academic and broadcaster Prof Alice Roberts and the novelist Tracy Chevalier. The actor Kate Winslet, who stars in Ammonite, a film about Anning, has also pledged support.
The sculptor Denise Dutton, whose recent works have included the Land Girls monument at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, and the suffragette Annie Kenney in Oldham, has been commissioned. Drawing inspiration from designs submitted by local schoolchildren in Lyme Regis, she has produced preliminary sketches that show Anning striding with her dog, Tray. “I think it looks really good. It just looks like her from the one picture that we have of her,” said Evie. Even though Anning was excluded from organisations such as the Geological Society, “it didn’t stop her. She still carried on, even when it became really hard for her,” Evie added. “She was a very important person, but she was lost in history.” Evie’s mother said that despite the pandemic, which delayed the launch of the crowdfunder, £70,000 of the £100,000 target had been raised, enough to go ahead with the statue. The remaining £30,000, which they will continue to fundraise for, is to cover installation and legal costs. The statue would be placed somewhere along the town’s sea defence wall, “so she will be looking out towards Black Ven where she did all her fossil hunting”, Pearson said. “She’s been created so she’s interactive, so there’s no pedestal or podium. She’s on the floor with everyone, so people can put fossils in her basket. Lots of children leave fossils at her grave. So the idea is we put her out on the walk down to the fossil beach and children will start putting fossils into her little basket.” The campaign has 30,000 followers across social media. “We call them the Anning army, and it really does feel like an army of people who are all equally up in arms that this absolutely incredible woman – working-class, self-educated – has been woefully forgotten,” said Pearson. Anning is now part of the national curriculum and many children have donated Christmas and pocket money, she added. Dutton said Anning was “absolutely fascinating” as a subject. Only one painting of her exists, where she is in her Sunday best. “She was never credited for her discoveries. She sold specimens to male scientists who claimed credit,” said Dutton. She is meticulously researching what Anning would have worn to go fossil hunting and is taking advice from the V&A Museum in London. What does she want the statue to convey? “Determination, because among everything else, the determination that she had to carry on, to go out – and she went out at the end of storms when it was very dangerous – so there must have been a pig-headedness about her to do that. So, that excitement and that determination,” said Dutton."
2021-01-19T10:03:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Met chief 'baffled' by lack of Covid vaccines for police,"Britain’s most senior police chief has said she is “baffled” by the government’s decision not to prioritise frontline police officers for Covid vaccines despite her repeated requests to ministers. The Metropolitan police commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, pointed out that in London almost 150 officers have been spat or coughed at by people who claimed they had Covid.
In a phone-in on LBC, Dick expressed her frustration that frontline officers in the UK were not on the priority list for vaccines. She said: “In many other countries, police officers and law enforcement colleagues are being prioritised and I want my officers to get the vaccine. I am baffled really.” Answering a call from the father of a police officer who contracted Covid, Dick revealed she had been lobbying the government for police vaccinations for “many, many weeks”. She said: “I have had many conversations with the home secretary. She is very supportive on this subject. These are difficult decisions, but I think there is a very strong case for the frontline officers.” She pointed out that “disgusting” and “awful” incidents of police being coughed and spat at were “quite widespread”. Dick said: “We’ve had 97 occasions where somebody has either mentioned or threatened Covid, and then coughed. We’ve had 48 [occasions] where they’ve spat. We’ve charged 126 people with that and nearly two-thirds of them have got custodial sentences.”
Dick said every day officers were also being coughed and spat at by people who may have Covid but did not say so. She said: “It certainly makes the point that we’re dealing with very unpredictable, sometimes violent, often spitting, shouting, people who are just spraying unwittingly, because they’re very upset.” She said three members of staff from the Met had died of Covid since the pandemic began, including a community support officer last week. She said: “This is a critical service, and to keep other people safe, we need to keep the police safe. Frontline officers are in and out of people’s houses, they’re helping people who are sick on the street or collapse behind locked doors, they are dealing with sometimes very aggressive people and to arrest people they have to get up close and personal. They don’t have very long to risk assess all that. They certainly can’t be dressed top to toe in heavy PPE.” Dick said ministers had expressed “warm words” that in the in second wave of the vaccination programme frontline workers, including police officers, may be given priority for jabs. But she suggested this was too late: “Phase 2 we won’t come to, as I understand, until spring, whatever that means, whereas we will end the first four cohorts for the very vulnerable in the middle of February.” Under the current vaccination programme, 60-year-olds, including Dick, are due to get the vaccine before frontline officers. “The frontlines should be getting it before people like me and I’m very clear about that … This is a decision that’s the government has made so far on the basis of the JCVI, who are the experts,” she said."
2021-01-19T06:15:48Z,uk-news,UK news,Storm Christoph: sandbags issued in South Yorkshire as lashing rains loom,"A major incident has been declared in South Yorkshire as Storm Christoph is set to bring widespread flooding, gales and snow to parts of the UK. People have been urged to prepare after an amber weather warning for rain was issued by the Met Office for Tuesday to Thursday for central northern England, affecting an area around Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield and stretching down to Peterborough. It has led to a major incident being declared in South Yorkshire in preparation for potential flooding, said Ros Jones, mayor of Doncaster. Jones said emergency protocols were instigated with sandbags handed out in flood-risk areas. She said plans would run alongside the region’s Covid-19 response, adding: “I do not want people to panic, but flooding is possible so please be prepared.” The Environment Agency described the combination of torrential rain and melting snow as a “volatile situation”, with councils preparing for possible evacuations should a severe flood warning be issued. Catherine Wright, acting executive director for flood and coastal risk management at the Environment Agency, said: “That rain is falling on very wet ground and so we are very concerned that it’s a very volatile situation and we are expecting significant flooding to occur on the back of that weather.” She said the Environment Agency would be working with local authorities to help with evacuation efforts should a severe flood warning be issued, adding: “If you do need to evacuate then that is allowed within the Covid rules the government has.” The Met Office has warned homes and businesses are likely to be flooded, causing damage to some buildings, and issued a “danger to life” warning due to fast-flowing or deep flood water, while there is a “good chance” some communities may be cut off by flooded roads. Up to 70mm is expected to fall but in isolated spots, particularly in the northern Peak District and parts of the southern Pennines, 200mm could be possible. A yellow rain alert is also in place for most of northern England and Wales from Tuesday to Wednesday, while a yellow weather warning for snow and ice is in force in Scotland from Dundee to Elgin and across the east coast from Wednesday afternoon until midday on Thursday. The Environment Agency issued 10 flood warnings covering parts of Yorkshire, Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire as of Monday night, with a further 109 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, across northern England, the Midlands and the east. Highways England advised drivers to take extra care on motorways and major A roads, while the RAC breakdown service said motorists should only drive if absolutely necessary."
2021-01-18T19:25:03Z,uk-news,UK news,"Two Manchester Arena bombing victims could have been saved, inquiry hears","Firefighters did not arrive at Manchester Arena until two hours after the suicide bombing, only one paramedic entered the blast scene in the first 40 minutes, and Greater Manchester police (GMP) did not declare a major incident until the following day, the inquiry into the terror attack has heard. The Manchester Arena inquiry, which resumed on Monday, moved to examine the response of the emergency services to the tragedy. The inquiry heard evidence about the deaths of two of the victims, John Atkinson, 28, and Saffie-Rose Roussos – at age eight, the youngest to die in the attack. “Most of those who died suffered injuries in the bombing that were, on the expert evidence, unsurvivable even with current advanced medical treatment,” said the counsel to the inquiry, Paul Greaney QC. But where Atkinson and Saffie-Rose were concerned, Greaney said: “A different response may have led to a different outcome.” Atkinson, 28, who later died, was evacuated from the arena’s foyer on a cardboard advertising hoarding 45 minutes after the explosion. He was then moved to an area near a station entrance where he remained for a further 24 minutes before chest compressions commenced at 23.47pm and he was taken away in an ambulance. A report commissioned by the family of Saffie-Rose claims she might have survived the bombing if she had received better first aid. Saffie-Rose died after excessive blood loss, but the report states her injuries “did not reach a threshold where they would be considered incompatible with life”. The inquiry, which began last September, was due to resume on 12 January but was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. On resuming Monday, Greaney said: “We will explore whether the emergency response really worked that night and, if it did not, whether that failure made any contribution to the extent of the dreadful loss of life that occurred.” He noted that “some of what we have to say will be distressing”. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi, 22, exploded his homemade rucksack bomb in the foyer of the arena shortly after an Ariana Grande concert at 10.31pm on 22 May 2017. Twenty-two people were killed in the blast which also injured hundreds. Greaney said “it did not take long” for concerns to emerge about the emergency services’ response. Audio recordings taken from the body cameras of police officers in attendance were played before the inquiry, with one heard to say: “We need paramedics like fucking yesterday”. Greaney said it was important to acknowledge the immense pressure facing members of the emergency services that night. “Our investigations must not be used to vilify those who did their best on the night,” he said. “That failure was, in the opinion of the experts, of command, not individual responders.” The inquiry heard that while six North West ambulance service (NWAS) paramedics were at Manchester Victoria station, adjacent to the Arena, within 30 minutes of the blast, and within 40 minutes “at least” eight ambulances had arrived, only one NWAS paramedic had actually entered the foyer of the arena within the first 40 minutes. Firefighters had assembled at a fire station three miles from the arena but did not attend the scene until two hours and six minutes after the attack. “Why that is so is plainly something that will need to be closely examined during the evidence,” said Greaney. The hearing continues."
2021-01-18T18:28:04Z,uk-news,UK news,Crossrail 2: more than Â£115m spent before project mothballed,"More than £115m was spent on Crossrail 2 before work on the scheme for a new north-south rail line through London was suspended in November. The costs for the development and design of the line, which was once hoped to be operational in the early 2030s, were shared between the Department for Transport and Transport for London. However, work was officially paused as part of the emergency financial agreement between the government and TfL to fund the capital’s transport network after passenger revenues dried up due to the coronavirus pandemic. Around a quarter of the money spent went to Network Rail, the state-owned railway infrastructure manager, according to figures revealed by New Civil Engineer. The biggest private sector beneficiaries were Arup, whose design consultancy work on the tunnels and southern section totalled almost £12m, and Arcadis, which was paid £11.4m for engineering consultancy. The line would have linked stations in the home counties to the north and south-west of the capital via new tunnels underneath central London, roughly along the route of the Chelsea-Hackney underground line first discussed in the 1970s. Central development funding was allotted from 2015-16 when construction of the original Crossrail line appeared to be on time and on budget, and when Crossrail 2 was regarded as an essential part of the plan for handling HS2 passengers arriving in London Euston – a prospect that is in doubt. The division within TfL that was working on Crossrail 2 was seconded to other work after Covid-19 hit London last year. TfL said that while the project was mothballed, land would remain safeguarded and the design work would remain relevant. A TfL spokesperson said: “The pandemic, and subsequent impact on our finances, has meant that we have to be realistic about what is currently affordable.” A planned Bakerloo line extension for the underground is also on ice. The spokesperson added: “Our immediate priority for these schemes is progressing safeguarding as they are still likely to be needed in the future to support long-term growth and modal shift in London. The work developing proposals for these schemes will still be used when we are in a position to confirm funding in future.”"
2021-01-18T16:09:17Z,uk-news,UK news,"Residents of Wales care home died after alleged neglect, inquest hears","Vulnerable residents of a care home in south Wales, owned and run by a doctor, died after suffering from alleged neglect including dehydration, malnourishment and pressure sores, an inquest has heard. Police uncovered evidence of “general neglect” when they investigated Brithdir nursing home, near New Tredegar, Caerphilly, the inquest on six residents aged in their 70s and 80s was told. Dr Prana Das, who owned and ran the nursing home, faced charges relating to alleged failings in care before he suffered a brain injury during a burglary at his home and was declared medically unfit to stand trial. He died last year. On Monday the assistant coroner for Gwent, Geraint Williams, opened the inquest into the deaths of six residents between 2003 and 2005. Williams said the police operation – codenamed Jasmine – uncovered evidence “suggesting poor care of residents, including allegations of poor pressure sore and peg (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) feed management, malnourishment, and general neglect of the residents’ long-term needs, together with deficient standards of care and nursing practice”. Among those who died was Edith Evans, 85, who loved dancing, the inquest was told. When she was admitted to hospital, nurses found the site around her feeding tube “infected”, while broken skin was found on her buttocks and she appeared “unkempt and dirty, and her mouth and lips were dry and her tongue was thick”. Stanley James, 89, a retired steelworker who had a history of dementia, developed pressure sores on his buttocks and one on his heel. Stanley Bradford, 76, a former miner who had schizophrenia, was admitted to hospital on several occasions to be treated for “dehydration, chest and urine infections”, and before his death was considered “seriously malnourished” by doctors, the inquest heard. June Hamer, 71, a retired wages clerk; Evelyn Jones, 87, a former seamstress; and William Hickman, 71, an ex-miner, all had pressure sores. The coroner said that when Das was confronted with concerns about the home, he became evasive and difficult. Williams said: “When they raised unacceptable poor care for the residents he was of the view he was being victimised and became unreasonable.” Williams said the inquest would consider the actions of nurses and carers at the home and the authorities charged with overseeing it. “Brithdir was not in isolation,” he said. “Some residents were placed by Caerphilly county borough council and the local health board.” The inquest, which is taking place in Newport, is due to last until March. A hearing into the death of a seventh resident, Matthew Higgins, 86, will be held at a later date."
2021-01-18T15:03:35Z,uk-news,UK news,Met police to start recording ethnicity of people stopped in cars,"Britain’s biggest police force will start recording the ethnicity of people stopped in their cars in a move aimed at stopping the alleged targeting of people for “driving while black”. It follows a spate of cases last year when people were stopped and found to be innocent. Vehicle stops were at the heart of controversial incidents including the searching of champion athlete Bianca Williams and her partner, both of whom were handcuffed while their baby was in the car, and nothing unlawful was found by officers. The case is under investigation. Until now, police have had to record the ethnicity of people they stop on foot in the street, which has exposed the disproportionality in stop and search, but not for vehicle stops. A small pilot last year in London suggested black people were six times more likely to be stopped while driving than white people. The Met scheme, believed to be the first of its kind, will record the location, time of the vehicle stop, ethnic background, sex and age of the driver, and the make and model of the vehicle. The pilot will last six months and is part of a package of reforms under a plan following pressure on the Met by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, after last year’s Black Lives Matter protests and the race crisis the Met was plunged into. The Met commander Kyle Gordon said: “This pilot will help us assess our proportionality in relation to vehicle stops. This is part of the steps we are taking to increase even further public trust and confidence in the Met – particularly among London’s black communities. “We want all communities to have the same level of trust in us and for us to be the most trusted police service in the world. Lower levels of trust create challenges to keeping Londoners safe whether it is a reluctance to share information, to report crime, or to support our work to tackle violence. “Our job is quite simply to protect all of London’s communities and to do so with professionalism and empathy. This pilot is, I believe, a way to ensure we keep doing just that.” Attempts at driving bias out of public services such as policing has seen the collection of ethnic data as a way of identifying potential issues. Sadiq Khan said: “We’ve listened and responded to the continued frustrations of black Londoners, who are concerned that they are six times more likely to be stopped in a car than a white person, and this pilot will help us to begin to assess and address concerns about racial profiling and disproportionality in our city. “Road traffic stops are an important tool the police have to keep Londoners safe but they can have a huge impact on community relations and deserve the same level of scrutiny as any other kind of police stop-and-search power. For many Londoners, that interaction is their defining experience of the police and that is why we are committed to carefully scrutinising the outcome of the pilot and acting on its findings.” Khan has asked the home secretary to mandate all 43 forces in England and Wales to record the race of those stopped to see if ethnic groups are experiencing different levels of police attention while driving."
2021-01-18T13:50:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Wales' Covid vaccine rollout criticised as first minister defends delay,"The Covid vaccination programme in Wales has been heavily criticised after the first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the deployment of tens of thousands of Pfizer/BioNTech jabs was being staggered to avoid staff sitting around with nothing to do once the country gets through its current supply. Doctors’ representatives, opposition politicians and citizens waiting for their vaccine expressed deep concern and called for the Labour-led government to speed up its distribution. Wales has so far has been provided with about 300,000 Covid vaccinations, around 250,000 of them the Pfizer version and 50,000 the Oxford jab. By Monday it had vaccinated just over 150,000 people. The Oxford vaccine is being used as soon as it arrives in the country from centralised UK supplies and has already got through 95% of its current ration. But speaking on the BBC on Monday morning, Drakeford said that as Wales was not due to get any more Pfizer vaccines until the end of this month or the start of next, it was staggering its rollout. He said: “We have to use that over that six-week stretch. There would be no point, I think, and it would be logistically very damaging to try to use all of that in the first week and then have all of our vaccinators standing around with nothing to do for another month. “The sensible thing to do is use the vaccine you have got over the period that you have got it for so your system can absorb it. You don’t have people standing about with nothing to do.” Following an outcry, a Welsh government spokesperson insisted that it was on course to vaccinate all members of the top four priority groups by mid-February. The spokesperson did not repeat Drakeford’s reasoning but said it was organising the distribution of the Pfizer vaccine in such a way as to avoid wastage. “The Pfizer vaccine comes in large packs, which cannot be split and must be stored at ultra-low temperatures – at -70c. There are only two centres in Wales where we can keep them at this temperature. Once removed from storage, the vaccine lasts five-days. Every dose wasted is a vaccine which cannot be given to someone in Wales. Health boards are receiving all the doses of Pfizer they can use.” Speaking at the Welsh government’s press conference on Monday lunchtime, the education minister, Kirsty Williams, said: “We are not holding back on any supplies. We are distributing Pfizer in a careful way to ensure there is infrastructure in place to deliver it safely and most efficiently, avoiding waste.” The supply in Wales suffered a blow after a batch of 26,000 Oxford vaccines failed testing. Wales is due to receive those vaccines next week, and the Welsh government said the hitch would not affect its February target. But the Welsh Conservatives said the system was “not fit for purpose”. Andrew RT Davies, the shadow minister for health, said: “The Welsh Labour government is failing to deliver its vaccine programme. His [Drakeford’s] shocking … decision to delay deployment of Pfizer vaccine supplies is dangerous and makes no clinical sense whatsoever. We need to get these vaccinations into people’s arms ASAP. Lives and livelihoods across Wales are at stake.” Davies added: “People, especially in the vulnerable groups or those over 80, will today be wondering just what to believe from the Welsh government, just what it’s doing, and just when they will receive their vaccinations. “This contradictory and confusing messaging from ministers will allay no-one’s concerns and will likely add to their anxiety.” About 5% of the population has been vaccinated in Wales, compared with 6% in England. The Plaid Cymru health spokesperson, Rhun ap Iorwerth, asked: “Why are we rationing here? To see the first minister being relaxed about the slow pace of the vaccine rollout here is very, very frustrating.” The British Medical Association in Wales expressed concern about the tactic of staggering vaccines. It tweeted: “Extremely concerned the Welsh government is spacing out the Pfizer vaccine to make it last until the next delivery. If Pfizer vaccines are available, second does must be given within the maximum 42-day timeline and all remaining vaccinations for staff must be accelerated.” Michael Jenkins, whose 90-year-old father, Harry, has not received a date for his first jab, called on the government to speed up the pace of the programme. He said his father, a retired surveyor from Swansea, had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but was still waiting for his appointment. “People like my father are being put at risk unnecessarily,” he said. “He and pensioners like him need the jab as soon as then can. I think the Welsh government is dragging its heels. I’m not criticising our doctors and nurses. They’re doing a fantastic job. But there is a blockage in the system that needs to be sorted out.”"
2021-01-18T06:00:23Z,uk-news,UK news,Fewer than one in 10 police officers fired after gross misconduct finding,"Fewer than one in 10 British police officers found to have potentially committed gross misconduct by the watchdog are dismissed, the Guardian can reveal. Figures released by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) show 641 officers in England and Wales may have so seriously breached standards that they were liable to be sacked between 2015 and 2020, but just 54 (8.4%) were fired after disciplinary action was conducted internally. Another 848 officers were found to have a case to answer over possible misconduct, but in total only 363 of the misconduct claims have so far been upheld following IOPC recommendations. There were official warnings in 151 of these cases, and 16 retirements or resignations. Many more disciplinary cases against officers occur without the involvement of the IOPC. The IOPC received statutory powers in February to ensure forces investigate those found to have a case to answer, but internal police disciplinary panels still have the final say and the watchdog said its role is not to be “judge and jury”. The figures, obtained through freedom of information requests, raise questions about the efficacy of the IOPC, which receives £71m per year from the Home Office. These issues were amplified by anti-racism protests in the UK last summer amid concern over police use of force and the number of deaths in custody without officers subsequently facing charges. Katrina Ffrench, the former CEO of StopWatch, which campaigns for fair policing, said the figures were “indicative of the IOPC’s inability to hold the police to account in any meaningful way” and that the body needed to be subject to true community oversight. “It is incredibly concerning that people enforcing the law are able to remain in positions of power despite having gross misconduct allegations against them proven,” she said. “If communities that are distrustful of policing, due to lived experiences, are to believe the institution is fair and there are consequences for bad behaviour, the IOPC must do a better job.” Victor Olisa, a former Met Ch Supt, said officers “run rings round IOPC investigators” and that the relationship was unequal. “The police service is not held to account like it ought to be,” he said. “This data shows the rate of IOPC ‘case to answer’ findings to actual disciplinary rulings really is quite low. “The police cannot work in a vacuum. It has to face questions about how it provides its public service. It should be scrutinised and have its powers balanced.” The IOPC succeeded the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) in 2018, in a reform designed to ensure “greater accountability to the public”. It followed condemnation over the IPCC’s handling of the death of Mark Duggan, which led to an apology three years after his death in 2014. But the new body has also come under scrutiny – with critics pointing to the complaints process, its independence and the fact some high profile cases have taken several years. One concern is that people cannot complain directly to the watchdog and must instead raise issues with the relevant force, which then decides whether to refer itself to the IOPC, to investigate internally, or to take no action – apart from in the event of “serious injury” or death when a referral is mandatory. About 28% of staff in investigations have previously worked for the police service, with more than one-in-three senior investigators being former officers. Between 2015 and 2020 the IOPC referred 391 files where there was an indication of a criminal offence by an officer to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which resulted in 69 criminal prosecutions, leading to at least 22 guilty verdicts in which judges passed down four custodial sentences. The IOPC said it was eager to work with forces, the police union, the CPS and the Home Office to speed up the investigations, and that 83% of reports in 2019-2020 were completed within 12 months. A spokesperson said: “The majority of public complaints and allegations of misconduct are rightly dealt with by police forces themselves. The discipline system is the responsibility of police forces and is administered by them.” They said changes were introduced to the complaints and disciplines procedures in February 2020, which include a duty for police witnesses to cooperate with IOPC investigations and a reform so that a “case to answer” finding will now be the final decision. “Very few cases referred to and investigated by the IOPC will result in criminal prosecution because only a small proportion of those matters involve allegations of criminal activity. Prosecution isn’t the only route for holding police officers accountable for wrongdoing and only applies where criminality is involved. Disciplinary action can range from dismissal and reduction in rank to written warnings, all of which are determined by misconduct panels led by legally qualified chairs for misconduct hearings and senior police officers for misconduct meetings, not the IOPC. “To obtain a more accurate picture of sanctions against police, you would also have to look at cases brought forward by 43 police force professional standards departments, as they deal with the majority of public complaints and conduct matters.” National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for professional standards, chief constable Craig Guildford said: “The recent changes have seen a shift towards resolving issues earlier, learning lessons faster and a firm focus on the most serious of cases. As these changes further embed we will see the improvement in timeliness, transparency and learning continue. “Those who let the public, the service and themselves down will be dismissed once the process has taken its course.”"
2021-01-18T06:00:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Families of citizens dying after contact with police still await justice,"Relatives of people who have died after contact with the police have told of their distrust in and dissatisfaction with the ability of the complaints system to help deliver justice. “I feel the IOPC is there to shut families up and make us believe there is a thorough investigation,” said Carla Cumberbatch, sister of electrician Darren, who died at the age of 32 in July 2017 after he was punched up to 15 times, beaten with a baton, sprayed with CS gas and Tasered multiple times by officers. They had been called to a bail hostel in Nuneaton, west Midlands, while he was experiencing a mental health crisis – behaving “irrationally” in a toilet bloc, according to the coroner. An inquest jury said that police use of “considerable restraint” on Cumberbatch contributed to his death and was “at times probably avoidable”. Officers, one of whom reportedly admitted making incorrect statements on police notes after the event and copying another officer’s notes word for word in his account of the incident, have not faced disciplinary consequences, but probation staff are to receive more training to de-escalate situations. The watchdog’s initial statement, two days after Cumberbatch died and 11 days after the incident, said only that he had become “unwell” in police presence and criticised “unhelpful” speculation. “It was like talking to a wall,” Cumberbatch’s sister said. “The way I was spoken to was disgusting. I was originally told it could take up to eight months to investigate, but over three years on we’ve still got no report; it took two years to get to an inquest.” It is rare for the IOPC to recommend the suspension of officers, though it did so initially in 2017 in the case of Rashan Charles, who died in east London. Video footage showed an officer who held him breaching police standards on detention and restraint. However, the Metropolitan police said regulations stated that an officer under investigation should not be suspended if temporary redeployment to alternative duties was appropriate.
The police officer was placed on office duties before the watchdog eventually concluded that the “unorthodox” restraint used against the 20-year-old did not amount to misconduct as his failures were not deemed to be deliberate. Criticism of the watchdog’s response to Charles’ death has been led by his great-uncle, retired former Met Ch Insp Rod Charles, who said the watchdog simply echoed the Met’s version of events. Writing for OpenDemocracy, he said: “In its first statement, [it] claimed: ‘The man became unwell and first aid was provided by a police officer, police medic and paramedics.’ These accounts mislead by omission. “They fail to mention that a police officer at the scene heavily restrained Rashan, with help from a second man. Instead they direct attention towards Rashan’s own actions.” Kevin Clarke, who had serious mental health issues, died after he was restrained by police in March 2018 in Lewisham, south-east London. Nine Met officers were placed under unspecified restricted duties while under investigation by the IOPC. In police body-cam footage of the incident, Clarke can be heard telling officers: “I can’t breathe … I’m going to die.” One officer told the inquest, which concluded recently, that he believed the restraint – applied because Clarke was “a bit fidgety” lying on the edge of a school playing field – was necessary and safe. However, his family said he was “restrained unnecessarily and with disproportionate force” and that police officers were among those who “let Kevin die”. The Met agreed that seven of the officers had a case to answer for misconduct after the watchdog said the continued use of handcuffs and limb restraints once Clarke was unconscious was “unnecessary and disproportionate”. They were dealt with by the force “by way of practice requiring improvement” through identifying any organisational and individual learning and reflecting on what happened, the IOPC said. Cumberbatch is still waiting for the IOPC investigation into her brother’s death to be published. “If I punched you 15 times, there would be a criminal investigation, but nothing has been done about it,” she said. “No restricted duties, no suspensions, no desk duties, no misconduct, nothing. I struggle to understand after a serious incident why officers are not interviewed immediately to prevent conferring. “Who do you call when police are the killers? The IOPC, many of whom are ex-police officers. In an ideal world I’d like to have justice, but what is justice? Even where unlawful killing has been ruled by an inquest, some officers have been able to return to duty.”"
2021-01-18T02:00:37Z,uk-news,UK news,Police break up fight in London between 40 men involving knives and a sword,"A brawl between 40 men using knives, bottles and a sword has been broken up by police in west London. Police initially reported that two swords had been used in the fight in Southall in the early hours of Sunday, but later corrected this to “at least one sword”. At 8pm on Sunday, police released a statement saying that they had been called at “around 0200hrs to a large group of males fighting with knives and at least one sword in the area of King Street, Southall”.
Two men in their 20s were arrested and remain in police custody, according to the statement. Despite the diverse and unusual weapons used, police said: “There are no reported injuries.” The police have asked anyone with information about those involved to come forward. The initial tweet about the fight described the two men being, “chased into St Johns Road and identified as having carried swords during the fight. They were arrested for violent disorder and affray”."
2021-01-17T18:25:34Z,uk-news,UK news,UK trained military of 15 countries with poor human rights records,"The UK government has trained the armies of two-thirds of the world’s countries, including 15 it has rebuked for human rights violations. An anti-arms trade organisation has called for an investigation into the use of UK military training by other countries to determine whether it has been used to perpetrate human rights abuses. The call from Campaign Against the Arms Trade came after the Guardian obtained a freedom of information response from the Ministry of Defence that revealed in the years 2018/19 and 2019/20, the government provided training on UK soil to around two-thirds of the world’s countries – 130 countries in 2018/19 and 120 in 2019/20 – including some with appalling human rights records. The countries with concerning human rights records that received military training from the UK include Bahrain, China, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Zimbabwe. While the Ministry of Defence provided a full list of military training provided in the UK to foreign countries, it declined, on the grounds of the cost of obtaining this information, to respond to questions about UK military training provided overseas to other countries. The UK government produces an annual list of countries it has human rights concerns about. These 30 countries listed in the first half of 2020 include 15 for which it has provided military training, including Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The UK government has a list of 20 countries for which an arms export embargo is in place. The government said guidance relating to this list applied until 31 December 2020. It has provided military training to eight countries on the list where an arms embargo is in place, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan. In 2018/19 the government provided 1,169 separate courses in the UK. In 2019/20 it provided 1,096 courses. The introduction to the British Army International Defence Training catalogue stated of the UK: “It is rightly acknowledged as a leader in the provision of world-class military training.” Courses in the catalogue include preparing and commanding armoured troops on operations, infantry courses, including a platoon commander battle course, which involves five weeks of live firing tactical training and the throwing of live grenades on purpose-built ranges, offensive and defensive operations in jungle environments, and instruction in how to operate 81-millimetre and 60-millimetre mortars. There is also training on offer for snipers in basic and advanced marksmanship. The brochure also includes courses in gentler aspects of military life, such as music courses for pipers, photography courses and training for military chefs. Andrew Smith of Campaign Against the Arms Trade said: “This raises very serious questions for the government. Many of these armies are responsible for upholding brutal and repressive laws, and have been accused of torture and other human rights violations. UK forces should not be doing anything to support or strengthen them. “The message that this training sends to those forces is one of support. It shows a total disregard for people who have suffered under these cruel regimes. There must be a full investigation into the forces that have taken part in UK training to find out if any of those personnel or units have been implicated in abuses.” A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “Defence engagement makes an important contribution to international diplomacy. Military support is determined on a country-by-country basis, often including the provision of peacekeeping, medical, and language training. “UK engagement is informed by a thorough assessment of potential risks relating to human rights and international law, along with options to mitigate them and opportunities to promote compliance with international standards, including international humanitarian law.”"
2021-01-17T12:17:23Z,uk-news,UK news,A galanthus effort: Covid-hit snowdrop festival moves online,"There was a sense of excitement at the Garden House in Devon this weekend. A Galanthus “Primrose Warburg”, a charming white and yellow snowdrop, had just appeared. “It is a lovely one,” said visitor services manager Karen Willcocks. “It’s just a pity more people can’t be here to see it.” Usually at this time of year, snowdrop aficionados – galanthophiles – are heading to the village of Buckland Monachorum in their droves to spy examples of the beloved flower in the grounds of the Garden House. As the days lengthen and February approaches, wonderful, subtle-scented, crowd-pleasing drifts form. But 2021’s Garden House snowdrop festival has become another casualty of the Covid crisis: a huge shame, because this harbinger of spring is putting on one of its best shows ever on the edge of Dartmoor. Local people are being allowed in to take their permitted exercise, but most galanthophiles will have to stay away. However, to try to fill the gap, the Garden House is staging what it confidently believes to be the UK’s first “virtual snowdrop festival”.
Every day the team of gardeners and student horticulturalists Rose and Rosie will go out into the snowdrop drifts and post live images of the flowers as they appear, dots of brightness shining in the winter gloom. “We’re actually really excited now about our virtual snowdrop festival,” said Willcocks. “People travel from across the UK to see our snowdrops, so this seems like the perfect way to share their beauty and a great way to give people a daily treat – something to look forward to in lockdown.” Another snowdrop that has just made an appearance is Galanthus elwesii “Godfrey Owen”, which has grey-green leaves and white flowers on stems around 20cm tall. Its flowers feature six pure white, symmetrical outer petals that open to give a wide, lamp-shade-like form over six inner petals, each of which bears a green mark. The house and gardens, once home to the vicars of Buckland Monachorum, trace their history back to 1305 and feature romantic ruins including a tower with a spiral staircase and a thatched barn. A modern vicarage was built in the 1920s and just after the second world war was bought by Lionel Fortescue, a retiring Eton master, and his wife, Katharine, who set about renovating and developing their garden. They bequeathed the house and garden to the Fortescue Garden Trust, an independent charity that continues to run the property. The snowdrops bloom from September through to March, peaking in January and February, and are carefully labelled, tucked into herbaceous borders, scattered across banks, some in in plain sight, others tucked away in secret corners. There are scores of various shapes, colours (the pink snowdrop Galanthus nivalis “Blushing Pendant” is one lots of visitors look out for) and scents. The collection was established by expert Matt Bishop, former head gardener at the Garden House and one of the authors of the “galanthophile bible”, Snowdrops: A Monograph of Cultivated Galanthus.
Snowdrops collected by a second expert, Colin Mason, who travelled to Turkey and Georgia, sometimes searching on horseback for unusual examples of the flower, have been added to the grounds. Willcocks said she believed the sight of snowdrops, whether viewed in person by local people or online by those who are not allowed to visit, would be a balm in these most difficult of times. “The snowdrop collection is not only extraordinarily pretty, it’s a unique chance to see some of the rarest varieties of snowdrop in an exceptionally beautiful setting. We hope it will help people.” The virtual festival will run until 28 February and can be viewed on Facebook and on Instagram."
2021-01-17T08:45:01Z,uk-news,UK news,No true ‘city of culture’ should dishonour the bold ideals of its postwar rebirth,"Coventry is UK City of Culture 2021, a title that focuses attention on its contribution to the cultural life of the nation: 1980s two-tone music, the legend of Lady Godiva, and its role in the development of the bicycle and car industries. And, high on this list, the fact that it was the pre-eminent example of reconstruction after wartime bombing. Among the most devastated cities, Coventry was also one of the most determined and thoughtful in its reconstruction. This was partly expressed by its new cathedral, which brought together leading art and architecture, and connected movingly with the ruins of its predecessor. It was also expressed by the city centre, rebuilt as a series of human-scaled, pedestrian-friendly precincts. Here, too, the idea was for art and architecture to work together. The proposed redevelopment of much of the centre, by the London-based Shearer Property Group and Chapman Taylor architects, in a joint venture with Coventry city council, would obliterate much of this legacy. The designs show little sympathy for what would remain. Although it promises an “authentic sense of place”, and a purported but extremely vague resemblance to the pre-war historic fabric of the city, it is generic, could-be-anywhere stuff, not fundamentally different from developments “global architects and masterplanners” Chapman Taylor might design anywhere in the world.
Coventry’s “culture” and sense of place, the things that make it different from other cities, must surely include the brave ideals of its postwar renewal. As heritage campaigners rightly point out, it can take a long time for the value of architectural styles to be appreciated, by which time it is too late for the buildings that have been demolished. It happened with Victorian architecture, derided for decades, and it is happening now with mid-century modernism. This is not to say everything about postwar Coventry should be sacrosanct. No one, looking at it now, could deny that it would benefit from some regeneration. It has to respond, like city centres everywhere, to the recession of retail and whatever challenges the post-pandemic world might bring. Some ideas behind the original plans, such as a determination to put car parks on as many roof-tops as possible, may have outlived whatever usefulness they once had. But the starting point for any regeneration should be an appreciation of the work of the postwar rebuilders. This would mean a serious attempt to learn from their intentions and draw inspiration from the best of their work. It would mean celebrating William Mitchell’s remarkable relief sculpture, rather than consigning it to a so-far unspecified “appropriate place”. It might mean bringing the best out of the existing buildings of the Bull Yard, rather than replacing them, as is currently proposed, with a weak imitation of London’s Covent Garden market.
Chapman Taylor’s view, expressed in a video on its website, is that the postwar work is largely worthless and should be replaced with variegated buildings and street patterns that existed before the second world war. But it is delusional to think that this lost Coventry could come back, and there is little in the designs to suggest that it would. With their hostility to what is actually there, they create an unnecessary conflict between heritage and regeneration. So the Twentieth Century Society is insisting that certain features be retained, while the council and developers chafe at what they see as pernickety obstructions to the march of progress. An avoidable zero-sum game is set up. For Coventry can be renewed, at the same time as the past 80 years of its history – ever since its bombing in 1940 – can be respected. All it takes is a bit of intelligent and sensitive design."

The 125-acre Carbis Bay Estate – which encompasses a luxury hotel, an award-winning restaurant and a spa – will be the main location of the summit, but the seaside village will be supported by neighbouring St Ives a mile away, along with other towns across the region.
The incoming US president, Joe Biden, is among those expected to attend the three-day summer meeting, along with leaders of the other G7 nations – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and Japan – and representatives from the EUuropean Union. Boris Johnson said Cornwall was “the perfect location for such a crucial summit” and, after referring to the role the region’s tin and copper mines played in the Industrial Revolution, said: “This summer Cornwall will again be the nucleus of great global change and advancement.” The prime minister said: “Coronavirus is doubtless the most destructive force we have seen for generations and the greatest test of the modern world order we have experienced. It is only right that we approach the challenge of building back better by uniting with a spirit of openness to create a better future.” Visit Cornwall estimates the summit could bring a £50m boost to the regional economy from immediate benefits and projected tourism growth. Julian German, leader of Cornwall council, told local press: “We want a lasting legacy that maximises inward investment, translating our moment on the global stage into trade.” He cited the county’s hope to contribute to sectors such as “space and satellite, floating offshore wind and other sources of clean energy, and globally significant geo-resources including lithium to power our future”.
Malcolm Bell, chief executive of Visit Cornwall, said he hoped to raise its profile globally as a tourist area. “The G7 Leaders’ summit will shine a spotlight on our very special place and the worldwide exposure is promotion we could never buy,” he said. Johnson has also invited Australia, India and South Korea to attend as guests, in an apparent effort to convert the annual summit into a meeting of 10 leading democracies – an idea that has been circulating in US thinktanks for nearly a decade. It is due to be the first in-person meeting of world leaders for nearly two years, after the US-hosted G7, the 46th, was cancelled because of the pandemic and the Saudi-hosted G20 meeting moved online last year. The last time the UK hosted the summit, in 2013, the venue was a resort in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. This time round, the attendees will be right next to the renowned Carbis Bay beach which was the site of scenes in the fifth series of Poldark. With so many world leaders expected to be based in the seaside resort for the weekend, a major security operation will be in place. Devon and Cornwall police’s chief constable, Shaun Sawyer, said: “We have been preparing for this event for several months, including speaking with colleagues who have managed similar events, so we can ensure that we continue to effectively serve our local communities in the run-up to, during and after the event.” The total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test result in Cornwall is reportedly 218, making it one of the least affected regions in the UK, although cases have been rising steeply."
2021-01-16T13:52:42Z,uk-news,UK news,"CBBC star Archie Lyndhurst died from brain haemorrhage, mother confirms","The CBBC actor Archie Lyndhurst, the son of the Only Fools and Horses actor Nicholas Lyndhurst, died from a brain haemorrhage, his mother has said. Lucy Smith, a former ballet dancer, said a postmortem found his death was due to natural causes. Her 19-year-old son had had “numerous bleeds” on the brain and would have died painlessly in his sleep, the doctor confirmed to her, at his home in Fulham, west London, on 22 September. “The results utterly floored us to think something like this could happen. It’s very rare and around only 800 people a year die from it,” she said of the intracerebral haemorrhage. “Only days before he’d been with the love of his life, Nethra, celebrating his birthday early as she was due to go away with work commitments. Life is fragile, precious and sometimes incredibly cruel.” Writing on Instagram, she added: “Nick and I try each day to make Archie proud, but it’s baby steps, beyond hard and a struggle at times. The world is a very different place without him. One of my last conversations with him was about all that was going on in the world, the chaos, anger about all different subjects.
“He looked at me with his huge blue soulful eyes, shook his head and said: ‘All the world needs is love mama, it’s so easy to love.’ “Archie was an empath. He loved life, he valued everyone in it and every moment he was given. He was always singing, and had such energy and passion in everything he did. To be part of his life has been the biggest joy mad honour. We miss him everyday and always will.” Lyndhurst was best known for starring as Ollie Coulton in the comedy show So Awkward, and was described by CBBC’s head of content, Cheryl Taylor, as “such a talented young actor”. Smith suggested she was forced into making the statement by media outlets who may have been planning to carry speculative reports about Lyndhurst’s death. “To have a coroner call you a few days after your child has died to say the press have been calling for the results of Archie’s postmortem, I think stoops to an all-time low for us. What gives the press the right to badger a coroner’s office solely to find the cause of death before the parents? “The complete lack of empathy is astounding. We released no information at the time as we had no idea what he had died from.” Archie’s funeral took place in a tiny chapel in November, Smith said in an earlier message."
2021-01-16T13:17:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Mohamud Hassan death: woman faces Covid fine over Cardiff protests,"A woman faces a £500 fine for allegedly organising protests in response to the death of a man who died hours after being released from police custody in Cardiff, because demonstrations are not allowed under Welsh government regulations. People gathered in protest outside Cardiff Bay police station after Mohamud Hassan’s death on 9 January. His family claim he was assaulted while in custody, but the police have said there was no indication of excessive force used by officers. Hassan, 24, was arrested on suspicion of a breach of the peace after reports of a disturbance at his home on 8 January. He was released from custody without charge the following morning. On Friday, South Wales police said an unnamed woman had been reported for summons by organising the protests on Tuesday and Wednesday, in which around 200 people attended on both occasions demanding video footage of Hassan’s arrest and time in custody be made public. Two further protests outside the police station occurred on Thursday and Friday, and police say further inquires are ongoing. The woman has the option of paying a £500 fixed-penalty notice or requesting a court hearing. A police spokesperson said: “Welsh government regulations are in place to protect the community from the spread of Covid-19 and this action was taken in an effort to protect the public’s health during this global pandemic. “Inquiries into the protests are continuing and further action against other individuals for breaching Covid-19 regulations and, or other criminal offences, is anticipated.” Earlier on Friday, the force’s chief constable, Jeremy Vaughan, described Hassan’s death as a “tragedy” but urged people to abide by the Covid restrictions – which do not allow protests. “I know people want to make their voices heard; the prevalence of racial discrimination and disadvantage across all parts of our society is such an important issue that voices should be heard,” he said. “In ordinary times policing will do all it can to facilitate people lawfully exercising that right to be heard. These are no ordinary times. A global health pandemic is affecting all of us and the virus is spreading, leading to unimaginable pressures on the National Health Service, and I would urge people to follow the regulations and guidelines to help protect the NHS and save lives.” CCTV and body-worn video involving Hassan has been handed to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) which is investigating officers’ contact with him. The force have said the material cannot be publicly released until the conclusion of the IOPC investigation, which is likely to take a number of months. The IOPC’s director for Wales, Catrin Evans, said the investigation will look at the level of force used by officers, but that early indications following postmortem examination showed no physical trauma to explain his death. His aunt, Zainab Hassan, said she saw Hassan following his release on Saturday with “lots of wounds on his body and lots of bruises … He didn’t have these wounds when he was arrested and when he came out of Cardiff Bay police station, he had them. “Nothing we do is going to bring him back, but we will not rest for a second until we have justice.” • This article was corrected on 17 January 2021. It was the police who said there was no indication of excessive force used by officers, not the police watchdog as stated in an earlier version."
2021-01-16T11:24:02Z,uk-news,UK news,NHS worker stuck in Kenya as settled status documents are rejected,"An NHS worker has been left stranded in Kenya because she has been told that new EU settled status documents issued to her by the Home Office are not valid for travel. Doreen Kathambi, 36, lives in Glasgow with her fiance, Iain Dunsmore. She works as a dietetic assistant at the Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley. She had to travel to Kenya last month for her father’s funeral and informed her employers she would be back in the UK by 18 January. She obtained her EUSS documents from the Home Office last month to enable her to attend the funeral. Although she applied for these documents in July last year, she did not get a biometric residence permit appointment until October. After the death of her father her lawyer had to intervene with the Home Office to expedite the issuing of her EUSS confirmation.
The letter from the Home Office granting her EUSS, seen by the Guardian, confirms that she can prove her settled status by logging into her online digital identity information, which includes her photo and other identifying details. The case raises concerns about the efficacy of EUSS digital documents issued by the Home Office after officials demanded additional proof from Kathambi. She had no problems travelling from the UK to Kenya but when she arrived at the airport in Nairobi on Friday hoping to board a Qatar Airways flight back home she was denied permission to board the plane by airline staff and immigration officials at the airport. “I presented my letter from the Home Office confirming my EU settled status, which said I could share my immigration status online but they said that the advice given by the Home Office to prove my status online is not enough, I need a visa stamped on my passport,” she said. Although she logged into her digital identity documents, which included a photo, and showed them to officials, they rejected this as proof of her status and said they would have to contact Home Office officials in London. She showed a screenshot of the UK government website page titled: “View and prove your immigration status”, explaining how to access the online identity information but was still denied permission to board the 5.10pm flight she and her fiance were booked on to. Kathambi is distressed by her experience and concerned that her delay in returning to the UK could put her job at risk. “I’m so worried about my job,” she said. “I asked the airline officials if they could at least give me a document to confirm they had denied me boarding of the plane so that I could show that to my employer but they refused to do so.” The Home Office issues biometric cards to some people granted EUSS, but many only have the online evidence to rely on that failed in Kathambi’s case. She said her experience at the airport was traumatic. “They were asking me all sorts of personal questions about things like whether I was married. I kept showing them proof that I could travel. I even showed them my NHS work badge which I carry with me. But everything was refused. The whole thing was so dehumanising. I almost lost my mind in the airport.” Chai Patel of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said: “We’ve warned time and again that digital only status will lead to discrimination – in particular against people of colour. Now we are seeing confirmation of this. [The]Home Office must immediately enable Doreen to return to the UK – as is her right as an EU settled status holder and give Europeans the physical proof they so desperately need to demonstrate their rights. Without this we will sadly see more discrimination at borders, in employment and in housing.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are in the process of making contact with Ms Kathambi to work with her on the best options to help her to return to the UK. “A non-EEA national with settled status must continue to present their passport and biometric residence card to travel to the UK.” Qatar Airways has been approached for comment. • This article was amended on 16 January 2021. An earlier version said the Home Office issue biometric cards to people granted EUSS, but this only applies in some cases. This has been clarified."
2021-01-16T09:00:28Z,uk-news,UK news,'Technophobe' Camilla clicks with Zoom and finds favour under Covid,"From her Reading Room book club to her Strictly Come Dancing cameo, the profile of the Duchess of Cornwall has never been higher. During the coronavirus pandemic, Camilla, 73, has guest-edited BBC 5 live’s Emma Barnett Show, filmed a SafeLives video on domestic violence, shared chocolate cake recipes on the Big Virtual Lunch, and coerced her rescue jack russell, Beth, into unveiling a Battersea Dogs & Cats Home plaque by pulling a sausage tied to the cord. We’ve seen her dressed down in jeans, and up close and personal with her dog on her lap at home. We’ve heard her reciting WH Auden on National Poetry Day, and the role of Ship’s Captain in a celebrity-studded audio of Roald Dahl’s James and the Giant Peach. “Both Charles and Camilla have been troupers throughout 2020, given the pandemic, and their ages. But in terms of Camilla, she has been more visible and more audible than she has ever been before. This is Camilla on a more personal level,” said Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty Magazine.
Which will be music to the ears of Clarence House aides charged with smoothing the duchess’s path to the consort’s throne, a journey not without its obstacles. Though the duchess’s standing has been transformed to that of one of the Queen’s favourites, the Netflix hit The Crown recently swung the spotlight back on to Charles’s marriage to Diana, serving as a reminder of Camilla’s unpopularity in that period as vilified mistress. Not that her current high profile is part of a palace ploy to promote “Queen Camilla”, or “Princess Consort”, or whichever title is eventually bestowed. Far from it, sources insist, though her recent successes are likely to make that task easier. Camilla is not the product of a series of palace advisers. She chooses the things she wants to do, and then aides help to deliver them, said those close to her team. She has never wanted a big PR campaign to promote her, sources said. What she wanted was to meet people, let them see what she is like, and then make their own minds up. Zoom and other video conferencing platforms have given her that opportunity to get up close and personal to people, sources said. And she has embraced it – despite previously being a self-confessed technophobe.
She is someone who, while very aware of the need for duty and service, doesn’t take the view you can only do that with a straight face, said one who knows her. A laugh, a joke, and a little bit of self-deprecation – one of her most popular approaches – go a long way.
“The benefit of all this is people have got to know her, and appreciate her qualities, far more than ever before, though she has been a member of the royal family now coming up for 16 years. She has that little twinkle in her eye, and is completely relatable,” said Little. She also, it is said, regularly reminds those around her that she had 50 years living a normal life before entering the royal world, and that she knows the difference – but she also knows where the join is. The royal author and Camilla biographer Penny Junor said: “The royal family have really come into their own during this pandemic. They are doing the sort of stuff they have been doing on a daily basis, but because they are doing it online, far more people can access it.” In the real world, Camilla might do a couple of visits in a day, meeting a handful of people. Now we can all “hear her voice and see her charm”, said Junor. “She’s her own PR. As soon as she was married to Charles, and people met her, they realised she was a warm, friendly, charming, funny, woman. And it then turned out she was rather good at the job, too. So there was no need for a great PR machine to ratchet up. She is her own ambassador.” The Camilla of the online engagements might have come as a surprise to some of the wider public, said Junor. “To the public that know her, and that have had the opportunity to meet her, they won’t be surprised. But I think to a lot of people who don’t know her, who have never met her, who have nothing to do with the charities where she has been so effective … I think it will be a revelation to them.”"
2021-01-16T07:00:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Legal action launched against plan to house asylum seekers at Yarl's Wood,"Pressure is mounting on the Home Office over its plans to house nearly 200 asylum seekers in what campaigners have described as a “prison-style” camp on the site of an immigration jail. The construction of prefab-style accommodation at the privately run Yarl’s Wood centre in Bedfordshire follow a series of damning reports on conditions at two former army barracks sites in Kent and Pembrokeshire being used to hold up to 600 asylum-seeking men. Campaigners have started legal action against the expansion of Yarl’s Wood, which is set to house its first asylum seekers imminently, while councillors in Bedford have spoken out against the new development. The Home Office has invoked emergency powers under town and country planning legislation to speedily construct the cabin-style accommodation without seeking planning permission through conventional channels. Images of the new site have been leaked to the Guardian.
The tension over the Yarl’s Wood site comes as the chief inspector of borders and immigration, David Bolt, said he hoped to be able to inspect the camps on the former Ministry of Defence sites “within a few weeks”. Rosie Newbigging, a former Labour parliamentary candidate for Welwyn Hatfield, in Hertfordshire, and a volunteer for refugee support charity Care4Calais and Stand Up to Racism Bedford, has sent a letter before action to the Home Office and Bedford borough council – the first step in judicial review proceedings. Newbigging, who has raised more than £16,000 towards her lawsuit on a crowdfunding website, said: “Development of the site is already under way, with the Home Office claiming that emergency provisions under town and country planning regulations, allow them to develop sites without planning permission or essential environmental or social risk assessments. “This means that there has been no consultation, none of the usual scrutiny by responsible agencies, and in fact there has not even been publication of the plans in the public domain.
She added: “The emotional impact of using camp-style accommodation, in a remote area, next to an immigration removal centre, with virtually no access to support in the community, is something we all need to oppose.” Louise Jackson, portfolio holder for health and wellbeing at Bedford council, said she had a constructive meeting with Home Office officials but significant concerns still remain. “I’m fundamentally opposed to that model. I think they’re treating some vulnerable people with complete lack of dignity,” she said. “It looks like a prisoner of war camp. These people are traumatised. You don’t make that journey for no reason.” She added: “I find it unacceptable that with hotels, holiday parks, offices shut, the only suitable accommodation for people fleeing war and life trauma is a Portakabin on an industrial park.” Jackson said it had echoes of “the hostile environment” policy spearheaded by the former prime minister, Theresa May, which drove the Windrush scandal. “We’re an area with a high infection rate, in a pandemic, you’re talking about moving 200 people from somewhere else in the country, into unsuitable accommodation which helps the virus to spread. All these ideas were conceived prior to the new variant being identified, she said. “Why hasn’t the home secretary gone back in light of what we now know about the new variant and reviewed the plans?” More than 50 organisations, including Stand Up to Racism, Refugee Council, Freedom From Torture, Unite and Doctors of the World have signed a petition to stop the move. The founder of Care4Calais, Clare Moseley, said: “It’s the freezing cold middle of winter and the Home Office thinks it’s acceptable to force vulnerable refugees to live in flimsy Portakabins. “The people that come to the UK for asylum are traumatised, they’ve escaped unimaginable wars and persecution, to lock them up at Yarl’s Wood is cruel. The prison-style camp the Home Office is building at Yarl’s Wood will be a place of misery for refugees, when what they need is a place of safety.” The minister for immigration compliance, Chris Philp, said: “To ensure we have sufficient accommodation available to meet our statutory obligations we are considering the use of a vacant site adjacent to the existing Immigration Removal Centre to accommodate asylum seekers while their claim is being fully processed.”"
2021-01-15T15:29:13Z,uk-news,UK news,Grime artist who raped four women has jail sentence increased,"A man who held four women against their will and repeatedly raped them has had his sentence increased by the court of appeal. Victims of Andy Anokye, 33, who performed as a grime artist under the stage name Solo 45, told how he beat and threatened them with weapons, held a cloth with bleach over their faces and waterboarded them, recording much of the abuse on his mobile phone. Anokye was convicted of 30 charges at Bristol crown court last year and handed a 29-year extended sentence, made up of a 24-year jail term and an extended licence period of five years. But after a hearing on Friday three senior judges concluded the sentence was “unduly lenient” and increased it to 35 years – with a 30-year jail term and five years extended licence. Lady Justice Macur, sitting with two other judges, said the original sentence did not reflect the fact that Anokye had committed multiple offences of rape against four separate victims. The court refused an attempt by Anokye to appeal against the length of his original sentence. His sentence was referred to the court by the Attorney General’s Office (AGO) under the unduly lenient sentencing scheme. Speaking after the ruling, the solicitor general, Michael Ellis QC, said: “Anokye’s crimes were truly shocking. The court of appeal’s decision to increase his sentence recognises the severity of the abuse he inflicted upon his victims and the danger he poses to the public.” The musician, who was part of the collective Boy Better Know, admitted in court that he liked to “terrorise” women but claimed they always consented to his “rape game”. However, when asked during cross-examination whether he ever continued to have sex when a woman had asked him to stop, Anokye initially said he “usually” did stop, before swiftly correcting himself to say “always”. The videos he made of his crimes were so extreme and intimate that the public gallery was cleared when they were shown and, unusually, only two members of the media were allowed to view them. Anokye grew up in Tottenham, north London, but was living in a Bristol apartment at the time of his arrest. Giving evidence, Anokye told the court he had dacryphilia – a sexual arousal from tears or sobbing. He will only be released from prison after serving at least 20 years of his 30-year jail term behind bars and when the Parole Board is satisfied he no longer poses a danger to the public."
2021-01-15T15:18:48Z,uk-news,UK news,UK weather: snow and ice warnings issued for Scotland and parts of England,"Snow and ice warnings have been issued for much of Scotland and parts of England for the weekend. The Met Office expects a band of heavy snow to bring disruption to road and rail networks as it sweeps eastwards in the early morning. A snow warning is in place for London, with up to 4cm expected to fall in the south-east and East Anglia. Motorists have been told to expect continuing icy conditions across much of England, Wales and Scotland. Temperatures were as low as -6C early on Friday in parts of Yorkshire and Cumbria, with yellow warnings likely to last through most of the day. Yorkshire Ambulance said it had stood down from the major incident status it declared on Friday. However, staff would continue to monitor the situation. Efforts to press on with the vaccine distribution have been affected by the bad weather. At one point a vaccination centre in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was closed, with patients told to await new appointments. Pensioners on the over-80s list at Newcastle’s Centre for Life were told they could rebook rather than risk making a trip in the icy conditions. Newcastle Hospitals tweeted: “There’s enough vaccine for everyone, so don’t worry about making a trip to Newcastle.” Leeds University delayed the opening of its asymptomatic Covid-19 test centre, saying: “We know travel in the snow can be tricky, so if you are late you will still be seen.” Brighter Futures, which provides homes, hostels and health services for the homeless and mentally ill in the Midlands, activated its severe weather emergency procedure. The organisation is giving emergency accommodation to everyone it sees sleeping rough. A juror in the trial of Pawel Relowicz, who denies raping and murdering student Libby Squire, was unable to get to Sheffield crown court on Friday due to the weather. The case had already been postponed on Thursday when three jurors found themselves unable to make the journey. About 700 homes in the Hebden Bridge area of West Yorkshire lost their gas supply when water froze in a pipe. Becky Mitchell, meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “Saturday is the next day we could potentially see some snow.” Areas at lower levels and further south could be see up to 2-5cm of snow or face rain or sleet. Saturday’s Met Office weather warning states: “At first the main hazard may be rain falling on to frozen surfaces leading to ice, especially on higher level routes. However, snow becomes more likely during the early morning. “Heavier snowfall is more likely above 200 metres in Scotland and northern England, where 5-10cm of snow may accumulate, possibly 20cm on highest routes.”"
2021-01-15T14:16:21Z,uk-news,UK news,New Covid outbreak at third UK immigration removal centre,"A number of Covid-19 outbreaks have been confirmed across the immigration detention estate and asylum seeker accommodation, prompting warnings of a major public health risk and calls to release individuals into the community. Harmondsworth immigration removal centre (IRC), near Heathrow, the largest of its kind in Europe, is the third such centre to experience an outbreak. It is understood that there are at least two detainees who have tested positive for Covid along with a number of staff.
In addition, at least one asylum seeker being held at a former army barracks in Kent being used as initial accommodation by the Home Office has tested positive for Covid after taking a test on Wednesday. The man is being held at Napier barracks in Folkestone while he awaits a decision on his asylum claim. He and more than 25 others have been isolating in blocks 5 and 6 of the barracks since individuals first developed symptoms. The Guardian understands as many as eight positive tests have been returned. Last week the Home Office temporarily closed another IRC – Brook House near Gatwick – due to a Covid outbreak. There has also been a Covid outbreak at Morton Hall IRC in Swinderby, near Lincoln.
The latest confirmed Covid outbreak in a detention centre comes as 73 organisations on Thursday sent an urgent letter to Priti Patel calling for the release of all detainees from immigration removal centres to prevent a “full-scale crisis” because of the pandemic. Signatories include Amnesty International, Liberty and the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, law firms and barristers chambers along with the detention charities Bail for Immigration Detainees, (BID) Detention Action and Medical Justice. The letter, coordinated by BID, states: “It is now clearer than it has ever been that the continued use of immigration detention cannot be consistent with public health and undermines national efforts to bring coronavirus under control.” It urged the home secretary to release all detainees to safe and suitable accommodation.
Pierre Makhlouf, assistant director of BID, said: “The home secretary herself this week urged people to ‘play your part’ in the fight against coronavirus. At this critical moment she must now do the right thing and release everybody held in immigration detention. With a third confirmed outbreak of Covid-19 at a detention centre and already historically low numbers of people in detention, there is no justification to continue to hold people.” Bella Sankey, director of Detention Action, said: “All week we’ve heard about detained people and detention centre staff at Harmondsworth testing positive for Covid. The government has funded deportation flights of Covid-positive people, spreading the virus across the globe and contributing to further transmission in the UK. This is as serious as it gets, the home secretary’s vain desire to look tough coming before the lives of officials and those caught up in the immigration system.”
Emma Ginn, director of Medical Justice, said: “We have repeatedly warned the Home Office that locking people up together in immigration detention risks the health of detainees. It also risks the health of detention staff who form a conduit of infection between the community and the detained population, thus functioning as an ‘epidemiological pump’. The Home Office keeps reassuring everyone that their measures to prevent the spread of Covid are effective, but they are clearly not. The Home Office should now urgently close all IRCs.” The immigration minister , Chris Philp , said: “We work closely with our providers and Public Health England to ensure all medical advice is closely followed and people self-isolate where needed. All immigration removal centres have dedicated health facilities run by doctors and nurses as well as robust contingency plans in place.” Mitie, the Home Office contractor at Harmondsworth IRC, said: “A small number of staff have tested positive and are isolating, but this is very much in line with previous levels and those seen in public communities. “These are individual cases and are not concentrated in any particular area on the site so we do not believe they are connected. Routine Covid-19 testing and full PPE equipment and procedures are in place to ensure the health and safety of both staff and detainees.” The Home Office has been approached for comment about Covid at Napier barracks."
2021-01-15T12:15:12Z,uk-news,UK news,Wales to introduce new Covid risk assessments for shops and workplaces,"Laws are to be introduced in Wales to make supermarkets, shops and workplaces more Covid secure amid concerns that standards are slipping. All retailers will be required by law to put in place measures such as limiting the number of customers, while workplaces are to be obliged to carry out Covid assessments taking into account the new more easily transmissible variant. But the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said on Friday there were signs that Covid rates were stabilising across most of the country and suggested it was possible some lockdown measures could begin to be eased at the end of January. Drakeford said the all-Wales coronavirus infection rate had fallen to below 400 per 100,000 people for the first time in many weeks. “We are seeing some encouraging signs that cases are stabilising and reducing,” he said. “These signs of improvements show all the hard work and sacrifice is really paying off. We have to continue making this effort.” He said the NHS in Wales remained under “immense and sustained pressure” but “marginal easements” of the current lockdown restrictions could be on the horizon. “If things over the next two weeks continue to head in the right direction the cabinet will decide if there is any headroom for us to begin the process of lessening the levels of restrictions we face,” he said. “We would have to be certain that improvement is reliable, sustainable in order for us to begin the journey of lifting restrictions.” He added that the government was keen to get children returning to face-to-face learning as quickly as possible as long as it could be done safely. “We all want children to be back in the classroom, we all want that to be done in a way that is safe for them and staff.”
On shops and supermarkets, Drakeford said: “We will put into the law those measures that are currently set out in guidance. For example, all retailers will need to have signs visible to help people keep their distance and make their way around the store. They must have sanitiser for hands and trolleys and systems in place to limit the number of people who can be in-store at any one time.” He said there was “significant evidence” of coronavirus transmission in supermarkets and while the majority of supermarkets had worked hard to make their shops as safe as possible, the “visible signs of protection” had been reduced compared with last spring. “I think it is very important in giving confidence to staff and to people who go shopping that a more visible sense that everything is being done to protect them is put back in its place,” Drakeford said.
The first minister said it would become a legal requirement for a businesses with five or more employees to carry out a Covid risk assessment. All businesses that had such an assessment would have to re-run it to take into account the new strain of the virus. He said issues such as ventilation, social distancing, PPE, face coverings and making sure the maximum number of people possible worked from home were among the issues businesses would have to consider.
Drakeford said it would be up to owners and managers to enforce the rules. He raised concern about coronavirus rates in Wrexham and Flintshire in north Wales. He said the new variant was dominant in the north and suggested the proximity of areas badly affected to north-west England could be a factor."
2021-01-15T12:15:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Digested week: home schooling has turned me into an anti-fractioner | Lucy Mangan,"Monday A new week dawns and fresh madness breaks upon us. Sex and the City is to be relaunched as a 10-part limited series under the title Just Like That – without the legendary sex goddess Samantha Jones. Think The Beatles without John. Jaffa Cakes without the smashing orangey bit. A pair of Louboutins without the scarlet sole. For the scarlet soul of the show she surely was. The rest of the quartet were, at best, a labour of love for viewers. Linchpin Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) was an exhausting mass of neuroses and learned helplessness distilled into one tiny, starving, designer-clad frame, Charlotte (Kirsten Davies) was seven parts idiot, and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon)was a ballbreaker who morphed into a self-sabotaging overthinker who was only allowed to get her man (Steve, also seven parts idiot) when production had finally worked out what to do with her hair. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) strode with a blessedly unshakeable confidence through every scene, like a penis-seeking missile, offering expert relief not just to any male (and occasionally female) genitals in the vicinity but to viewers too. A longstanding animus between Cattrall and Parker is thought to be behind Cattrall’s refusal to get onboard the new outing. But without her, as Carrie (almost) said at the beginning of every column that somehow kept her in Blahniks and her brownstone, I cannot help but wonder if there’s really any point. On the other hand, if someone would like to remake Schitt’s Creek for me without the mayor, a character so viscerally repellent that I have to watch with a bucket by my feet, let the record show that I am very much in the market for that. Tuesday Victoria and David Beckham are building a lake in lockdown at their £6m Cotswolds home, while I – in, for the avoidance of doubt, my non-£6m, non-Cotswolds home – am trying to understand improper fractions and the various manipulations thereof, thanks to home-fecking-schooling. I thought that I was getting used to the punishing necessity of having to believe six impossible things before breakfast. Today’s gamut, for example, ran from “contracted suppliers of £30 lunch parcels to impoverished children furnishing forth £5 of food per time in the form of carrot stumps, single halves of tomatoes and tuna portions literally packed into the little bags banks use to keep coins in, via Trump’s name found carved on to an endangered manatee’s back, to the government delaying any sort of testing of airport travellers for another week, a year into a pandemic. But the idea that fifteen-sevenths can or should ever be a thing, let alone that they can or should ever be multiplied or divided by nine-fifths or their ilk, is utterly beyond me and I will have no part in it. If we do live in a post-fact world as some insist, let us at least embrace an anti-vulgar fraction movement as well as anti-vaxxers.
Wednesday The UK wakes up to the news that we have officially passed the 100,000 Covid deaths milestone and that across the pond a gorilla in a zoo has tested positive for the virus. A lightening of spirits and possibly a brief pause in the packing of survival kits and plotting of routes on Ordnance Survey maps (no point relying on Google Maps when the grid goes down, my non-prepper friends!) to the remoter reaches of the Welsh valleys and Scottish Highlands was occasioned in the afternoon, however, when the news came that Donald Trump had been impeached. Again. A small reassertion of justice by itself, of course, but it does also point the way – if you squint really hard – to some possible future reckoning for our own government. Let’s research the law regarding manslaughter in our bunkers and prepare our opening speeches, in case there are any people left to prosecute or principles left to defend by the time we re-emerge. Thursday Since smashing my ankle to bits just before Christmas, I have been living a mini-lockdown within the macro one. Limited by having the upper body strength of Silly String, my walker (not even crutches! I’m risible!) and I have travelled no further than the loo and bed for three weeks. But today liberation dawned with the arrival of my knee scooter. It looks like a little trike and does exactly what it says on the tin. You put the knee of your bad leg on the seat, grab a firm hold of the handlebars and scoot with the other leg. The whole world opens up in an instant. I can roll anywhere on the ground floor in an instant. I can stand safely, balanced on knee and foot, and make a cup of coffee and even, I suspect, a basic meal. I can even – get this – leave the house. I mean, I’m not going to, obviously, because of all the coughing gorillas I assume are filling the streets by now, but it’s nice to know that I could if I had to. And of course the lifting of one set of restrictions naturally raises the hope that one day the burden of the other will lift too. One dose of vaccination, then the other, one cautious but determined step at a time, and we will all walk freely once more.
Friday I don’t know, I don’t know – can a metaphor be writ too large? Try this one for size: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s security detail have apparently had to be rented a $3,000-a-month apartment just for its bathroom facilities after the couple refused to let them use any of the six lavatories in their Washington DC mansion. I know – for the lesser Trumps to go out on an actual toilet story is almost too good, it’s almost too much. But it’s true. For a while, the Secret Service agents made do with portable toilets and trips to Mike Pence’s and Barack Obama’s homes. But it was eventually decided that the taxpayer would have to stump up in order to provide a reliable relief station for the people who were supposed to be available to protect the couple 24/7 rather than scurrying around begging for basic sanitation rights. Final proof, if it were ever needed, that the rich are different and that Alexander Knox was right – the more they have, the less they’re worth. The Trumps alone have clogged the system long enough. Flush the lot."
2021-01-15T12:06:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Megrahi family to appeal to UK supreme court over Lockerbie conviction,"The family of the Libyan convicted for the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, are lodging an appeal to the UK supreme court after Scottish judges threw out a miscarriage of justice case. The court of appeal in Edinburgh ruled on Friday that Megrahi was properly convicted of bombing Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988, killing 270 passengers, crew and townspeople. The court, chaired by Lord Carloway, Scotland’s most senior judge, rejected both grounds of appeal from Megrahi’s family, lodged after the Scottish criminal cases review commission, an official body which investigates suspected miscarriages of justice, returned the case to court. “On the evidence at trial, a reasonable jury, properly directed, would have been entitled to return a guilty verdict,” its ruling said. Megrahi died at home in Tripoli in 2012 after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. Aamer Anwar, the family’s lawyer, said they would now take their case to the supreme court in London and would continue pressing for the UK government to release a secret document thought to implicate Iran and a Palestinian terror group. It emerged in November that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had upheld a public interest immunity certificate withholding documents, thought to have been sent by the then king of Jordan, which alleged a Jordanian intelligence agent within the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), called Marwan Khreesat, made the bomb. Anwar said: “Ali al-Megrahi, the son of the only man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, said his family were left heartbroken by the decision of the Scottish courts. He maintained his father’s innocence and is determined to fulfil the promise he made to clear his name and that of Libya.” The significance of the Megrahi appeal increased in December after William Barr, the outgoing US attorney general, announced he was indicting another Libyan, Mohammed Abouagela Masud, for allegedly building the bomb used against Pan Am 103. Masud is thought to be in a Libyan jail, and had been named as an associate of Megrahi’s on the original indictment against Megrahi but never formally implicated in the bombing. Lord Wolffe, the lord advocate and head of Scotland’s prosecution service, welcomed the appeal court decision. He did not refer directly to the US decision to indict Masud but confirmed that other suspects were under “active investigation”. He said the Lockerbie remained “the deadliest terrorist attack on UK soil and the largest homicide case Scotland’s prosecutors have ever encountered in terms of scale and of complexity”. So far no other suspects have been formally identified by Scottish police or prosecutors but it is understood Masud is also very high on the Scottish list of names. Wolffe said a pledge to the Scottish parliament by the then lord advocate, Lord Boyd, to continue searching for other culprits after Megrahi’s conviction in 2001 was being honoured. “For almost 20 years since that date, Scottish police and prosecutors have continued the search for evidence. This work will continue; and there remain suspects under active investigation,” Wolffe said. The latest appeal centred on two grounds. The first was that no reasonable jury would have convicted Megrahi on the evidence offered in court, particularly on the circumstantial evidence of Tony Gauci, a Maltese shopkeeper who claimed he sold clothes to Megrahi which were placed in the suitcase bomb. It also said the conviction was unsafe because the prosecution had failed to disclose evidence which raised strong doubts about reliability of Gauci’s evidence and information contained in CIA cables. On the opening day of the appeal, heard in November, Megrahi’s legal team accused the judges who convicted Megrahi at a special trial held without a jury 20 years ago of “cherrypicking” evidence. “The court has read into a mass of conflicting evidence a pattern or conclusion which is not really justified,” Claire Mitchell QC told the five appeal judges. But that was rebutted in the appeal court’s 64-page ruling. In a passage rejecting allegations that the possibility of Gauci getting a reward for his evidence should have been disclosed, the judges said the court had been very careful in how it reached its verdict. “When the whole evidence, and the circumstances of the trial in general, are taken into account, the content of these documents [referring to a reward] would have been of no significance relative to the undermining of the careful reasoning of the court on the credibility and reliability of Mr Gauci,” the ruling said."
2021-01-15T11:32:36Z,uk-news,UK news,What the loss of records from the Police National Computer means,"Fingerprint, DNA and arrest history records have been accidentally deleted from databases linked to the Police National Computer (PNC). Here we take a look at what the PNC is used for and the implications of the technical blunder. What is the Police National Computer? The PNC is a system that stores and shares criminal records information across the UK, according to the criminal records office Acro. Law enforcement agencies use it to access information that will support national, regional and local investigations, Acro says. A person’s PNC record contains their name, date of birth, sex and ethnic appearance and an arrest summons number, as well as details of successful convictions. Information about DNA and fingerprints is also held on the PNC. How is the information used? According to the College of Policing, the PNC provides “real-time checks” on people, vehicles, crimes and property. In addition, other “non-police organisations”, have limited access to information held on the PNC in order to help them fulfil their statutory functions. Organisations such as the Charity Commission for England and Wales, government departments, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), the Prison Service, the NHS and UK border operations. How long is information kept? An individual’s record on the PNC is retained until their 100th birthday, including if they were released with no further action after an arrest. DNA and fingerprints are held indefinitely for those convicted of a crime, except for first-time offenders who are children. If a person is not convicted and released without further action, the DNA and fingerprints could be held for three years before deletion. What has been lost?
According to a letter sent to the National Police Chiefs’ Council, more than 400,000 offence records, arrest records and person records may have been deleted, as well as tens of thousands of fingerprint records and DNA records, some of which had been marked for “indefinite retention”. What is the impact? The impact is significant because some offenders are ultimately charged and convicted because their fingerprints and DNA, accessed via the PNC, are kept and cross-checked against material found at other crime scenes."
2021-01-15T10:18:31Z,uk-news,UK news,How the New Cross fire became a rallying cry for political action,"Yvonne Ruddock’s 16th birthday party was the first her mother had allowed her to host in the family home in New Cross, south-east London. But the joint celebration that started with much excitement ended in a devastating blaze that killed Yvonne, her brother and 11 others on 18 January 1981. The victims were nearly all teenagers, and all black. Twenty-seven others were seriously injured. One of the survivors was so horrified by what he saw that he killed himself two years later. The tragedy became a hugely politicising moment for the black community, due largely to the lack of response from the police, public, and government. The slogan “13 dead, nothing said” became a rallying cry for political action. On the 40th anniversary of the blaze, and in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, the hurt remains for many. Community organisers have warned that lessons have still not been learned, pointing to the painful process that victims of recent deaths in custody and the Grenfell Tower fire have had to undergo to get justice. “I remember somebody asked me how do we go about moving forward and, to be quite honest, there isn’t a way of moving forward,” said Richard Gooding, who lost his 14-year-old brother Andrew in the fire.
Richard recalled dropping off his three siblings at the party and leaving before the fire started. His 11-year-old sister Denise and 17-year-old brother David were injured, David seriously. Shortly after the fire, his parents received a letter that stated: “How glad I was when 13 [n-words] went up in smoke.” “We were devastated because we’d just lost our brother, but that was the sort of thing that was going on,” Gooding, who was 19 at the time, added. “When we went to the police station, a lot of the times they were questioning us like we were the criminals rather than the victims.” Yvonne Field, the chief executive of the Ubele Initiative, was studying in Birmingham in 1981 when she heard the news of the fire. “I can remember exactly where I stood. There was a sense of dread and sadness. I was beside myself.” The fire occurred during a time when the black community was “under siege” by the far right and controversial policing tactics, according to community organiser Lee Jasper. A year earlier, Annie Pilkington-Bernier, who worked at Union Place, a leftwing printing press, remembers how close she came to being attacked. “Somebody in the workplace picked up the telephone and it was a cross-line. And who was on that cross-line? The National Front, plotting to petrol bomb the building that I worked in.”
In the aftermath of the blaze, John La Rose, Darcus Howe, and Roxy Harris, all members of the Black Parents Movement, visited Yvonne’s mother Armza Ruddock at a home near the gutted New Cross house. A meeting was then held on 20 January, which 300 people attended, according to an interview with La Rose published in the book The New Cross Massacre Story. Present were anti-racist groups known as “the Alliance”, which as well as the Black Parents Movement, included the Black Youth Movement, Race Today Collective and Bogle L’Ouverture Publications. The meeting established the New Cross Massacre Action Committee and a fact-finding commission, which interviewed witnesses and ensured survivors had legal support. Police initially thought the New Cross fire was caused by a firebomb thrown through a downstairs window. But, after studying forensic evidence, later stated that the fire had started inside the house. Further advances in science led the police to conclude the fire broke out at 5.40am by an armchair in the front room. (Two inquests into the fire gave an open verdict.) Aggrey Burke, a retired British psychiatrist and academic who provided psychotherapeutic support to bereaved families, said they remained in a deep state of shock. “Mrs Thatcher didn’t provide any leadership. A month after New Cross there was a fire in Dublin, which killed nearly 50 people at the club. The Queen and the prime minister expressed condolences pretty quickly, but that didn’t happen for New Cross.” Velvetina Francis, whose 17-year-old son, Gerry, died in the fire, said in a BBC interview aired in 1981: “Had it been white kids, she would have been on the television, on the radio, and sent her sympathy.” Six weeks after the fire, an estimated 20,000 people marched for eight hours through London in what was known as the Black People’s Day of Action. The protest, organised by the New Cross massacre committee, was then the largest demonstration by the black community in the UK. Ros Griffiths, a community organiser in London, said that when teachers in her school in Camberwell found out there was going to be a march that Monday, they decided to lock the gates to prevent students leaving to attend. Griffiths, who was 15, added: “We just climbed out the gate and went. It was amazing, it was my first experience of participating in a black-led demonstration.” The dub poet Linton Kwesi Johnson, who was active with Race Today Collective and the Alliance, described the march as a watershed moment. “It made the British establishment sit up and take note of the fact that we weren’t powerless. We were able to mobilise that power in defence of our human rights.” When Pilkington-Bernier read about the march in a Guardian article a few days later, she was surprised to find a picture of herself wearing her favourite hat. “I met black people that day who’d never been on a march before. It was a very powerful day.” Forty years on, she looks back with pride at the day they declared that the victims of the New Cross fire mattered, that their lives mattered, that black lives matter. Those who died in the fire were: Humphrey Brown, 18; Peter Campbell, 18; Steve Collins, 17; Patrick Cummings, 16; Gerry Francis, 17; Andrew Gooding, 14; Lloyd Richard Hall, 20; Patricia Denise Johnston, 15; Rosalind Henry, 16; Glenton Powell, 15; Paul Ruddock, 22; Yvonne Ruddock, 16; Owen Thompson, 16. • This article was amended on 16 January 2021. References in an earlier version to John La Rose, Darcus Howe, and Roxy Harris being members of the Black Panthers Movement, and to that movement being part of “the Alliance”, were intended to refer to the Black Parents Movement. This has been corrected."
2021-01-14T17:56:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Asylum seeker housing conditions under scrutiny at third ex-military site,"A third former military site being used as temporary housing for asylum seekers is facing allegations of poor conditions, poor food quality and mental health crises, it has emerged. The Home Office has been housing asylum seekers in a former officers’ mess at RAF Coltishall, north of Norwich, since April last year. The Norfolk site has not received as much scrutiny as two similar facilities, Napier Barracks in Kent and Penally Barracks in Pembrokeshire, which have been dogged by allegations of cover-ups, poor access to healthcare and legal advice, and crowded conditions.
But it has emerged that there have been similar concerns over the set-up at RAF Coltishall, with people familiar with the site claiming there have been issues with lack of information, food quality, access to medical care including dentistry, as well as suicide attempts and hunger strikes. The Grade II-listed building, on Jaguar Drive, was left derelict for 15 years before refurbishment began in May 2019. A spokesperson for Care4Calais, speaking on behalf of volunteers on the ground, said: “The main overarching issue is some [asylum seekers] have been there as long as eight months with no information, no knowledge as to what is going to happen to them. This is compounded by this being a remote location, miles from the nearest town, facing a bus fare to Norwich. They have nowhere to go, nothing to do. For traumatised people it is incredibly bad for their mental health. They have nothing to do but ruminate. “It makes it a hard place to be. That’s exacerbated because it’s a former military site. The people running the site are using Covid to say no volunteers can go in, but they’ve been saying that a long time before the recent peak started. It’s not been a welcoming community. Refugees have been on the receiving end of racism and hostility – as well as volunteers, because of the work they’re doing.” Last week, the Conservative MP for Broadland, Jerome Mayhew, spoke out against the use of the former RAF base. “The rural location of the asylum centre in the Jaguar Buildings is widely recognised as being unsuitable for anything other than a short-term emergency stopgap to keep asylum seekers off the streets during the Covid pandemic,” he was reported as saying. The issues at Coltishall emerged as dozens of men at the Napier barracks site were placed in isolation after residents developed Covid-19 symptoms. The Guardian understands that the men are being isolated from the rest of the site until coronavirus test results are returned. Meanwhile, Liz Saville Roberts, the Westminster leader of Plaid Cymru, has written to David Bolt, the chief inspector of borders and immigration, urging him to inspect the site in Penally. In her letter, she said: “We are now not only in the middle of winter, but cases of Covid-19 in Wales are alarmingly high. I am extremely worried that the conditions at these old military barracks are wholly unsuitable to deal with the cold weather and to facilitate effective social distancing. “The establishment and continued use of the camp under these conditions shows a clear disregard for the health and wellbeing of those housed inside.” The immigration minister, Chris Philp, said: “As required by law, we provide asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute with accommodation, paid for by the taxpayer. “During the pandemic we have acted quickly to source contingency accommodation to create additional capacity to ensure that our obligations can be met in full. “We take the wellbeing of asylum seekers extremely seriously and those at Coltishall are staying in safe, Covid-compliant conditions, in line with the law and social distancing requirements. “All their basic needs are met, those on the site have access to appropriate medical care, they are provided with three meals a day, and have access to the 24/7 Migrant Help helpline to raise any issues.”"
2021-01-14T17:15:00Z,uk-news,UK news,Man offers Newport council Â£50m if it helps find bitcoins in landfill,"A computer engineer who claims he accidentally threw away a hard drive containing a virtual currency worth tens of millions of pounds has promised to give a local council a quarter of the fortune if they help him dig it out of a rubbish tip. James Howells, 35, says the hard drive of his old laptop contains bitcoins worth about £200m but is languishing in a landfill site in Newport, south Wales. Howells says both he and the council will benefit if they allow him to dig for it but the local authority is refusing, claiming an excavation would break licensing regulations and cause environmental damage. “The attitude of the council does not compute, it just does not make sense,” said Howells. Howells says he threw out the hard drive in summer 2013 when he was clearing out his desk. “I had two identical hard drives and I threw out the wrong one,” he said. “I have to laugh about it now.” He has repeatedly appealed to Newport city council for help in recovering the machine – and has now offered it a 25% share if workers can pluck it out. He believes that even after all this time the hard drive would still be in good enough working order. “The outside case might be rusted. But the inside disk, where the data is stored – there should be a good chance that it still works.” Howells said he had financial backing from a hedge fund to pay for the search so the council would not be out of pocket. And he has a plan. “The way the landfill operated in 2013 was when a general waste bin was full, it was given a serial number, it was dragged off to the open pit and it was buried. It was also given a grid reference number. “So if I could access the landfill records I could identify the week that I threw the hard drive away, I could identify the serial number of the bin that it was in, and then I could identify where the grid reference is located.” A spokeswoman for the council said: “Newport city council has been contacted a number of times since 2014 about the possibility of retrieving a piece of IT hardware said to contain bitcoins. “The cost of digging up the landfill, storing and treating the waste could run into millions of pounds – without any guarantee of either finding it or it still being in working order. “The council has also told Mr Howells on a number of occasions that excavation is not possible under our licensing permit and excavation itself would have a huge environmental impact on the surrounding area. We have, therefore, been clear that we cannot assist him in this matter.”"
2021-01-14T12:54:12Z,uk-news,UK news,UK weather: heavy snow disrupts Scotland and north of England,"Heavy snow and freezing rain in Scotland and northern England has disrupted court trials and Covid vaccination appointments. Amid warnings that a “Beast from the East 2” could hit the UK next week, the Met Office issued an amber snow warning for parts of Scotland and north-east England overnight, with up to 11cm falling in the Perth and Kinross area, 5cm in Cumbria, and large accumulations in other parts of northern England. A yellow snow and ice warning has been issued for Saturday, covering large parts of Scotland and northern and central England. Hospital bosses have advised older people not to visit Newcastle’s Centre for Life mass vaccination hub because of the conditions, and to rebook their appointments. Newcastle upon Tyne NHS hospitals foundation trust tweeted: “It’s easy to do by calling 119. No need to risk travelling in the bad weather.”
The rest of England is expected to experience heavy rain, particularly London and the south-east, while Wales and Northern Ireland are predicted to stay mostly dry. Temperatures fell as low as -5.5C in North Yorkshire on Thursday morning and -6.4C in Dalwhinnie in the Highlands. The Met Office chief meteorologist, Paul Gundersen, said: “There is cold air from the north pushing down the east side of the UK and warm air moving in from the west. Where these two air masses meet a weather front is bringing some heavy rain, which is turning to snow in places.” The trial of Pawel Relowicz, accused of raping and murdering the Hull student Libby Squire, will not go ahead as planned on Thursday after snowfall in South Yorkshire that meant three jurors were unable to get to Sheffield crown court on time. Mrs Justice Lambert told the jurors who did arrive: “I’m sorry and have a safe journey home. Unless you hear anything on the contrary, please return to court tomorrow.” A Met Office spokeswoman said the unsettled conditions were likely to last into next week, and she urged people to be alert for additional warnings. “We’ve seen snow leave the M62 Yorkshire area and journeying now into the Vales of Yorkshire,” she said. “It will push further south as we go through the day, likely to go down to the Midlands but becoming less intense. “When we go into tomorrow there may well be an ice warning issued; we are certainly looking at some potential for frost. With the temperatures warming up through the day there’s potential the snow starts melting. If it freezes overnight there’s a chance of frost and ice tomorrow morning.”"
2021-01-14T11:04:26Z,uk-news,UK news,"Bad omen? Tower of London raven missing, feared dead","One of the ravens at the Tower of London is feared to have died, in a potentially gloomy omen for Britain. It means that the tower is close to having fewer than six ravens, a level that would spell doom for the kingdom, according to legend. Ravenmaster Christopher Skaife confirmed that one of the birds, Merlina, known as the queen of the tower’s unkindness of ravens, is presumed dead after being missing for weeks. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Skaife said: “Merlina is a free-spirited raven and has been known to leave the tower precincts on many occasion. I’m her buddy and she normally comes back to us, but this time she didn’t. So, I do fear that she is not with us any more.” He added: “Just before Christmas, before we went into the lockdown, we were putting the ravens to bed, and she didn’t come back.” If confirmed, Merlina’s death would bring the number of ravens at the tower to just seven. According to legend if two more were to die the tower and the kingdom would fall. But Skaife said that if Merlina did not return, the tower did have a reserve raven to ensure that at least six remained. He said: “We do have seven ravens here at the Tower of London, six by royal decree. And of course I still have a spare one, so we’re OK at the moment.” In a statement on Twitter, the Tower of London said it hoped Merlina would be replaced by a chick from its raven breeding programme.
Various legends associate keeping ravens at the tower with Charles II and his Astronomer Royal, John Flamsteed. According to one, Charles refused to remove ravens from the tower after Flamsteed complained they were obscuring his view of the stars. According to another, Flamsteed was concerned that ravens were being persecuted at the tower after being associated with the Great Fire of London. After being advised that killing all the ravens would be a bad omen, Charles II then ordered six birds to be kept at the tower. • This article was amended on 14 January 2021. In places, the original piece incorrectly spelled the missing corvid’s name as “Molina”, rather than Merlina."

2021-01-14T00:01:23Z,uk-news,UK news,UK rail services to be reduced to 72% of pre-pandemic levels,"Rail services in Britain will be reduced to 72% of pre-pandemic levels over the next few weeks, and passengers are being asked to check before they travel that their service is running. The cuts, which will be announced from Thursday, are less than the 50% reduction in services that had been expected. Train operators have focused on retaining services at morning and evening peak travel times so that key workers such as NHS staff can get to their workplace. The rail industry argues that the timetable cuts will mean a more reliable service for passengers because rail staff can catch the virus like other key workers and cause disruption to more extensive schedules. Rail companies were effectively nationalised last March when franchises were suspended. The rescue deal was extended in October, when emergency recovery contracts were agreed with rail operators ranging from six to 18 months, while the industry moves to a long-term overhaul. Ministers are anxious to curtail costs that have already risen to £9bn in additional subsidy since March. Before fresh lockdowns were announced in England and Scotland on 4 January, rail services were running at 87% of pre-pandemic levels. According to provisional Department for Transport figures, passenger use of national rail was 17% of normal levels on Monday. The new Covid-19 rules instruct people to work from home wherever possible and have banned all non-essential travel. During the first national lockdown last spring, rail services were cut to 55% of pre-Covid levels. However, passenger numbers fell by as much as 96% as people stayed home where possible. Between April and June, passenger journeys on Britain’s railways fell to the lowest level sine the mid-19th century. According to the rail industry regulator, 35m journeys were undertaken, which was just 8% of the total for the same period in 2019. Following the first nationwide lockdown, a number of timetable changes were introduced to steadily increase services throughout last year as more people were able to travel again, and to increase space to allow physical distancing on trains. Rail minister Chris Heaton-Harris said: “It is critical that our railways continue to deliver reliable services for key workers and people who cannot reasonably work from home, and that they respond quickly to changes in demand. “The new reduced timetable delivers that, as well as reducing the financial burden on the taxpayer. Levels of services will vary by operator and changes will come into effect steadily over the next few weeks. Passengers who are using the railways, including those who need to travel to vaccination centres, should check their route before they travel, and aim to do so outside of peak times wherever possible.” Rail companies have sought to make travel safer, by improving cleaning and installing modern air conditioning on the vast majority of trains so the air in carriages is replaced every six minutes to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission. Since the start of the pandemic, rail companies have paid out more than £500m in ticket refunds to people who were unable to travel due to the pandemic. People whose travel plans have been affected by the new Covid-19 restrictions in January can change their date of travel, request a refund or apply for a travel voucher depending on the type of ticket they have purchased, said industry body the Rail Delivery Group."
2021-01-13T22:21:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Furlough refused to 71% of UK working mothers while schools shut - survey,"More than 70% of working mothers who asked to be furloughed for childcare reasons since schools shut have been refused, according to a survey that experts said highlighted a rapid reversal in gender equality that will take decades to repair. The survey of 50,000 women in the UK has revealed the crisis facing working mothers and was described as a “cry for help” by trade union umbrella body the TUC. TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said the government’s lack of support for working parents was causing huge financial hardship and stress – and hitting low-paid mums and single parents hardest. “Just like in the first lockdown, mums are shouldering the majority of childcare,” she said. “Tens of thousands of mums have told us they are despairing. It’s neither possible nor sustainable for them to work as normal, while looking after their children and supervising schoolwork.”
Since April 2020 the job retention scheme has allowed bosses to furlough parents who can’t work due to a lack of childcare, but the survey found that 78% of working mothers had not been offered furlough. The TUC survey found 90% of working mothers had seen their anxiety and stress levels increase during the latest lockdown, while almost half (48%) were worried about being treated negatively by their employers because of their childcare responsibilities. The research also suggests a widespread lack of awareness among workers that they can ask to be furloughed for childcare reasons – two in five mothers were unaware the scheme was available to parents affected by school or nursery closures. While the TUC marketed the survey to all parents, just 7% of respondents (2,660) were men – suggesting the issue is heavily gendered. Of the 167 fathers (compared to 3,100 mothers) who had asked for furlough, 75% had been refused, a similar percentage as women, at 71%. And while 25% of both male and female respondents were using annual leave to manage childcare, 10% of men had been forced to reduce their hours, compared to 18% of women. The TUC is calling for a temporary legal right to furlough for parents and carers, along with 10 days’ paid carers leave, a right to flexible work, an increase in sick pay and access to the self-employment income support scheme (SEISS) for newly self-employed parents. “Making staff take weeks of unpaid leave isn’t the answer,” said O’Grady. “Bosses must do the right thing and offer maximum flexibility to mums and dads who can’t work because of childcare. And as a last resort, parents must have a temporary right to be furloughed where their boss will not agree.” Joeli Brearley of the campaigning group Pregnant Then Screwed said the organisation had been frantically trying to help an influx of “distressed mothers”. “The government must have known this would happen, they must appreciate that by closing schools with little consideration for parent employees that we would see women trapped in impossible circumstances,” she said. “We are on the brink of a mental health crisis and a rapid reversal of gender equality that will take us decades to repair.” Holly*, a single mother with two children requested furlough and provided her boss with government information, but he “refused to believe her” and insisted she take unpaid leave. “I have had to get support for the food bank just so I know at least I will be able to feed my children,” she said. Ciara*, who has three children under 10, said she had been told to work after her children had gone to bed. ‘I finish at 1am and am up at 5.30am with my youngest. I’m facing weeks, maybe longer of this. I can’t sustain it.” Anna Whitehouse, otherwise known as Mother Pukka author of ‘Parenting the Sh*t out of Life’ said working parents were being asked to do the impossible, adding: “This unpaid labour is mainly strapped to female shoulders because - for all the International Women’s Days Sellotaped together - that’s the current working world we live in,” she said. “The system needs to step up for parents before we step back to the 1950s.” Under the current rules employees can be furloughed (with 80% of their wages covered by the government to a maximum of £2,500 a month) if they are clinically extremely vulnerable, caring for someone vulnerable or are “caring for children who are at home as a result of school and childcare facilities closing”. Flexible furlough is available for caring responsibilities and can also be given on a part-time basis, meaning families could choose to share caring responsibilities if supported by their companies. A Treasury spokesperson said: “It’s been clear since the first lockdown that employers can furlough eligible employees who are required to shield, or those with childcare responsibilities, including because of school closures.’’"
2021-01-13T20:13:18Z,uk-news,UK news,"Grace Robertson, photography pioneer, dies at 90","“Gentle pictures are probably dead as a dodo today,” Grace Robertson, the photographer who has died aged 90, told the Guardian in 2010, “but back then it was different.” Back then was the 1950s, when Grace worked for Picture Post in Britain, her gentle style of observational photojournalism chiming with the postwar public’s appetite for images that reflected the small pleasures of peacetime. Picture Post was a weekly news periodical, founded in 1938, that regularly published the work of a generation of pioneering photojournalists, including Bert Hardy and Bill Brandt. Grace’s father, Fyfe Robertson, a famous BBC TV reporter in the 50s and 60s, worked at Picture Post from 1943.
Grace, born in Manchester in 1930, later recalled being dismayed as a teenager by the paucity of career choices available to her. “There were only three jobs considered by society as appropriate – teaching, secretarial work or nursing, just to fill in until you got your man.” After she expressed an interest in photography, her father, in 1949, bought her a camera, enthusiastically encouraging her to try her hand at what was then a combative, male-dominated, medium. She initially sent her photos to Picture Post under a male pseudonym – Dick Muir – not wanting to draw attention to the fact that she was Fyfe Robertson’s daughter. On an early rejection slip, a picture editor wrote “persevere, young man”.
In 1951, she had her first series, A Schoolgirl Does Her Homework, published. It featured her younger sister, Elizabeth. Other photo essays by her were published in the years that followed, including Sheep Shearing in Wales (1951), Tate Gallery (1952), and Mother’s Day Off (1954). The latter series, which became her most celebrated, was a record of a day-trip to Margate by a group of middle-aged and older working-class women she had encountered in a pub in Bermondsey, London, and befriended. “Their energy was awesome,” she said. She later recalled: “These women were survivors.” Robertson had an acute eye for social history, realising in this instance that the working-class community the women belonged to was under threat from the high-rise developments being built in the city.
The series became so iconic that Life magazine commissioned her to reshoot a version of it two years later, this time featuring another group of women who were regulars at a pub in Clapham. She was astonished and embarrassed when Life provided her with a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce for the story. “He insisted on following us down to Margate while I went in the coach,” she told the Guardian in 2006. “The women spotted it, but fortunately it didn’t ruin the story as we got on so well.” Strikingly tall, unmistakably middle-class, and from a Scottish background, Robertson decided from the beginning to make her difference work in her favour, spending time with people until they accepted her. In 1955 she published a pioneering series on childbirth which featured what were then considered graphic images of a young woman giving birth. Belonging by temperament to the left politically, she was also, with hindsight, a proto-feminist, whose work often reflected the experiences and everyday lives of women in Britain. “I took any opportunity to work on stories that allowed me to meet other women,” she later said. She married fellow photographer Thurston Hopkins, in 1955, whom she met while they were both working for Picture Post. They were together until his death, aged 101, in 2014. In 1999 she received an OBE for her services to photography. • This article was amended on 15 January 2021 because an earlier version incorrectly said that Grace’s father Fyfe Robertson founded Picture Post whereas he worked at the publication."
2021-01-13T19:16:09Z,uk-news,UK news,"Family of Leon Briggs will never get over his death, inquest hears","The family of a man who died after being restrained by police in Luton will never be able to get over his death, an inquest has been told. The inquest into the death of Leon Briggs, a 39-year-old father of two from a mixed ethnic background, opened on Wednesday before the senior coroner for Bedfordshire and Luton, Emma Whitting, seven years after he died.
A witness statement from his mother, Margaret Briggs, described the lorry driver, who also taught computer skills to older people, as a “caring and genuine” man and “a loving brother”. On 4 November 2013, police were called to reports of a man behaving unusually in the street. When officers arrived they restrained him and detained him under the Mental Health Act. East of England ambulance service arrived shortly afterwards. Briggs was transported in the back of a police van to Luton police station where he was placed in a cell. He became unresponsive and an ambulance was called to take him to Luton and Dunstable hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Margaret Briggs’ statement charted a severe deterioration in her son’s mental health in the months and weeks before he died. She said that although he had gone through low periods previously there had not been anything like his mental state towards the end of his life where he “started to behave strangely” and believed that people were shining lights into his bedroom, putting spiders through the letterbox at his mother’s home, and trying to kill him. At one point he urged his mother to call the police and showed officers what he said was footage of this he had recorded on his laptop. Police said they could not see anything on the computer. He replied: “Can you see the devil coming out of the screen?” His mother sought help for him from various mental health services who said that not much could be done unless he voluntarily agreed to get help. On the day of his death he had agreed to go to hospital to seek help for his mental health problems. His mother could not find him and after a search was told he was at hospital. She hurried there and after a long wait was told by doctors that although they had tried to resuscitate him for 20 minutes, he had died. “Leon’s passing away has devastated our family,” she said in her witness statement. “The last seven years has been a real nightmare. I don’t think any of us will be able to get over it. We have waited so long to get some answers about what happened to him on the day he died and the wait has added to our pain.” The coroner told the jury that a pathologist had found Briggs’ cause of death to be due to “amphetamine intoxication, prone restraint and prolonged struggling”. A further cause of death was given as coronary heart disease, the inquest heard. Anita Sharma, the head of casework at the charity Inquest, which is supporting the Briggs family, said: “Leon’s family have endured seven years of protracted investigations and legal processes. They now turn to the inquest to provide the utmost scrutiny of the circumstances of his death.” • This article was amended on 14 January 2021 to include the further cause of death of coronary heart disease."
2021-01-13T15:52:09Z,uk-news,UK news,Wendy Simon: the interim mayor running Liverpool from her living room,"Wendy Simon was preparing for a Liverpool-wide open council Zoom meeting on Friday 4 December, when she got a message asking if she, as the council’s designated deputy, would lead the session. That wasn’t unusual, she’d done it several times before. The reason, however, couldn’t have been more out of the ordinary. “My phone was on charge upstairs, I went to make a cup of tea and then I came back into the lounge to lock everybody else out and do the meeting and the chief exec said to me: ‘Have you not seen your phone? I need to speak to you.’” The city’s larger-than-life mayor, Joe Anderson, had been arrested by Merseyside police on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation, alongside four other men from the city as part of an investigation into building and development contracts in Liverpool. Hit by this controversy at the same time as the number of coronavirus cases in the city was starting to rise exponentially, Simon took over as interim mayor with immediate effect and has been running the city out of the living room of the house she shares with her partner, daughter, son-in-law and two-year-old granddaughter ever since. Not put off by the long days and occasional sleepless nights, she is bidding to become the first woman to do the role on a more permanent basis, this week launching her candidacy for mayor if local elections go ahead in May. Anderson has denied wrongdoing and is on bail until mid-February, but has said he will not be Labour’s candidate. “It isn’t something I aspired to do, but as I’ve seen the enormity of what we were facing over the coming months and coming years, I do feel it is important that I put myself forward,” says the softly spoken former social worker. “I am fully aware of the situation we face, and I’m confident of being able to work together with the team to get us through this together and make sure Liverpool comes through this stronger.” In the lead-up to Christmas, Liverpool’s role in fighting the pandemic was being praised by the government and city leaders alike. A groundbreaking mass test-and-trace system was piloted in the city from the second week of November, identifying hundreds of asymptomatic cases. On 19 November the city region had 189 cases per 100,000 people; by 3 December that number had fallen to 88. However, by 7 January it had rocketed to 1,017 cases per 100,000, with 602 Covid beds occupied, compared with 314 in mid-November.
The crisis has been monumentally difficult for local authorities to cope with, but has highlighted the extent of the work they do and the expertise they have to offer, says Simon. “Because of the range of services we provide, we’re really at the frontline,” she says. “But as well as it being really intense, it’s been a time when local government has shone.” Often seen as one of the sharpest thorns in the side of any Conservative government, Liverpool has been cited as a shining example of local and national government collaboration – praise that Anderson likened to a viper showing its teeth. Simon is more pragmatic, pointing out that with only 12% of the council’s funding generated locally, the city has little choice. “There’s a difference between criticising policies and trying to get the best for your city, between highlighting the unfairness and injustice and actually trying to work to bring about better policies to get support and services into the city,” she says. “That doesn’t mean we need to agree with everything that they do, because we certainly don’t.” It could be harder for the city to maintain its position in the limelight with the shadow of criminal proceedings hanging over it. While no charges have been made against Anderson, the government has ordered an emergency inspection of the council following the arrests of the mayor and, in 2019, the council’s director of regeneration, Nick Kavanagh. Simon was first elected to the council in 2007 and has held the tourism brief for a decade as well as working as a senior social worker – a job she resigned from at the end of last month. Seen as an Anderson loyalist over the years, she has insisted she is “her own woman”, adding that the city wants to be as transparent as possible during the corruption inquiry. People “do still want to talk to us as a city”, she insists, but when pushed she admits the scale of the damage is not yet known. “We can’t begin to believe that it’s not devastating, for the individuals concerned and for the city as a whole,” she says. “We’ll have to assess the impact of that in the weeks and months to come.” For now, she will continue to slog away in her living room, the door handle of which is fortunately too high for her granddaughter to reach. Despite the scale of the task ahead, she feels “that little bit of hope that you’re moving towards”, and like the city she hopes to serve, says she has to be resilient. “People are really, really tired. And people have been scared,” she says. “But I think as a city, we still have fantastic opportunities. I think we’re a world-class city, the best city in the world,” she says. “But I would say that, wouldn’t I?”"
2021-01-13T13:59:57Z,uk-news,UK news,Scotland's Covid lockdown tightened with click and collect and takeaway curbs,"Shops in Scotland have been ordered to stop non-essential click-and-collect services and alcohol consumption is to be banned outdoors, in a further tightening of lockdown measures. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said shops would be allowed to offer click and collect only for essential goods such as clothes, shoes, baby equipment, books and homeware from Saturday 16 January. Takeaway outlets will be banned from allowing customers into the building. “I must stress at the outset that the situation we face in relation to the virus remains very precarious and extremely serious,” she told MSPs. UK government ministers are considering restricting click and collect in England, and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, joined Sturgeon in welcoming John Lewis’s voluntary decision on Tuesday to suspend its collect services. After announcing 79 further deaths, with 1,794 people in hospital with Covid, Sturgeon said shops must stagger collection times by offering appointments, as she set out six further controls on people’s movements and interactions. These included banning any alcohol consumption outdoors across all level 4 areas, preventing people from buying takeaway beers to drink outside. Sturgeon said Scotland’s stay-at-home legislation would be tightened to make it clear people were not legally allowed to remain outdoors for non-essential reasons once they had finished any essential task. That brought Scotland’s rules in line with those in the rest of the UK. New statutory guidance will tell employers they are now required to help their staff work from home, and restrictions on builders or plumbers working on non-essential tasks in homes will be enforced in law.
Sturgeon said the current lockdown, which came into force across mainland Scotland on Boxing Day, seemed to be slowing the rate of increase in Covid cases. Testing suggested the new highly infectious variant, B117, was now responsible for 60% of cases, up from 50% in late December. “Case numbers are still so high and the new variant is so infectious that we must be as tough and as effective as we can to stop it spreading,” she told MSPs. The new measures were “a regrettable, but necessary, means to an end”. Business leaders and the Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, urged the Scottish government to significantly speed up the rollout of business support funds. Davidson said a majority of Sturgeon’s promised support funds were still not operational. Tracy Black, the director of CBI Scotland, said click-and-collect services were vital to some retailers’ survival, particularly smaller shops. “It’s really important that the Scottish government sets out compelling evidence that these services are a source of transmission and provides additional, urgent support to compensate for what would be a further loss of revenue in increasingly challenging times,” she said."

Mohammed Islam, known as Nowab Miah, from Hyde, Tameside, was delivering a meal last Friday in the Romiley area when he was run over. The 53-year-old was taken to hospital in a critical condition and died on Sunday afternoon. Greater Manchester police said in a statement on Tuesday: “A 14-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been charged with murder and numerous driving offences. “He has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Manchester magistrates court on Wednesday 13 January.” Islam’s son, Shaf Nowab, posted on Facebook: “I am saddened to announce that my father, my mentor, my role model […] has sadly left this world surrounded by close family. “I would like to thank everyone in the community for their prayers and regards, and me and my family genuinely appreciate everything you have said.” Local people have raised more than £12,000 in Islam’s memory. DCI Liam Boden of GMP’s major incident team said: “As our investigation continues, I would like to pay tribute to Mohammed’s family who have shown such admirable bravery and dignity this week during the most tragic of circumstances imaginable. “They and the local community have responded stoically in the last few days and we are doing all we can to support Mohammed’s loved ones with specialist officers at this awful time. “Our priority is to ensure they get the answers they are undoubtedly owed and we urge anyone with information or footage relating to this incident to submit it to our portal or to contact us via phone so we can ensure we ascertain the full details of this incident.”"
2021-01-12T18:20:14Z,uk-news,UK news,"Libby Squire murder: man, 26, raped and killed student, court hears","A 26-year-old man raped and murdered a “drunk and vulnerable” student in an act of sexual violence before disposing of her body in a river, a court has heard. Libby Squire was in “deep distress”, intoxicated and likely hypothermic when Pawel Relowicz came across her in Hull on the evening of 31 January 2019, a trial was told on Tuesday. Squire had been refused entry to a nightclub and put in a taxi home by her friends when she was seen was stumbling and sobbing on the cold night. Richard Wright QC, prosecuting, said a number of people were concerned for the philosophy student as she walked away from her accommodation, occasionally falling into the snow. Relowicz, a butcher who lived nearby with his wife and two children, had been “patrolling the streets” in his car when he came across Squire and took herto a remote playing field, Sheffield crown court head. It was there that he raped and murdered the student and placed her “dead or dying” into a river, Wright said. Her body was recovered by a lifeboat about seven weeks later after being spotted in the Humber estuary by the skipper of a fishing vessel. Relowicz denies raping and murdering Squire. Wright told the jury Squire had initially had drinks with friends and was said to be in “good spirits” but she was refused entry to the Welly nightclub because she seemed drunk. He said her friends put her in a taxi but on being dropped near her home she fell and landed face first on the ground and walked “away from the safety of her front door” and towards Beverley Road. A group of students heard the student crying and let her in but she left, saying that she wanted to go home. Wright said Squires, who would not take her phone with her on a night out because she had smashed too many screens, had dropped her house keys in the garden of this house. A number of people then saw the student outside and were concerned about her condition, describing her as “obviously drunk” and “sobbing”, the jury heard. Wright told the jury some “good citizens” tried to help Squire, but she became agitated and they left her by the roadside. CCTV showed Squire travelling in the defendant’s car to Oak Road playing fields but she was never seen again. “From there she seemingly vanished,” Wright said. “One man knew very well where Libby had gone. That man is the defendant, Pawel Relowicz.” Squire’s parents, Lisa and Russ, were in court watching proceedings from the public gallery above the jury. The trial continues."
2021-01-12T17:16:46Z,uk-news,UK news,Death of Cardiff man after night in police custody 'deeply concerning',"The Welsh first minister has described the sudden and unexplained death of a 24-year-old man from Cardiff hours after his release from custody as “deeply concerning”. South Wales police referred the death of Mohamud Mohammed Hassan after he was arrested following a disturbance in the city to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which has launched an investigation. Police said they were called by the Welsh ambulance service to a “multi-occupancy” property in Roath, shortly after 10.30pm on 9 January. Hassan, who was of Somali heritage, was arrested at his Cardiff home on Friday on suspicion of breach of the peace but released without charge on Saturday morning. Officers said he left custody at around 8.30am. Hours later on Saturday evening he had died with his family saying he had claimed he was assaulted in custody before his death. South Wales police said it had so far found no evidence of excessive force or misconduct. It said its self-referral to the complaints watchdog was standard practice following a death after police contact. The IOPC director for Wales, Catrin Evans, said it would look carefully at the level of force used during the arrest and whether proper assessments were made on Hassan before he was released, but added that preliminary indications were that there was no physical trauma injury to explain the cause of death and toxicology tests would be needed. Speaking in the Welsh parliament, Mark Drakeford, offered his condolences to Hassan’s family. “Our thoughts must be with the family of a young man who was a fit and healthy individual whose death must be properly investigated,” he said. The Welsh first minister said the first step was to allow the IOPC to look into the case. “I expect that to be done vigorously and with full and visible independence,” he said. The Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price, told the parliament: “Witnesses were reportedly shocked by Mr Hassan’s condition on his release, saying his tracksuit was covered in blood and he had severe injuries and bruising. “There can be no doubt this is a deeply harrowing case and every effort should be made to seek the truth of what happened. Why was Mohamud Hassan arrested, what happened during his arrest, did he have legal representation, was there any after care; why did this young man die?” Price asked the first minister to do “everything in your power to help the family find those answers”. The Plaid leader reminded the parliament of previous controversial investigations involving South Wales police including the murder of Lynette White, which led to the Cardiff Three miscarriage of justice, and the death of schoolboy Christopher Kapessa, following which his mother, Alina Joseph, accused the police of institutional racism. Price asked Drakeford: “Do you understand why so many people of colour sympathise with that statement? The Plaid leader also pointed out that only 2.6% of South Wales police officers were from black and ethnic minority backgrounds when they made up 6.7% of the population. He also said black people in Wales were more likely to end up in prison than their US counterparts. Drakeford replied: “Black lives matter in every aspect of public services and public life here in Wales. That obligation lies with our police services as much as every part of life.” Hassan’s aunt, Zainab Hassan, said she saw her nephew within an hour of his release. “He had lots of wounds on his body and lots of bruises,” she said. “He didn’t have these wounds when he was arrested and when he came out of Cardiff Bay police station, he had them. “Nothing we do is going to bring him back, but we will not rest for a second until we have justice.” On Tuesday afternoon, about 200 people gathered outside Cardiff Bay police station and flares were let off to protest over Hassan’s death. Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” and demanded the force release CCTV of Hassan’s time in custody, while some held signs that read “Black Lives Matter” and “stop police brutality”. One protester, Bianca Ali, 29, said: “We want justice, we want transparency, we want answers, we want the truth.” Hilary Brown, a solicitor and director of Virgo Consultancy, said a complaint had been made to the IOPC, while the family would be seeking an independent pathologist report and called for an independent police force to investigate the issue. Evans said the IOPC “will look carefully at the level of force used during the interaction”, adding: “We will be urgently examining the extensive relevant CCTV footage and body-worn video. Accounts will be gained from the officers involved, and we will be seeking to speak to a number of witnesses to the police attendance on Friday evening and to Mr Hassan’s movements on Saturday after leaving custody. “I would like to reassure people that we will carry out a thorough and independent investigation … An interim report from a postmortem examination is awaited. Preliminary indications are that there is no physical trauma injury to explain a cause of death, and toxicology tests are required.” In a statement South Wales police said: “As part of the South Wales police investigation CCTV and body-worn video has already been, and will continue to be, examined. “This will assist in establishing and understanding the events that took place. Early findings by the force indicate no misconduct issues and no excessive force.” A postmortem examination was due to take place on Tuesday."
2021-01-12T15:59:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Paul Dennett: the 'sensible socialist' seeking to transform Salford,"Given the extent of the Conservative landslide in last year’s general election, one would be forgiven for believing that socialism in Britain was dead and buried – at least until 2025. But in one northern English city, socialism – and indeed Corbynism – is alive and kicking. Four years after being elected on a manifesto to tackle social injustice and poverty, the Salford city mayor, Paul Dennett, still lives in the same two-bed council flat he moved into long before becoming a politician. He is unrepentant about living in social housing when there is a long waiting list locally, believing it is all part of creating an equal society. “When you look at the history of what social housing or council housing was all about, it was very much about where doctors and shopkeepers and cleaners could all coexist and live and create vibrant and sustainable communities and that’s what we’re trying to create now in the city of Salford,” he said. Dennett is against trickle-down economics and outsourcing: in January, Salford council brought planning, building control, property, highways and infrastructure services back in-house, ending a 15-year joint-venture partnership with Capita and Galliford Try. He rejects gentrification, recently celebrating the council’s purchase of Islington Mill, a popular arts venue, using £3.3m of EU money, by saying: “This is about protecting and cultivating the production of culture – not just the consumption of culture. Ownership is key and, moving forward, the project we are embarking on with the Mill will be crucial in creating models for communities to resist gentrification. It’s about putting power into the hands of local communities.” Salford’s sharp-suited city mayor is a member of Momentum and a good friend of Jeremy Corbyn as well as Rebecca Long-Bailey, a local MP and Corbyn’s former shadow business secretary. He describes himself as a “sensible socialist” and “much more of an interventionist” than others in Greater Manchester, having more in common with Matthew Brown, his counterpart up the M6 in Preston, who decided to spend as much of taxpayers’ money as possible locally in a public procurement policy now known as the Preston model. After taking office in May 2016, one of Dennett’s first moves was to make Salford council an accredited living wage employer. In October, it increased the pay of care workers to £9 an hour and ultimately wants to pay them the real living wage (currently £9.30 per hour). Over the past year, the city has invested £126m into green spaces, has shamed the rest of Greater Manchester with its ambitious cycling and walking plans and has started to build a solar farm and hydro-electric schemes in the River Irwell to power 638 homes. Last year, Dennett launched Dérive, a company set up to build affordable accommodation to rent. It is named after a Marxist psycho-geographical concept developed by Guy Debord, a French philosopher so dedicated to disruption that he insisted his first book was bound with a sandpaper cover so that it would damage other books placed next to it. The rough idea of Dérive was to challenge the alienation between people and their natural environment by creating vibrant active places. In December, Dérive announced the largest council housing scheme for 50 years in Salford – 417 new council and community-owned homes, with the potential for 3,000 more. Dennett’s administration has previously been criticised for letting developers build huge blocks with no provision for affordable housing. Salford has a long socialist history. It was there, sent from his native Germany to work in his family’s mill in the suburb of Weaste in the 1840s, that Friedrich Engels turned against unregulated capitalism, witnessing “women made unfit for childbearing, children deformed, men enfeebled, limbs crushed, whole generations wrecked, afflicted with disease and infirmity, purely to fill the purses of the bourgeoisie”. Almost 200 years on, Salford is the 18th most deprived local authority in England. It is a borough of extremes – footballers including Ryan Giggs live in gated mansions in Worsley, yet in the Broughton area, home to many Orthodox Jews and other ethnic minorities, health is so poor that male life expectancy is decreasing, with the average man dying aged just 71.6. Dennett’s approach is markedly different from his counterpoint over the River Irwell in Manchester. Ever since the IRA bomb in 1996, Manchester’s long-standing leader, Sir Richard Leese, has followed a model of development built around city centre skyscrapers and huge land deals with foreign investors, which his critics say puts economic growth above all else. As mayor of Salford, Dennett decided to do things differently. “I was seeing economic investment within Greater Manchester ,which, on the one hand is is really positive – money coming into Greater Manchester and creating jobs, creating opportunities, and creating interesting places to live, work, play, and visit,” he said. “But I’ve always been uneasy with the kind of trickle-down economic theory that has kind of characterised our economy, not just within Greater Manchester but within the entire United Kingdom.” The Manchester model hasn’t worked for many Salfordians, suggests Dennett. “When you look at Salford, we’ve increased in terms of the government’s index of multiple deprivation. We’re the 18th most deprived local authority in the country now with the economic growth we’ve seen, so there’s clearly an issue with the form of economic growth. That growth now for me has to go hand in hand with economic reform.” Next, he wants to bring more care homes back under local authority control. He insists he doesn’t want the council to do everything but says: “I’d like the council to be doing an awful lot more than what it is at the moment.”"
2021-01-12T14:53:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Asylum seekers on hunger strike over conditions at Kent barracks site,"Hundreds of asylum seekers are reportedly on hunger strike at a former army barracks in Kent being used as temporary housing, amid allegations conditions at the site are worsening. About 400 men are being held at the Napier barracks site near Folkestone, which has been used as temporary accommodation since September and has faced calls for closure after allegations of cover-ups, poor access to healthcare and legal advice, and crowded conditions. On Monday, about 350 men went on hunger strike at the barracks in protest at lack of information on their asylum claims, the impact of crowding on their risk of catching Covid-19, and poor hygiene, volunteers said. Videos and pictures show broken toilets and out-of-order sinks in the bathrooms. Some men are refusing to sleep indoors and are outside in freezing temperatures in sleeping bags, while the Guardian also understands that at least two men have attempted suicide in the last week. Kent Police was called to assist the South East Coast Ambulance Service with a medical incident at around 2pm on 8 January. Dozens of residents staged a protest at the gates of the barracks on Tuesday, shouting “freedom” and hoisting banners with warnings about lack of social distancing and mental health problems, as police officers watched. Clare Moseley, founder of Care4Calais, said: “We’re extremely worried about the asylum seekers held in Napier barracks. The conditions they are being kept in are cramped, stressful and dangerous. Asylum seekers have fled terrifying dangers, wars and persecution. They need support and protection – instead our government is treating them with cruelty. “The Home Office can quickly solve this crisis by processing asylum seekers’ claims. They want to work, settle in this country and contribute to society. Processing their claims would give them the opportunity to rebuild their lives instead of keeping them in this cruel limbo, and remove the need for unsafe short-term asylum housing.” Adam Yasir, a human rights campaigner who runs Rosa Parked’s Journey, a mobile support service for refugees and asylum seekers, said: “The Home Office should shut Napier barracks down, and asylum seekers should be relocated to a suitable accommodation to integrate in society while their asylum claims are assessed. “[The Home Office] should provide adequate mental health support to those who are suffering from mental health illnesses right now in the camp. “They should also provide a timeline of how long asylum seekers will be at Napier barracks, as the majority of them have been there since September 2020.” The Home Office has commissioned Clearsprings Ready Homes to run the site, but the company has subcontracted at least some responsibilities for day-to-day management to a letting agent and property management firm called NACCS. Volunteers are now being refused access to the site due to a high number of coronavirus cases. Kent has been one of the worst-hit areas of the country and is where the new, more transmissible variant of Covid-19 was first detected. Folkestone and Hythe, where the site is located, has a case rate of about 770 cases per 100,000, above the average for England. A volunteer, who asked not to be named for fear of being refused entry, said: “It has been too long being in a prison-like environment … they are starting to lose all hope. They need privacy and space to be able to safely social-distance.” Chris Philp, the immigration compliance minister, said: “The government takes the wellbeing of asylum seekers extremely seriously. We provide asylum seekers with safe, warm, Covid-secure suitable accommodation where they receive three meals a day whilst their claims are being processed. “They are not detained and are free to come and go in line with Covid-19 restrictions. We have a robust complaints process where the people who we support or people representing them can raise concerns if they are not rectified through the 24/7 helpline run by Migrant Help. “Those at Napier have generally come from France by small boat. This journey is not only dangerous but unnecessary – France is a safe country with a well-functioning asylum system. Migrants should not make this journey in the first place.”"
2021-01-12T07:00:32Z,uk-news,UK news,"Marvin Rees, mayor of Bristol: 'Symbolic acts should be linked to change'","Back in June, a group of Black Lives Matter protesters toppled the statue of Edward Colston from its plinth in Bristol and threw it off a quayside where the slave trader’s ships used to dock. More than six months on, the mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, describes it as an “iconic moment”. But not a simple one. “I think we need to be careful with it,” said Rees. “The danger is that iconic moments of great symbolic value occupy the space that should be filled by substantial action. “Symbols are important but I didn’t get a memo on my desk the next day or the next week telling me racial equalities around mental health, school exclusions, criminal justice systems and educational outcomes had changed. It’s very important we make sure all symbolic acts are firmly attached to real change, real policy change,” he said. Rees mentions the Selma to Montgomery march of 1965, a key event in the US civil rights movement. “They didn’t just throw the die and see what came out of it. They wanted the Voting Rights Act to come out of it.” Rees argues that “policy outcomes” need to flow from moments such as the fall of the Colston statue. “Otherwise we just create disturbance without having a strategy and we lose control. That’s a challenge.” Rees, who was elected as mayor in 2016, argued that before the BLM protest, his administration had been working hard to make Bristol fairer for people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, ranging from setting up a commission on race equality to recruiting more magistrates from BAME communities. But Rees says the toppling of the statue brought more people into the discussion. “What has changed is the appetite for public conversations about race. That has become more urgent and more visible. People are being much more proactive asking people like myself and Asher Craig [a deputy mayor] what they can do.” Rees has also set up a history commission to study all the local memorials and places linked to the slave trade to inform a city-wide conversation on their future. It is a sensitive process. “There are many people who feel they are losing control of their city, their world. We have to have that conversation in a way that repairs relationships. That doesn’t mean moving at the pace of the slowest but it means taking people with you. “The commission is there to help us understand Bristol’s history in all its fullness … How we became the city we’ve become – who are the heroes, be they women, union organisers, abolitionists, black people, Asian people, gay people. “With that further understanding we’ll be in a better position to make decisions about who and what we want to celebrate. At the moment what’s clear is that we don’t have a shared understanding of Bristol’s story and the meaning of individuals within Bristol’s story.” In the days after the Colston statue fell, the headstone of an African man who was enslaved in the 18th century was vandalised. “It’s heartbreaking that a piece of Bristol’s history was smashed like that,” said Rees. Another tense moment came when hundreds of people gathered around the cenotaph in the city centre in an “All Lives Matter” demonstration. Rees sought out some of those who were at the cenotaph and discussed their fears. “One of the organisers said they felt like they were losing their city. I said they are, but they’re losing it to house prices and gentrification, not to migration. Houses used to be affordable, now they’re not. We have the worst affordability ratio among core cities. That’s what’s undermining people’s purchase in Bristol.” Rees says that “fragilities” within society were exposed at the time of the BLM protests. “We get on with life and every now and then something comes along that tests our relationships and they find us strong or wanting – and often somewhere in between. What we’ve had through Covid and Back Lives Matter are some real tests.”
On balance, Rees believes the challenges the city faced have made it stronger, manifested in the number of people who have stepped forward to support the most needy. “I am hopeful. There’s an ancient truth – you get strong through challenge. The challenge is never fun at the time but that’s how you find your strength.” Rees argues the recovery after Covid will provide both opportunity and risk. “It’s very important we put the sustainable development goals at the heart of our plans for economic recovery. “One of my biggest fears is that in the midst of an economic depression [central] government will be so desperate they will have a values-free pursuit of economic growth. They will say, OK, environmentalism is great but we’ve got to get the numbers moving. And then they will try to retro-fit sustainability, ecology, inclusion on to the back of the economic machine. I think that would be a huge mistake. “Now is the time to rethink what the economy is so that by its very nature the way our economy works takes carbon out of the economy, drives inclusion, promotes life.” Cities and mayors can lead a new way of thinking, Rees believes. “We need to have cities shaping national and international policy. I think the voices of UK cities have to be equal partners at those top tables.” The Covid crisis has turned mayors such as Andy Burnham (Greater Manchester) and Andy Street (West Midlands) into national figures. Rees appears regularly on the same platforms as Burnham and also with the mayors of Los Angeles, Freetown and Montreal. “We are seeing more city networks and we’re seeing organisations like the UN starting to say that if we really want change we need to work through cities.” Rees says a string of US mayors have been praised for their work in the environment and immigration, despite having to work during Donald Trump’s presidency. “Their attitude is, it doesn’t matter what the president says, we’re still going to go along with the Paris agreement [on climate change]. It doesn’t matter what the president says, we are going to take care of our migrant populations.”
Rees identifies as black and of mixed heritage, having been born in Bristol to a Jamaican father and white mother. As a boy growing up in a working class area of the city in the 70s and 80s, racism was common. He worked in the media and health sectors before entering politics through Operation Black Vote. “I grew up in challenging circumstances but there’s no point sitting in the corner lamenting how bad it is. You’ve got to get on with it.” The days and weeks after the statue toppled were busy for Rees as the world’s media asked him to explain the extraordinary moment. His term as mayor ends in 2021 and he plans to stand again. He accepts there is still much to do. “We’ve got to get affordable houses built in Bristol, get food out to people, tackle period poverty and school exclusions, decarbonise the economy.” The mayor ends with a scrap of philosophy from an unlikely source – the mixed martial fighter and boxer Conor McGregor: “‘I win or learn.” Rees says: “Even at times of trials we don’t want, we’re learning.”"
2021-01-12T06:00:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Heritage park plan aims to bring Merthyr Tydfil's history to life,"Recent history has not been kind to Merthyr Tydfil. The decline of the sprawling ironworks turned a crucible of the Industrial Revolution into a place of high unemployment and social deprivation. The area continues to be battered by Covid-19. But brighter times may be ahead after the unveiling of a hugely ambitious 20-year masterplan to create a 100-hectare (250-acre) heritage park with the aim of bringing to life Merthyr’s extraordinary history, healing a scarred landscape, drawing in half a million visitors a year and creating hundreds of new jobs. Designers who have worked on world-class projects including the Louvre Pyramid have drawn up the multimillion-pound “Cyfarthfa Plan”, which is billed as a chance to revive Merthyr and the wider south Wales area. At its centre is a scheme to update a museum at Cyfarthfa Castle, formerly the home of one of the families that grew rich from the ironworks, but now in need of urgent repair. Another urgent project detailed in the plan is saving the 200-year-old Cyfarthfa furnaces, a scheduled ancient monument considered of world importance but in danger of being lost.
Additional eye-catching proposals include a new “iron way”, a dramatic high-level 495-metre walkway connecting the castle and the furnaces, to echo a 19th-century aqueduct that spanned the valley. There are plans for a “glassway” entrance to the east of the castle, which will be a reminder of impressive 19th-century greenhouses, plus a three-hectare community vegetable garden and meadows. There is also a strong emphasis on education, with a site at the confluence of the Taff and Taf Fechan rivers reserved for a possible new environmental institute. Geraint Thomas, the cabinet member for regeneration at Merthyr Tydfil county borough council, said the report was “visionary”. He said: “For many years Merthyr has been a sleeping giant in the south Wales valleys, and this is a plan like no other I have seen. It will be an immense industrial heritage park of 100 hectares that is going to create up to 200 full-time jobs.” Some wonder why the project is being launched in the midst of a pandemic. The answer is that the repairs to the castle and furnaces are urgent, and the hope is the development will help Merthyr rebuild after Covid.
Commissioned by Merthyr council, the plan says the story of these valleys is one of change. It says: “They were once wild and green environments of forests and farmlands.” Between the 18th and 20th century the area was transformed into “a pandemonium of iron, steel and coal.” Since the decline of industry, the natural world had made a comeback, and the new plan will build on this regreening. The team behind the plan is led by Ian Ritchie Architects, which was involved in the Louvre Pyramid project. The landscape architects involved, Gustafson Porter + Bowman, are also working on the design of a 16-hectare landscape around the Eiffel Tower. A new company has been formed – the Cyfarthfa Foundation – to take the scheme forward, and it is seeking charitable status. The project will not come cheap, with the development of Cyfartha Castle into a modern museum alone costing around £50m. There has already been support from the Welsh government and the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and other sponsors, philanthropists, trusts and foundations are being sought. Ian Ritchie, the principal of Ian Ritchie Architects, said: “We all need space and we all need hope, and we all need things that will inspire us. Within this plan, and within this community, lies an energy that will carry people through to a happier place.”"
2021-01-11T18:31:43Z,uk-news,UK news,Authorities had four warnings about Reading attacker's mental health,"Repeated warnings were given that Khairi Saadallah, who murdered three men in a Reading park last summer, could carry out a “London Bridge-type scenario” shortly before the killings took place, the Guardian has learned. Documents reveal that Nick Harborne, chief executive of the Reading Refugee Support Group (RRSG), who had had dealings with Saadallah since 2016, made four specific warnings to health and probation professionals between 4 December 2019 and 12 June 2020 that Saadallah could commit a violent crime if he did not receive appropriate support. On Monday, Saadallah was sentenced to spend his whole life in jail for the attacks on 20 June 2020. James Furlong, 36, a history teacher, David Wails, 49, a scientist, and an American pharmaceutical worker Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39, died after being stabbed by Saadallah as they sat on the grass in Forbury Gardens that evening. Sentencing him at the Old Bailey to a whole-life order, Mr Justice Sweeney said the attack had been driven by terrorism. Harborne said he had not been concerned that Saadallah would commit an ideologically driven terrorist attack, but that he would commit a violent attack because of his serious mental health problems. Harborne believes that an independent inquiry into the circumstances leading to the murders may be needed to ensure that lessons are learned and that other tragedies of this nature are avoided in future. “We believe that the crimes in Forbury Gardens could have been prevented,” he said. “We all need to collectively examine this to ensure that lessons are learned. RRSG tried to raise his case with a number of agencies including Prevent, the NHS clinical commissioning group, and the prison and probation services.” RRSG wrote to Prevent, the probation service, the Berkshire West Clinical Commissioning Group, Berkshire Healthcare Trust and Reading mental health social care team communicating concerns that there could be a “London Bridge-type scenario” if Saadallah didn’t get immediate and appropriate support. The last time he made contact with statutory agencies about Saadallah’s case was when he emailed the probation service the day after he was released from prison, two weeks before the Reading murders. The email sent on 12 June 2020, seen by the Guardian, states: “I am seriously concerned we could have an incident not dissimilar to the London bridge attack in November last year if he becomes unwell.” He had previously written to prison officials on 4 February 2020: “My overall concern is that something similar to the recent events on London Bridge may occur on his release.” Saadallah’s probation officer visited him on 18 June 2020, and made an urgent referral to mental health services as a result of concerns about his mental state. Speaking after the sentencing, Furlong’s father, Gary Furlong, questioned why Saadallah had been free to carry out the killings after obtaining “a litany of criminal convictions, including assaults on the public, police and emergency services, along with carrying a bladed weapon”. “Whilst in prison it was decided by the secretary of state on 4 June, 4 2020, just two weeks prior to the attack, that his deportation was in the public interest, but for legal reasons it could not happen. “Despite his criminal history and threats made before the attack, he was then released back into society immediately and was freely able to commit this horrendous act on the public.” Saadallah arrived from Libya to the UK 16 days after his 18th birthday. He told agencies that he had been forcibly conscripted to a militia as a child soldier in his home country and refused the militia chiefs’ demands to torture people. He said he fled Libya after members of his family were killed as punishment for him refusing to carry out those demands. Documents regarding Saadallah’s case seen by the Guardian said he was traumatised by events in Libya and had been diagnosed with complex PTSD, emotionally unstable personality disorder and dissociative personality disorder. Harborne said he first met Saadallah when he came to the charity’s office to seek information about voluntarily returning to Libya in 2016. He violently kicked his way out of the office after becoming agitated, assaulted members of the public on the street and was arrested after RRSG called the police. He said: “I witnessed first-hand his capacity for violence and saw how quickly his mental health could deteriorate when under the influence of alcohol. He assaulted members of the public for no reason. We were always concerned there was the potential of him committing some kind of atrocity in the future because of his mental health.”,” said Harborne. Harborne questioned the terrorist narrative. “I have reservations about any assumptions or assertions that he was motivated by any notions of terrorism. His problems, in our opinion, stem from mental instability,” he said. “Had we all listened and responded to the concerns that were repeatedly communicated by several different agencies, this tragedy may well have been avoided,” Harborne said. The Ministry of Justice, the Home Office and Berkshire Healthcare Trust, the NHS trust dealing with Saadallah’s care, have all been approached for comment."
2021-01-11T15:33:28Z,uk-news,UK news,Reading attacker Khairi Saadallah given whole-life prison sentence,"A man who murdered three men in 10 seconds on a summer evening in a Reading park, has been sentenced to die in prison after a judge determined it was a jihadist attack. Khairi Saadallah, 26, showed no emotion as the rare whole-life tariff was handed down by Mr Justice Sweeney for the “swift, ruthless and brutal” stabbings last June. Saadallah killed his victims with a single stab wound which investigators believed showed training and which police said resembled an “execution”. He had been part of a militia in Libya deemed to be Islamist extremists, and shouted “Allahu Akbar” during the stabbings. But during previous prison sentences for assault and other crimes, officials had classed him as vulnerable because of his extensive mental health problems, made worse by substance abuse. The attack happened on 20 June as the first coronavirus lockdown neared its end, with Saadallah approaching the park with a union jack bandana around his knee. The victims were James Furlong, 36, a history teacher; David Wails, 49, a scientist; and Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39, an American pharmaceutical worker. Ritchie-Bennett and Furlong suffered single wounds to their necks. Wails was stabbed once in the back, with the crown arguing the precision of the wounds showing the attacker knew how to inflict maximum damage with the knife he had bought from a supermarket the day before. Saadallah also stabbed Stephen Young, Patrick Edwards and Nishit Nisudan, who were sitting nearby and were lucky to survive. All six attacks took under 60 seconds, with Saadallah then fleeing. One Muslim member of the public who chased after Saadallah told him after he had been caught: “You have nothing to do with Islam, bastard.” Saadallah came to the UK in 2012 and tried and failed to get asylum seeker status, but the turmoil in Libya prevented his deportation. Sentencing Saadallah at the Old Bailey on Monday, Mr Justice Sweeney said: “Using his combat experience in each of their cases the defendant targeted a vulnerable area where a single thrust of the knife would, as he intended, inevitably cause death.” Saadallah had carried out reconnaissance on Forbury Gardens where the killings occurred. Sweeney added: “During the course of the attack and afterwards, and because he was seeking to advance a political, religious or ideological cause, the defendant was shouting in Arabic, ‘God is the greatest’ and ‘God accept my jihad’.” DCS Kath Barnes, the head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East, said: “The men he killed were not just murdered, they were executed at such a speed, they had very little chance to react or defend themselves. “The horrors of this incident took just a single minute to unfold. It took him less than 10 seconds to kill three innocent men, and he then went on to attack and tried to kill another three men before running off towards the town centre.” The court heard he was in prison at the same time as the extremist preacher Omar Brooks. Sources said Saadallah spent five days in the same part of the prison in 2017 with the ability to associate with Brooks, but was moved away as he was assessed as vulnerable due to poor mental health and potentially susceptible to radicalisation. The prosecution said Saadallah had a longstanding interest in extremism and in 2019, had accessed material on his mobile phone about Mohammed Emwazi, the Islamic State propagandist seen in videos taunting victims before killing them, and two days before the attack had accessed a website with the flag associated with Isis, which had staged numerous attacks against western targets. Material recovered from his mobile phone showed Saadallah holding firearms and in military fatigues. One photo shows a small handgun next to bullets arranged into a letter “K” for “Khairi”. He is believed to have been part of the Ansar Al-Sharia militia, now proscribed in the UK as being an Islamist extremist group, but once part of the western-backed effort to topple Muammar Gaddafi. The attacker had a crucifix tattoo on his leg, had prayed in a church, and had told police in an interview he was “part Muslim and part Catholic”. He had severe mental health problems and before the stabbings last June was twice assessed by security services but deemed to pose no danger of an attack. In 2018, he is understood to have been assessed by Prevent and found to have no clear ideology. He was deemed to need additional mental health support. In 2019 MI5 had Saadallah under investigation as a person who might travel to Libya “for extremist reasons”. That claim was found to lack credibility and he was assessed as being far from the legal threshold for investigation. He had previous convictions for theft and assault and was released on 5 June 2020 from prison, 15 days before the killings. Saadallah is one of 63 people in England and Wales serving whole-life tariffs, meaning they can never be released. Sweeney himself previously sentenced Michael Adebolajo, 29, who murdered Lee Rigby in 2013 to a whole-life tariff. An inquest into the Reading deaths is expected to examine issues of whether the attack could have been prevented."
2021-01-11T13:48:55Z,uk-news,UK news,The new UK Covid variant: your questions answered,"How do scientists know the new UK variant is 70% more transmissible, and how certain are they of this figure? Our gift to the world: the UK variant of Sars-CoV-2. There are sufficient data to quote 70% greater infectivity, but how was this figure ascertained?” D Moon, Brighton This has been investigated using a number of different methods, all of which lead to the same basic conclusion, that the new B117 variant is easier to pass from person to person – even if the precise increase in transmissibility is only an estimate, for now. One method involved comparing the growth in cases of the new variant and old variant within the same population, which enabled researchers to control other factors that can affect rates of transmission, such as social distancing. They also followed the pattern of signals in Covid tests across the UK, looking at the increase in cases of “S gene dropout” caused by specific mutations in the viral spike protein – a proxy for the new variant. “Both of these methods show that the new variant replaced the older variants in the UK population, strongly suggesting that the new variant is a fitter virus and most likely achieved this though increased transmissibility,” said Paul Kellam, a professor of virus genomics at Imperial College London. The researchers also tested various mathematical models to see which one best fitted the observed increase in the new variant, and discovered that it would be consistent with an increase in the reproduction number of 0.4 to 0.7. “What we would still like to see is proof in animal models of transmission that the new variant is better at establishing new infections than the old variant. But for now the evidence is sufficiently compelling that we must act on it, which is why we have entered another lockdown,” Kellam said. What does a 70% increase in transmissibility actually mean? Does it mean that if you breathe in a small viral load you are 70% more likely to catch it, or perhaps that you need to socially distance 70% further?” Brian, retired IT consultant, Reading The 70% figure derives from this estimated increase in the R value of 0.4 to 0.7. Say the old variant was spreading at an R of 1.5, meaning 10 Covid-positive people transmitted infection to 15 new people: “The new variant would have a R of 1.9 to 2.3, so 10 people with Covid-19 would transmit infection to 19 to 23 new people,” said Kellam. “It is reasonable to say that strict adherence to the rules that are designed to break chains of transmission (hands, face and space) are still effective, but that the tolerance for bending or ignoring the rules may be much less, as we cannot discount that multiple factors have contributed to the increase in transmission, including poor adherence to tier rules.” Can I be reinfected with the new variant if I’ve already had Covid? Can people who have had Covid catch this new variant as well? James Crawford, Covid swabber, Bristol This is an area of active research. Although there have been reports of people being reinfected with older coronavirus variants, such reinfections appear to be rare. “What we know about the new UK variant at the moment strongly suggests that it remains sensitive to the immune response of the older variants and will be similarly sensitive to the immune response generated by the two vaccines currently being rolled out in the UK,” said Kellam. Are surfaces likely to play a greater role in transmission of the new variant? Do I need to up my game regarding cleaning?” Natasha, Cumbria This is also unclear. However, if the new variant finds it easier to bind to and infect cells, which is one theory being investigated, this could mean a smaller number of viral particles is needed to establish an infection. Complying with the guidance on hands, face and space is therefore more important than ever: 70% more handwashing will not compensate for not wearing a mask. How did the mutation happen, and why did it happen in the UK? If the mutation occurs when the virus is transmitted from one person to another, surely the persistently high number of infections in this country will give the virus more opportunity to further mutate, the possible result being this devastating world pandemic is prolonged whilst new vaccines are developed.” Steven Cooper, retired engineer, Herefordshire Viruses are constantly acquiring small changes in their genetic code. Usually, these “mutations” have no effect, but occasionally they will alter how the virus behaves – which is what may have happened with the B117 and South African variants. These are far from being the only coronavirus variants in circulation, but they’re generating concern because the mutations they carry may make them more infectious. As for how – and where – the B117 variant arose, it could simply be that Britain was the first country to detect it, as we routinely sequence more viral genomes than many other countries. Also being explored is whether mutations are more likely to arise in patients with long-running coronavirus infections who are treated with blood from recovered Covid-19 patients (convalescent plasma). One study, which followed a single immunocompromised patient, detected important changes in the virus each time the patient received plasma treatment, raising the possibility that the antibodies it contained placed additional pressure on the virus to mutate. However, this is less likely to happen in people with healthier immune systems. Will the Covid-19 vaccines still work, and, if not, how would scientists go about updating them? Yesterday, I got the first shot of the Moderna vaccine, am I covered from the new variant?” Conor, laboratory worker, New York Most scientists are confident that current Covid-19 vaccines will protect against the new B117 variant, but there’s a risk that they may become less effective if the virus continues to mutate. This is another reason why it’s important to reduce the number of people who become infected – because mutations are more likely to occur when the virus infects new hosts. If the vaccines did become less effective, they would be relatively easy to tweak – especially those based on RNA and vector vaccines, including the Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines. Doing so would involve making small changes to the sequence of the genetic material these vaccines contain, and could be incorporated in the new design within a matter of days, said Brendan Wren, a professor of vaccinology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who added: “I’m sure that the Oxford group have already modified their vaccine design to include variants as they arise.” Can young (primary age) children be infected with the new variant/s and pass it on to their friends and parents? How much do schools contribute to the spread of Covid, and how has that changed since the emergence of the new variant?” Olivia Bacon, clinical scientist, Hampshire People of all ages can be infected with both the new and old coronavirus variants and transmit them to other people, but primary-aged children appear less likely to do so – at least where the older variants are concerned. Whether this also holds true for the new B117 variant is still uncertain. “It is most likely that the B117 lineage influences transmissibility in all age groups, and there is not yet clear evidence that the degree to which transmission has increased in children is any different than the degree to which it has increased in adults,” said Erik Volz at Imperial College London, who is studying the new variant. Even if the variant is less transmissible between children than adults, the fact that transmission does occur is still a major concern when there are such high case numbers and hospitals are under such stress – which is why schools are closed.

2021-01-11T13:11:17Z,uk-news,UK news,Passengers at Heathrow down by 73% in 2020 due to Covid,"The number of passengers at Britain’s biggest airport slumped by 73% in 2020 to the smallest annual total since 1975 due to the travel restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Just 22.1 million travellers passed through Heathrow last year, 59 million fewer than in 2019. December figures were higher than November, rising to 1.1 million as Britain came briefly out of lockdown, but finished 83% below the previous December as the new variant of Covid-19 led to more border closures and halted many flights. Cargo volumes for the year were down 28.2%, with dedicated cargo flights helping to counteract lost capacity in the belly hold of passenger planes. Although Heathrow cut its costs by slashing pay, mothballing two terminals and operating on one runway for most of the year, it said the industry was “fighting for survival” and called for more government action to restart travel and assist the struggling sector. The chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said: “The past year has been incredibly challenging for aviation. While we support tightening border controls temporarily by introducing pre-departure testing for international arrivals, as well as quarantine, this is not sustainable.” He called on the government to “show leadership” and work to create a common international standard for pre-departure testing, adding: “The aviation industry is the cornerstone of the UK economy but is fighting for survival. We need a roadmap out of this lockdown, and a full waiver of business rates.” Heathrow’s call came after easyJet announced it had secured another £1.4bn five-year loan to help shore up its finances during the pandemic. The loan is underwritten by a syndicate of banks and partially backed by the British state, through its UK Export Finance arm. The airline said the loan would enable it to repay and cancel about £800m of shorter-term debt. The airline’s chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said: “This facility will significantly extend and improve easyJet’s debt maturity profile and increase the level of liquidity available. EasyJet has taken swift and decisive action, having now secured more than £4.5bn in liquidity since the beginning of the pandemic.” EasyJet follows other companies in aviation and aerospace, including British Airways and Rolls-Royce, in using UK Export Finance guarantees to help shore up their balance sheets during the pandemic. Hopes for a return to flying in early 2021 that were raised by the approval of Covid vaccines have been largely dampened by the virus variant discovered in the UK and the subsequent renewed travel restrictions. EasyJet now plans to cut its schedule to domestic connections and a few international flights. The UK government announced last week it would also demand all incoming travellers produce a recent negative Covid-19 test, a move that aviation bodies said they accepted as necessary but increased the need for financial assistance to survive."
2021-01-11T12:44:25Z,uk-news,UK news,Tributes for restaurant owner who died after being hit with own car in Stockport,"Tributes have been paid to a restaurant owner who died after he was hit by his own car during an alleged robbery while he was making deliveries in Stockport. Haji Mohammed Heydayatul Islam, known as Nowab Miah, from Hyde, Tameside, was delivering a meal last Friday in the Romiley area when, according to witnesses, he was run over as he tried to stop his car from being taken. The 53-year-old was taken to hospital in a critical condition and died on Sunday afternoon, police said. His son, Shaf Nowab, posted on Facebook: “I am saddened to announce that my father, my mentor, my role model … has sadly left this world surrounded by close family. “Many of you will be aware of the recent incident that occurred in Romiley. My father is the person that it occurred with, he was just doing his last delivery for our restaurant before he went home. I would like to thank everyone in the community for their prayers and regards, and me and my family genuinely appreciate everything you have said.” Local people have launched a GoFundMe page to raise money for the family and for charity. More than 480 people have made donations totalling £6,500, exceeding a target of £1,000. A 14-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of robbery after police were called to a report of a road traffic collision just after 9pm on Friday. Detectives are continuing to look for a silver Mercedes that they believe was stolen. Ch Insp Liam Boden, of Greater Manchester police, said: “This is an extremely tragic case which has rocked the community and left a family utterly devastated. We believe there may have been others involved in the incident and a number of lines of inquiry are continuing to be carried out in order for us to find those responsible. “We’re still asking the public to come forward with any information that may assist us. Even the smallest bit of information can prove vital. Anyone who may have seen a silver Mercedes in the area at the time or may have seen it in suspicious circumstances since is asked to get in touch.”"
2021-01-11T12:04:34Z,uk-news,UK news,Unison union elects Christina McAnea as its first female leader,"Unison, the UK’s biggest trade union and a major Labour party donor, has elected its first female leader. Christina McAnea, who was an assistant general secretary at the union, won 47% of the vote, seeing off three challengers from the left of the Labour movement. The Glasgow-born negotiator has shown little interest in internal Labour machinations but is expected to be broadly supportive of Sir Keir Starmer, the party leader. She succeeds Dave Prentis as general secretary of the union, which has a majority of women among its 1.3 million members.
Her victory comes amid tensions between Starmer and union leaders, many of whom have spoken against the suspension of Jeremy Corbyn from the parliamentary party. Elections will soon follow at the top of the second- and third-biggest unions in the UK, both of which are also major donors to Labour. Len McCluskey is expected to announce he will stand down at Unite, clearing the way for a contest for control of the union. The GMB union is without a general secretary after Tim Roache stood down amid allegations of misogyny, cronyism and sexual harassment at the organisation. McAnea’s victory will come as a relief for those close to Starmer after she saw off candidates from the Labour left who had said they wanted to change the union’s financial arrangement with Labour. Sources said she is expected to follow a similar political line to Prentis, who endorsed Starmer in the Labour leadership election and voted in his favour on the national executive committee. McAnea, the daughter of a dinner lady from Glasgow, left school at 16 and briefly joined the Communist party after hearing a speech by the trade union leader Jimmy Reid. At Unison, she rose to become assistant general secretary responsible for collective bargaining and negotiation. Commenting on her victory, she praised the union’s members, who have been at the forefront of the fight against coronavirus, and called for a pay rise. “Health, care, council, police, energy, school, college and university staff have worked throughout the pandemic, and it’s their skill and dedication that will see us out the other side,” she said. “Their union will continue to speak up for them and do all it can to protect them in the difficult months ahead. Despite the risks, the immense pressures and their sheer exhaustion, the dedication and commitment of our key workers knows no end. I will not let this government, nor any future one, forget that. “Supporting public service workers through the pandemic, securing an early pay rise for NHS staff and ensuring the government backs down on its plans for an ill-judged pay freeze will be my immediate priorities. Pushing for the funding and the political will to create a quality, affordable national care service, where staff are respected and paid fairly, comes close behind.” The union is promising action against the government’s pay freeze for 1.3 million public sector workers, which Prentis described as an attack on members’ livelihoods. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has said he cannot “justify a significant, across-the-board” salary increase while the economy and public finances are under severe strain from the pandemic."
2021-01-11T11:45:20Z,uk-news,UK news,High status of Northern Ireland human rights body 'being put at risk',"A network of more than 90 NGOs and trade unions has complained that ministerial appointments to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) are undermining the public body. The group raised particular concerns about the selection of candidates with a policing background at a time when the commission is required to advise on addressing the legacy of the Troubles. The NIHRC, established on the basis of the Good Friday agreement, is a UN “A” status national human rights commission but the Equality Coalition says it could lose that status as a result of the appointments. In a formal complaint to the Northern Ireland Office (NIO), seen by the Guardian, the coalition points out that of six recent appointments, five have a predominately public sector background, including three who formerly served with either the Royal Ulster Constabulary or Police Service of Northern Ireland. Daniel Holder, the deputy director of the Committee on the Administration of Justice, a Belfast-based NGO, and a co-convener of the Equality Coalition, said it was not questioning the integrity of the individual appointees. “Rather, this concerns the composition of the appointments as a whole not meeting the diversity requirements of the UN Paris principles (which specify the criteria to be an accredited national human rights institution),” he said. “The appointments are very state-centric, with half being from a NI policing background, at precisely a time the NIHRC is to advise on planned legacy legislation that among other matters will or will not deal with investigating the past actions of the police.” The Paris principles state that the appointment of members should be by way of a procedure “which affords all necessary guarantees to ensure the pluralist representation of the social forces (of civilian society) involved in the protection and promotion of human rights”. They say representatives should be from NGOs responsible for human rights and tackling racial discrimination, trades unions and “concerned social and professional organisations” such as associations of lawyers, doctors, journalists and eminent scientists. The NIO has confirmed there were 129 applicants (52% male and 48% female) “from across civil society” for the six new commissioner roles. Of 36 shortlisted for interview, 56% were male and 44% female, and of 15 (unranked) candidates recommended to the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, for appointment, 60% were male and 40% were female. Two out of six commissioners appointed were female. In its complaint to the NIO, the coalition says, in reference to the alleged breach of diversity requirements: “It appears most likely this has happened at the stage of the [Northern Ireland secretary] making appointments from the list of recommended candidates.” Patricia McKeown, the NI regional secretary for Unison and a co-convener of the Equality Coalition, said: “A fully functioning NIHRC is a cornerstone safeguard of the peace settlement. We have long had concerns the UK government has failed to implement provisions of the Good Friday agreement including those affirming the rights of women to full and equal participation in peace-building. “It is alarming that the secretary of state could have now jeopardised the status of the NIHRC as a UN-accredited human rights institution with appointments that manifestly do not meet the pluralism requirements of UN rules.” A UK government spokesperson said: “Appointments to the NIHRC are regulated by the office of the commissioner for public appointments and made in accordance with the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The government is committed to supporting the work of the NIHRC and looks forward to continuing to engage with all of the commissioners.”"

2021-01-11T06:00:11Z,uk-news,UK news,"Police in England and Wales face crime targets in return for 20,000 new officers","Crime will have to be cut by up to 20% under radical plans drawn up by the government and discussed with police chiefs, the Guardian has learned. However, senior officers believe it would be a return to Whitehall setting “targets”, which were derided by the Conservatives when the last Labour government used them. Ministers want to bring down rates of homicide, serious violent crime and a whole host of other offences across England and Wales. The reductions would be in return for government providing the money for 20,000 new officers, about the same number cut since 2010 after the Conservatives slashed police budgets. Some senior officers fear it could damage crime fighting and lead to police prioritising some of the wrong issues as they try to meet the headline-grabbing target before the next election. Other police chiefs believe if the government thinks the plans through properly, they may intensify the focus on reducing crime. News of the plans come amid fears that crime may rise as the economy nosedives in 2021 because of the damage the Covid crisis has caused. The government and police have talked about the plans for months, according to multiple sources with knowledge of discussions. Homicide and serious violence, and neighbourhood crimes such as burglary and vehicle theft are among those that the government wants to see cut by up to 20%. Also reductions are wanted in just over three years in cybercrime, discharge of firearms, knife crime, drug crimes including county lines. Targets actively being discussed also include boosting victim satisfaction, cutting domestic violence and also cover an increase in those referred for substance misuse treatment. Some chiefs are critical of the vehicle crime target, which they do not believe is a priority, given everything else the police have to deal with. One said: “You’re never going to deploy an officer for something stolen from the back seat.” Some targets allegedly miss the point, with one senior chief saying: “There are some obvious big problems in here. You are measuring homicides, but surely you also want to know what police are doing to refer young people away from county lines.” Some police leaders believe there is too little stress on prevention of crime, just as policing is trying to do more of it. Policing has been left to itself to interpret its role over the past decade amid a growing realisation that society can not arrest its way out of a whole series of serious crimes. A senior source said of the plans: “There is a real danger of perverse incentives. There are no incentives to avoid criminalising young people or encourage diversion.” The source added actions the government has taken since the Conservatives took power in 2010 can make the work of the police harder: “Quite a lot of what drives crime rates is nothing to do with the police. Cutting mental health services and youth services has quite a big effect. Youth and diversion services have been eviscerated since austerity.” Police also fear the other parts of the criminal justice system, the courts and prosecution service, are under such strain and chaos, that police alone may not be able to deliver reductions in crime. Another source added: “Policing is not the sole determinant of crime rates and we are about to enter a big economic challenge and that can lead to rises in crime and violent crime.” In February 2020 the home secretary said the 20,000 extra officers must mean people see a cut in crime, with every offence investigated rigorously – a feat police chiefs think is beyond the resources they have. Priti Patel told a conference of police leaders: “This extra injection of taxpayers’ cash must deliver the crime cuts the public desperately want. In three years’ time when the 20,000 additional officers are through the door, people must see a difference. Less crime, safer streets, no excuses. The public won’t accept them and neither should we.” Patel said a national policing board and a new crime and policing performance board would set outcomes on cutting serious crime and other offences. The Conservatives since 2010 had preached localism and said it was for elected police and crime commissioners, which cover 43 local areas, to set priorities with their police chiefs. Another senior source with knowledge of private discussions said “this is a rebalancing”, representing the Home Office and central government expecting a greater say in what police do strategically, in a way “we have not seen for ages”. It is a sign of a move away from localism and leaving strategy to elected police and crime commissioners (PCCs), whose role is under review by government. The source added: “It’s not treading on [police] chiefs’ toes but treading on PCC’s toes. That won’t deter Kit [Malthouse, the policing minister,] and the home secretary.” Police chiefs believe the government will deliver on its promise to provide 20,000 new officers by 2022/23, though that will mean a lot of new and inexperienced officers are out on duty. The ambitious 20% desired cut in violent crime puts pressure on those forces policing the biggest urban areas, such as the Metropolitan police covering London, West Midlands police covering Birmingham, and Greater Manchester police."
2021-01-10T17:58:48Z,uk-news,UK news,RAF 'Spitfire woman' Eleanor Wadsworth dies aged 103,"A trailblazing pilot who was one of the last surviving women to have taken on the task of transporting aircraft to the frontlines of the second world war has died at the age of 103. Nottingham-born Eleanor Wadsworth, who served as one of the RAF’s “Spitfire women” during the conflict, died in December in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk after a short illness. She was one of about 165 women who flew without instruments, flying instructions or radios. Operating out of White Waltham in Berkshire, the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) programme trained female pilots to fly numerous types of aircraft and played a crucial part in ensuring the RAF was able to fight. Like many of the pilots, Wadsworth joined the ATA in 1943 after seeing an advertisement for female pilots. “The thought of learning to fly for free was a great incentive. I put my name down and didn’t think much about it,” she said in 2020. Like many of the pilots, her favourite machine was the Spitfire, which she flew more than 130 times and described as a beautiful aircraft that was great to handle. The author Karen Borden, who interviewed Wadsworth for an upcoming book, told the BBC that “like many of the women pilots, she was incredibly humble about her contribution to the war effort”. “She joked about how flying ‘straight and level’ was her mark ... and how marvellous it was to take to the air on her own,” Borden said. The exploits of the female pilots have been given more attention recently after Giles Whittell’s 2008 book, Spitfire Women of World War II, put them in the spotlight. Diana Barnato Walker, who died in 2008 aged 90, delivered 260 unarmed Spitfires from factories to RAF airfields between 1942 and 1945. Joy Lofthouse joined the ATA with her sister in 1943 and flew aircraft – including Barracuda bombers, Mustang fighters and Spitfires – from factories to the front line. Mary Ellis, who died in 2018, flew 76 types of aircraft and managed 1,100 flying hours. Molly Rose flew 486 aircraft and survived a crash after experiencing total engine failure while flying a Swordfish in Shropshire. About 165 female and 1,153 male pilots flew planes from factories to the frontlines during the war. It was incredibly dangerous work, with the pilot’s only map strapped with elastic to their calf. Fifteen women died in action. When the ATA was wound up in November 1945, more than 309,000 aircraft had been transported to the frontlines, with pilots clocking up more than 400,000 hours of flying time."
2021-01-10T12:12:10Z,uk-news,UK news,Victorian bathhouse uncovered beneath Manchester car park,"A large Victorian washhouse that served Manchester textile workers more than 150 years ago has been uncovered during work to create the city’s first public park in a century. The ornate tiles of the Mayfield baths, whose pools measured nearly 20 metres, were found in “stunning” condition beneath a car park 164 years after it opened. The building, a grand Italianate design set in the heart of Manchester’s booming “Cottonopolis” district, was demolished after being bombed in the second world war but the remains of its swimming pools have been discovered by archaeologists from the University of Salford.
The bathhouse, which opened in 1857, was a vital public amenity that served generations of Mancunians, most of whom worked in the surrounding print and textiles factories. The area behind Manchester Piccadilly station has mainly been derelict for years but is undergoing redevelopment as part of plans to build 1,500 homes, retail, leisure and office space, as well as a 6.5-acre park – the first in the city for 100 years. Graham Mottershead, the project manager at Salford Archaeology, said: “The Mayfield bathhouse is a fascinating example of the social and public health advancements that came about during the Industrial Revolution. “As the city’s population boomed with factory workers, crowded and substandard living conditions gave rise to the spread of cholera and typhoid. For those living and working around Mayfield, the Mayfield baths would have been a vital source of cleanliness and hygiene.
“The sheer pace of change and innovation during the Industrial Revolution means many advancements were not recorded. Excavations like this help us to learn a great deal about what is arguably the most important period of human history and, in the case of Mayfield, a location that is so very relevant to the heritage of the people of Manchester.” The Mayfield Partnership, the public-private company behind the redevelopment, said it would preserve the ornate tiles from the bathhouse and use them in future. It plans to name one of the new commercial buildings after George Poulton, who became famous in the 1850s as a promoter of public health at the Mayfield baths. The remains, which were uncovered by painstaking hand-digging as well as machine excavation, will be used to form a detailed record of the bathhouse by combining the findings with historical documents and digital drawings."
2021-01-10T12:01:58Z,uk-news,UK news,Kevin Lane publishes book in hope of overturning murder conviction,"A man serving a life sentence for a controversial hitman murder committed nearly 30 years ago has taken the unusual step of publishing a book from inside prison with fresh evidence he hopes will lead to his conviction being overturned. With his book titled Fitted Up and Fighting Back, Kevin Lane believes he can finally prove his innocence of the contract shooting of Robert Magill in Hertfordshire in 1994. Lane, now 53, was convicted after two trials on a majority verdict of murdering Magill, who had been out walking his dog in Rickmansworth. Witnesses saw two masked men fleeing the scene in a red BMW after shooting Magill, who was known to have a number of enemies because of his involvement in protection rackets. The BMW car allegedly used as the getaway vehicle was traced, and one of Lane’s palm prints was found on a bin-liner in the boot. Within hours of the shooting the names of two men, Roger Vincent and David Smith, were being spoken of as those responsible. The following year Vincent and Lane were charged with the murder but Vincent was acquitted at the subsequent trial. In his book, Lane reveals documents held back under public interest immunity regulations that give details of Vincent’s conversations with one of the key investigating officers, who would himself end up behind bars. Vincent was acquitted of the Magill killing, but he and Smith were back in court for murder in 2005 and were jailed for life. They were convicted of killing David King, who was suspected of being a police informer. Lane highlights the similarity of the two killings. “In the Magill murder a witness describes one of the men brazenly smiling as he drove away from the scene. In the King murder, a witness refers to one of the killers ‘waving a salute’ in her direction as he changed vehicle,” he writes. Both Vincent and Smith deny any involvement in the Magill murder. Lane goes into great detail about the detective in the case, DS Chris Spackman. Lane claims that in a previous confrontation, when Lane was 21, he had met Spackman when he was briefly arrested in connection with a car-ringing operation. While in a police cell, Lane alleges Spackman came in and told him: “You think you’re the daddy of this lot, don’t you?” Spackman was jailed at the Old Bailey in 2003 for plotting to steal £160,000 from Hertfordshire police, money that had been seized from criminals. Spackman, who admitted conspiracy to steal, theft and misconduct in office, was the officer handling disclosure information in Lane’s case. The judge sentencing Spackman remarked that “this was no fiddling of expenses, but was more suited to a seasoned fraudster who could conduct complicated deceptions in a police environment”. Spackman’s involvement in another case, involving cloned credit cards, led to the successful appeal of the two men convicted. Robert Evans, counsel for the two men in that case told the court: “In my opinion, Mr Spackman’s accounts in interview show a history of dishonesty and a history of tampering or falsifying police records in cases he was involved in.” Lane notes that at his own trialone of the detectives told the court that “he is an extremely dangerous man who has undoubtedly committed other murders” although he had never been charged with any others. Lane has always proclaimed his innocence despite the fact that this inevitably slows down the possibility of release as a prisoner is deemed not to have come to terms with his offence. His case was initially covered in the Guardian in 2001 and was later the subject of a short film as part of the Guardian’s Justice on Trial series. He was released in 2015 but returned to jail last year after his arrest on a common assault charge unconnected to the case. A parole hearing is due in March. In his book, Lane acknowledges previous offences which landed him behind bars as a young man but is adamant that he is innocent of the Magill murder. He is scathing about the possibility that any professional hitman would use the battered old BMW car he was alleged to have used. “Wouldn’t it be simply unbelievable that I’d choose a car I had been driving my family about in just a few days before?” His young son’s fingerprints were also found in the car. In the book, Lane quotes everyone from Voltaire to Hunter S Thompson to Juvenal and is also revealing on the state of prisons today. “The Covid-19 crisis has reported concerns for the public’s mental health due to being housebound,” he notes. “Really! I think to myself what do they think being locked up in a concrete coffin for years and years does to a person?”"
2021-01-10T09:53:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Harry and Meghan reported to have quit social media,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have reportedly abandoned social media as they focus on their new roles in the US. Harry and Meghan, who amassed more than 10 million followers on their official royal Instagram account, are said to have become disillusioned by the “hate” they encountered online. The Sunday Times reported that the couple, who stepped down as senior royals last year, had no plans to use social media for their non-profit organisation, Archewell, and were very unlikely to return to the sites in a personal capacity. It comes after days of criticism of social media companies for giving a platform to Donald Trump, the US president who was suspended from Twitter, Facebook and Instagram indefinitely last week after inciting a mob who raided the US Capitol in Washington DC on Wednesday. Harry and Meghan’s primary social media account was @sussexroyal on Instagram, which has 10.4 million followers but has not posted any new content since March 2020. The couple agreed not to use the word “royal” in their branding from spring last year as they began new, more financially independent roles in the US. Meghan has previously spoken about the “almost unsurvivable” toll of online abuse and said she was the most trolled person in the world in 2019. Appearing on the Teenager Therapy podcast in October last year, she said: “I’m told that in 2019 I was the most trolled person in the entire world, male or female. Now, eight months of that I wasn’t even visible, I was on maternity leave or with a baby. “But what was able to just be manufactured and churned out, it’s almost unsurvivable, that’s so big, you can’t think of what that feels like, because I don’t care if you’re 15 or 25, if people are saying things about you that aren’t true, what that does to your mental and emotional health is so damaging.” Archewell, which they founded last year, does not have an official social media presence. Its aim, according to its website, is to “unleash the power of compassion to drive systemic cultural change” by non-profit work and “creative activations through the business verticals of audio and production”. The couple have signed multi-year, multimillion-pound deals with Spotify and Netflix, with plans to produce a podcast series and documentaries. The apparent breakaway from social media comes a year after an official statement on the Sussex Royal website said the pair would continue to use those sites in their new roles. It said: “Yes, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue to have a social media platform. They look forward to continuing their use of social media and believe that their updated media approach will enable them to share more, with you, directly.”"
2021-01-10T07:45:44Z,uk-news,UK news,Starmer supporter plans bid for leadership of Unite union,"A supporter of Keir Starmer’s leadership is to launch a new attempt to lead Labour’s most generous union backer, the Observer can reveal. Gerard Coyne, who was narrowly defeated by current leader Len McCluskey in a bitter battle for the Unite leadership in 2017, has announced that he will aim to become its new general secretary when a contest begins later this year. The battle over who leads Unite is an important one for Starmer. McCluskey, who will formally step down next year, was one of Jeremy Corbyn’s closest allies and has already attacked the current Labour leader over his decision to pay damages to ex-staffers who claimed the party had not dealt with antisemitism. Unite has also cut its support to Labour in the wake of the decision. In a statement to the Observer, Coyne said: “Unite the Union will hold its election for general secretary this year. When it does, after receiving much encouragement and support, I will put myself forward as a candidate. I am offering a progressive vision for Unite and its members that embraces the digital age and focuses on the members and their needs in a changed work environment. “Unite needs real change. I believe the culture needs to change, and that our union must modernise in order to be successful, effective and relevant. We must do far more to protect our existing members, organise in growing sectors of the economy, and we must respond far more decisively to the post-Covid world of work.” Coyne was sacked in June 2017, three months after standing against McCluskey for the union’s leadership. While McCluskey won 59,067 votes (45.4%), Coyne won 53,544 (41.5%). This time around, Coyne’s allies believe he may be helped because there are two candidates fighting for support for the union’s left. Coyne added: “I stood in the previous election for general secretary and very nearly won. I believe the past few years have shown I was right to stand and hold to account the leadership of Unite for its attempts to run the Labour party. Keir Starmer has displayed a sure touch on the major issues he has faced in his first year, and I think he should be given the support to help Labour win power in the interests of working people.” It comes with the new leader of another Labour-affiliated union set to be unveiled on Monday. The frontrunner to be named the new leader of Unison, the UK’s biggest union, is also a figure said to be broadly supportive of Starmer’s leadership. Christina McAnea, one of the union’s assistant general secretaries, faces a challenge from counterpart Roger McKenzie, who has been backed by Corbyn. A friendly set of union general secretaries could be a major boost for Starmer as he seeks to develop his leadership this year. McCluskey has already warned Starmer over any attempt to shift to the right or drop some of his leadership pledges that borrowed heavily from Corbyn’s last election manifesto. Unions still have huge influence in Labour’s party conference and its ruling body. They also provide large amounts of funding for the party. Unite gave Labour £3m in the run-up to the last general election. The 2017 battle for the Unite leadership was hugely divisive and subsequently saw Coyne suspended from the union. Several Labour MPs who opposed Corbyn’s leadership had been supporting him. Coyne later dropped an unfair dismissal claim. However, his allies believe he now has a real chance of seizing Unite’s leadership, with two prominent candidates vying to win support from the union’s left wing. Howard Beckett has been highly critical of Starmer’s leadership so far. Last year, he led a walkout by left figures from a meeting of Labour’s national executive committee in protest at what he described as “Keir Starmer’s factionalism”. Steve Turner, another current union official, has taken a more emollient tone towards Starmer, but is also on the left. He narrowly beat Beckett to the endorsement for the United Left faction of Unite."

In an unusual move, Buckingham Palace – which rarely comments on the private health matters of the couple – announced that the 94-year-old head of state and her consort had been given the injection. It is understood the Queen decided the information should be made public to prevent speculation. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have today received Covid-19 vaccinations.” A royal source confirmed to PA Media that a royal household doctor had administered the injections at Windsor Castle. The Queen and Philip have been spending the lockdown in England at the castle after deciding to to forgo the traditional family gathering at Sandringham. The Queen and the Duke will have been in the second priority group, for those aged 80 and older, after care home residents and staff. Discussions have reportedly been taking place in government about how to deploy public figures to encourage people to receive the vaccine amid scepticism among some. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, tweeted: “I’m delighted that Her Majesty the Queen & HRH the Duke of Edinburgh have received their Covid vaccine. We are defeating this virus jab by jab.” It is said that Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will let the public know when they have been inoculated. Charles and Prince William tested positive for Covid last year but did not report any serious adverse consequences. Queen Margrethe of Denmark, the third cousin of Elizabeth II, became the first European monarch to receive the coronavirus vaccine this week. In 1957, the Queen made public that Charles and his sister, Princess Anne, then eight and six, had been inoculated against polio with what was then a new vaccine."
2021-01-09T15:42:18Z,uk-news,UK news,Owners of London gym fined for staying open during Covid lockdown,"The owners of a London gym have been fined for breaching Covid-19 rules by remaining open during lockdown. The Metropolitan police said officers were called to the fitness centre on Stean Street in Hackney, east London, on Friday following reports of a breach of regulations. After finding three people inside the gym shortly before 9.30am, police issued the owners with a £1,000 fixed penalty notice (FPN).
The Met Police’s Ch Insp Pete Shaw, Covid lead for Hackney and Tower Hamlets, said: “Whilst there are certain rules around people being allowed to exercise in public under this lockdown, nowhere in the legislation does it allow people to go to gyms to work out. “Those found to be flouting the rules, as with this instance, should expect necessary enforcement action to be taken against them. We are thankful that the vast majority of people continue to follow the guidance and do their part to reduce the infection rate.” The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, declared a “major incident” in the capital on Friday due to the “out of control” spread of the virus, which was threatening to “overwhelm” hospitals. In some parts of the capital, as many as one in 20 people have the virus, while London’s average rate is one in 30, Khan told LBC on Friday. He said the London ambulance service was receiving between 3,000 and 4,000 more calls every day than it would on a normal busy day. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has defended the way police have handed out fines for lockdown breaches, stressing that there is a “need for strong enforcement”."
2021-01-09T09:00:17Z,uk-news,UK news,'It's about finding yourself': Cornish hedgers plan record-breaking labyrinth,"High on a Cornish moor, a living, breathing piece of artwork that is designed to last thousands of years is taking shape. Called Kerdroya, the piece is a labyrinth – billed as the largest of its kind in the world and constructed out of Cornish hedges, which are a unique combination of stone and vegetation. The footings of the hedges, the foundation boulders, or “grounders”, are in place, having been hauled out of the shallows of the nearby Colliford Lake by horse and sledge. As soon as Covid allows, hundreds of people, including schoolchildren, local people and volunteers, will help build and plant up the hedges, creating a classical labyrinth 56 metres across. In the spring, the site will hopefully be turned into an “outdoor university of Cornish hedging” with a training programme supported by the Guild of Cornish Hedgers passing on the age-old art to the next generation. More than 60 apprentice Cornish hedgers are to work on the labyrinth, learning from experts. The project director, Will Coleman, said Cornish hedges were an “unsung wonder.” He said the labyrinth would not be a tourist attraction but a “piece of land art” that would provide a place of quiet contemplation. “I really think this is the ideal project for these times,” he said. “We will build it, then plant it and after that, we walk away, let it become what it becomes, tell nature: ‘Off you go, have some fun with that.’”
Some Cornish hedges are believed to be 4,000 years old, making them one of the oldest human-made structures still used for their original purpose. They are neither a hedgerow nor a dry stone wall. In the east of the county they are more likely to have shrubs on the top; in the windswept, weather-battered far west, they may consist of earth and hefty stones. But all types of Cornish hedge are rich in plant and animal life and in the spring and summer often a riot of colour, home to 600 types of flowering plants. The makers of Kerdroya (a Cornish word that could be roughly translated as castle of turnings) also make it clear it is a labyrinth, not a maze. “A maze is about getting lost,” said Coleman. “This labyrinth will be about finding yourself.” Coleman says there are bigger mazes but he believes Kerdroya, which is being created on a disused car park close to the A30, will be the largest classical labyrinth in the world. “At least nobody has told me of a bigger one,” he said. Visitors will follow a single meandering path through the labyrinth. While most of the raw material will be from Bodmin Moor, there will be sections of stone from other parts of Cornwall, put into place under the supervision of hedgers used to working with that particular stone. The hedges will be topped with plants including whitethorn. The project, which has received funding from a wide range of organisations including Cornwall council, Arts Council England and the National Lottery Heritage Fund, was launched to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in 2019. It will not be completed any time soon. But Coleman argued it was better that way and said the West Country expression “dreckly” – which literally translates as “directly” but in fact means at some unspecified time in the future – was a good word to use. “When you are building something to last 4,000 years, everything is better off done dreckly.” • This article was amended on 15 January 2021. A previous version referred to the hedges being topped with plants “including whitethorn and hawthorn”, but these are different names for the same plant.

2021-01-08T20:35:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Gatwick immigration detention centre closed due to staff Covid cases,"An immigration detention centre has been temporarily closed after several members of staff tested positive for coronavirus. The Home Office said Brook House, near Gatwick airport in West Sussex, has been shut for 10 days. It said a “very small number” of detainees had been moved to Colnbrook immigration removal centre near Heathrow. Everyone being held at detention centres is being seen by a nurse and offered a Covid test, while face masks are provided; these are mandatory for all staff, it said. The department would not confirm how many staff and detainees have been affected but insisted it was a “very small number”. Last month the Guardian revealed that three wings at Brook House were in lockdown after an outbreak of Covid-19. There were understood to be 17 confirmed cases at the immigration removal centre. A notice from the Home Office contractor Serco, which runs the centre, was pushed under detainees’ cell doors confirming the news. The notice, seen by the Guardian, encouraged detainees to stay in their room.
Serco took over operations at Brook House from another outsourcing multinational, G4S, in May 2020. In 2017, the BBC’s Panorama programme broadcast undercover footage showing alleged assaults, humiliation and verbal abuse of detainees by officers at the facility. Fourteen members of G4S staff were dismissed or resigned after the broadcast, and the Home Office asked the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman to carry out an investigation. The inquiry was delayed pending legal action. In 2019, inspectors found there was “no culture of abuse” among current staff at Brook House. However, their findings said a series of improvements needed to be made."
2021-01-08T19:40:24Z,uk-news,UK news,Met police officers told they must justify pre-arrest use of handcuffs,"Britain’s largest police force will have to justify its use of handcuffs following a review that was triggered after the stop and search of Olympic athlete Bianca Williams. Williams, 27, accused the Metropolitan police of racially profiling her and her partner, Ricardo dos Santos, a Portuguese sprinter, when they were handcuffed and separated from their three-month-old son last July after their car was stopped by officers. The Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, apologised to the athletes after footage of the incident in Maida Vale, north-west London, was posted online by the Olympic medallist Linford Christie, who coaches the pair. The couple were found to have committed no offence.
Dick launched a review into the use of handcuffs where an arrest has not been made, a tactic most commonly deployed during stop and search. Scotland Yard said the force will improve its “training, policy and processes” following the review, which makes 10 recommendations. “The Met will now develop a specific policy on handcuffing pre-arrest that will set out clear guidance for officers, including the requirement to justify any initial application of handcuffs as well as their continued use during an interaction,” a statement said. Recommendations include “additional legal training, extended officer safety and improved personal safety training for police officers, de-escalation tactics and more community input to understand the respective experiences of each during encounters”. The Met has also amended its stop and search e-form to include any use and justification for handcuffs pre-arrest. The review included consultations with young black men, aged 16-25, as well as with frontline officers. The review said: “The public are concerned that the use of handcuffs can be degrading and, whilst accepting there is a place for it, handcuffs should not be the first resort, and more effort should be made in communication and explanation that might make the use of handcuffs unnecessary.
“The use of handcuffs pre-arrest is an issue of community concern. It is clear that there is a sound legal basis in some circumstances for the use of handcuffs pre-arrest in order to conduct a stop and search. However, this needs to be justified on every occasion and cannot, and must not, be considered a matter of routine or common practice that is done without proper consideration and recording on each occasion.” The Met deputy assistant commissioner Matt Twist, who led the review, said: “The Met is determined to be the most trusted police service in the world … I am grateful to the members of the public, police officers and critical friends who took time to help with this important work, which I believe will help us to improve our practices and with it, the trust of the public.”"
2021-01-08T15:50:33Z,uk-news,UK news,Covid in Wales: level 4 lockdown restrictions to remain in place,"Lockdown restrictions need to be further strengthened in Welsh supermarkets, shops and workplaces after the number of Covid cases began to climb again following a brief dip, the Welsh government has said. The â€œalert level 4â€� lockdown in Wales will continue for at least another three weeks and schools and colleges have been told to prepare for remote learning to continue until the February half-term. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said on Friday the new variant was â€œadding a dangerous dimension to the pandemicâ€�. It had a â€œfirm footholdâ€� in north Wales and was expected to become the dominant variant in the south. It has emerged that 13 residents of a care home in Wrexham have died from Covid-19 in recent days. Cindy Clutton, the manager of Hillbury Care Home, said staff were working hard to keep the remaining 40 residents safe. â€œThis new variant is now prevalent across north-east Wales and here in Wrexham we are suffering particularly badly,â€� she said.â€� Drakeford told a press conference on Friday: â€œOn Monday, there were around 440 cases per 100,000 people in Wales. Today, this is more than 20 points higher.â€�
More than 2,700 coronavirus-related patients are in Welsh hospitals and 143 people with Covid-19 in critical care beds. â€œThe number of people in critical care has reached the highest point in the pandemic,â€� he said. Drakeford said a nationwide curfew was not needed at the moment but that shops needed to strengthen safety measures such as limiting the number of people allowed in at once. He said: â€œThe new strain of the virus is so much more contagious that we have to look again at the defences in place to keep workplaces safe, working with employers and trade unions to do so.â€� On schools and colleges, Drakeford said most pupils would be taught online until 29 January but that unless there was â€œa significant reduction in casesâ€� this would continue until February half-term. Asked if it was possible schools and colleges would open during the summer for pupils and students to catch up, he said discussions would take place about the â€œwider pictureâ€�.
Drakeford said there was only a marginal difference between the number of people who have been vaccinated in Wales compared with the rest of the UK. But he said that to be able to plan properly there needed to be a â€œreliable senseâ€� of how much vaccine Wales would be receiving from UK supplies, and when. Wales has vaccinated about 50,000 people. It received a â€œsignificantâ€� delivery of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on 23 and 27 December. It then took 22,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot on Monday and is due to receive 25,000 doses next week and 80,000 the week after that. But Drakeford said: â€œWe need to know beyond three weeks. To be able to plan for the maximum delivery you need a reliable sense of how many doses you are going to have available.â€�
Although Wales has so far vaccinated fewer people than other UK nations, Drakeford said: â€œVaccination is neither a sprint nor a contest.â€� He said all frontline ambulance staff in Wales would have had their first dose by next week and vaccination is to be extended to staff working in special schools and to school and college staff who are at risk. He shared the UKâ€™s ambition of vaccinating the top priority groups by mid-February but said it was not sensible to have a target when it was not clear how much vaccine would be available. The first minister said he strongly supported plans to require all travellers to England and Scotland from international destinations to test negative for coronavirus before they can enter the country, but because Cardiff airport was closed and people arriving in ports were travelling from the common travel area, there was no need at the moment to bring in such a rule."
2021-01-08T11:18:30Z,uk-news,UK news,Penzance mayor tells of racist abuse over removal of Brexit flags,"The mayor of a Cornish town who was targeted with racist abuse after a dispute over the flying of union flags to celebrate Brexit has spoken of her fear and anger. Police have installed a panic alarm at the home of Nicole Broadhurst after she received thousands of messages, many abusive or racist, criticising her for saying the flags had to be taken down from Penzance seafront. Broadhurst, who is black, also revealed that she and her husband were badly shaken after a group arrived at her remote home in a van at night, shone headlights into their sitting room and shouted abuse. She has been advised by police to suspend her mayoral Facebook page and staff at Penzance town council are passing offensive messages straight to the police rather than showing them to her. Broadhurst, 50, said: “It’s quite frightening to think they can do this to me and make me feel scared. It’s a vocal minority who want people to change how they run their homes and towns. “When they came up to the house shouting and flashing their lights that was a bit of a shake-up for me and my husband. Now when a car pulls up, we’re both like, ‘what’s that?’ We’re living differently to the day before it happened.” Flags are not normally flown on Penzance promenade in the winter because they can be damaged by high winds. But over new year 18 union flags appeared on poles owned by Cornwall council to mark the end of the Brexit transition. Broadhurst made it clear they had not been authorised and they were taken down. A petition was launched against the move and the issue was picked up by local and national media, leading to “thousands” of abusive messages. The mayor said: “The messages were unpleasant, personal, misogynistic and horrible. They included things like: ‘Don’t you dare show your face in this town, you’re an incomer, go back to where you came from.’ “There were lots of comments such as: ‘Look at her, she should go back to where she came from.’” Broadhurst said she was born in south London, moved to Cornwall in 2005 and had been a town councillor for almost four years. She said: “I think I became a conduit for the anger that is out there, which is puzzling. The people who are angry won, they won Brexit. They got what they wanted, why are they still cross? “I’ve been told by a few supporters keep your head down but I won’t. People keep their head down because they have been slapped down by a vocal minority. I will be asking the council not to appease these people. If we have a policy there is no way we should change it just because a small vocal minority wants to change something.” She added: “It’s surreal that I have a personal panic alarm installed. The police are phoning to make sure I’m OK.” She said she had been told the police were investigating possible crimes under the Malicious Communications Act 1988. It is not known who put the flags up. One man, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Cornwall Live website he had done it to help the UK celebrate independence from the EU. He said: “They were not put up to create further divide in our community, they were put up to try to unite us as a nation. I am a proud Cornishman and I am proud to be British.” A spokesperson for Devon and Cornwall police said: “Police in Penzance are investigating a report that racist comments had been posted online about a member of the community.”"
2021-01-08T07:35:16Z,uk-news,UK news,Covid: arrivals to UK will need to show a negative test before entry,"International travellers will need to show a negative Covid-19 test before being allowed into the UK, the government has announced, in a significant toughening of border controls to try to stem the spread of new coronavirus variants. The new rules will take effect next week and apply to returning UK nationals as well as foreign citizens. Passengers will need to produce a test result taken less than 72 hours before boarding planes, boats or trains to the UK, and could be fined £500 in border spot checks without a negative result. Arrivals will still need to quarantine for 10 days, even with a negative test, unless they are coming from one of the limited number of countries deemed low risk on the government’s travel corridor list. The move comes many months after border restrictions were put in place in other countries, which have managed to bring local transmission to an end, and amid mounting pressure for tighter controls with fears over the South African Covid variant. The rules will officially only apply to England but ministers were said to be working closely with the devolved administrations on similar measures for Wales and Northern Ireland. The Scottish government confirmed it would adopt the same plan, while adding it would not affect current rules that make non-essential travel to and from Scotland illegal. The rules will not apply to visitors from Ireland, which is also expected to put a similar scheme in place this week. It comes as other countries including France close their borders to British travellers due to the highly transmissible new variant of Covid-19 first identified in the UK. Pre-departure testing is seen as safer than testing on arrival to reduce the chance of infection during travel – although the aviation industry has argued the risk of transmission in flight is minimal. Announcing the move, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “We already have significant measures in place to prevent imported cases of Covid-19, but with new strains of the virus developing internationally we must take further precautions. “Taken together with the existing mandatory self-isolation period for passengers returning from high-risk countries, pre-departure tests will provide a further line of defence – helping us control the virus as we roll out the vaccine at pace over the coming weeks.” Legislation will be brought in early next week, the Department for Transport said, setting out the test standards and required proof of a negative test. Hauliers, flight crew and children under 11 will be exempt. Passengers will still be able to reduce their isolation period by paying for a further test five days after arrival, under the Test to Release scheme. Heathrow airport’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said: “Having called for the introduction of pre-departure testing since last April, we support this development which ensures passengers can continue to travel safely. The government must now prioritise the creation of a common international standard for testing that would introduce a global process to protect confidence in future travel.” Earlier, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, urged Shapps to implement more robust measures owing to the capital’s exposure through international airports, Eurostar rail arrivals and freight ports. Contrasting UK policy with other countries’ protective restrictions, he said that pre-departure testing should be combined with a test on arrival and stricter, better enforced quarantine rules. The government has also extended the blanket ban on entry from South Africa to include a swathe of southern African countries. From 4am Saturday, entry will be denied to most people who have travelled from or through any southern African country in the last 10 days – including Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe, and holiday destinations Seychelles and Mauritius. British and Irish nationals can return but must self-isolate with their households for 10 days."
2021-01-07T18:52:43Z,uk-news,UK news,"Man, 19, guilty of murdering schoolboy he paid Â£2,000 to keep silent","A 19-year-old man has been found guilty of murdering a schoolboy after paying more than £2,000 to try to stop him revealing their sexual relationship. Matthew Mason admitted bludgeoning 15-year-old Alex Rodda to death with a wrench in woods in Cheshire on 12 December 2019. The court heard they had been involved in a brief sexual relationship before Rodda told Mason’s girlfriend that the older teenager had sent him explicit photos and a video. Mason argued at trial that he had experienced a loss of control during the killing and had been blackmailed by Rodda, who he claimed had tried to attack him before his death. He was found guilty of murder by a majority of jurors at Chester crown court on Thursday. He will be sentenced at a later date.
In a statement, Rodda’s family described the 15-year-old as a “wonderful, gentle, loving, kind, caring, respectful boy who loved life and lived life to the full”. “His precious life was cut short all too soon at the hands of Matthew Mason,” they said. The family said they had never come across a more “selfish, cold and calculating person” than Mason, who they said had “attempted to blame Alex and discredit his name throughout this trial, and thankfully the jury were able to see through his web of deceit”. Mason, an architectural engineering student, wept in the dock as the guilty verdict was returned. He previously told jurors he had asked friends and family for money to pay Rodda but did not tell them what it was for. He said he was embarrassed and worried after having sex with the younger boy, adding that he thought it was wrong “because he was a male and, secondly, his age”. The trial heard Rodda had contacted Mason’s then girlfriend and told her he had been sending “flirty” messages and an explicit picture and video. Mason denied the allegations to his girlfriend but began making payments to Rodda’s bank account at around the same time, amounting to more than £2,200 by the time of Rodda’s death. The court heard Mason had searched the internet for phrases including “what would happen if you kicked someone down the stairs” and “everyday poison”. He said he was looking for ways to kill himself as he felt depressed and suicidal following the end of his relationship with his girlfriend. The court heard that Mason picked the younger boy up from his home in Tabley, Cheshire, and drove him to a remote spot on the night of the murder. Mason, who lived on his family’s farm near Knutsford, Cheshire, said he told Rodda that he could not afford to give him any more money. He said he had taken a wrench with him because he felt intimidated by the teenager and wanted to scare him. Mason claimed that Rodda had grabbed the wrench from him and pushed him to the floor. Evidence showed that Rodda had been struck at least 15 times in what was described by the prosecution as a brutal attack."
2021-01-07T18:06:27Z,uk-news,UK news,"Teacher died in freak Cornish paddleboard accident, inquest told","A teacher taking a seaside break as he recovered from the impact of Covid-19 died in a freak paddleboarding accident when he became trapped under a moored boat, an inquest heard. Simon Flynn jumped off the paddleboard as the current in a Cornish estuary carried him towards the boat. But he was tethered to the board by an ankle leash and became stuck underwater. Flynn’s partner, Chia Appleby, who was paddleboarding with him at the time, said the pair had gone to Cornwall for a weekend break in August last year. Appleby said Flynn, 42, had suffered Covid-19 and was dealing with chronic fatigue and insomnia but was keen to go paddleboarding. She said her partner, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, had done a lot of water sports, was a good swimmer and confident in the water. The inquest at Truro, Cornwall heard the tide was low. It was a calm, sunny day, and they both wore wetsuits as they paddled across the estuary near Rock to some sandbanks where Appleby said they had a “chat and kiss and cuddle”. On the way back across, the current took them towards the moored boat and Appleby said Flynn leapt off the 4-metre inflatable board. She said: “I looked behind. I could see he had gone under the boat. I could see that all his body was under the boat. He just got stuck underneath the boat.” Appleby jumped into the water to try to help but could not swim against the current and screamed for help. Financial services operations manager Charlie Palmer saw the incident unfolding from the Rock sailing club, where he was having his lunch. He paddled out, dived in, undid the leash and pulled Flynn to the surface. Other rescuers arrived but could not save Flynn. The harbour master, Bryn Phillips, said there were 300 moorings in the area and this was the first such incident. A postmortem concluded Flynn died from drowning and also suffered a minor head injury. The acting senior coroner, Andrew Cox, recorded a conclusion of accidental death. Flynn’s family said at the time: “It is with immeasurable sadness that we, Simon’s family, must announce that he tragically passed away in a freak accident while having the time of his life in Cornwall. He loved his job, he loved working and developing his students.”"
2021-01-07T18:06:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Police investigate racist abuse of mayor over removal of Brexit flags,"Police are investigating racist abuse aimed at the mayor of a Cornish town after she said union flags that had appeared on the seafront to celebrate Brexit had to be taken down. Nicole Broadhurst, the mayor of Penzance, received abuse on social media when she said the 18 flags had been hoisted without permission and needed to be removed. Thousands of people have signed a petition calling for the flags to be reinstated and hundreds of people left comments on social media, many criticising Broadhurst’s stance but some aiming personal abuse at her. Devon and Cornwall police said on Thursday they were investigating racist abuse posted on social media. Flags are not normally flown on Penzance promenade in the winter because they can be damaged by high winds. But over new year 18 flags appeared on poles owned by Cornwall council to mark the end of the Brexit transition. Broadhurst said at the time: “Penzance council didn’t authorise these or have anything to do with their installation. We are working with Cornwall council and the flags will be taken down.” She went on to insist the flags were not removed because they were union flags but because they were unauthorised. Broadhurst said: “If they were Peppa Pig flags or Saint Piran flags or EU flags they would still have to come down if no permission had been given for them to be put up.” The town council said it was deeply saddened at the racist abuse the mayor suffered. In a statement it said: “We are deeply saddened at the offensive and personal comments, including racist abuse, made in response to the removal of the flags; unity and community spirit are needed in these uncertain times rather than division and negativity.” The statement added: “The flags on Penzance promenade are usually put up around the time of the Golowan festival [in June] until the end of summer, helping to define our town’s positive spirit and bring joy to those enjoying our wonderful seafront. “The flags which were put up on New Year’s Day have been removed because they were flown without the permission of Cornwall council or Penzance town council. “We do not fly flags during the winter months when the promenade is often exposed to gusting winds which could damage both the flags and flagpoles themselves.”"
2021-01-07T18:04:11Z,uk-news,UK news,'World's unluckiest burglars' arrested after calling police by accident,"As pocket dials go, it was a fairly costly one: two suspected burglars have been arrested after accidentally calling the police on themselves, officers have said. Staffordshire police confirmed they arrested a 49-year-old and a 42-year-old after receiving a call from one of them, who appeared to have unwittingly sat on his phone. Officers said they listened in to the call as the men carried out the burglary and could even hear their colleagues arrive to make the arrests. “I think we have just arrested the world’s unluckiest burglars,” said Ch Insp John Owen. Police said they arrested the two men in the Middleport area of Stoke-on-Trent on suspicion of burglary after receiving the “suspicious call” on Wednesday evening. They were still in custody on Thursday morning. Poking fun at the unlucky pair, Owen included an image of Marv, the hapless burglar from the Home Alone film series, in a Twitter post on Wednesday evening.
“Whilst committing a burglary one of the bungling burglars has accidentally sat on his phone and dialled 999. We receive a call detailing all of their antics up to the point of hearing our patrols arrive to arrest them,” he wrote. It is not the first time a set of robbers has managed to shop themselves with an injudiciously placed rear end. In 2013, a pair who were breaking into a car in Fresno, California, managed to call police on themselves. The call handler on duty was able to track them down as Nathan Teklemariam and Carson Rinehart spent about half an hour discussing their plans. The pair were eventually arrested. “This stuff just doesn’t happen – where a crime is captured from beginning to end,” Sgt Jaime Rios told Today. “The 911 call was still open at the time of the arrests, and the officer took the phone and ended the call himself.” While 25-year-old Callum Tumilty managed not to call the police on himself when he broke into Cambois first school near Blyth, in Northumberland, to steal a load of laptops, his mother was less obliging. Tumilty left his phone behind at the crime scene and was caught after his mother called it to try to track him down and asked the person who answered if Callum was there. Officers on the scene were quickly able to identify and track down the guilty party. According to Newcastle’s Chronicle newspaper, Tumilty was later sentenced to 26 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to several charges."
2021-01-07T17:05:57Z,uk-news,UK news,Trial date set for teenagers over stabbing of 13-year-old in Reading,"A 13-year-old girl and two boys aged 13 and 14 will go on trial this summer accused of the murder of a boy who was stabbed at a wildlife conservation area on the outskirts of Reading. Oliver Stephens, 13, was found at Bugs Bottom fields, close to St Barnabas Road, Emmer Green, on Sunday. He died of his injuries at the scene, police said. The three suspects, who cannot be named because of their ages, appeared at Reading crown court on Thursday morning charged with murder and conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. The girl was also charged with perverting the course of justice. The three, all from Reading, spoke in court only to confirm their names, ages and addresses, according to the PA Media news agency. No application for bail was made. The teenagers will next appear at a pre-trial hearing at the same court on 4 February and a provisional trial date has been set for 21 June, also at Reading crown court. They were all remanded in custody at a youth detention centre. Police responding to reports of a stabbing found Oliver, who was autistic, just before 4pm on Sunday at Bugs Bottom fields, a managed wildlife conservation area covering nearly six hectares of meadows. The area is popular with dog-walkers, joggers and families. Five suspects were arrested shortly after. Two other boys, both aged 13, have been released on bail, with strict conditions, until 1 February. In a statement issued through police, Oliver’s family described the youngster, known as Olly, as “an enigma” and said he “could get his own way with a wry smile and a cheeky grin”. They said: “He always stood his ground and fought for the underdog while having an amazing depth of love, warmth and wit. In his final moments he must have been terrified. Fighting to get home, he had everything to live for. We now have only memories. An Olly-sized hole has been left in our hearts.” The family described the ordeal as “every parent’s worst nightmare”."
2021-01-07T12:29:14Z,uk-news,UK news,Slave trade links of Scotland's Glenfinnan memorial revealed,"The history of Glenfinnan, one of the most famous sites linked to Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Jacobite revolt, is being rewritten after significant links to the Atlantic slave trade were uncovered. Historians have found evidence the Glenfinnan memorial, erected close to where Charles Edward Stuart raised his standard at Loch Shiel in 1745, was built using wealth from slave plantations in Jamaica by a descendant of clansmen who took part in the Jacobite rebellion. Bonnie Prince Charlie arrived at Glenfinnan on a French-owned ship used for slave transports, the Du Teillay. It had been donated to the Jacobite cause by a French-Irish privateer and plantation owner, Antoine Walsh, who had grown wealthy from the transatlantic slavery trade.
The National Trust for Scotland (NTS), the charity that owns Glenfinnan and many of Scotland’s best-known historic sites, is now rewriting its literature and displays at the memorial, including relabelling a scale model of the Du Teillay to give prominence to those slavery links. A large portrait of Bonnie Prince Charlie at Glenfinnan visitor centre is being replaced in early 2021 by a new display detailing those links and new research that has uncovered significant ties between many Highland estate owners and slave plantations across the Americas. In a strange collision of historic and contemporary cultures, Glenfinnan is also one of Scotland’s most popular tourist destinations because its nearby railway viaduct features heavily in Harry Potter films: it was the backdrop to Harry’s flying car and used by the Hogwarts school train. “It’s not to downplay the fact that Glenfinnan monument will always be there to remember those brave Highlanders who died at Culloden, but we’d also like people to reflect on those brave people in Jamaica whose tragic story 4,500 miles away contributed to the monument as well,” said Emily Bryce, the NTS curator at Glenfinnan.
“There are two parts of the history and I don’t want to not tell one or downgrade another.” Historians working for NTS, which owns around 139 historic properties, islands, nature reserves and gardens, estimate at least 36 of its buildings have ties to slavery. Some owners profited from the exploitation of enslaved people or from the UK government’s compensation scheme for slave-owners after abolition in 1833. Dr Jennifer Melville, a historian leading the NTS review, said those include Culzean castle in Ayrshire, Pollok House in Glasgow, Brodie castle in Moray and its famous Georgian properties on Charlotte Square in Edinburgh, including Bute House, the official residence of Scotland’s first ministers. Over the last year, the V&A Dundee relabelled many of its historic exhibits to reflect their ties to Empire and slavery; in Bristol, protestors toppled the statue of slave trader Edward Colston; while Oriel college in Oxford agreed to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes, the Victorian-era colonialist after a five year long student campaign. “We’re just trying to find out as much as we possibly can about all of our portfolio,” Melville said. “If you care for a heritage portfolio it is your duty to know about that portfolio and I think in the past we’ve looked at that history in a very linear patriarchal way.” Melville said a disproportionate number of Scots emigrated to the Americas during the 1700s as colonisers. While highly educated, there were too few economic and professional opportunities at home. They moved into the slavery economy as plantation owners, overseers, doctors, lawyers or bookkeepers.
Some, including Catholic Highlanders and islanders with Jacobite ties, left to avoid or escape religious persecution by Protestant landowners. After Bonnie Prince Charlie’s defeat at Culloden in 1746, 254 captured Jacobites were deported to Jamaica and Barbados as indentured labourers. The trust has drawn on new research for Community Land Scotland by Dr Iain Mackinnon, of Coventry university, and Dr Andrew Mackillop, of Glasgow university, who found at least 63 land purchases across the west Highlands and islands by the beneficiaries of slavery between 1726 and 1939. The Glenfinnan memorial’s association was uncovered by Dr Karly Kehoe, a Canadian academic researching Scottish migration to Nova Scotia. The monument was built by Alexander Macdonald, the only son of Alexander “Golden Sandy” Macdonald, and 10th laird of Glenaladale. Golden Sandy bought the estate from his cousin, John Macdonald, using the profits of his coffee plantation in Jamaica and the wealth of his first wife, a plantation owner who died after their marriage. In 1745, Alexander Macdonald’s grandfather and three uncles had welcomed Stuart when he stepped off the Du Teillay at Glenfinnan and fought with him during the Jacobite rebellion. Melville said NTS guides and curators were heavily involved in a team of 40 volunteers reassessing the history of these properties and their owners. “As society changes, we need to look at it in a more textured way. All of our properties are palimpsests really, and they have a layered history which is complex. And Scotland’s history is complex.” • This article was corrected on 7 January 2021.

2021-01-07T11:28:09Z,uk-news,UK news,'Lockdown choices are not trivial’: Vaughan Gething on tackling Covid crisis in Wales,"In the past year, Vaughan Gething has become one of the most recognisable politicians in the UK. The job of Welsh health minister did not used to attract much UK-wide attention. But as a result of Covid, and the focus that has placed on the devolved nations, it does now. “Some government colleagues ask me: ‘How do you do that job? It’s awful.’ Of course it’s difficult, but you make a difference and you meet remarkable people who benefit from the health service and remarkable people who deliver it.” But with recognition also comes abuse. Gething, like many other politicians, now regularly gets vitriol from the public, none more so than after “Chipgate”, when the Sun carried a picture during the first lockdown of Gething sitting on a bench eating chips with his family in a park. He insists he broke no rules.
“There’s much more attention, and attention that is personal. That’s difficult, the feeling that you’re being watched and not in a kind way.” But what keeps Gething, 46, going is that decisions he makes during the Covid crisis can be the difference between hospitals being able to function or being overwhelmed, between the economy creaking on or collapsing, between life and death. The latest figures suggest the number of coronavirus patients in Welsh hospitals could soon be double that seen during the first wave of the pandemic. On Wednesday, Public Health Wales reported another 76 deaths – the highest daily total since the start of the pandemic, although not all deaths happened on the same day. It took the total deaths in Wales since the start of the pandemic to 3,738. Speaking shortly before the latest surge, Gething said: “The lockdown choices are not trivial; they have a huge impact on people. And there are people who potentially won’t be alive because we’ve chosen to act or not act. I don’t think I’ve been overwhelmed but I’ve been deeply troubled by the choices I’ve had to make at various times.” He pays tribute not just to health and social care staff. “It’s the volunteers, the taxi drivers who take shopping to people who can’t get out, it’s the community groups who made an effort to look after other people. That is what gives hope and optimism for the future.”
Gething accepts the crisis has exposed some “fragility” in parts of the system and highlighted deep health issues in the Welsh population. “This virus affects older people with underlying health conditions. There’s a very direct link between that and how well off you are. The poorer you are the more likely you are to be unwell. The ONS figures show it’s our poorer communities that have had the biggest impact. It’s highlighted a need to look again at what we do, that’s not just a health challenge but a whole society challenge.” But Gething argues some good things have come out of the Covid crisis such as partnerships between health and central and local government. “Necessity forced the relationships to improve to take another leap forward.” And the speed with which some innovations such as video consultations have come in. “Previously that would have taken years to roll out. It was done in months. There’s been a real can-do attitude. ” As a result, “there’s much more UK attention on Wales and devolution. Not every UK-wide news organisation has a benevolent view of devolution or of politicians who don’t agree with the UK government. Some of that has been personal and pretty fact-free.” After Chipgate, “a couple of months ago I went on a bike ride with my son and it’s a nice thing to do together, have a chat, have a snack. But someone tweeted about seeing me on the bike ride and claimed I was breaking the rules.” On another occasion he went to a food festival with his family, following all the rules. Again a picture appeared on social media suggesting he was doing something he shouldn’t. “That’s hurtful. They can see you’re out with a child of primary school age child they are still prepared to lay in and invite other people to be unkind, never mind the facts.” In 2013 Gething became the first black minister in the devolved UK administrations. Before that he was the first black president of the National Union of Students Wales and the first black president of the Trades Union Congress in Wales. He says that some of the abuse he receives is racist. He says he has nothing like the “sewer of filth” the likes of his Labour colleague Diane Abbott is subject to. “But some of what comes is because I’m black. There’s no getting away from that.” Despite the stress of his current job, Gething still harbours ambitions of becoming Welsh first minister one day. “I haven’t given up on my desire to lead the country but that will be a matter for another day. We have a lot to get through before then – not just the Covid pandemic but an election [there are due to be Welsh parliament elections in 2021] and a lot of uncertainty. Who knows what the world will be like in another few years.”"
2021-01-07T00:01:53Z,uk-news,UK news,British army recruits rise as Covid seems to act as 'rallying cry',"The British army says it is on track to meet its annual recruitment target for only the second time in eight years amid tentative signs that the pandemic crisis has acted as a “rallying cry to serve”. With nearly three months to go before the recruiting year ends in March, a total of 7,719 young people have signed up. That represents 78% of the numbers required, giving army chiefs confidence that the goal will be achieved. Formally, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is not yet ready to declare that Covid-19 has helped with recruitment, but one defence source has said they believed the near-year-long crisis was among the factors persuading young people to join. Applications often rise during periods of economic weakness, and the army offers a secure career at a time when many other employment opportunities have been curtailed. Another reason cited was the obvious need to help out around the UK in establishing Covid testing and vaccination sites. “It’s clear there is a rallying cry to serve,” the source added. Five thousand troops and other members of the armed forces are currently deployed in locations around the UK in what the MoD described earlier this week as “the biggest homeland operation in peacetime”. That includes 800 personnel providing coronavirus testing in Manchester, a further 420 in neighbouring Lancashire, and 390 in Kent – plus 160 planners and logistics specialists helping with fast-developing plans to supply the vaccine to sites around the country. Lt Gen Sir Tyrone Urch, Commander Home Command, said: “In a uniquely demanding year for us all, it has been remarkable and really encouraging to see the huge numbers of talented young people looking to join the army.” Enlistment had collapsed after the recruitment process was part-privatised in 2012, with Capita working jointly on the contract. Targets were missed six years in a row and the army remains 8% below its 82,050 official requirement. There were some pre-pandemic signs of recovery after the success of a controversial advertising campaign in 2019 encouraging “snowflakes” and “phone zombies” to sign up – coupled with a relaxation of health requirements that made it easier for overweight people to meet the recruitment criteria. That meant the enlistment target was hit in 2019-20. But before the pandemic, senior executives involved were issuing warnings about the pressures that lay ahead. “Socioeconomic, political factors have made life difficult,” Cath Possamai, the chief executive of the British Army Recruiting Group, said last February. This year’s advertising campaign, which launches today, targets youngsters who fear failure, with the tagline: “Fail. Learn. Win.” Television commercials show soldiers overcoming adversity, one face down in the mud while another struggles to keep the pace on a training march. In November, Boris Johnson announced an extra £24bn for the armed forces over the next four years, but a fresh analysis published today shows that the entire real-terms increase is going towards the MoD equipment budget. Cash for running expenses – including pay and support for soldiers – is set to fall by 2% in real terms by 2024-5. Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director-general of the RUSI thinktank, said: “This is likely to require hard choices on all the main elements of the MoD’s recurrent budget”, including spending on personnel."
2021-01-07T00:01:53Z,uk-news,UK news,London population set to decline for first time since 1988 – report,"London’s population is set to decline for the first time in more than 30 years, driven by the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and people reassessing where they live during the crisis, according to a report. The accountancy firm PwC said the number of people living in the capital could fall by more than 300,000 this year, from a record level of about 9 million in 2020, to as low as 8.7 million. This would end decades of growth with the first annual drop since 1988. The forecast comes as city-dwellers rethink their living situations during lockdown and a boom in home working during the pandemic encourages growing numbers of people to consider moving elsewhere.
Other drivers include a smaller number of graduates moving to London, fewer job opportunities in the capital and lower international migration to the city as a result of the pandemic and Brexit. Net EU migration to the UK as a whole has fallen since the 2016 Brexit vote, and could turn negative in 2021 – meaning more people leave the UK for the EU than arrive from it – for the first time since the early 1990s, according to PwC forecasts. The accountancy firm also said the UK could record a “baby bust” in 2021, with the annual birth rate dipping to the lowest level since records began more than a century ago.
Although it will take time before official population figures are published, PwC said there were early signs that London was on track to shrink for the first time this century. It said an August 2020 survey by the London Assembly found that 4.5% of Londoners – or 416,000 people – said they would definitely move out of the city within the next 12 months. Official figures show UK unemployment is rising fastest in London boroughs, as the country grapples with the deepest recession for 300 years. Job postings have fallen by the most among Europe’s biggest capital cities. According to economists, London’s jobs woes are a reflection of the city’s density and typical opportunities for work during normal times – such as in hospitality, leisure, retail and travel – which have been hit hardest by the pandemic. Londoners are also more likely to work from home than anywhere else in the UK – due to a higher proportion of professional, IT and finance jobs in the City – meaning more people could move to other parts of the country if remote-working practices are sustained beyond the crisis. A decline in London’s population would represent a return to the years in the middle of the 20th century when London’s population collapsed after the second world war, as people moved away from the bombed-out and blitzed city for a life in the leafier home counties or other parts of the country, dropping from 8.6 million in 1939 to 6.8 million in the 1980s. Population growth returned in the late 1980s, fuelled by London’s growth as a global financial centre, epitomised by the redevelopment of Canary Wharf in the London Docklands. In a reversal of the mid 20th-century trend, international migration helped lift the population to its pre-war peak by 2015, and was on track to hit 10 million. Hannah Audino, an economist at PwC, said a sustained decline in London’s population would have wide-ranging consequences for the capital’s economy, house prices and transport network, but that it was too early to know for certain whether Covid and Brexit would have a long-term impact. “It depends on the extent to which remote working truly does become the new normal into the long term. A lot of people really miss the office environment, so once social distancing measures are fully history, infive to 10 years’ time, maybe people will go back more to city living,” she said. A spokesman for Sadiq Khan said the Mayor of London was confident that the city would emerge stronger from the Covid crisis. “The pandemic has had a profound effect on London and Londoners, but Sadiq is determined that the capital will recover to become cleaner, greener and fairer, with thriving neighbourhoods, improved wellbeing and a strengthened healthcare system.”"
2021-01-06T16:13:35Z,uk-news,UK news,"Reading knife attacker had 'fleeting interest' in extremism, court told","The man who has admitted murdering three people in a Reading park is not a jihadist but plagued by substance abuse and mental health issues, a court today heard. The prosecution has asked for Khairi Saadallah, 26, to be given a whole life sentence – meaning he would die in jail – for the attacks last June during which he shouted Allahu Akbar. At an earlier hearing, Saadallah pleaded guilty to murdering three men and the attempted murder of three more, over a period of less than one minute. His barrister, Rossano Scamardella QC, tried to rebut the prosecution case that the attacks were committed as part of an alleged jihad, fuelled by Saadallah’s long-term interest in violent extremism. The victims were enjoying a summer evening during the first coronavirus lockdown in Forbury Gardens, Reading. They were James Furlong, 36, a history teacher; David Wails, 49, a scientist; and Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39, an American pharmaceutical worker. Ritchie-Bennett and Furlong suffered single wounds to their necks. Wails was stabbed once in the back, with the Crown arguing the precision of the wounds showing the attacker knew how to inflict maximum damage with the knife he had bought from a supermarket the day before. Saadallah also stabbed Stephen Young, Patrick Edwards and Nishit Nisudan, who were sitting nearby and lucky to survive. Saadallah’s barrister told the sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey that he had shown an interest in Christianity and led a lifestyle that no committed Islamist extremist would lead. Scamardella said his client should face a starting point of 30 years imprisonment and stressed he was not downplaying the seriousness of the attacks: “In this case, significant planning or premeditation simply does not exist. “I concede the defendant took certain steps to facilitate the killing, putting himself in a position to commit the act, but nothing close in the issue of planning that would justify a whole-life term.” On Tuesday the prosecution said that in 2019, Saadallah had accessed material on his mobile phone about Mohammed Emwazi, the Isis propagandist seen in videos taunting victims before killing them, and two days before the attack had accessed a website with the flag associated with Isis, which had staged numerous attacks against western targets. He was alleged in 2017 to have associated with an extremist Islamist preacher while serving a prison sentence. Scamardella said Saadallah had a “fleeting or occasional interest” in Islamist extremism, but that was only part of what drove him: “He smokes cigarettes, takes drugs, he is a heavy user of alcohol. He self-harmed, he had tattoos. A person willing to kill for that cause would not behave in that way.” The attacker had a crucifix tattoo on his leg, had prayed in a church, and had told police in an interview he was “part Muslim and part Catholic”. Scamardella added: “No radical Islamist would countenance adoption of another faith – it’s inconceivable.” The court has heard that Saadallah had an emotionally unstable and antisocial personality disorder, worsened by alcohol and cannabis misuse. A psychiatric assessment of Saadallah said these were not a factor in the attack on 20 June, which police called a terrorist incident. The sentencing hearing also heard from those left bereaved by the attack. Furlong’s family, in statement read to the court, told of their pain and loss. His father, Gary, mother, Jan, brother, Gary, sister-in-law, Laura, and two nieces said in the joint statement: “James was a remarkable person, an unfailingly kind and compassionate man. He was a gentle, deeply caring soul and a great support to those he knew. James lived a happy and full life and we were a very close family. “James was gay. He first came out as gay to his mother and then later to the rest of his family. He was worried that it might change things, but it only made us all closer. As a parent, to have a child is the greatest gift. To lose a child is unbearable, but to lose a child in such a cruel and violent way is excruciating. “We have not slept a full night’s sleep since it happened. There is a massive gap where James should be that makes our hearts ache.” The hearing continues. A decision on Saadallah’s sentence is expected on Monday."
2021-01-06T15:08:25Z,uk-news,UK news,"Northern Ireland facing food supply disruption over Brexit, MPs told","Northern Ireland is facing disruptions to its food supply because suppliers in Great Britain are unaware of the Brexit-related paperwork needed to send goods to the region, business leaders have said. Trucks are arriving at GB ports with incorrect or absent documentation that delays their passage across the Irish Sea, they told MPs on Wednesday. Many operators in Great Britain seemed unaware that since 11pm on New Year’s Eve Northern Ireland was applying EU customs rules at its ports, meaning goods crossing the Irish Sea from other parts of the UK were subject to customs checks, Seamus Leheny, of the freight trade body Logistics UK, told the Northern Ireland affairs committee. “We had lorries arriving into Belfast with no documentation at all … it’s the lack of preparation on the GB side.” One large manufacturer had 15 lorries of food bound for Northern Ireland stuck because they lacked customs declarations, said Leheny. He cited another company that sent 285 lorries to Great Britain but only 100 returned, leading to knock-on disruption of supply chains. Another company resolved documentation problems after studying a YouTube tutorial. Leheny said ports and customs officials were working hard and flexibly to minimise disruption but he urged the government to improve communication so that hauliers were not left figuring out paperwork on their own. Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, told MPs that authorities in Belfast and London needed to be “shouting from the rooftops” so that suppliers and parcel companies understood the new rules. “This is a very turbulent time where decisions need to be taken at speed,” he said. Sainsbury’s has been forced to fill some of its Northern Ireland supermarket shelves with Spar-branded products. Shoppers at Tesco and other chains have reported bare shelves in some sections, especially chilled food. England, Scotland and Wales left the European Union’s single market for goods on 31 December but Northern Ireland did not. Products containing animal parts require export health certificates in accordance with EU regulations. Ian Paisley, an MP with the Democratic Unionist party, said the special arrangements for the region had been a “disaster” and justified ditching the Northern Ireland protocol, which had cleared the way for the final Brexit deal between London and Brussels. Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, told BBC Radio Ulster that companies were adapting to changes. “I think people will see, as things settle down, that things will flow as they did in 2020.”"
2021-01-06T13:59:07Z,uk-news,UK news,Grenfell Tower inquiry suspended because of Covid,"The Grenfell Tower public inquiry has been suspended until at least next month, due to rising Covid-19 infections in London. The move threatens to delay its conclusions until well into 2022 and slows down the prospect of criminal prosecutions. The inquiry team examining the 14 June 2017 disaster was hit by a spate of infections before Christmas, but its chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, 74, had planned to resume oral evidence sessions on Monday 11 January. Witnesses for Arconic, the company that made the combustible cladding panels which were the main cause of fire spread were due to be cross-examined. A total of 72 people died as a result of the fire at the west London council tower block. The inquiry said in a statement: “The increase in transmissibility of the new variant of coronavirus means there is a significant increase in the risk of infection facing anyone who travels to and works at the inquiry’s premises, notwithstanding the robustness of the arrangements in place. In the current circumstances it is unreasonable to ask witnesses and inquiry team staff to travel into a particularly high-risk area to attend the inquiry.” The inquiry, based in central London, had been operating in person but with minimal attendance. The three-strong inquiry panel, witnesses and lawyers for the inquiry were the only people at the premises, along with a support team. Bereaved people and survivors and their lawyers had been following proceedings on a public YouTube broadcast. The inquiry said it wanted to restart the inquiry in February with remote hearings using computer links. The bereaved and survivors have previously opposed that, saying it was important that executives working for the construction companies responsible for the refurbishment faced sometimes tough cross-examination from counsel to the inquiry in person. There were fears that witnesses giving evidence via computer link could be coached in their answers. “The panel recognises that the subject of remote hearings was fully explored with core participants last spring during the first 2020 lockdown, and that it was not in favour of that option,” the panel said. “However, the panel has decided it is better to have remote hearings than no hearings at all while the current restrictions are in place, and wishes to emphasise that this is a temporary measure to be used only for as long as it is absolutely necessary.” It said it was to distribute computer equipment to witnesses and test it before hearings restarted. “The inquiry hopes to start remote hearings as early as possible in February, and will write to core participants as soon as possible to confirm the resumption date and any other details, including how bereaved, survivor and resident core participants will be able to follow the proceedings remotely,” the inquiry said."
2021-01-06T06:28:55Z,uk-news,UK news,Light brigade: the Christmas holdouts keeping their decorations up,"In other years, the threat of bad luck if you fail to take your Christmas decorations down by Twelfth Night might have meant something. In 2021, the idea that things could get any worse seems blackly comic. And so it is that for some people, baubles, lights, and trees are staying in place this year. In cities, towns and villages across the country, a few doggedly cheerful celebrants of the season have decided to dispense with the practice of the last two centuries and embrace an older, medieval tradition â€“ which dictates that rather than ending in early January, Christmas celebrations should last until the next Christian holy day, Candlemas (2 February). Call it cheer for tiers.
The idea was raised on Tuesday by Michael Carter, senior properties historian at English Heritage, in his article for Catholic news magazine the Tablet announcing the organisationâ€™s endorsement of the extension. â€œThereâ€™s precious little joy in January at the best of times,â€� Carter argued. â€œThis year the accelerating spread of Covid â€¦ only compounds the misery.â€� You wouldnâ€™t want to miss the Candlemas deadline, though â€“ or, as 17th century clergyman and poet Robert Herrick warned, you might be visited by a goblin. In other words, if you keep your tinsel up and see Michael Gove on TV, you only have yourself to blame. While Carterâ€™s intervention earned him a spot on Radio 4â€™s Today programme, it turns out that plenty of others have had the same idea, with dozens of social media users suggesting they had similar plans.
Becci Wright, a unit manager in film and TV, told the Guardian that in her village of Osmotherley, North Yorkshire, Christmas lights went up early â€œin direct response to Covid-19â€�. â€œThere was an idea of lighting up the end of a very dark year for many,â€� she said. After Christmas, a coffee shop owner on the local Facebook page floated the idea of keeping lights up throughout January, and about 20 residents plan to do so. â€œLighting our way through the long, dark winter months will hopefully create a sense of optimism,â€� said Wright, who is participating herself. â€œThe lights serve as a reminder that we are here for each other.â€� Brigid Joughin, a GP in Newcastle, said she had insisted the tree stay up for the sake of her husband. â€œI have the luxury of being able to get out of the house for work but heâ€™s at home all day so itâ€™s nice to keep the house as cheerful as possible,â€� she said. In a â€œdark and miserable winter with nothing in our lives to look forward toâ€�, she added, an extension to the festivities seems reasonable. â€œThereâ€™s already lots of Christmas trees in the back lane and I just thought, â€˜Why is everybody rushing to do this now? Life isnâ€™t normal, so why pretend it is?â€�
Councils may not entirely agree, however, with many scheduling tree collection services for early to mid-January, and already bare-bones teams are likely to be unimpressed by the prospect of trees piling up on pavements in four weeksâ€™ time. Churches, though, have long been open-minded on the question, a Church of England spokesman said, noting that many routinely kept decorations until Candlemas. Among others, Chester, Leicester, Salisbury and Durham cathedrals are all maintaining some Christmas cheer through the rest of the month. So is the television presenter Amanda Holden, who claimed on Tuesday to be imitating the supposed approach taken by the Queen, as was the BBC Breakfast presenter Louise Minchin, who said her tree would be staying for â€œquite some timeâ€�.
Still, in normal circumstances, most of us would be surprised to see a Christmas tree in place after this week. Susannah Clark, a retired 68-year-old nurse from Milton Keynes, scoffs at such convention â€“ and has had hers up since December 2019. Her tree is artificial, negating the risk of needle shedding, but not of surprised relatives on Zoom calls. Once it had stayed to midsummer, Clark said, there didnâ€™t seem much point in removing it. â€œWhatâ€™s the point? Itâ€™s just up early!â€� Clark, who came out of retirement to help triage possible coronavirus cases by phone earlier in the pandemic, expects to leave her tree in place this year, too. â€œWe hadnâ€™t rationalised it as being to do with Covid, but weâ€™re both at home, and it cheers the place up â€“ anything that boosts your morale a bit.â€� Adam Adshead, a 56-year-old who lives in Billericay, has good reason to seek that kind of solace: he lost his sister in June, and his father, to coronavirus, two days before Christmas. And so he kept the lights on. â€œThis year, more than ever, we need cheering up, and leaving the lights on is a sign of hope for better things to come,â€� he said. â€œMaybe there are essential workers going past at night, and just maybe the sight of lights will bring a little joy to them.â€� Above all, though, Adshead has been thinking of his loved ones â€“ and like most people this Christmas, his cheer has a tinge of defiance. â€œThe lights are for them,â€� he said. â€œTo remember them, to honour them and to say that despite everything, life does go on.â€�"
2021-01-06T06:00:21Z,uk-news,UK news,Leak of November lockdown plan linked to 'surge in new infections',"The leak of plans for a November lockdown in England to the media approximately a week before restrictions came into force has been linked by researchers to a jump in Covid-19 cases caused by people rushing to socialise before the deadline. “There was a surge in new infections starting a couple of days before the lockdown – and running for about a week or so after the lockdown was implemented,” said the study’s lead author, Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia. The three-tier system, with varying degrees of restrictions, was introduced in England in mid-October. On Friday 30 October multiple outlets, including the Times, Daily Mail and Sun, reported that the government planned to announce a national lockdown the following Monday, prompting the launch of a leak inquiry. The lockdown eventually came into force on 5 November and ended on 2 December.
Using data procured from 315 local authorities, the researchers observed that case numbers were increasing up to about 24 October, after which they appeared to stabilise, even declining in tier 3 areas. However, over the “notice period” between the news becoming public and the start of lockdown, case numbers started to rise again until they reached a peak around 10 November. The observational study – which is still to be peer-reviewed – found that this boost in infections was largely seen in tier 1 and tier 2 areas, where there were more opportunities to socialise compared with in tier 3 regions. The surge was most notable in the 20 to 24 and 25 to 29 age groups, although there was an effect in all age groups up to 60, noted Hunter. “Those of us over 60 are boring old farts who stay home all the time,” he joked.
Using Google mobility data, the researchers noted an increase in visits to non-grocery retail and leisure venues just prior to the start of lockdown. The spike was not observed in tier 3 areas, where a key difference was that hospitality venues could only open if operating as a restaurant. This finding, combined with the atypical surge in infections in young adults, suggests there had been increased socialisation ahead of the lockdown. “I believe it probably almost certainly is,” said Hunter. “You can’t say that’s absolute proof, but I think it’s excellent strong supportive evidence.” “If that is the case, then … whoever leaked that indirectly would have been responsible for increased cases and, and almost certainly increased deaths.”
As December approached, infections in areas that were previously in tier 1 were pretty much at the same level as they were on 1 November. So, after about a month which largely included the lockdown, “we were back to square one”, Hunter said. Tier 2 regions did a little better – the infection rate was lower, but not by much. Tier 3 areas – which did not see a spike ahead of the lockdown – saw a dramatic decline, he added. However, in London, the south-east and east of England, cases started rising in the week before lockdown ended, which was later attributed to the fast-spreading variant discovered in Kent. “So that that surge towards the end was almost certainly … driven by the new variant,” added Hunter."
2021-01-06T06:00:20Z,uk-news,UK news,Fears Highlands are heading for spate of winter redundancies,"The Highlands are heading for further winter redundancies as local tourism businesses shed jobs during the latest wave of coronavirus, compounding the hollowing out of the essential migrant workforce caused by Brexit, campaigners have warned. Unions are reporting an increase in people being sacked rather than furloughed, with many of those laid off being EU nationals who are now forced to leave Scotland with no guarantee they can return after Brexit. With European workers fundamental to the Highland economy and society, this is likely to compound what analysts have described as the demographic timebomb facing the region. The Scottish Tourism Workers League is calling for the Holyrood government to make business grants conditional on job retention after hearing “daily” from workers who have lost their jobs. Jon Heggie, the organiser of the league, said: “At the beginning of lockdown, workers across Scotland won security by coming together and demanding that their bosses use the furlough scheme. With bosses across the tourism industry – in sectors like hospitality, heritage and tour guiding – sacking and evicting workers instead of furloughing them, we’re now supporting a new wave of workers to do the same. “Workers in this industry stick together. We started organising with workers in Oban and Inverness-shire, and now we’re hearing from people across Scotland. Recently, there’s been a marked increase in contact from workers from EU countries as we approach Brexit. Tourism workers are fundamental to Scotland’s future, and deserve better.” The league was set up in the summer by tourism workers to support each other in disputes over employment and accommodation. Those in the Highlands and Islands were particularly vulnerable: when the Coylumbridge hotel in Aviemore sacked at least 12 staff in March, making them homeless from tied accommodation just after the first lockdown was imposed, many did not realise they had rights as private tenants. The hotel later blamed the sacking and eviction notices on an “administrative error”. Recent analysis by Highlands and Islands Enterprise has found unemployment increasing faster across the region than the rest of Scotland – 118% compared with the Scottish figure of 95% – and almost trebling among young people. Previous research for the Federation of Small Businesses found 45% of tourism and leisure employers in the Highlands had EU staff in their workforce, compared with 20% for the whole of the UK. While some businesses have argued that current layoffs are seasonal, 91% of non-UK EU nationals employed by businesses in the region are permanent staff. Niall McLean, a councillor for Fort William and Ardnamurchan, said he was saddened by the job losses, particularly as younger migrant workers are essential to sustaining the local population. “Our tourist industry could have a very bright future due to the worldwide love of Scotland, our landscape and people. Scotland needs to be in a position to invest in our offerings and provide long-term job security in the sector. And with a large number of young people choosing to work in the industry, the tourist sector is key to the survival of our communities”. In early December there was a local outcry when the Fisher’s hotel in Pitlochry made about 20 staff, most of them from EU or EEA countries, redundant and asked them to leave their accommodation. Fionn MacCumhaill, the managing director of the Castle Hotel Group, which owns Fisher’s, said he was “a generous employer”, but had let go 17 part-time seasonal workers after being denied government grants because supporting the staff through the furlough scheme was unsustainable.
Although immediate eviction notices were withdrawn after union intervention, many have since returned home to Poland, Spain, the Czech Republic and Hungary, with no guarantee they can return after 31 December. Bryan Simpson, an organiser for Unite Hospitality, said this case was far from unique. “Hundreds of migrant workers have been left in the lurch by xenophobic immigration policies aided and abetted by the heartless actions of unscrupulous employers … As the region most reliant on hospitality and migrant workers, the Highlands can ill afford a situation where those same workers are put off or even legally prevented from returning due to the actions of multinational hospitality employers.” John Swinney, the local MSP and Scotland’s deputy first minister, said there was significant government support in place to ensure businesses could continue to employ their staff. “It is also the case that the majority of the affected workers are from countries within the European Union. Without a job or a place to stay, they have been forced to return to their home country. As a result of the end of freedom of movement, it may well be the case that – through no fault of their own – they will be unable to return to Scotland.” Martin Kovács: ‘Scotland really does rely on people like me’
Martin Kovács came from Hungary to Scotland to work in tourism in 2018. “This country was perfect for me. I came to love the people, the atmosphere, and the big cities like Glasgow and Edinburgh,” he says. He started work as a barman at the Fisher’s hotel in Pitlochry in October, but was “absolutely shocked” to receive his redundancy notice, and to be told to leave his staff accommodation earlier this month. “The hotel treated their staff well, so this came out of the blue, in the middle of a pandemic and with Brexit and Christmas not far away,” he says. “We were given 12 days to vacate our staff accommodation after which we would be evicted. The company refused to re-furlough us, claiming they couldn’t afford the 5% employer contributions.” Without savings, Kovács worried about how he would survive but, following pressure from Unite, he has been able to remain in his digs for now, although he has been told that there is no prospect of the hotel reinstating him. Since then, he has applied for the EU settlement scheme, and universal credit, which will tide him over as he looks for work. With a university degree and certificates in tourism and hospitality, he says he has been struck by how much Scotland relies on workers like him. “When I got my first job in a hotel in Loch Lomond, I was asking why so many staff were from the EU. Scotland really does rely on people like me, and we bring something positive to the country.”"
2021-01-05T17:48:27Z,uk-news,UK news,"Man viewed extreme Isis content before Reading knife attack, court hears","A man who stabbed three people to death in a minute in an alleged terrorist rampage had viewed material about a notorious Isis killer, a court has heard. Khairi Saadallah murdered three men in a park in Reading on 20 June as they enjoyed a summer’s evening. A hearing at the Old Bailey to determine if the attacks were terrorist acts and therefore subject to a higher sentence, was told that Saadallah viewed extremist material in the days before the attack and had a longstanding interest in extremism. It also heard that Saadallah, 26, bought the knife from a supermarket the day before the stabbing spree in which he stabbed three people to death, wounded three others, and shouted: “Allahu Akbar”. He has already admitted to three murders and three attempted murders at an earlier hearing. The hearing was told Saadallah had in 2019 accessed material on his mobile phone about Mohammed Emwazi , the Isis propagandist seen in videos taunting victims before killing them, and two days before the attack had accessed a website with the flag associated with Isis, which had staged numerous attacks against western targets. The prosecutor, Alison Morgan QC, said Saadallah, who was from Libya, believed the murders were an act of holy war. His victims were three men enjoying a summer evening in Forbury Gardens, Reading, during the first national lockdown. They were James Furlong, 36, a history teacher; David Wails, 49, a scientist; and an American pharmaceutical worker Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39. The men died after being stabbed by Saadallah as they sat on the grass at about 7pm. Ritchie-Bennett and Furlong died after single wounds to their necks. Wails was stabbed once in the back. Saadallah also stabbed and wounded their friend Stephen Young and two other men, Patrick Edwards and Nishit Nisudan, who were sat nearby. Morgan told the hearing: “In less than a minute, shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’, the defendant carried out a lethal attack with a knife, killing all three men before they had a chance to respond and try to defend themselves. “Within the same minute, the defendant went on to attack others nearby, stabbing three more people … The defendant was ruthlessly efficient in his actions. The prosecution’s case is that the attack perpetrated by the defendant was carefully planned and executed with determination and precision. “The defendant believed that in carrying out this attack he was acting in pursuit of his extreme ideology, an ideology he appears to have held for some time. He believed that in killing as many people as possible that day he was performing an act of religious jihad.” Morgan said Saadallah had carried out reconnaissance of the park and had been pictured in Libya handling firearms, and had come to Britain in 2012 after having been part of a militia opposing the regime of Muammar Gaddafi. In Britain, Saadallah was refused asylum and started offending, carrying out thefts and assaults, for which he was jailed. He was assessed as having an emotionally unstable and antisocial personality disorder, and in jail was seen as “impressionable and volatile” and keen to associate with a known extremist preacher Omar Brooks in about 2017. Morgan said this showed Saadallah, three years before the attack, was still interested in the extremism he had been exposed to in the chaos of Libya. On 5 June, two weeks before his stabbing rampage, he was released from jail and in the days preceding the attack made a series of internet searches. These included whether coronavirus was “a sign of the end of the world”, military activity in Libya, body bags, the park where the attacks happened, and how to disappear with magic – believed to be linked to witchcraft. He also accessed the website with the flag linked to Isis and the hearing heard that his probation officer became concerned about him, but when a crisis team visited him on 19 June he refused to open the door. That day he also went to a Morrison’s supermarket and bought the knife he used to stab six people. The hearing before a judge continues."
2021-01-05T13:15:39Z,uk-news,UK news,Shukri Abdi: family of refugee schoolgirl who drowned sues police,"The family of a 12-year-old refugee schoolgirl who drowned in a river is suing the police force which investigated her death, claiming institutional racism. The body of Shukri Abdi, who first came to the UK in January 2017, was found in the River Irwell in Bury, Greater Manchester, on 27 June 2019. A group of children were with her at the river in the period before she died. They can be referred to only as Child One, Child Two, Child Three and Child Four. In December 2020 a coroner concluded that Shukri’s death by drowning was an accident. Joanne Kearsley, senior coroner for Manchester North, concluded that there was no evidence that a child known as Child One had any intention to kill Shukri. She also rejected claims that anyone had pushed Shukri into the water. However, she said that Child One should have recognised the risk of death to Shukri once they were in deep water and Shukri was relying on her to stay afloat. She rejected claims that Child One had not led Shukri into deep water. “I am satisfied that Child One’s breach of duty caused or made a significant contribution to Shukri’s death,” she said. Solicitors have lodged a civil action for breach of the Human Rights Act against Greater Manchester police on behalf of Shukri’s mother, Zamzam Arab Ture. The legal action claims that there were a number of failures in GMP’s investigation into Shukri’s drowning including a failure to speak to all four children who were at the river with Shukri on the day of the incident. Two were spoken to on the day and the other two spoken to subsequently.
The lawyers argue that police should have investigated more thoroughly before deciding the drowning was an accident because the incident involved a child who could not swim, who had never been to a river before, had for the first time in her life not come home from school and was with children she had never before been with after school. They add that institutional racism played a part in the way the case was investigated because Shukri came from a family of black, Muslim refugees. An Independent Office for Police Conduct investigation into GMP – following a complaint from Ture alleging that officers failed to conduct an effective investigation and prematurely concluded that Shukri’s death was not suspicious – said it did not find evidence to indicate Shukri’s family were treated less favourably because of their ethnic background. The force is currently under fire after it was placed in special measures by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services. Inspectors found that the force had failed to record 80,000 crimes in 12 months and was providing a “poor service” to many victims of crime. Attiq Malik, the solicitor representing Shukri’s family, said: “The same criticisms that Shukri’s family raised about the GMP’s treatment of them and the investigation into her death resonate with the findings of the inspectorate of GMP’s conduct across the board.” Maz Saleem, of the Justice4Shukri campaign, said: “This is an important development in the fight for justice for Shukri Abdi. The family has maintained the firm position that they have been unfairly treated by GMP from the outset due to their status as a refugee family.” A GMP spokesperson said: “The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) carried out an independent investigation and reviewed GMP’s response following the death of Shukri Abdi. “The IOPC concluded their investigation and no learning was identified for GMP. Following the inquest, a civil claim has been started and it would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time. “Our sincere thoughts remain with Shukri’s loved ones and those affected by her death.”"

2021-01-04T22:12:37Z,uk-news,UK news,NHS needs to deliver at least 2m jabs a week to fulfil government target,"The NHS will have to start delivering at least 2m jabs a week from next week if it is to fulfil the government’s plan to vaccinate everyone in the four highest-priority groups by mid-February. The four groups the prime minister said will have a first dose amount to 13.9 million people in England, according to Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister. Boris Johnson’s target implies a sharp increase in the rate of vaccination, with the bulk of the burden likely to fall to GPs who said on Monday that staffing could limit their ability to ratchet up delivery. The four groups are everyone aged over 70, plus close to 3 million health and social care workers, the clinically extremely vulnerable and around 400,000 care home residents. GPs have already been offered a £10 bonus for every care home resident they vaccinate in January. Around a million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine have been administered in the last month and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has said 530,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab were available to the NHS on Monday. Sir John Bell, the regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, has said a further 450,000 doses are due this week. After those doses, 11.9m more jabs are to be delivered in the following five to six weeks, depending on how the government defines mid-February. That implies an average speed of between 2m and 2.4m doses per week. Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca’s chief executive said on 30 December his company would be able to provide 2m doses a week, after delivering one million a week for the first fortnight of the rollout. Doctors said the AstraZeneca vaccine is quicker to deliver and can also be deployed more easily to different locations because it only needs to be kept at fridge temperature, unlike Pfizer’s which must be kept at -70C. “As long as we have the vaccines we can give it to them in a matter of days so [delivery] is primarily down to the supply,” said Dr Richard Vautrey, chair of the British Medical Association’s GP committee. “Within weeks we should have supplies to get the first dose into all care home residents.”
However, it is the government’s policy to provide recipients with just the first dose of the jabs, with a gap of 12 weeks until the second dose, rather than the two to three weeks that the manufacturers have recommended. The PM said this would remove “huge numbers of people from the path of the virus, and of course that will enable us to lift many of the restrictions”. The extent to which they will continue to be potential virus carriers is less certain. Care home operators said on Monday they were unlikely to lift restrictions on visiting as soon as the vaccinations were complete in order to find out more about how they affect infection spread. “It feels right to be cautious about what vaccination will mean in relation to homes opening up in a big way,” said Vic Rayner, executive director of the National Care Forum, which represents not-for-profit care operators."
2021-01-04T19:25:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Scottish MP Margaret Ferrier arrested over alleged Covid rule breach,"The suspended Scottish National party MP Margaret Ferrier has been arrested by police and charged with breaching coronavirus restrictions. Police Scotland said Ferrier, 60, had been charged “in connection with alleged culpable and reckless conduct” for allegedly failing to observe the regulations limiting travel and social contact. The MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West was suspended by the SNP in October after she admitted travelling to London and attending debates in the Commons despite taking a Covid-19 test. After being told her test was positive, Ferrier then travelled home by train from London via Glasgow, and later acknowledged visiting several businesses in Rutherglen on the day she took the test. The Metropolitan police investigated the incident but concluded no criminal offence had taken place under the laws in force on the day she travelled to London. Legal controls in England came into effect several days later, but the Met passed its files to police in Scotland. In a brief statement, Police Scotland said: “We can confirm that officers today arrested and charged a 60-year-old woman in connection with alleged culpable and reckless conduct. “This follows a thorough investigation by Police Scotland into an alleged breach of coronavirus regulations between 26 and 29 September 2020. A report will be sent to the procurator fiscal and we are unable to comment further.” Ferrier apologised profusely after her journeys came to light, and said she took full responsibility for her decisions. “Despite feeling well, I should have self-isolated while waiting for my test result, and I deeply regret my actions,” she said. Police Scotland filed a preliminary report to the Crown Office, Scotland’s prosecution service, in mid-November and continued the investigation under its direction. The SNP suspended its review of Ferrier’s membership pending the police investigation. Nevertheless, Ferrier has been sitting as an independent MP in the Commons since 1 October after the party withdrew the whip from her."
2021-01-04T18:47:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Husband from one of UK's first married couples with Down's syndrome dies of Covid,"The husband from one of the UK’s first couples with Down’s syndrome to marry has died from Covid-19, it has emerged. Tommy Pilling, 62, from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, who had been treated in three different hospitals since early December with a chest infection, died on New Year’s Day. He and his wife Maryanne, 49, married 25 years ago. Family members said she was “completely devastated”. Her sister Lindi Newman, 33, described him as “one of a kind”. She said Pilling and her sister had never been apart for more than a few hours after her mother, Linda Martin, 70, unofficially adopted him and made him part of their family.
“She doesn’t remember a life before Tommy,” Newman said of her sister. “The day she met him, she had the biggest smile on her face and she couldn’t stop talking about him.” Pilling, who had dementia, had been shielding for 10 months, but then was hospitalised with a chest infection on 1 December which led to the couple being separated for the first time. He died on 1 January, after testing positive for coronavirus on 17 December. Maryanne’s mother Linda said: “Tommy has left a vast hole in our lives that nobody will ever fill. “I considered him as my son and I’ve never regretted a single moment of the three decades he was in my care.” She praised the NHS staff who nursed him. “I cannot thank the staff enough, their care and compassion was outstanding – especially during these dreadful times,” she said. “They were all rushed off their feet but still made time to inform me daily regarding his condition.” • The headline on this article was amended on 8 January 2021 in line with Guardian style guidance."

What does tier 4 mean? Under tier 4 restrictions, non-essential shops, hairdressers, and leisure and entertainment venues must close, with a new “stay at home” message introduced. People who need to travel for education or childcare are exempt, and exercise is unlimited. Where people cannot work from home, they will still be able to travel to work. Under the measures, households are not allowed to mix, but one person is allowed to meet with one other person outside in a public space. Support bubbles and those meeting for childcare are exempt. Those who are deemed clinically extremely vulnerable should not go to work and should limit time outside of their homes. Tier 4 residents must not stay overnight away from home, and cannot travel abroad. What can I do in each tier? People in all tiers are advised to stay local, and if you travel, your restrictions follow you. For example, if you live in a tier 3 area, you must continue to follow tier 3 rules even when you travel to a tier 1 or tier 2 area. You can find out which tier you live in here.

2021-01-03T16:19:08Z,uk-news,UK news,"'Step up' and face Grenfell inquiry, minister tells cladding firm bosses","The UK government has demanded that executives who supplied combustible cladding to Grenfell Tower “step up to the plate” after their refusal to give evidence to the public inquiry into the disaster provoked anger among the bereaved and survivors. On Sunday, Stephen Greenhalgh, the building safety minister, escalated a legal and diplomatic dispute over the position taken by three current and former executives at the French division of the US company Arconic. He told them to stop hiding behind an arcane French law. Arconic made the polyethylene-filled aluminium composite panels that were the main cause of the spread of the fire, which killed 72 people. The witnesses, based in France and Germany, are wanted by the inquiry to account for their role in manufacturing, testing and marketing the cladding, which is now banned on high rise homes in the UK. The former executives Claude Wehrle and Peter Froehlich, alongside Gwenaëlle Derrendinger, a current employee, are citing the rarely used 53-year-old French blocking statute and are refusing to attend six days of cross-examination due this month. Two UK-based Arconic witnesses will give evidence. In 2009, Wehrle shared with Arconic colleagues images of a burning tower fitted with similar panels to those it sold to Grenfell “to show you how dangerous PE [polyethylene] can be when it comes to architecture”. In 2015, he emailed colleagues: “PE is dangerous on facades, and everything should be transferred to fire-resistant as a matter of urgency.” Greenhalgh spoke out on Twitter after a months-long deadlock in which the witnesses have resisted calls by the inquiry to “do the right thing” and ignored warnings that non-attendance runs the risk of “adverse inference and criticism”. The inquiry has been communicating directly with the French government via the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to try to get them to appear. Greenhalgh tweeted: “Time for these ⁦@arconic⁩ executives to step up to the plate + appear before the #GrenfellTower Inquiry rather than hide behind the 1968 French Blocking Statute.” In November, the inquiry said it would “empty-chair” the trio if they did not attend. It would set out email evidence relating to their actions and frame the questions they needed to answer. A fourth Arconic executive, Claude Schmidt, has said he will only give evidence if the inquiry accepts “certain conditions”, which have not been made public. The inquiry said last month they were largely unacceptable. Schmidt still works for Arconic. Grenfell United, the survivors and families group, has said “there is no way Arconic staff should be dictating terms about what they are asked or not asked”. The row over the witnesses’ appearance has been rumbling since before November, when the inquiry publicly revealed their refusal. Counsel to the inquiry, Richard Millett QC, said “neither Arconic nor any of those witnesses has provided any evidence that there is a real risk of prosecution under the French blocking statute”. Last month, the bereaved and survivors mounted a protest outside the French embassy in London, and the French government said it did not believe the blocking statute applies. Arconic Architectural Products (AAP) said it “continues to fully cooperate with the inquiry”. “The individuals who have declined to participate … have taken the advice of separate counsel and AAP does not have any influence on those decisions,” a spokesperson said. “The three witnesses who are represented by the company’s counsel are prepared to provide evidence, including Claude Schmidt.” The inquiry is due to resume on 11 January."
2021-01-03T14:56:19Z,uk-news,UK news,Derbyshire police pan 'stupid' hikers for defying Covid rules and getting stuck in snow,"First they used drones to shame people walking their dogs in the Peak District during the first lockdown. Then they dyed a quarry pool black to make its toxic blue waters less inviting to furloughed swimmers. Now Derbyshire police have turned their attention to “stupid” hikers who ignored a snowy weather forecast and got stuck on one of county’s highest passes this weekend. The force’s rural crime team lambasted the owners of more than 200 cars who drove to the top of Snake Pass, a trans-Pennine road between Sheffield and Manchester on Saturday, and then expected the police to rescue them with their “magical snowmobiles”. “We’ll deal with what we can, but our underpants aren’t on the outside and we can only knock so much common sense back into society,” the team said on its Facebook page. The incident came after parts of northern England, the Midlands and Wales awoke to snow this weekend. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for ice in eastern Scotland and the north-east on Sunday and Monday. It also forecast some sleet or snow on higher hills on Sunday evening.
Police in Wales said officers had turned away people who wanted to walk up Snowdon in breach of stay-at-home rules, including some from Milton Keynes and London. Wales is at alert level four, meaning non-essential travel is banned and exercise must start and finish at home. Derbyshire is in English tier 4, meaning people must stay at home and not leave their area, other than for legally permitted reasons. So is Greater Manchester. Sheffield, on the eastern end of Snake Pass, is in tier 3, where residents are told not travel into a tier 4 area. Derbyshire police said many of those parked on the top of the pass were not only ill-equipped for the weather, but also ignoring government advice to exercise within their own tiers. “It seems like many didn’t have the common sense to check the forecast, dress themselves suitably, check they had a capable vehicle and/or driving skills, never mind the fact that they perhaps shouldn’t have been stretching the advice given by the government so as not to overburden our NHS,” the rural crime team wrote. “Never mind, though. Just ring the police and expect them to come along with their magical snowmobiles. Of course, with our superpowers we can simultaneously deal with similar situations in the Goyt Valley, Mam Nick, Curbar Gap and others. And we’re Covid-proof, didn’t you know? Joking aside, please don’t be stupid. It shouldn’t need a greater explanation than that.” PC Andy Shaw said the force had to help rescue about 60 cars that become trapped in the Peak District on Saturday. Snow on the Snake Pass “largely cleared itself”, he said, with most drivers getting into trouble on the Cat and Fiddle Hill between Macclesfield and Buxton, and Long Hill between Buxton and Whaley Bridge. “Most drivers I spoke to were not from Derbyshire,” he said.
The mountain rescue team from Glossop, on the Manchester side of Snake Pass, was called out on Saturday afternoon to help two women who had got lost on Bleaklow, a suitably desolate section of moorland. “Due to challenging conditions and fading light, the pair became disoriented and called for our assistance,” the rescuers said. The Glossop team put out a plea in November to “Instagram hikers” who had been going up to Bleaklow and the nearby Higher Shelf Stones to take selfies. The site contains large sections of a US military plane, a B-29 that plunged into a ridge in fog in 1948, killing the 13 men on board. They also asked people to tell them if they had managed to make their own way to safety after calling for assistance. The request, however, appears to have fallen on deaf ears. The team’s first callout of 2021 came on New Year’s Day, when two men rang for help at 9.30pm after getting lost on Bleaklow on a visit to the B-29 crash site. “When team members reached Snake Summit, they found a vehicle with two male occupants in, which turned out to be the two that had reported themselves lost!” the Glossop team wrote. In Snowdonia, North Wales police said they had stopped and turned away several individuals who wanted to walk up Snowdon. “Many were from the north Wales area. However, some have travelled up from London and Milton Keynes. Level 4 restrictions means only essential travel,” the force tweeted. Officers also towed away a car parked on Pen y Pass, near Llanberis, after police said it had been parked unsafely on a bend in snowy conditions."
2021-01-03T12:00:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Youth organisations in England face wholesale closure,"England faces a wholesale closure of youth organisations, leaving a generation of vulnerable young people without life-changing support, according to research. Almost two-thirds of youth organisations with incomes under £250,000 say they are at risk of closure, with 31% saying they might have to shut in the next six months. The forced withdrawal of support officially recognised as “essential” comes at a time when the pandemic has left more than 1.5 million vulnerable young people in critical need of help, the research by the charity UK Youth found.
The responses from 1,759 youth organisations in England revealed that 58% are operating at a reduced level, with a further 20% temporarily closed or preparing to permanently close. The predicted closures come against a backdrop of years of chronic underfunding that has already forced at least 763 youth centres to shut since 2012. A further round of major cuts to local authority youth services is expected in the near future. “There are 1.6 million children from a vulnerable family background for whom support is either patchy or non-existent. Just over half of these children are ‘invisible’ to services,” said Anna Alcock, the head of engagement and advocacy at UK Youth. “Youth work could be the only answer to helping these children; a preventative service that provides support before problems arise.” The preliminary data, which will be at the centre of a more in-depth report published later this year, is in line with recent research by the National Youth Agency (NYA) which found many youth charities are “running on empty”. “Youth services simply do not have the capacity or enough funding to meet young people’s vastly increased needs,” said the NYA’s chief executive, Leigh Middleton. “They have depleted reserves and incomes slashed by half or more. “We are calling for greater investment in frontline youth services right now, sustained throughout any lockdown and regional tier emergency measures.” Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England, said the research was “shocking but sadly, not surprising”. “A major funder said to me recently that he had wanted to substantially invest in youth provision but when he had sought applications, he found most of the services he wanted to support had already closed down,” she said. Areas suffering the most significant cuts in spending on young people have recorded larger increases in knife crime and drug-related crimes, said Longfield. “Youth services are the last line of defence for vulnerable children,” she said. “If these children have a bad time at home and don’t have the structure of school, for whatever reason, and then you take away youth services too, they’re completely on their own, with nothing protecting them from physical abuse, self-harm and drug use, being exploited and groomed.” Tom Madders, the director of campaigns at YoungMinds, said: “For lots of young people, youth clubs are a lifeline. Without early support for their mental health, young people’s needs often escalate, sometimes resulting in crisis and more acute intervention.” Just over £34m of the emergency £750m coronavirus fund for charities was directed to children and youth charities. The government’s £500m youth investment fund to help transform and increase capacity of the youth sector, confirmed in the Conservative manifesto in December 2019 and due to start in April 2020, has yet to be spent. In addition, the government has delayed its review of the statutory duty for local authorities to secure local youth services until summer 2021 and has suspended reporting by local authorities on funding of youth services until 2022. Matthew Hussey, the public affairs manager of the Children’s Society, said another missed opportunity was the chancellor’s spending review in December. “It was a chance to place children’s services, which include council-led support for young people like youth work, on a sustainable footing and give councils the resources they need to rebuild the support so needed by children and young people,” he said. A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the impact that the coronavirus pandemic has had on young people, which is why we recently announced a £16.5m fund for the youth sector and have provided more than £60m to children’s and youth organisations as part of a wider multibillion-pound support package for charities.” But the NYA said that referring to a range of different funding pots and commitments to youth work “simply disguises the paucity of funding specific to the youth sector” and the limited ways funding can be used: the £16.5m, for example, can only be claimed against revenue/losses from the second national lockdown”. Middleton said: “The government response confuses the picture by referencing general funding ‘for young people’.” Collapse of youth services There has been a 71% cut in spending on children and youth services across England in less than a decade. Over the same period, local authority spending on crisis intervention services for children and young people has risen from £5.6bn to £7.2bn – a 29% increase. At the start of the decade, crisis intervention accounted for 58% of local authority spending on children and young people’s services. This had risen to 78% by 2018 to 2019. There is a north-south divide: between 2010-11 and 2018-19, spending in the north of England fell three times as fast as in the south: -9% compared with -3%."
2021-01-03T09:45:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Women fight to help families torn apart by ‘racist’ deportation policy,"The Home Office is refusing to review the forced separation of black British families caught up in the criminal justice system, a practice that campaigners say is systemically racist and legitimises child cruelty. Under a 13-year-old law, individuals who are not British citizens and receive a prison sentence of more than 12 months are automatically targeted for deportation. This policy has seen hundreds of people, mainly men, put on charter flights to Jamaica, leaving their British children behind in the UK. Despite evidence of significant harm to children, the Home Office has ruled out officially investigating the impact on minors and families when considering deporting a parent. Now a group of mothers, wives, partners, sisters and aunts, including members and descendants of the Windrush generation, has been formed to campaign for the effect on children to be formally assessed in cases of mandatory repatriation. A statement from Families for Justice, submitted to the Home Office before the most recent deportation flight to Jamaica in December, says: “Our children have been professionally neglected and inexplicably made to feel unwelcome in the country we call home. Our children’s British birthrights have been disregarded. We are saddened about the systematic disregard for the mental health of our children and the unassessed separation they are put through.” By the wording of the 2007 UK Borders Act, families wanting to overturn a deportation order need to demonstrate that the impact of separation on a child would be “unduly harsh”. The Home Office interprets this to mean “excessively cruel” – a threshold campaigners say is too high. The negative impact of the policy was highlighted in the context of the death of 14-year-old David, a pseudonym, who was hunted down and knifed in a gang attack in 2019. His father had been deported to Jamaica a decade earlier, having been caught selling drugs after losing his job because he did not have a national insurance number. Before David’s murder, his teenage sister had written to the Home Office saying their father’s deportation had “caused catastrophic heartbreak” to the family but that it was David who had needed him most. Although the group contains Windrush survivors, when it wrote to the Home Office minister Kevin Foster on Windrush day last June to complain about “this law tearing apart British families and communities”, it did not receive a response. Bella Sankey, director of the campaign group Detention Action, said: “The cruelty of separating children from loving parents, without hearing their views and carefully assessing their needs, is abundantly clear. Priti Patel talks constantly of protecting the British public: why are these children not included in her efforts?” Testimony gathered by the Observer reveals the policy’s impact. Sammy’s father, Chris, was deported to Jamaica last year for a non-violent criminal offence. The 17-year-old found out the day before, when she arrived home from school and her mother told her to quickly pack a bag to take to the detention centre. Sammy was given five minutes to say goodbye. “I felt numb and I still do. It feels like he’s died, really,” she said. “I wish people would imagine what it must be like for him. He’s all alone with nobody around. He can’t even give us a hug or pick us up from school.” Sammy says she never had the opportunity to tell the court how his deportation would affect her. Another member of the group, Freya Roberts, described the plight of her twin brothers, who are facing deportation to different countries, despite being born in London. Darrell Roberts, 24, has been issued with a Home Office deportation notice that proposes to send him to the Dominican Republic following a prison sentence – although the family believe that the notice probably meant to cite Dominica, their father’s home country. His twin brother, Darren, has been warned he faces deportation to Grenada, their mother’s home country. Freya Roberts, a 20-year-old broadcast and journalism student, said: “This has proven to me the continued systemic racism not only from the government’s immigration policies, but also the local councils, mental health services and other statutory services within the UK who have failed my brothers and many people like them.” The brothers were taken into care aged 13 after the deaths from cancer of their mother and then the uncle who had looked after them when she died. “The council then failed in supporting my brothers at regularising their immigration status or even informing them of their precarious situation and the seriousness of it. They failed my brothers in not making them aware of their rights as British people, and as descendants of Windrush,” said Roberts. The Home Office said: “Foreign dangerous criminals who violate our laws and abuse our hospitality have no place in our country. The UK only ever returns those who the Home Office and, where applicable, the courts are satisfied do not need our protection and have no legal basis to remain. In December, the courts once again considered our approach to removals and the impact on children, and found it to be lawful.”"
2021-01-03T06:00:06Z,uk-news,UK news,Liverpool's acting mayor calls for national coronavirus lockdown,"The acting mayor of Liverpool has called for a national lockdown amid rising numbers of Covid-19 cases in the UK. Wendy Simon and the city council’s cabinet say the speed of the rise in coronavirus cases and a new more transmissible variant mean action is needed to save lives and stop hospitals being overwhelmed. She said the number of infections had reached “alarming levels”. Simon took over from fellow Labour councillor Joe Anderson in December after he was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation. He has since been bailed. It is believed the new coronavirus strain, which was first identified in south-east England, has been spreading north. It is thought to have led to the surge in infections seen in December.
Cases in Liverpool have almost trebled in the last two weeks to 350 per 100,000, despite the city leading on the national pilot for community testing. As a result of an initially positive trial, it was the first city to be taken out of tier 3 and put into tier 2. A statement by Simon and the council’s cabinet member for public health, Paul Brant, said: “We need the government to listen to those at the frontline, both in our hospitals and frontline services. “Yes, there will be pain for our retail and hospitality sectors, but they want long-term security and a strong recovery and a lockdown provides both. “An additional package of welfare and economic support will also be needed, especially to protect the most vulnerable.” The statement added: “London’s rates are a huge cause for concern and we will soon see those rates here and across the rest of the country. “The country is currently facing a catastrophe that will undo much of what has been achieved if we do not act as one.” A Department for Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: “We will not hesitate to take actions necessary to protect local communities.”"
2021-01-02T12:55:45Z,uk-news,UK news,Battle for Brixton's soul as billionaire Texan DJ plans 20-storey tower block,"The outcome of the fight may help shape London’s future skyline. In one corner is a Texan millionaire DJ and property developer who has put forward plans for a 20-storey office block in Brixton, next to a conservation area and the district’s famous Electric Avenue. Taylor McWilliams’s property company Hondo, which owns most of Brixton market, claims the proposal will “deliver” 2,000 jobs in the area and generate £2.8m every year for the local economy. In the other corner is a group of residents whose fierce opposition has been joined by Historic England and the Victorian Society, which this month wrote to the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, saying the proposal no longer had merit in a post-Covid future where more people would be working from home. McWilliams, a member of the DJ collective Housekeeping, first attracted local anger when Hondo served notice on a popular small shop, Nour Cash & Carry. But, following a social media campaign called Save Nour – backed by celebrities including rock singer Skin from Skunk Anansie, – the shop will stay, albeit moved to a new site nearby. Now McWilliams find himself facing further local censure after his plans for the tower were approved last month by Lambeth council despite almost 8,000 people signing an online petition opposing it. The Save Nour group wants the mayor to intervene, a move backed by the Victorian Society. “This area of Brixton has avoided the intensive development which has blighted many of London’s historic urban centres,” said Olivia Stockdale, conservation adviser for the society. “It therefore retains its character as a predominantly Victorian town centre. “The plans to construct a building of 20 storeys next to this conservation area demonstrates a total failure to understand and respond to the context of the area.
“While buildings of this height may be appropriate elsewhere in London, this is clearly not a location where this applies. The proposed development would overshadow the surrounding buildings, including the historic Electric Avenue which, when built in the 1880s, was the first market street lit by electric lights.” There were reports that the development had already been approved by the mayor. An email was circulated that appeared to confirm Khan had given the go-ahead. But this was later attributed to an administrative error. In response to locals’ concerns, Hondo told the Observer that it was setting up a community liaison group “to identify and map how the local community can engage with this project, including engagement through the community space”. It claimed that the proposal had received support from more than 1,000 residents, predominantly from the local area, and a large percentage of current Brixton market traders. Joe O’Donnell, Victorian Society director, called on Khan to consider whether London needed more office space. “This is an opportunity to respond to what is wanted by the local community. If a huge office tower block was ever really needed or viable in Brixton, it’s commercial future seems now seems doubtful as it is unclear whether London will ever return to previous levels of office demand in a post Covid-19 world of home working. We have sent our objection to the mayor to inform his decision.” Hondo said there was a “serious need for office and commercial space, especially in Brixton”. The company said in a statement: “Commercial space is at a premium, and Hondo feel we are best placed to address that. Despite employment rising at twice the rate as in Lambeth, in Brixton vacancy rates are virtually at zero. Studies have been undertaken by Savills which reflect that the post-Covid situation for office space will look very similar to the pre-Covid situation.”
O’Donnell said that if the plan were to go ahead it would set a precedent, opening up the area, and potentially other sites across the capital, for further high-rise developments. “Many of the largely Victorian town centres of urban London are already blighted by massive development which has radically altered their character, for example Lewisham or Stratford. This character is becoming increasingly rare, and this is why we argue the conservation area be spared it.” However, Hondo stressed that the new development would do justice to the area. “The Pope’s Road development will be a landmark building and the design is of the highest quality, led by world leading designer Sir David Adjaye, who has drawn inspiration from architecture in Brixton,” the company said. “Our proposal takes direct inspiration from the existing markets and aims to extend and implement this unique urban typology. “A thorough research into the character and history of Brixton from both an architectural and a cultural point of view allowed us to propose a scheme which is at the same time innovative and contextual.”"
2021-01-02T12:07:49Z,uk-news,UK news,"Ten-metre hole in Kent lorry park 'not a sinkhole', officials say","A 10-metre hole discovered beneath a runway at an airport in Kent being used as a makeshift lorry park is to be filled with concrete after it was initially reported as a possible sinkhole. Reports emerged on New Year’s Eve suggesting that the hole may have been caused by water erosion, but a director of the company that owns Manston airport, in Thanet, said he believed it was man-made. Officials later confirmed it was not a sinkhole. Tony Freudmann, from owners RiverOak Strategic Partners, who visited the site on Friday, told Kent Online: “I think it has been dug out for some reason in the past and then been capped. Contrary to some reports, it is not on the main runway of the airport, but is on an old taxi runway adjacent.” He added: “I’m sure any restoration will be done in close collaboration with the Environment Agency because it is known there is a water aquifer under the runway nearby.” Officials from the Environment Agency and Kent county council have been on site to assess the cause of the hole, which was first noticed on Boxing Day, and whether it has caused any damage. It led to a reduction in the capacity of the holding area after part of the lorry park was cordoned off. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “Once we became aware of the issue at Manston we acted quickly to ensure the specific area was safely cordoned off, allowing the rest of the airfield to remain in use. “Following an investigation by Kent Fire and Rescue, they have advised that it is safe to resolve the issue by filling the hole with concrete, which will be done on Monday.” Drivers who arrive in Dover or Folkestone without proof of a Covid test are being sent back to the airport to get one by police manning the entrance to the port after France decreed emergency measures due to fears over the variant first identified in the UK. At one point the runway was accommodating nearly 4,000 vehicles – meaning it was under significant and possibly unprecedented strain from the sheer weight of the trucks. However, the park is now reported to be relatively empty. “There are no lorries left here from before Christmas and very few arriving for tests or checks,” Freudmann said. “I’m told this is because firms stocked up well in advance and it is expected to remain quiet for the next few days at least.” One driver who arrived on New Year’s Day looked dejected after being told his test was too old and he would have to return to the airport 18 miles away. “Sorry, test is 24 December, new test. New test. Manston,” instructed the police officer in broken English. It comes as local fury erupted in Dover after plans for a lorry park to hold up to 1,200 were confirmed in a letter to residents on New Year’s Eve. The transport minister, Rachel Maclean, told them that the site would create local jobs but residents say they have had no consultation about proposals for the site to be built 25 metres – less than the length of two lorry trailers – from their front doors. Kent county council has been contacted for comment."
2021-01-02T07:00:32Z,uk-news,UK news,Inside the 'moving factory' that will cut HS2 through the Chilterns,"In a decade’s time, passengers on the new high-speed trains hurtling out of London will get just a burst of daylight and a glimpse of the Colne Valley landscape before disappearing back underground through the Chiltern Hills. Today, in that three-mile stretch between future tunnel openings to the north-west of the capital, the £98bn HS2 project’s scale, engineering might and cost are all evident: both at the vast work site scooped out beside the M25 in Buckinghamshire, and in nearby waters and woods where protesters are still encamped to stop machines coming through. What was billed as the formal start of construction of HS2 began in September, after years of design, preparatory work and demolition. Funds were finally released for major works for phase one of HS2 between London and Birmingham after the government reviewed its decision one more time, with Boris Johnson giving the go-ahead in February.
On Chalfont Lane, just inside the motorway, lies HS2’s biggest single work site, part of a £1.6bn contract to create just 15 miles of the proposed 330-mile network. An expanse of bare earth the size of 80 football pitches holds temporary offices and factories to treat excavated chalk and cast enormous concrete segments. The focal point resembles half an excavated stadium with two circular portals at one end: the start of a future 10-mile tunnel through the Chilterns. Two giant 170m-long tunnel boring machines (TBMs) are being assembled in this arena. Simply getting this state of the art German technology to the start line has proved an epic challenge. HS2 will not put a price on it, but each TBM will have cost many tens of millions of pounds. Transporting the machines from the Herrenknecht factory in southwest Germany by truck and ship meant slicing them into parts: the giant cutter heads, with a diameter of 10.3m, had to be bisected and welded again on site.
Reassembly started last month and could take until spring, a giant Meccano set requiring a 600-tonne crane to complete. “It’s a moving factory,” says Didier Jacques, construction director, and a veteran of the Channel Tunnel project. Behind the cutter head will be a control cabin, where more than a dozen screens tell the operators exactly what is going on. “It is pressurised like a submarine so we can work safely underground.” The two machines, named Florence and Cecilia by HS2 Ltd, are a significant upgrade even on the beasts brought in to dig out London’s Crossrail tunnels: not just bigger but also capable of continuous boring to speed up the years of work, drilling onwards even as the 7.5-tonne concrete tunnel segments are sucked up and swung into place by hydraulic arms behind the cutter head. Further back is all the machinery that supports the process – as well as a canteen and toilets for the workers labouring within, and a refuge chamber promising 24 hours of survival should anything occur underground. Human safety will be improved by a pioneering robot, dubbed the Krokodyl because of its jaws, whose job will include removing the pieces of wood used to space out the hefty concrete segments. Segments are baked here not just for the tunnel walls but for a two-mile viaduct spanning the Colne Valley, leading south-east into London. While tunnelling takes much of the disruption out of sight and mind for the Chilterns, the viaduct will traverse the lakes and waterways of local nature reserves.
And its construction will not just affect its eventual location, as the ongoing protests are highlighting. To reroute power lines in its path, pylons must be removed from Denham country park, a job that meant building another bridge and route through woodland. Work was briefly halted last month by more ingenious construction – this time on the part of protesters. A mesh nest in a 30ft tall bamboo tower erected in the River Colne was occupied by veteran activist Swampy, before police moved in to end the standoff and allow the works bridge to be built. Now, more trees lie in the path of construction, including a number of oaks where treehouses have been installed by protesters. Sam Smithson, who left a job in fashion design to join Extinction Rebellion, has been part of the camp since May. Sooner or later, she says, the protesters will be evicted and trees felled: “It’s looking more inevitable each day but they haven’t moved in yet.” A cheerful Swampy, speaking before his arrest, said he hoped the protests would slow HS2 until the government decided to can the works: “I still think there is a very good chance they will cancel it: it’s unpopular already and more hearts and minds are changing now they see the devastation.” Despite the government’s go-ahead for HS2 last year, the network’s future appears to perennially remain in doubt. A report last month by the National Infrastructure Commission, previously a solid backer of HS2, suggested it would be better to prioritise regional rail links above building the north-eastern leg, which would link Birmingham to Sheffield and Leeds. Lord Adonis, the former Labour transport secretary who launched HS2 as a scheme in 2009, points to facts on the ground. “It’s going to be largely built … there are 250 construction sites between London and Birmingham, there is £10bn spent, parliament has just enacted the leg to go on to Crewe… and it’s consulting on the fine detail of the route to Manchester. A line linking the three biggest cities in the country is a certainty.” However, the eastern leg’s fate will only be announced in the context of broader rail plans for the Midlands and north of England. Adonis believes the only question is whether it goes ahead now or in decades to come. “In terms of what the country’s going to look like in 30 to 40 years’ time, it’s one of the most critical decisions for 2021.”
Failing to build high-speed links east of the Pennines would, Adonis says, “be like the Victorians building railways to Birmingham, to Manchester, and leaving Sheffield and Leeds with the canals. In social terms, if it believes in levelling up, the government really needs to build the eastern leg. Or the east will be two centuries behind, and it will lead to an exodus of jobs and people.” With many around the PM remaining hostile, and the Treasury eager for cost savings, the political battle over the cost and economic benefits of the railway will continue. As will the physical standoff in Colne Valley. “We’re continuing building more treehouses and better infrastructure, so that they are weatherproof and people can stay as long as possible, with sleeping bags and tarps and stoves to keep going up there,” says Smithson. “The area is historically known for flooding, and we are expecting flooding in January and February. It will be a tricky environment for everyone, whichever way you look at it.”"
2021-01-01T17:10:37Z,uk-news,UK news,"Most new and expectant mothers feel more anxious due to Covid, finds survey","Nearly half of new and expectant mothers feel anxious or nervous, while more than three quarters say the coronavirus pandemic has added to their fears, according to research. The pregnancy charity Tommy’s has called for more support for pregnant women before what is historically the most popular weekend to conceive a child. Official figures have shown that 2 January is the most common day to conceive, as the most common day to be born in the UK is 26 September – which falls 38 weeks after the second day of the year. A survey of a 1,000 new or expectant mothers by the charity found that seven in 10 felt overwhelmed at some point in their pregnancy, with 14% saying they struggled throughout, 49% feeling nervous or anxious and 77% saying the pandemic had added to their fears. Of those who responded to the survey, 89% said they had been scared by pregnancy-related headlines, while 80% had received unwanted advice. The survey also found that women had been told common myths related to pregnancy, which the charity said “can contribute to the 1 in 4 babies lost during pregnancy or birth”. While 65% had heard the phase “You can eat for two”, 54% had heard that small amounts of alcohol were fine during pregnancy, and 39% had heard that baby movements slowed towards the end of pregnancy. Tommy’s midwifery manager, Kate Marsh, advised mothers to use the charity’s Healthy Pregnancy tool to check up-to-date information about pregnancy. “Knowledge is power – and when it comes to pregnancy, feeling confident you have everything you need to do the right thing for you and your baby is important – but there is such a thing as too much information, which can leave mums-to-be anxious and overwhelmed,” she said. “Expectant parents need advice they can trust and personally tailored support throughout their pregnancy journey, not myths and misconceptions that evidence has disproved.” Rachel, 29, from Rhyl found out she was expecting her first child just before the government deemed pregnant women a higher-risk group in the pandemic. She told the charity: “I didn’t know what to do because I’ve never been through this before – and, even if I had, Covid changed everything; I couldn’t just go to see my midwife, I hardly saw any professionals until I was close to giving birth, but I didn’t want to be a burden calling up with my concerns when the NHS was in crisis.”"
2021-01-01T13:14:29Z,uk-news,UK news,'Cultural rebirth': Covid-hit Barrow's bold vision for the future,"The people of Barrow-in-Furness, the Cumbrian outpost that is perennially described as one of the most unhappy places in Britain and has one of the UK’s highest Covid-19 death rates, are used to negative headlines about their town. Three months ago its council declared a poverty emergency, becoming one of the first in the country to do so, and tourists rarely visit this windy peninsula near the Lake District. But that may soon change. A project involving Barrovians from all walks of life has produced a radical vision for its future, taking inspiration from Covent Garden in London, cooperative farms in Barcelona and the vineyards of southern France. It may be difficult to see Barrow, situated a 45-minute drive from the nearest motorway, as one of the UK’s top tourist destinations, but that is the ambition. “It is a really bold vision,” said Sam Plum, the chief executive of Barrow-in-Furness borough council. “We’re not going to change the world overnight but it does feel like a significant moment.”
Using a £50,000 grant from the national lottery, Barrow’s New Constellation project brought together 15 local figures – including a police officer, a tyre fitter, a GP and a port worker – to come up with bold ideas to transform the town’s fortunes. Their plan, which Plum said would set the council’s direction for decades to come, includes replacing car parks with playgrounds, turning backstreets into a natural park and transforming the tired town centre into a Covent Garden-style bazaar of independent businesses run by local people.
Community-run farms could help alleviate the chronic food poverty in parts of Barrow, where food bank use soared by 280% during the first national lockdown in spring. The idea for cooperative allotments is a nod to Barcelona, where locally run farms have spun off shops, and the vineyards of southern France, where many a backpacker has spent the summer picking grapes. The challenge is huge. Deprivation in parts of Barrow is deep-rooted; people in its poorest neighbourhood live on average 11 years less than those in its wealthiest borough. The town’s proud history of shipbuilding has left a legacy of respiratory illness, leaving older Barrovians more vulnerable to coronavirus. This in part explains why Barrow has one of the UK’s highest Covid-19 death rates, recording 168 deaths per 100,000 people within 28 days of a positive test, compared with the England average of 103 per 100,000. The town has also had a higher than average infection rate, thought to be in part down to its preponderance of terraced housing, making up 55% of all homes in Barrow. Poverty and public-facing work are also risk factors that would leave Barrow exposed.
“Those kinds of inequalities aren’t acceptable and we’ve been trying for years to shift them,” said Plum, who took over as council chief executive 18 months ago. “There’ve been so many different government interventions, so many programmes, so many funding streams but still those inequalities and that poverty exists and, if anything, through Covid it’s been amplified.” There are reasons for hope. Barrow is home to the UK’s largest shipyard, where BAE Systems is building the next fleet of nuclear submarines. It employs nearly 9,000 people at the site and last week announced plans to hire another 400 trainees. The area also stands to benefit from Eden Project North, which aims to open in 2024 on the other side of Morecambe Bay, with a new community hub on Walney Island in Barrow. Tom Lowes, 21, a Barrovian who works as a technology coordinator at BAE Systems, said he hoped the vision would turn the town of 57,000 people – regularly described as England’s longest cul-de-sac because it relies on only one road in and out – as a thriving metropolitan area that could compete for tourists with the Lake District. “I think there’s the potential of this town for it to become greener, for it to have a lot more culture, for it to bring in and retain diverse people that would want to work in the town and live here,” he said, adding: “I think we’re on the edge of the cultural rebirth of Barrow.” Plum hopes to use a £25m grant from the government’s Town Fund to put some of the ideas into action, ideally within months. She knows that some of the proposals could prompt a “massive backlash”, but says town centres need huge change to survive the closure of major retailers and the climate emergency. “If we don’t start really changing the way we design our towns, so that they’re about people, we’ll never get out of it.”"
2021-01-01T12:48:33Z,uk-news,UK news,New Year's Eve revellers fined by police for breaking UK Covid rules,"Police across the UK have made several arrests and issued hundreds of fines for New Year’s Eve parties and large gatherings that breached strict Covid regulations. Parties were broken up in Brighton, Manchester, Leicestershire, Sheffield, Essex, London and Lancashire where breaches of stay-at-home guidelines occurred. In Edinburgh, hundreds of people gathered around the castle despite warnings to keep away. But according to the Police Federation, officers were pleasantly surprised more illegal gatherings did not take place. Greater Manchester police issued more than 100 fixed penalty notices for Covid regulation breaches during a busy night for the force. The incidents included a rave at a building in an industrial estate in Wigan, several house parties across the Greater Manchester area, and a pub in Stockport that breached tier 4 rules by continuing to serve customers. Chris Sykes, the assistant chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said: “I’m sure the right-thinking majority of our residents will join me in condemning this irresponsible behaviour, which puts lives at risk.” Leicestershire police said they had handed out 75 fixed penalty notices (FPN) over new year, totalling almost £74,000. In a 24-hour period, the force received 191 reports of Covid breaches by the public.
Police in Brighton and Hove issued 66 FPNs overnight but thanked the “vast majority” of people for staying at home. The FPNs ranged from outdoor gatherings of groups in public spaces, to private parties and people travelling in from outside the area. Several were issued to groups gathering on Brighton beach in breach of the restrictions, although there was no large-scale event on the seafront, police said. Essex police said they arrested five people overnight and issued £18,000-worth of fines for Covid breaches. Assistant Chief Constable Andy Prophet said: “I’d like to firstly thank everyone across Essex who stayed at home and did the right thing last night. Unfortunately, there were others who decided to blatantly flout the coronavirus rules and regulations and, ultimately, they decided that partying was more important than protecting other people.” The force said officers had objects thrown at them when they broke up an illegal gathering of hundreds of people at All Saints church in East Horndon. Three men were arrested for drugs offences and an estimate £1,000 of damage was done to the grade II* listed church. Officers later broke up a party of about 100 people at an abandoned warehouse in Brentwood, where two people were arrested. A woman was issued with a £10,000 fine for organising a house party for 100 people in Sewardstonebury, Epping Forest. More than 25 guests were issued with FPNs. A dispersal order remains in place until midday. The organiser of a party for 80 people at a rural property in Hyndburn, near Blackburn, was issued with a £10,000 fine. Deputy Chief Constable Terry Woods, of Lancashire police, described the party as a “shocker”.
In Sheffield, police said they broke up a gathering of 70 people in a flat big enough for six people. “All issued fixed penalty tickets!” police tweeted. The Metropolitan police said they had attended calls to 58 unlicensed music events and 217 people were handed FPNs. Another five people were reported for a possible £10,000 fine for organising large gatherings. In east London, police in Newham shut down a “large unlicensed music event” at a building in the Royal Docks. Arrests were made and the organiser of the event could face a £10,000 fine. In Bromley, south-east London, three vans full of sound equipment were seized and 11 “Covid tickets” were issued, and one arrest was made for “abstracting electricity” at another unlicensed music event. In the east London borough of Barking, six people were fined for Covid breaches at a house party. A “car meet” in neighbouring Redbridge led to four fines. Despite the incidents in and around the capital, Ken Marsh, the chair of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said New Year’s Eve in London was “quite quiet”. He said sporadic gatherings of people “who just won’t take note of what is being said” were dealt with quickly. Speaking to to BBC Breakfast, Marsh said: “I think the public have really cottoned on that this is really serious, the position that we are in, and we did not see the numbers [gathering] we thought we would.” He said the number of officers who were off with Covid-19 or self-isolating had been rising over the last three or four weeks. He told the programme: “We have got probably 1,200 or 1,300 officers who are off with Covid or self-isolating and that is predicted to double in the next couple of weeks, and puts a massive strain on my colleagues who are still at work performing their roles. There are no other officers available other than what is in the pot.”"
2021-01-01T10:00:31Z,uk-news,UK news,Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson withdraws from elections,"The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, has said he will not be seeking re-election after police extended his bail as part of a corruption inquiry. Anderson, who was praised by the government for his handling of the city’s Covid crisis, said he had decided to step back from his role leading Liverpool city council and would not stand in May’s delayed mayoral election. He insisted the police investigation “will confirm I have done nothing wrong, and my name and reputation will be exonerated”. However he accepted his presence would be a distraction from “the positives of our city”, which he said he had always put first during his 22-year political career. Anderson was arrested at the start of December on suspicion of bribery and witness intimidation as part of an investigation into building and development contracts awarded in Liverpool. Several officers from Liverpool council were also arrested as part of the wide-ranging Operation Aloft inquiry, including the director of regeneration, Nick Kavanagh, and Andy Barr, the council’s assistant director of highways and planning. Shortly before Christmas the government announced an emergency inspection of the council, to check the authority’s planning, highways, regeneration and property management functions and “the strength of associated audit and governance arrangements”. In a statement posted on Twitter, Anderson said Merseyside police had extended his bail until February. “The timing of the extended bail notice means that it is in the best interests of the Labour party to seek a new candidate for the mayoral election,” he wrote. “Although our justice system is built on the principle of being innocent until proven guilty, their decision does in fact change everything, and restricts and restrains me from functioning as normal. Any media attention around the investigation will clearly be focused on me and not on the positives of our city and that is not how it should be. “I have always put the city first, that is why it is a tough, but the right, decision to continue to step back from my role in the council until the inquiries are completed.” The former social worker, who started out in the merchant navy, was first elected as a councillor in 1998. He became Liverpool’s first directly elected mayor in 2012, and had been reselected as Labour’s candidate to fight the local election in May, which was postponed from 2020 because of Covid. He said he would continue to fight to prove his innocence and to protect his legacy as mayor of his home city, writing: “It has been a great privilege to represent the Labour party and be part of a collective movement that represents people like me growing up in, and trying to find a way out of, poverty. Whoever the new Labour mayoral candidate is, I will cheer them on with all my heart.”"
2021-01-01T07:00:03Z,uk-news,UK news,Removed London bike lane blocked by parked cars most of the time – study,"A much-used cycle lane in London that was removed because the local council said it was impeding the flow of motor vehicles has since been blocked by parked cars up to 80% of the time, a study by a campaign group has found. Computer analysis of traffic cameras on Kensington High Street have also shown that average car journey times appear to have increased since officials took out the bike lane just seven weeks after it was installed. Kensington and Chelsea council ripped out the £320,000 lane on the busy east-west thoroughfare in December, citing complaints from 322 people, about 0.2% of the borough’s population. The Conservative-run authority said removing the cycle lane, which was used by up to 4,000 cyclists a day, would add extra space for motor traffic, and thus ease congestion and quicken journey times. But the study, which involved analysing video footage from Transport for London traffic cameras using Google artificial intelligence tools, found that the space had instead been largely taken up by parked cars. The analysis by Bike is Best, which groups together a series of organisations and companies from the cycling industry, found that in the week 21-28 December, what was formerly the eastbound cycle route was blocked by parked cars for 63.6% of the time. Even greater use of the space for illegal parking was found at other times. The most recent data, from 29 December, found that between 7am and 7pm what was the eastbound bike lane was blocked by parked vehicles for 81.6% of the period, with some parked on double yellow lines for more than 10 hours. Analysis of traffic camera footage from when London was still in the looser tier 2 coronavirus restrictions, during daytime hours from 14 to 18 December, showed the former lane blocked for 52.9% of the time. The study assessed average car journey times on a sample 1.1-mile stretch of the street using Google Maps’ real time traffic data, finding that these had increased after the cycle lane was removed. It calculated that average trip times eastbound increased from 5min 39sec to 8min 14sec, with those westbound rising from 5min 48sec to 6min 27sec. The study will bolster complaints from critics that Kensington and Chelsea council is institutionally hostile towards safer cycling schemes, with London’s cycling and walking commissioner, Will Norman, having previously accused it of “putting the convenience of car drivers over the lives of local residents”. In 2019 the council unilaterally vetoed a separate flagship east-west cycle scheme in the middle of a public consultation, citing complaints from 450 residents, or 0.3% of the borough’s population. Bike is Best submitted a freedom of information request to ask how the council had formally assessed the success or otherwise of the Kensington High Street scheme. The council responded: “No criteria or metrics were developed by which the scheme was to be assessed.” The campaign group is pushing for councils to use data analysis to properly assess the efficacy of cycling infrastructure. Adam Tranter, the founder of Bike is Best, who has the role of bicycle mayor for Coventry, said: “Active travel is probably one of the only modes that can be removed based on local opinion without data or research; you wouldn’t build a new dual carriageway and close it a month later because it didn’t look like it was at full capacity.”
The Kensington High Street cycle lane was now “occupied by a handful of drivers of inconsiderately and illegally parked cars”, he said, adding: “The same councillors and residents who were up in arms about a cycle lane don’t seem to be too bothered about that. It was never about capacity, it was about something new that upset the status quo.” A council spokesman said it was examining alternative schemes, including so-called school streets and 20mph zones. He said: “Since the decision we have received a letter signed by 25 residents’ associations, which represent 3,400 households, welcoming the decision to remove the lanes. We have had over 1,300 emails from residents and 85% were against the cycle lane.” This updated total of 1,300 residents represents 0.8% of the borough’s population."
2020-12-31T19:02:42Z,uk-news,UK news,Three-month customs grace period for parcels into Northern Ireland from rest of UK,"Businesses in Great Britain sending parcels to customers in Northern Ireland will not have to complete new customs processes for three months, the government has said. The announcement came after large retailers including the department store chain John Lewis paused deliveries to the region, while others cancelled orders, owing to uncertainty about the introduction of mandatory controls on the Irish Sea border after Brexit. From 11pm on New Year’s Eve, Northern Ireland will apply EU customs rules at its ports, meaning goods crossing the Irish Sea from other parts of the UK will be subject to customs checks. Customs declarations will also be required, even though the Brexit deal allows for tariff-free trade in goods. Just hours before the introduction of the trading arrangements, the government announced that customs declarations would not be required for most parcels received by Northern Ireland residents or businesses during a three-month grace period, until 1 April. One exception is parcels sent by businesses to businesses containing goods worth more than £135. However, the firms will have three months to submit the customs declaration. The government guidance does not state what will happen after 1 April. Retailers and other firms had suspended delivery services to Northern Ireland and had warned of potential disruption earlier in December because of uncertainty about the new requirements. John Lewis said it was reviewing the government guidance and was looking forward to resuming delivery services to Northern Ireland as soon as possible. In contrast with the three-month grace period for retailers, the food industry is only anticipating it will have one week to get to grips with new rules. Northern Ireland’s chief veterinary officer, Dr Robert Huey, has said food and animal products sent from Great Britain could be sent back or destroyed after Brexit if they were not compliant with new checks. Traders in Great Britain have been given six months to become accustomed to Brexit controls in Dover and other ports, but under the special arrangements for Northern Ireland some will apply immediately. Huey said no sanctions would apply during a one-week grace period. “For the first week there will be no drama,” he said. There will be another week for suppliers to ensure they label the stock for sale in Northern Ireland. “After that there will be 100% compliance,” Huey said, adding that goods that did not have the right health certification would either be destroyed or returned. “It sounds harsh, but that’s legally what I am required to do,” he said. “And just to emphasise we do it at the moment. So for example, there’s a requirement for farmyard machinery coming into Northern Ireland at the moment to be clean because of eelworm, which is a plant health issue. If they are not clean, they go back. That happens half a dozen times a year.” Supermarkets and big trusted foods suppliers were given a six-month grace period for all the checks in a deal hammered out between the UK and the EU in early December. But other businesses, which may include small suppliers of fresh fish, cheese or grain, will have to have their goods certified for entry from day one. Huey said he did not expect a high level of non-compliance because goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain were the same standard post Brexit as they were before the end of the transition period. Software suppliers have predicted chaos in the weeks ahead however, as companies that trade in Ireland discover they have to submit customs paperwork for the first time. They will also be required to use a new HM Revenue & Customs software, known as the customs declaration system (CDS), which was only delivered at the beginning of December. “To expect a software company to not only test all those changes but then roll that out to thousands of customers, or [even] hundreds of customers is just not feasible,” said Stephen Bartlett, the chairman of the Association of Freight Software Suppliers. Normally it would take “at least 12 to 24 months to roll this out to our customers”, Bartlett said, adding that CDS was so complicated that it might take customers two weeks to install it on their internal systems. “HMRC have made it very difficult to move people across even if we wanted. To quote one of them it’s like wading through treacle,” he said. A government spokesperson said: “Our IT systems will be fully operational by 1 January. Over the past year we have continued to work with key delivery partners to support preparations for CDS. “In addition, the government has established the trader support service, which is a free-to-use service that will submit declarations to CDS on behalf of those traders moving goods under the Northern Ireland protocol.” Honest mistakes made by businesses in the first few weeks of the new trading arrangements should be treated with “pragmatism, not penalties”, Britain’s business lobby group has urged. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents almost 200,000 businesses, is calling on authorities to help firms “by relying on pragmatism rather than penalties. Honest mistakes should be coached, not penalised in the coming weeks.” Matthew Fell, the CBI’s chief UK policy director, said: “It’s something of a surprise that businesses still do not yet know what awaits them as vehicles roll off and how each member state will marshal the new rules on day one.” He added that any issues that arose under the new trading arrangements needed to be solved quickly, and called on the UK and EU to minimise disruption and keep goods moving after 1 January."
2020-12-31T18:14:29Z,uk-news,UK news,Police in Essex launch manhunt after pensioner is murdered,"Police have launched a manhunt for a 28-year-old wanted on suspicion of the murder of a pensioner in Essex. Essex police are trying to find Leighton Snook after 83-year-old Donald Ralph was found dead at his home in the village of Aldham, near Colchester, just after 1pm on Tuesday. Ralph’s car was stolen and officers said they believe the killing was a targeted attack. Police said Snook should not be approached, but if any members of the public see him, they should notify the police immediately. Snook is from Colchester, but investigators said he has links to Hastings, Suffolk, Hartlepool and County Durham. A 16-year-old from Leicester was arrested in Colchester on Wednesday evening in relation to the investigation and was being held in custody on suspicion of murder. Detectives are trying to track down Ralph’s car, a blue Volvo V50 with the registration HD08 YFV, which was last recorded being driven to Hastings on the morning of the murder. Ralph has been described as “very young at heart” and a man who enjoyed being in the countryside. His niece Tina Ralph said: “Don was a very young-at-heart, fit 83-year-old, with boundless energy, enthusiasm and enjoyment of life. “He was a man who loved all things countryside, particularly fishing and the Norfolk Broads, as well as being an avid bird lover. He loved horse racing and spent many a happy Saturday having a little flutter. “Don was a unique character, who will be much missed by his wide circle of friends, and all his family.” DCI Scott Egerton of Kent and Essex serious crime directorate said: “We urgently need to speak to Leighton Snook in connection with the murder of Donald Ralph. I would strongly urge him, or anyone who knows of his whereabouts, to contact police. “I ask members of the public not to approach him but to call police immediately. Anybody who is found to be assisting those involved in Mr Ralph’s murder in any way will be subject of a thorough investigation and could find themselves prosecuted for assisting an offender.”"
2020-12-30T22:30:23Z,uk-news,UK news,New Year honours 2021: citizens awarded for response to pandemic crisis,"Hundreds of key workers and community champions who battled the pandemic have been recognised in the New Year honours list for the UK which celebrates people’s extraordinary response to the Covid-19 crisis. Lewis Hamilton, the Formula One driver, and the cinematographer Roger Deakins are among the celebrities knighted, while the architect David Chipperfield gets the Companion of Honour. The actor Toby Jones and Jed Mercurio, creator of the TV series Line of Duty, are given OBEs for services to drama. On being made a dame for services to drama the actor Sheila Hancock said she feared she was “slightly miscast”. Nina Wadia, who performed in the BBC soap EastEnders, and Sally Dynevor, a stalwart of ITV’s Coronation Street series, also received honours – an OBE for Wadia, and MBE for Dynevor. The music producer and DJ Craig David is recognised with an MBE. Among the political figures honoured are Geoffrey Cox, the ToryMP for Torridge and West Devon, who becomes a knight, while Labour’s Angela Eagle, who became MP for Wallasey in 1992, is made a dame for parliamentary and political service. But while many of this year’s 1,239 award recipients have names that few would recognise, none would argue with the decision to honour their sacrifice and commitment in a year that “truly tested the resolve and determination of those on the frontline”. Public sector workers, including medics, teachers, local government workers, police officers and firefighters, make up 15% of the list, “recognised for making a huge individual impact”.
Among the 123 health and social care workers honoured is 62-year-old Cath Fitzsimmons, from Eccles, a former palliative care nurse who came out of retirement when the pandemic struck. She described the struggle with trying to help patients without being able to hug them in the most difficult moments, and learning to smile with her eyes. She gets a BEM (British empire medal). Prof Farah Bhatti, 55, the first female consultant cardiac surgeon in Wales, receives an OBE. Also honoured are people who have helped NHS staff. They include Emma Henderson, the airline pilotwho co-founded Project Wingman, creating “first-class lounges” in 80 hospitals for exhausted workers; she receives an MBE. An OBE goes to 28-year-old Azeem Alam, a doctor, who provides, with a team, free medical education through BiteMedicine; and an MBE goes to deputy director of nursing Jacky Copping, 55, for initiating safety procedures for fitting personal protection equipment (PPE) at the James Paget University hospitals NHS foundation trust. Recalling the early days of the pandemic, when UK supplies of PPE were low, an OBE has been awarded to Katherine Dawson, founder of the garment business All-in-One Company, for setting up 120 “Scrub Hubs” to make uniforms. And Manoj Varsani, founder of the property management tool Hammock, was made an MBE for setting up the voluntary organisation SOS Supplies to help provide more PPE. Scientists also feature in the 2020 list, with Prof Wendy Bickmore, head of the University of Edinburgh’s MRC Human Genetics Unit, given a CBE, and Prof Wendy Burn, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, getting the same honour for predicting the mental health impact of the pandemic. Phillippa Spencer, senior principal statistician at the Defence Science and Technology laboratory, at Porton Down, is made an OBE for services to defence during the crisis.
Prof David Stuart, a structural biologist at Oxford University, who has spent his career studying the nature of viruses, has been given a knighthood, and forensic psychologist Prof Laurence Alison, director of the Centre for Critical and Major Incident Psychology, at Liverpool University, was made an MBE for his work, which he said he did “for the love of doing it and because it provides purpose”. Ocado’s chief executive, Mel Smith, is made a CBE for services to the food supply chain during the pandemic, and Kate Nicholls, chief executive of industry body UKHospitality, becomes an OBE for speaking up for the embattled hospitality industry. Community champions feature heavily in the 2020 honours list, some with extraordinary stories. Nadeem Sadiq Khan, a 40-year-old housing adviser for the charity Shelter is given a BEM, after continuing to help homeless people using his laptop on a Lahore rooftop after being unable to return to the UK after visiting Pakistan early in March.
Mark Owen, 57, a retired police officer from Llanynys, Clwyd, is given an MBE for coming out of retirement to lead the volunteer response to Covid-19 across north Wales. Caroline Halfhide, 51, from Ash, Somerset, receives an MBE for changing her pub in to a village shop, while Jennifer Sims, 76, receives a BEM for providing hot meals and free bags of food to vulnerable people during the pandemic. Women represent 49% of the total honours, while 14.2% come from a BAME background; 6.9% have a disability and 4% identify as being LGBT. Among the diversity champions is Karen McDowell, 46, station commander at Northern Ireland Fire & Rescue Service, given an MBE for, among other work, building support networks for employees transitioning their gender. And Khakan Munir Qureshi, a senior independent living officer for Midland Heart, is given a BEM for services to LGBT equality. Organisers said there were no plans to remove the words “British empire” from the honours system, despite critics saying that it glorified Britain’s colonial past and that there are increasing number of recipients choosing to turn down the honour. Both old and young are recognised in the 2020 honours list. The eldest is Anne Baker, 106, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, who receives an MBE for fundraising for the NSPCC. And 104-year-old Ruth Saunders gets an MBE for walking a marathon to raise money for Thames Valley Air Ambulance.
At the younger end of the age scale, 20-year-old Samah Khalil, the youth mayor for Oldham, receives a BEM for working to empower young people. Boris Johnson said the outstanding efforts of those who had received honours was a “a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit, and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion”. • This article was amended on 1 January 2021. An earlier version incorrectly said that Khakan Munir Qureshi had been awarded an MBE."
2020-12-30T17:27:10Z,uk-news,UK news,'Happy vaccine day' at Welsh factory proudly preparing Oxford doses,"Most of the sprawling industrial estate on the edge of Wrexham was quiet. There was little sign of activity at the engineering firms or in the self-storage units or greasy spoon cafes. But behind the wire fence of the Wockhardt UK plant, the laboratories and production lines were buzzing as scores of staff worked on the final part of the manufacture of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. “It’s a very exciting day,” said Ravi Limaye, the managing director. “We are very pleased the moment has finally arrived. It’s really a matter of pride for all of us that we will now move forward at pace with the manufacturing and get doses out into the vaccination centres. This is a moment in history.” Wockhardt (slogan: “life wins”) has the UK government contract to “fill finish” the Covid vaccines. It puts the finishing touches to the vaccine, which is manufactured by Oxford Biomedica, and pours it into vials that will be distributed around the country. When Boris Johnson visited the plant in November, he said what was taking place there could help provide “salvation for humanity”.
Limaye said staff had been keen to work over Christmas and new year to make sure the vaccine would be available as soon as possible once it was approved. On Wednesday some were wishing each other not happy Christmas or new year but “happy vaccine day”. “Given the importance of this, we have worked through the holidays in shifts,” said Limaye. The plant is operating five days a week and could go to seven days if necessary. “We’ll do whatever it takes to get those doses out,” Limaye added. “We should be able to come out with a few million doses in quick time.” Asked what “quick time” meant, Limaye said he expected millions of doses to leave the plant in January. About 420 people work at the plant. Its involvement in the Covid vaccine has led Wockhardt to hire an extra 40 or 50 people. Jobs ranging from “sterile technician” to “warehouse operative” are still being advertised.
The role Wockhardt is playing in the Covid crisis is a matter of pride not only in the company but also in Wrexham and across Wales. The Welsh Conservative assembly member and shadow health minister, Andrew RT Davies, said the vaccine showed Britain – and Wales – at its best. “This is incredible news during an extremely bleak time, especially as we should be enjoying the festive season,” he said. Wockhardt has its headquarters in Mumbai but has had a presence in Wrexham for more than two decades. Dave Gray, a local businessman, said the town was proud of what was going on there. “Wrexham has many world-leading companies in specialist engineering, technology and pharmaceuticals,” he said. “It’s fantastic to hear that one of the town’s long established businesses will be at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19.” It has been an interesting year for this corner of north Wales. The Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney have taken over the local football club, and I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! was filmed up the road at Abergele. Wrexham council’s leader, Mark Pritchard, said: “This is wonderful news for the whole country and it’s great for Wrexham to have this happening on our doorstep. The football club takeover and I’m a Celebrity put us on the map. But this beats them all.”"
2020-12-30T14:10:11Z,uk-news,UK news,UK weather: snow and ice to bring 2020 to wintry end for many,"Snow and ice is expected across most of Scotland as well as parts of northern and southern England, Northern Ireland and Wales as 2020 draws to a chilly conclusion. Covid restrictions mean there is less traffic on the roads, but the Met Office has warned of hazardous driving conditions in areas covered by yellow warnings. Tuesday night was the coldest so far this winter and the joint coldest of the year. Dalwhinnie, in the Scottish Highlands, recorded a low of -10.2C. The Met Office said the chilly weather is expected to continue, with wintry showers in many places on Wednesday afternoon, particularly near windward coasts.
Yellow warnings for snow and ice are in place across northern and western parts of Scotland and the north of Northern Ireland until 11am on New Yearâ€™s Eve. For southern and eastern parts of Scotland, north-west England and the north of Wales they will apply from 6pm on Wednesday until 2pm on New Yearâ€™s Eve. A yellow warning for ice has also been issued for the southern coast of England from 6pm on Wednesday until 11am on New Yearâ€™s Eve. A little snow is also possible on the south coast, but it is unlikely to be as heavy as previously forecast. The Met Officeâ€™s chief meteorologist, Paul Gundersen, said: â€œAn Atlantic frontal system looks likely to bring a mixture of rain, sleet and snow.â€� Clare Nasir, a Met Office forecaster, said: â€œ2021 starts how 2020 ended, on a very cold note with the risk of wintry showers and widespread frosts.â€� Difficult driving conditions are likely to further affect supermarket delivery drivers. Sainsburyâ€™s and Tesco have already cancelled shopping orders as several centimetres of snow settled across parts of the UK. Deputy chief constable Terry Woods, of Lancashire police, said on Tuesday that several vehicles had become stuck on higher roads and officers had to rescue their occupants. He said the roads were only passable in 4x4s and advised people not to travel unless it was essential. Highways England has also alerted motorists, and the AA reminded drivers that stopping distances could be 10 times longer on icy roads. The AAâ€™s Ben Sheridan said: â€œBefore setting off, itâ€™s important to fully de-ice the car, remove snow from the roof and ensure all the lights are working so you can see and be seen. Check the conditions along your route before you go and make sure you have plenty of fuel in case of delays. â€œItâ€™s also worth carrying winter essentials, such as warm, waterproof layers, a shovel, a torch, fully charged mobile phone and a flask of hot drink.â€� Flooding may also add to the hazardous driving conditions in some parts of the country. Thirty-seven flood warnings, which indicate that flooding is expected and immediate action is required, were in place across England on Wednesday afternoon, along with 80 flood alerts, which indicate flooding is possible and people should be prepared."
2020-12-30T11:02:02Z,uk-news,UK news,Alan Sugar's sister dies from Covid two weeks after brother,"Alan Sugar’s sister has died from Covid, two weeks after The Apprentice host’s brother also died from the disease. The 73-year-old businessman paid tribute to his eldest sister, Shirley Regal, on social media, saying she had died on Monday, aged 88. “She had been sick for a while but I guess Covid got her in the end to join our brother Derek, who passed two weeks ago. RIP SHIRL,” he wrote on Twitter. He added on Instagram: “I guess another victim of Covid.” On 15 December, Lord Sugar announced his brother had died after contracting coronavirus, describing it as “a sad day for us all in the family”. He tweeted: “Today I lost my long-suffering brother Derek, another victim of Covid which added to his underlying health issues. “He was a lifetime, passionate Spurs supporter. I never forget my sister-in-law joking with me, thanking me for buying him the club.” In September, Sugar condemned “unfair” criticism of the government’s handling of the pandemic, saying the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, had done a “good job in the circumstances”. “I think the chancellor has done very well generally, and I say that as someone who is not exactly a supporter of the government,” he told PA Media. “There have been a lot of people saying how costly it has been and giving them stick, but I think that’s unfair to be honest.” However, he said the government should require office workers to return to work to “support the City [of London], support the economy”. “The City is suffering as there are no workers there, so until they really push to get more people there it will continue to look like a ghost town.” This year’s series of The Apprentice, in which Sugar judges hopeful entrepreneurs doing business-related challenges, was postponed by the BBC due to Covid-19. The programme usually airs in October, with Sugar choosing the winner in December. “We can’t be sending people across the world for tasks, or going out on the street to sell items. It’s really unfortunate but had to happen,” he said at the time."
2020-12-30T08:01:05Z,uk-news,UK news,John Major was warned of ‘PR disaster’ from Róisín McAliskey case,"The detention of the pregnant daughter of the Northern Ireland civil rights leader Bernadette Devlin McAliskey threatened to degenerate into a “PR disaster”, John Major was warned, according to files released to the National Archives. The decision to hold Róisín McAliskey in Holloway prison while awaiting extradition to Germany – on suspicion of participating in a 1996 IRA mortar attack on a British army base in Osnabrück – caused acute anxiety in Whitehall at a sensitive moment in the peace process. Secret Downing Street files show that McAliskey’s treatment imposed pressure on the justice system and on negotiations with the Irish government. McAliskey was arrested in County Tyrone in November 1996 at the request of German authorities. She was transferred to HMP Holloway in north London, where she was held as a category A prisoner and regularly strip-searched. Stories that she would be shackled when she gave birth were repeatedly denied but prison officials would not confirm whether she would be permitted to keep the baby. In February 1997, a Cabinet Office letter to Major’s principal private secretary recorded that Dick Spring, the then deputy prime minister of Ireland, called in the British ambassador to Dublin to warn that the case was damaging the UK government’s position in Ireland. A telegram from the ambassador, Veronica Sutherland, said Spring had “implied a deep personal hostility towards the whole Devlin/McAliskey family” but he was concerned “to avoid damage to our bilateral relationship”. Sutherland added: “The strength of feeling on this case is increasing, involving very many people with no connection whatsoever to the republican cause.” Major’s principal private secretary, John Holmes, wrote to the Home Office saying the prime minister was troubled by press coverage. He did not want McAliskey treated “differently from other prisoners” but nonetheless was keen “not to give the republican movement a cause which will attract wider support”. An inter-departmental meeting was told that the number of strip-searches had been reduced. Pressure from Downing Street appears to have obtained further relaxations to McAliskey’s conditions: her “high-risk” category A status was downgraded and a decision was expected that she would be allowed to keep her baby. In March, Holmes wrote to the prime minister: “I think this is now going in the right direction. I am continuing to keep a close eye and to remind all concerned of your interest in ensuring that we do not have a PR disaster on our hands.” McAliskey, in her mid-20s, was eventually allowed to keep her daughter. She was held in prison for 15 month before being released in 1998 on the grounds that she was too ill to be extradited. The Crown Prosecution Service subsequently found there was insufficient evidence for her to be tried in the UK. She has consistently denied involvement in the IRA attack. Elsewhere, Northern Ireland files reveal that Major wrote a letter of sympathy to the DUP MP Nigel Dodds in December 1996 following a failed IRA assassination attempt on him while he was visiting one of his children in hospital in Belfast. “That anyone could mount an attack in a children’s hospital seems almost beyond belief,” the note said. “But it shows once again what we are up against.” On an earlier trip to Northern Ireland, in December 1995, Major dismissed attempts by aides to cancel a school visit and substitute it with a trip to “some place of economic/business interest in Ballymena”. Major wrote on the note: “This will be fine. It is Christmas after all!” An article in the Irish Times by the Sinn Féin leader, Gerry Adams, urging the prime minister to let the republican movement enter peace talks before an IRA ceasefire, prompted Major to scribble: “Clever little devil isn’t he, but is it genuine?” Another file from 1994 reveals that the Tory peer Norman Tebbit was contacted by a Libyan businessman who wanted to establish contact between Muammar Gaddafi and the UK government. Gaddafi’s officials later answered questions from the Foreign Office about his military support for the IRA. A Cabinet Office file from 1978 records one of many earlier attempts by the IRA to open talks with the British government. A message was sent by the republican movement in 1978 via the World Council of Churches to Martin Ennals, the then secretary general of Amnesty International. Ennals’s brother David was a minister at the time in the Labour government. Downing Street officials informed Jim Callaghan, the prime minister, but concluded: “There can be no deal or understanding or indeed direct contact with them.” David Ennals was told “to forget it”. Martin Ennals was instructed to say: “You cannot use me for this purpose.” The Good Friday agreement, ending the Troubles, was signed 20 years later in 1998."
