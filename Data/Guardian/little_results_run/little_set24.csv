2018-07-05T23:51:25Z,world,World news,Mother of Nauru refugee who killed himself begs to bury him in Australia,"The mother of an Iranian asylum seeker who took his own life on Nauru last month has been told his body will be sent to Iran against her wishes and not to Australia where he had relatives. Fazileh Mansour Beigi has told Guardian Australia she will stand vigil by the container where Fariborz Karami’s body is being held inside the Australian-run regional processing centre. She vowed to “stand by this container until the Australian government arrives to throw my kids and my body into the sea and release all of us together”. She has told Australian Border Force that she wishes for her eldest son to be buried in Australia, where her sister can perform a burial service, and visit his grave.
And she has written – through the camp management company Canstruct and the ABF – to the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, pleading for compassion. In it she says: I thought for a mother that nothing would be as torturous as seeing her children suffer for five years, in the heat above 40 degrees, in a tent filled with mould, dirt and a rusted fan. But, now, as a mother, more painful for me is seeing my son’s dead body, disrespected in front of my eyes, in a fridge inside a rusty container for 19 days … My only wish is that you bury Fariborz’s body with respect in Australia, as soon as possible, so he can rest in eternal peace and my 12-year-old son won’t have the same destiny as his older brother. The Guardian has seen letters written to camp managers by Fariborz’s younger brother but has chosen not to reproduce or quote from them because of their graphic nature. Doctors on the island have, over years, consistently raised concerns about the boy’s mental health. In English, Fazileh wrote to the ABF formally requesting that her son’s body be buried where her sister could oversee the funeral service.
The 26-year-old died on 15 June. An autopsy revealed a drug overdose. An embalmer has been on the island for several days, Guardian Australia has been told, to prepare the body for burial. Karami’s mother, wife, brother and close friends have been able to see his body over the past 24 hours. ABF officers insisted the body could only be buried in Nauru – for which the family would have to pay – or Iran. Mansour Beigi has rejected both options as they would mean her family is permanently separated from her son’s resting place. She says she cannot return to Iran for fear of persecution, and Nauru has consistently refused to permanently resettle any refugees or asylum seekers.
Karami does have other relatives in Iran, from which, it is understood, he was estranged. Mansour Beigi said the delay in burying her son was culturally insensitive and had caused her further grief. “Many times, I have requested ABF to allow me to bury my child while his body and face are still looking beautiful,” she told Guardian Australia. “Now he is bruised, swollen and not even buried. I will stand by this container until the Australian government arrives to throw my kids and my body into the sea and release all of us together.” In response to questions about Fariborz Karami, the home affairs department has maintained: “Further inquiries should be referred to Nauruan authorities … The department does not comment on individual cases.” Sources on Nauru have told Guardian Australian that ABF has ultimate authority over the regional processing centre, and has had “complete control” over Karami’s body and the movement of his family on the island. Questions to the Nauruan government have not been answered.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/06/mother-of-nauru-refugee-who-killed-himself-begs-to-bury-him-in-australia,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/06/mother-of-nauru-refugee-who-killed-himself-begs-to-bury-him-in-australia
2018-07-05T23:27:25Z,world,World news,Rohingya refugees reject UN-Myanmar repatriation agreement,"Rohingya community leaders have rejected an agreement between the United Nations and government of Myanmar for the return of refugees who fled violence in Rakhine state. Having seen a leaked text, the leaders say it does not address their concerns and will not help in the repatriation of the refugees.
“The agreement is on the issue of return of the Rohingya to their homes. Strangely, they did not bother to consult the Rohingya community before going for the deal. In the agreement there is no commitment from the Burmese government to fulfill our key demands as a precondition for our safe return to our homes. It is against the interest of the Rohingya,” Bangladesh-based Rohingya political activist Ko Ko Linn said. After the authorities in Myanmar launched a crackdown in Rakhine in October 2016, many Rohingya Muslims fled to neighbouring Bangladesh. Following further military action in August 2017, in which Myanmar’s soldiers were accused of rape, murder and arson, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya crossed to Bangladesh. In June, the Myanmar government announced it had reached an agreement with the UN that would quicken the process of repatriating the Rohingya. But the resulting memorandum of understanding was kept secret by its signatories. After the text of the MoU leaked online, Rohingya leaders and activists say it fails to address the key concerns of the community.
“We have long been seeking a guarantee from the Burmese government of restoration of our citizenship rights before we return. But, they have skirted this issue of citizenship in the MoU to our disappointment. The plan to repatriate the Rohingya will never meet with any success if the government does not accept this key demand,” Linn told the Guardian. Although the community has lived in Myanmar for generations, a 1982 law stripped the Rohingya of their citizenship and made most of them stateless. In the Buddhist majority country Rohingya Muslims are now identified as interlopers from Bangladesh. Myanmar’s government refers to them as Bengali, not Rohingya. UK-based Rohingya rights activist Tun Khin said that it had been unethical on the parts of the Myanmar government and the UN agencies not to involve the refugee community before drafting the agreement. “The Rohingya have the right to know about the details of the agreement relating to the process of repatriation, restoration of the citizenship rights, rehabilitation, reintegration and rebuilding of their bulldozed homes and their future. Our community members are extremely angry and disappointed to know of the details of the MoU, after it has leaked. They are also angry because the Burmese government did not make the the details of the agreement public,” Tun Khin, president of Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK. Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the UN high commissioner for human rights, reportedly had a heated exchange with a diplomat from Myanmar over the 700,000 Rohingya who are stuck in overcrowded camps in Bangladesh. When the diplomat told the UN Human Rights Council that his country was “committed to the defence of human rights,” Hussein said the claim “almost creates its own level of preposterousness”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/06/rohingya-refugees-reject-un-myanmar-repatriation-agreement,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/06/rohingya-refugees-reject-un-myanmar-repatriation-agreement
2018-07-05T20:16:45Z,world,World news,'He died a hero': Canadian man mauled by polar bear while protecting his family,"A father in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut is being hailed as a hero after he died protecting his three young children from a polar bear attack.
Aaron Gibbons, 31, was at a popular fishing and hunting spot near the hamlet of Arviat, on the western shores of Hudson Bay, on Tuesday when the bear appeared, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Gibbons was unarmed at the time of the attack. He was on a small island enjoying a day out with his children, Gordy Kidlapik, Gibbons’ uncle, told the Winnipeg Free Press. “The bear started to stalk or charge one of his children,” he said. “He told his children to run back to the boat and put himself between his children and the bear.”
His school-age children made it safely to the boat and called for help on the CB radio. Kidlapik was among those who heard the call, describing it as “heartbreaking”. Police said Gibbons was pronounced dead at the scene. “He died a hero,” said Kidlapik. The bear was shot and killed by other adults who were nearby. The attack left Arviat, a small hamlet that is home to some 2,600 people, reeling. “It’s just really incredibly sad,” a local lawmaker, John Main, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). “We’re a small community and when something like this happens, it affects the whole community.” Attacks by polar bears are rare; the last polar bear mauling in the region is believed to have happened 18 years ago in Rankin Inlet, about 200km north of Arviat. Nunavut’s department of environment said conservation officers were investigating the circumstances of the attack to determine whether factors such as the bear’s age or health played a role in the attack. Arviat is located within the range of the Western Hudson Bay polar bear population, which numbers around 840 bears, according to 2016 estimates. In recent years, local hunters and elders in the community have reported a spike in sightings of polar bears around the community and noted that they seem to be less afraid of humans. The World Wildlife Fund, which in 2010 partnered with Arviat to launch a program to monitor the perimeter of the community from September to December, has linked the increase to climate change. Sea ice is taking longer to form each autumn, meaning bears are spending more time on the coastline, Paul Crowley, director of the organisation’s arctic program, told the CBC in 2016. “It’s partially because the climate is changing and partly because of attractants in the communities like the dumps.” On Wednesday, Kidlapik, Gibbons’ uncle, floated his own theory, pointing to polar bear tours based in Churchill, Manitoba – about 250km south of Arviat – for acclimatising the bears to the presence of humans. “You’ll see pictures of tourists touching a bear through the fence,” he said, while other outfitters offered walking tours near the bears.
The bears then migrated from Manitoba, where the tours are based, towards northern communities like Arviat, he said. He speculated that the tours could be a factor in explaining the bears’ shifting behaviour, noting that 10 or 15 years ago, they would flee at the sound of an all-terrain vehicle or snowmobile. “Today, bears are not doing that. They hang around. They won’t run away. They’ll go on the trail beside you,” he said. “Bears are losing whatever fear they have of humans.” When asked about any potential link between polar bear tours and the attack, Nunavut’s department of environment declined to comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/canada-nunavut-aaron-gibbons-mauled-polar-bear-kids,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/canada-nunavut-aaron-gibbons-mauled-polar-bear-kids
2018-07-05T19:34:34Z,world,World news,Mexico: 19 killed and dozens injured in fireworks explosions,"Nineteen people have been killed and at least 40 injured in a string of explosions that ripped through fireworks workshops just north of Mexico City – the latest in a series of deadly blasts to hit the area. Video of Thursday’s disaster showed an immense plume of smoke rising above the area of the explosions in the town of Tultepec. Other images released by local media showed wrecked buildings and scorched ground in a rural patch of modest homes and small farm plots. Officials said that four explosions ripped through the area after fire broke out at a clandestine worshop. “The problem was that after the first explosion, people went running to help, and when the second explosion occurred, these people who ran to help were killed,” Luis Felipe Puente, head of Mexico’s civil defense agency, told the Milenio news network.
The tragedy comes 18 months after a chain reaction of explosions tore through the San Pablito fireworks market in Tultepec at the height of the busy Christmas season, killing 42 people. The 2016 blast marked the third time in a decade the site had exploded, even though it was supposedly constructed to avoid just such a calamity. Mexicans were quick to express anger of officials’ apparent inability to prevent repeated disasters at the same site. “Guess what happened in Tultepec (again) …” the Reforma newspaper’s city section tweeted. In a second tweet, the newspaper said: “Barely 11 days ago, an explosion in Tultepec left one dead and six injured; 18 days ago, another [explosion] caused seven deaths … Explosions and tragedies in Tultepec repeat themselves constantly.”The people in Tultepec express pride in their pyrotechnics industry, despite the risks. Barely three months after the 2016 San Pablito explosion the town paid tribute to those who died in the accident with a massive fireworks display.
“It’s a high-risk activity and there are a lot of people that depend on it,” said Juan Guerrero, a Tultepec government spokesman. He estimated the fireworks business – which supplies the country and attracts hoards of buyers over the independence and Christmas holidays – supports 30,000 jobs. “It’s generational. There are some people who are third-generation working in it and obviously it’s a good source of work,” he said. “The earnings are good, but it’s high-risk.” Critics accuse politicians of refusing to crack down on the industry in order to win elections, even going so far as to promise support for those in the fireworks trade.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/mexico-city-fireworks-explosions-tultepec,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/mexico-city-fireworks-explosions-tultepec
2018-07-05T17:45:38Z,world,World news,Police officer arrested over shooting that sparked Nantes riots,"A police officer who shot and killed a man during a stop-and-search operation in Nantes, sparking two nights of rioting and violence, has been taken into custody for questioning. Investigators are looking into whether the officer should be charged with “violence by a person of authority leading to manslaughter”. Announcing the arrest on Thursday, the Nantes prosecutor’s office said: “Only at the end of this questioning will the prosecutor be in a position to announce his decision regarding what happens next in this affair.” On Thursday evening several hundred people took part in a silent march in memory of the dead man, Aboubakar Fofana. His family, who did not take part in the march, have appealed for calm after clashes between protesters and police on Wednesday night. Dozens of vehicles and buildings – including shops, a police station, community centre and a library – were torched. Protesters shouted “killers, killers, shame on you” and others threw stones from apartment windows. Police responded with teargas. The violence was worst in areas routinely described by French authorities as “sensitive” – often run-down high-rise social housing projects where unemployment, poverty and crime are high. The prime minister, Édouard Philippe, visited Nantes on Thursday and promised “the fullest transparency” over the death. He expressed his support for police and firefighters dealing with the protests and “firm condemnation” of the rioters. “When firefighters come to save a library or evacuate someone who is ill and [they] are stoned, nobody understands,” he said. The government promised police reinforcements and said the violence and vandalism would not be tolerated. Fofana was allegedly under surveillance in a drug-trafficking investigation when the rented Nissan he was driving was stopped by police in the Breil district at around 8.30pm on Tuesday. He was not carrying identity papers, as required in France, and police tried to arrest him. Le Monde reported that Fofana was wanted under a 2017 arrest warrant for organised robberies. Police said he was hit in the neck by a single bullet after he reversed his car into one of the officers. However, a number of witnesses contested the police claims, saying the car was stationary when officers fired and that no officer was injured. A woman who filmed the incident, who did not wish to give her name, told French journalists: “There were no police behind the car. He didn’t hit anyone. There was only the one gunshot.” The incident has strained tense relations between youths and police in France’s urban housing estates. On Wednesday night, protesters set fire to a community centre on the Malakoff estate, destroying more than 10,000 books and children’s games. The town hall has vowed to rebuild the centre, but Marie-Gaby, a local resident, said people were devastated. “They’ve attacked a symbol of the area. Apart from the library, this was a wonderful gathering place for children and the elderly. There were activities, association meetings, and things offered to youngsters who couldn’t go on holiday,” she told 20 Minutes. Another resident, who was close to tears, said: “In two nights they’ve destroyed everything built in 20 years, but we won’t give up.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/security-forces-dispatched-to-nantes-after-police-shooting-sparks-violence,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/security-forces-dispatched-to-nantes-after-police-shooting-sparks-violence
2018-07-05T17:12:40Z,world,World news,Iran threatens to block Strait of Hormuz over US oil sanctions,"A potential confrontation between the US and Iran is brewing in the Strait of Hormuz after Tehran threatened to block the Gulf passageway in retaliation for Washington’s looming sanctions against Iranian oil exports – a threat the US military said would be immediately countered. The Trump administration is demanding all countries end imports of Iranian oil by 4 November as part of its new policy of hostility towards Tehran after Washington’s unilateral exit from the 2015 nuclear agreement. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, responded during a rare visit to Europe this week by signalling that Tehran could disrupt regional crude shipments and cut its cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog. On Thursday the commander of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, whose forces patrol the Strait of Hormuz – through which one-fifth of the world’s oil passes in tankers – said the Guards were ready to put Rouhani’s words into action if necessary.
The US navy signalled it was ready to confront Tehran militarily in response. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the Guards commander, was quoted by the semi-official Tasnim news agency as saying: “We will make the enemy understand that either everyone can use the Strait of Hormuz or no one.” Bill Urban, a spokesman for US Central Command, said Washington and its allies provided security in the region and would not stand idly by. “Together, we stand ready to ensure the freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce wherever international law allows,” he said. The threats will bring back memories of the latter years of the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, when US forces attacked Iranian territorial waters after a US ship struck an Iranian mine. Rouhani returned to Tehran on Thursday after lobbying European leaders to deliver a robust rebuttal to the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal. “The Americans have claimed they want to completely stop Iran’s oil exports. They don’t understand the meaning of this statement because it has no meaning for Iranian oil not to be exported while the region’s oil is exported,” Rouhani said this week in Switzerland. “If you can do such a thing, do it and see the result,” Rouhani added in a threat that was lauded at home by the commander of the Quds force, Qassem Suleimani. The fate of the nuclear deal is in the balance after Donald Trump pulled the US out of it in May before imposing new sanctions despite European resistance and Tehran’s adherence to the agreement, as verified multiple times by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Although the US initially demanded all countries end imports of Iranian oil in the autumn, it is likely to grant temporary exceptions to countries that rely heavily on Iranian crude such as China, India and Turkey. Ellie Geranmayeh, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Iran did not view the nuclear agreement solely through the prism of an economic agreement, but also as a political and security deal. She said the Trump administration’s policy was not solely to exit the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) but also to make it impossible to sustain it. Rouhani had two overarching messages during his visit to Europe, Geranmayeh said. “First, Iran expects more concrete action from all parties to the nuclear agreement to sustain economic channels. Second, sustaining oil exports and market share is a red line for Iran.
“If Trump implements his threat to squeeze Iran’s oil exports, Tehran is prepared to escalate against the US to impose direct costs for global oil markets. This is a core issue of national security behind which there is growing backing from the political establishment.” Despite the US’s withdrawal, the deal has not yet collapsed as Europe remains committed to salvaging it. Geranmayeh said Europe was expected to present a more concrete economic package to Iran during a ministerial meeting at the JCPOA’s joint commission on Friday. Also at stake is Rouhani’s political career. The agreement is the moderate cleric’s main achievement in office, for which he was rewarded with a second term last year, but Trump’s antagonism towards Iran has empowered Rouhani’s hardline opponents at home, risking him becoming an early lame duck. Trump’s hostility has compounded the country’s economic woes, while Iran is going through weeks of protests due to a currency crisis and environmental issues. Hardliners have started their onslaught on Rouhani, blaming his economic performance for the protests.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/iran-retaliate-us-oil-threats-eu-visit-hassan-rouhani-trump,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/iran-retaliate-us-oil-threats-eu-visit-hassan-rouhani-trump
2018-07-05T17:10:51Z,world,World news,Facebook labels declaration of independence as 'hate speech',"In the run-up to the Fourth of July, the Liberty Country Vindicator, a small local newspaper in Texas, posted sections of the declaration of the independence to its Facebook page, in a bid to encourage discussion of US history among its readership. What must have seemed like a benign social media strategy managed to fall foul of Facebook’s algorithmic censors, which labeled sections of the declaration hate speech and removed the posts. Facebook alerted the Vindicator to let them know that the section of the declaration that includes a reference to “merciless Indian savages” was a violation of their community standards. The declaration’s passage has often been cited as an encapsulation of the dehumanising attitude toward indigenous Americans that the US was founded on. Facebook’s removal of the section arguably put the Vindicator in a position of whitewashing history. Casey Stinnett, the managing editor of the paper, said in a post on the site on Monday that the removal also put them in a “a quandary about whether to continue with posting the final two parts of the declaration … should Facebook find anything in them offensive, the Vindicator could lose its Facebook page”. Facebook has since apologised and reinstated the post, but it’s not the first time algorithmic censors have tried to censor important historical artefacts because they are considered obscene. Earlier this year, an account dedicated to LGBT History posted the 1992 Zoe Leonard poem I Want A President, which has the opening line: “I want a dyke for president.” The poem, which has previously been displayed in a 20ft by 30ft piece of public art in New York, was removed by Instagram for violating its community standards. In response, hundreds of other accounts also posted the poem, with Instagram playing whack-a-mole trying to remove them. The chief curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles was among a number of influential art and literary figures that posted the poem and had it removed by the site. After a days of removals, Instagram apologised, said there had been a “mistake” and reinstated the posts.
In 2016, Facebook removed a posting of Pulitzer-prize winning photograph The Terror War and suspended the account of Norwegian Tom Egeland. The photograph shows children, including the naked nine-year-old Kim Phúc, fleeing a napalm attack during the Vietnam war. In response, a Norwegian newspaper wrote a front-page editorial defending Egeland and displaying the photograph. Facebook also removed the newspaper’s posting of the front page, alerting them that: “Any photographs of people displaying fully nude genitalia or buttocks, or fully nude female breast, will be removed.” These errors in censorship might appear trivial, but as an ever-increasing amount of internet usage takes place within a tiny number of social media sites, it is likely these kinds of challenging works or honest reflections of history will reach fewer people. As Stinnett says, outlets like theirs have become “dependent, perhaps too dependent, on Facebook to communicate with local residents”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/facebook-declaration-of-independence-hate-speech,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/facebook-declaration-of-independence-hate-speech
2018-07-05T16:28:51Z,world,World news,Lancashire firefighters set up exclusion zone amid BBQ risk,"Firefighters have set up a three sq mile exclusion zone around a large moorland fire in Lancashire amid concerns about people lighting barbecues. Lancashire fire and rescue service took the unusual step of banning walkers from the area after they discovered a used disposable barbecue on Winter Hill, near Bolton, on Wednesday. Around 100 firefighters with up to 20 fire engines are continuing to tackle the blaze that started seven days ago, as emergency services across the region struggle to contain the biggest outbreak of wildfire in recent memory. On Thursday, Lancashire fire and rescue released an image of the exclusion zone, which stretches from Rivington village to Horrocks Moor, where one of the fires began a week ago. The fire service said: “[The map] shows the areas we need people to stay clear of; not only for public safety but to help us maintain the progress we’ve made so we can give you back full access ASAP.”
Steven Fletcher, the Bolton mountain rescue team leader, told the BBC the exclusion zone was in place to “stop people disturbing the ash by walking on the burnt area”. He said it “beggars belief” and that someone would risk causing another fire by having a barbecue on the hill. Concerns about the Winter Hill blaze being reignited came after Greater Manchester police said they believed arson may have caused the Saddleworth Moor fire which began on 24 June. Police said residents had seen people lighting a bonfire at around 7.30pm on Sunday and Ch Supt Neil Evans, the territorial policing commander for Tameside, said: “The moorland fire is now being investigated as arson following information from local witnesses and initial inquiries.” The Saddleworth fire was quickly doused by fire crews but reignited because of the hot weather. Residents have inundated firefighters with donations of everything from suncream to water and socks. On Thursday, a local McDonalds store delivered 200 meals to the firefighters at Winter Hill.
Some firefighters from Greater Manchester and Lancashire have been working 20-hour shifts as the fires burn in several locations across north-west England. The fire on Saddleworth Moor is now said to be under control but soldiers and an RAF Chinook will stay until at least Friday to help firefighters extinguish the smouldering embers. Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union general secretary, said some firefighters without basic training had been sent to tackle blazes, and MPs have raised concerns that some soldiers were pictured at the scene without protective clothing.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/lancashire-firefighters-set-up-exclusion-zone-amid-bbq-risk,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/lancashire-firefighters-set-up-exclusion-zone-amid-bbq-risk
2018-07-05T15:34:54Z,world,World news,"Germany, Austria and Italy to consider 'closing' southern migrant route","Germany, Austria and Italy will hold talks on “closing” the southern migrant route to Europe, the German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, has announced, after he promised that refugees would not be sent over the Bavarian border to Austria. At a hastily arranged meeting in Vienna with the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, Seehofer sought support from Germany’s southern neighbour for a controversial border agreement he had reached with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Seehofer, whose hard line on immigration has prompted weeks of conflict with the chancellor, promised that Germany would not send asylum seekers to Austria if they were turned away at the German border, although details remained unclear. Separately, Merkel said she wanted to protect Europe’s “humanity” in dealing with migrants, spelling out her differences with Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, at a press conference in Berlin. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party reached an agreement with its sister party, Seehofer’s Christian Social Union, to set up special transit centres at the German-Austrian border to process asylum claims. Germany also wants to reach bilateral deals with Greece and Italy so they take back asylum seekers.
Under EU rules, the first country of arrival is responsible for processing asylum claims, a system that has put a heavy burden on Mediterranean states and triggered angry debates about what to do with people who move to other member states. Seehofer predicted that talks with Greece and Italy about these so-called secondary movements of people would be “extremely complex and complicated”. Austria had feared that Germany was exporting these asylum claimants, prompting Kurz to warn that he could introduce controls along the southern border. “These national measures would of course affect Austria and would mean that we would have to take measures along our southern border,” Kurz said hours before meeting Seehofer. “We are fighting for a European solution.” After the meeting, Kurz said “things had been cleared up now”, but acknowledged that there would be a “period of uncertainty” while Germany sought to negotiate agreements on returns with Greece and Italy. Under pressure from the CSU, Merkel has been scrambling to get an EU-wide solution, fearing that there will be a domino effect if Germany takes unilateral action, leading to border closures across central Europe and unravelling the EU’s border-free travel zone, imposing costs on people and businesses. Austria has been considering imposing controls at the Brenner Pass, one of Europe’s busiest transport hubs, on its southern border with Italy. If vehicles had to detour through the Gotthard tunnel in Switzerland, Austrian officials estimate it would add €124 (£110) to the cost of each journey. Austria, which took over the EU’s rotating presidency on 1 July, wants to strengthen the EU’s external borders while avoiding internal controls on the continent. Kurz said “major progress” on external borders had been made at a recent summit in Brussels of EU leaders as he sought to dispel doubts about the vague communique that was agreed. After all-night talks, EU leaders agreed that unspecified non-EU countries should host migrant-processing centres to try to prevent people risking their lives making dangerous sea crossings to Europe. Kurz said he was “convinced there are countries that are willing to work with us in the spirit of partnership”, though he did not name them. Under Kurz’s leadership, the Austrian People’s party entered into a coalition with the far-right anti-immigrant Freedom party last December. That coalition, backed by Denmark, recently called for failed asylum seekers to be expelled from the EU to camps in the Balkans. Diplomatic convention requires the holder of the EU presidency not to push pet projects but to act as an honest broker for all EU countries. Kurz indicated it would not be possible to push the idea of camps in non-EU countries during the next six months. “To be honest, I do not want to elaborate on this idea because we do not want to endanger it,” he said, adding it was “not connected to the Austrian presidency but it might serve as an example for others”. Austria has become an enthusiastic supporter of a long-standing effort by the European commission to create a European border and coastguard agency, in contrast to the policy of previous Austrian governments. Kurz called for the agency to have 10,000 border guards by 2020, seven years earlier than anticipated by Brussels.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/germany-austria-and-italy-to-moot-closing-southern-migrant-route,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/germany-austria-and-italy-to-moot-closing-southern-migrant-route
2018-07-05T14:08:53Z,world,World news,'Gun to head': French prison break helicopter pilot describes ordeal,"The helicopter pilot taken hostage and forced to help heavily armed men spring a notorious French criminal from prison has spoken publicly for the first time about his ordeal. Stéphane Buy told how he was expecting to give a flying lesson to two men; instead, he was beaten, knocked briefly unconscious and ordered to take a group of masked men to break Rédoine Faïd out of jail. The hunt continues for Faïd, 46, a serial criminal serving 25 years for his part in a failed robbery in 2010 in which a police officer died. Buy, an experienced pilot with 3,000 flying hours, said he had been approached by two men, one aged around 50 and the second in his twenties, for lessons. “It was the second or third time I’d seen them. They’d already done an initiation flight with me and it had gone very well. I thought it was a father who wanted to treat his son. It was a flying lesson like any other,” he told RTL radio.
Buy said the men arrived on time for their lesson at 9.30am French time on Sunday morning at the aerodrome at Lognes, east of Paris. But instead of boarding the helicopter Buy had prepared, an R44 Robinson with four places, the two men insisted on a lesson in an Alouette II, capable of transporting five people parked in the same hangar. Buy refused, saying the Allouette was on loan and not suitable for beginners. In any case it was too low on fuel, he told the men. “It was at that moment everything changed and they began to threaten me. I said we couldn’t take off with so little fuel, and they said: ‘Then get fuel quickly.’” His voice breaking, Buy added: “They led me to believe my family was in danger.”
He said he was in “such a state” but managed to put fuel in the helicopter and was ordered to calmly let the control tower know they were taking off in a southeasterly direction. “Then [the gunmen] told me to land in a field on the pretext of wanting to urinate. “They made me get out of the helicopter and aimed their guns at me. I was hit a couple of times with the butts and was told they had decided to take a friend from Réau prison, and it was important for me to do my job well otherwise my family would be at risk and there was someone outside my home. “I wasn’t resisting; I didn’t have any choice with two Colts held to my head.” Buy said he was then ordered to take off again, but had no flight plan or any idea of which direction to go.
“Then they told me to land again. I didn’t know where I was. They ordered me to cut off the engine and put my head down so I couldn’t see the commandoes arriving. I could hear bags and people being loaded into the back but I had to guess what was happening from the noise behind the cockpit. I was still being held with a Colt against my head.” Buy said his nightmare truly began after the Alouette II, a vintage model, refused to restart. “At this point the men became really angry. Suddenly I was being hit harder and harder with the gun butts. They kept shouting ‘start it, start it’, but each time the red light came on and it wouldn’t start. There was nothing I could do. “I suggested we get out and try to solve the problem from the electro-mechanical box on the outside. It was then I saw these men completely hooded in outfits like the Raid or GIGN [French rapid intervention forces] in the helicopter.” Buy said the men, wielding Kalashnikov rifles and reportedly wearing police armbands, began to lose patience with him as he repeatedly tried to start the aircraft without success. “Maybe they thought I was faking a breakdown, but I felt completely helpless in front of that engine that I had tried to restart five, six times,” he said. “They became more and more nasty. I took a blow to the head and I fell to the ground unconscious for several moments. They picked me up … I tried another connection … finally the engine started and we took off in a hurry.” The gunmen ordered Buy to fly low over fields “clearly to avoid radar” while they looked for the prison, finally spotting its red walls. “I asked them: ‘What do I do now?’ They made me pass directly over the prison. I was too busy concentrating on what was a tricky manoeuvre to be worried for my safety. I had to follow their orders. “I landed in a triangular courtyard on a piece of Tarmac about 1.5 metres wide lined with flowers. It was a precise move but that is what I am specialised in. It’s what I teach my students. “The others got out, leaving a commando with me who ordered me to rise to 1.5 metres and do a half turn in the courtyard. “I was then told to hold the helicopter just about the ground and wait. I don’t know why. It was extremely precise move to hold it at around 3cms for 10 minutes. “My worry was that the level of fuel was going down. It was very low. And I didn’t know where they would take me.” While Buy hovered in the prison’s main courtyard, the only one not protected by anti-aircraft netting, the gunmen cut through a prison door using an angle grinder and burst into the visiting room where Faïd was talking to his brother, Brahim. “After … everyone was on board I took off. I didn’t know who was on board; he [Faïd] was pretty quiet. They told me to fly towards Roissy [Charles de Gaulle] airport but not the airport itself.“Then they ordered me to land in an alley near a Total petrol station next to a fast road … Everyone got out. I heard them talking about petrol and bleach and I knew they were going to try to set the Alouette on fire.” The helicopter was found partially burned near Gonesse, north-east of Paris. Buy was taken to hospital where he was treated for shock. It is the second time in five years that Faïd has broken out of jail. The French authorities believe the gang may have flown drones over the prison in recent months to become familiar with its layout in preparation for the raid.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/gun-to-head-french-prison-break-helicopter-pilot-describes-ordeal,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/gun-to-head-french-prison-break-helicopter-pilot-describes-ordeal
2018-07-05T13:45:45Z,world,World news,Talented and resilient: the Wild Boars footballers trapped in Thai cave,"When, on Monday, members of the Wild Boars football club spotted a light emerging from the watery depths that had confined them to a pitch-black chamber in Tham Luang cave in Thailand’s Mae Sai district for nine days, they had no idea it was being carried by two British men. Unaware of the headlines and sympathy their plight had inspired around the world, the 12 boys and their coach assumed the divers were explorers. Adul Sam-on, 14, called out in English to ask the divers what day it was and tell them that he and his friends were hungry. His teammates, unable to follow the conversation, chattered “eat, eat, eat” with the little English they had. Adul assured his friends: “I already told them.” Driven by the revelation that the boys are alive and that a rescue is likely, Thai sports outlets have been working to piece together the dynamics and personalities of the team. In goal
The squad’s goalkeeper is Ekkarat Wongsookchan, 14, who goes by the nickname Bew. Bew has reportedly improved his game over the past few years as a result of his disciplined personality. At the end of each training session, he steps up to collect the team’s equipment. In the cave with Bew is his close friend Pipat Bodhi, 15, whose nickname is Nick. Nick is not a member of the Wild Boars; he had joined the team’s practice match on 23 June to spend time with Bew. Prajak Sutham, 14, known as Note, occasionally plays in goal when he is not in midfield. He has been playing football for two years. The defenders
In defence are Pornchai Kamluang, 16, known as Tee, and Panumas Saengdee, 13, nicknamed Mick. Mick has been described as an ideal defender because of his fitness and fluid movement. However, his coaches have recently considered playing him as a striker because he is strong in the air and skilful with his head. He is said to play as well as a 15-year-old. The midfielders
Adul Sam-on, the boy who spoke to the divers, plays on the left wing. His English skills have won him the admiration of millions in Thailand, where fewer than 30% of the population speak the language. According to local news outlets, his knowledge of English comes from his involvement in church activities. He also speaks Thai, Mandarin, and Burmese, which he learned living just over the border in Shan state, Myanmar. Like many students in Thailand’s Mae Sai district, he commutes over the border every day.
Also in the cave are two right-wingers: Peerapat Sompiangjai, 16, known as Night, and Sompong Jaiwong, 13, or Pong. The forwards
Duangpetch Promthep, 13, known as Dom, is a forward and team captain. His teammates on the U16 squad say he has the qualities of a leader and a good sense of humour. Dom has been invited to trials by a number of leading provincial teams, including Sukhothai FC and Chiangrai United FC. Playing alongside Dom is Chanin Wiboonrungrueng, 11, or Titan. Titan is the youngest Wild Boars player. He has been playing football for five years. When he joined his school’s sports club three years ago, he was invited to play for the Wild Boars. The third striker in the cave is Nattawut Takamsai, 14, known as Tle. The trainee
Mongkol Boonpiam, 14, known as Mark, is a trainee. Thailand’s sports daily Siamsport reported that Mark has been playing football since he was in kindergarten and loves the sport so much that he almost always wears a football shirt. His favourite team is Muangthong United, the leading team in the Thai Premier League. He also enjoys swimming and cycling. His mother, Namhom Boonpiam, told Siamsport: “I believe he will survive.” The coach
Assistant coach Ekaphol Chantawong, 25, took his squad into the cave on 23 June. He was once ordained as a Buddhist monk, and since leaving the monkhood has spent much of his time caring for his grandmother. Thai news outlets have reported that the authorities have not ruled out charging him with a crime, but Thai government spokesman Lt Gen Werachon Sukondhapatipak told the Guardian that “no one is talking about that”. Werachon said the coach’s presence had been a comfort to the boys: “The coach is advising them that they need to lie down, of course [try] meditation, try not to move their bodies too much, try not to waste their energy. And of course, by meditation, they stay conscious all the time, so their mind will not be wandering around.” Wild Boars FC, known in Thai as Moo Pa, was established three years ago as a small, regional club to compete in provincial tournaments. It has under-13, under-16 and under-19 squads, and since members of each squad are trapped in the cave, the entire club has had to sit out of competitive matches. Most of the players are from ethnic minorities and underprivileged communities, and many join when they are eight or nine years old.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/talented-and-resilient-the-wild-boars-footballers-trapped-in-thai-cave,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/talented-and-resilient-the-wild-boars-footballers-trapped-in-thai-cave
2018-07-05T12:40:00Z,world,World news,"England owes arrears over St George's Cross, claims Genoa mayor","As England fans fly the flag of St George at pubs, out of windows and from cars during the World Cup, an Italian mayor has suggested claiming back centuries’ worth of arrears from England for its use of the red cross. Genoa, once a powerful maritime city, adopted the St George’s Cross as its flag and St George as its patron saint during the Crusades. The symbol was adopted by England toward the end of the religious wars, in the 13th century, with English ships flying the flag of Genoa as a deterrent to enemies.
For the privilege, the English monarch paid an annual tribute to the doge of Genoa, or ruler of the Republic of Genoa. However, the tribute apparently fell by the wayside after the republic collapsed. Marco Bucci, the mayor of Genoa, said the arrears claim could be the “biggest stroke of marketing” for the city. He said he would write to the Queen seeking to recoup funds that could then be spent on the city’s needs. “Your Majesty, I regret to inform you that from my books [it] looks like you didn’t pay for the last 247 years,” he joked.
It is highly unlikely Bucci’s idea has any legal grounds, but the matter has been a bone of contention between the two countries for centuries. The St George’s Cross is also used as a symbol in other northern Italian cities, including Bologna, Padua, Reggio Emilia, Mantua, Vercelli, Alessandria and Milan. It is unknown whether St George – who is thought to have been born in the late third century in Cappadocia, now eastern Turkey – ever visited England. He became the country’s patron saint after the English Reformation and is the patron saint of many other places including Portugal, Malta, Georgia and Ethiopia.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/england-owes-arrears-over-st-georges-cross-claims-genoa-mayor,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/england-owes-arrears-over-st-georges-cross-claims-genoa-mayor
2018-07-05T11:40:49Z,world,World news,Thai cave rescue: army drains site in bid to free boys before monsoon,"Thai rescuers say 12 boys trapped deep inside a cave complex may be able to walk out, provided the route can be drained before the monsoon showers predicted for the weekend. A military operation in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave complex is employing hundreds of industrial pumps to drain the water along the 2.5-mile (4km) path from the entrance to the area where the children and their football coach have been sheltering for 12 days.
Poonsak Woongsatngiem, a rescue official with Thailand’s interior ministry, told the Guardian the water had been reduced by 40% in the past few days, clearing a 1.5km stretch of dark, jagged and muddy cave channels that the boys would need to traverse. The focus of Thursday’s operations is a third major basin along the route, Woongsatngiem said. The boys, who are not strong swimmers, are being trained in how to dive using scuba equipment. But forcing them to exit through the water is considered very risky.
“We [are] target[ing] the water in the third chamber to reduce to the point that no diving equipment is needed, like to the waistline, so one can wear just life jackets and walk out,” Woongsatngiem said on Thursday. Clearing the third basin would leave another 2.5km of path to the boys, whose ages range from 11 to 16. A Chinese diver at the site, Wang Ying Jie, said about half that remaining path would be walkable in the right conditions; the maximum water depth they would need to cross is about six metres.
It is unclear how long the remaining area would take to drain, but monsoon rains are predicted for Saturday and would quickly refill the cave complex, potentially cutting the boys off for months. Rain was the biggest worry, said Narongsak Osatanakorn, the governor of Chiang Rai province, who is coordinating the rescue efforts. “We were racing against time before we found them,” he said. “Now we’re racing against water. It keeps seeping through the cave.” A fibre-optic cable was being laid inside the cave and would reach the boys soon, he added, so the children would be able to speak to and possibly see their parents on video.
Wang said most of the boys remained in good health but three had intestinal issues and were in some pain. Divers were positioned at the third basin waiting to ferry medicine to the children. With wet weather looming, authorities are also calculating how long they are willing to allow rescuers to remain in the cave before they order an evacuation. Updates on the condition of the boys and the water levels were being slowed by the length of the journey to reach the children. “It’s about 11 hours – six on the way from the entrance to where the kids are and five on the way back,” he said.
He said the boys and their 25-year-old coach had started practising diving but did not confirm whether they would try to bring any out on Thursday. Those considered strong enough to go could do so first, he said. “They don’t need to be brought out as a team,” Osatanakorn said. “Whosoever is ready can come out first.”
Officials were also scouring the jungle above the complex to find new openings that could be drilled to extract the boys more easily. The children were breathing, he said, so there was very likely a shaft somewhere to the top. “We have around 20 to 30 teams surveying on top to find the closest and most precise spot,” he said. One Thai navy Seal member who spent time with the boys said they “were always asking about the World Cup. I told them that all the big teams had gone home.” Additional reporting by Veena Thoopkrajae in Mae Sai and the Associated Press",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/rescuers-draining-thai-cave-in-hope-football-team-can-walk-out-before-rains,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/rescuers-draining-thai-cave-in-hope-football-team-can-walk-out-before-rains
2018-07-05T09:57:05Z,world,World news,Russia denies any involvement in latest UK novichok poisoning,"The Kremlin has said it is “deeply concerned” by the poisoning of a British couple with the nerve agent novichok but has claimed Russia had nothing to do with it. It was the highest-level response yet to Wednesday’s poisoning, which Russian officials said on social media would be “dumb” for Moscow to have carried during the World Cup. Vladimir Putin’s personal spokesman categorically denied that Russia was behind the use of the nerve agent in Wiltshire and also complained that Russia had not been given information about what substances were used.
“Of course we’re concerned that these substances have been used repeatedly in Europe,” Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. “However, on the other hand, we have no information about which substances were used or how they were used.” He also said that no convincing evidence of Russia’s complicity in the March attack against the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, had been presented by the UK. Asked about remarks by the British security minister, Ben Wallace, who called on Moscow to give details about the original novichok attack, Peskov said: “To my shame I don’t know who Ben Wallace is. [But] the minister knows very well that Russia proposed a joint investigation long ago and that this proposal was on the agenda. It was made long ago and unfortunately the British side is not showing any interest in such proposals.” It follows remarks by a senior Russian politician that the state’s law enforcement bodies should participate in the UK investigation. “There is a need for thorough and professional work, and the efforts of British security services will not be enough. Russia should be involved, among others,” said Vladimir Shamanov, who chairs the defence committee of the state Duma. Russia’s embassy in London said in a statement that it believed the government was intentionally trying to frame Moscow for the second poisoning. “It is regrettable that official representatives are trying to link the second poisoning to Russia, having failed to provide any results of the probe into the first one,” the statement by the embassy said. “Instead of real cooperation, London is doing everything to make the situation vague and intimidate its own people.”
Dawn Sturgess, 44, and Charlie Rowley, 45, collapsed in Amesbury on Wednesday in an incident that has been attributed to the use of the nerve agent originally developed by the Russian military. Many Russian officials have previously denied that Russia developed novichok, or that the state used it in the attack on the Skripals in nearby Salisbury March. The latest incident comes at a particularly sensitive moment. Russia is hosting tens of thousands of foreigners during the World Cup and its national team could face England in the semi-finals next week if both teams win their next matches. Russian media and officials have suggested that the Skripal attack was a provocation to take the football tournament away from Russia. As a result of the Salisbury poisonings, British ministers and members of the royal family have not attended the World Cup. A post on a Twitter account used by the Russian embassy in the Netherlands said on Thursday:
Last month, the UK and its allies won a vote to give the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons the power to attribute blame for the use of chemical weapons and not just confirm their use. Russia opposed the decision at the Conference of the States Parties. British law enforcement has suggested that the latest poisonings were probably caused by the nerve agent used in the original attack, and that the Amesbury couple were not targeted specifically.

2018-07-05T09:06:54Z,world,World news,Courts get punishment guidelines for revenge porn offences,"Courts have for the first time been given guidelines on how to punish people who humiliate ex-lovers by uploading so-called revenge porn to the internet. Repeatedly reposting private sexual images and videos after they have been taken offline will earn offenders sentences of up to two years when new instructions are introduced to courts in October. Labour recently called for victims of revenge porn to be given anonymity like victims of other sexual offences as the government pushes through its “upskirting” bill, while there have been calls for schools to do more to recognise the damage of new, online forms of sexual harassment. Two Love Island constants, Zara McDermott and Laura Anderson, reportedly had explicit images of them shared online while they appeared on the reality TV show but thousands of lesser known figures have also suffered the same ignominy. Courts have, until now, been unclear on the requisite punishment for perpetrators of these types of “intimidatory” offences. The guidelines – published on Thursday – will come into force on 1 October and also cover stalking and harassment cases. Sentencing Council member Judge Rosa Dean said courts would now have comprehensive guidance “that will help ensure sentences reflect the seriousness of these offences”. “Our guidelines recognise and reflect the very intimate, personal and intrusive nature of these offences, which can have devastating, often long-term impacts on victims and their families,” she said. People who set up fake social media profiles or websites to amplify the embarrassment of their targets, which could result in abuse and sexualised contact from strangers, can also expect to receive the harshest penalties available. The offence of disclosing private sexual images without consent was introduced in 2015 and carries a maximum sentence of two years. In 2016/17, there were 465 prosecutions over revenge porn allegations in England and Wales. Justice minister Rory Stewart said such crimes could have a “devastating and deeply traumatising effect on victims”. “These new guidelines will ensure that our courts recognise the serious harm caused to victims, and that perpetrators are properly punished,” he said. The guideline on meting more severe punishments to those who make “repeated efforts to keep images available for viewing” was added following last year’s consultation after the practice was identified among some offenders. Stalking, controlling and coercive behaviour and threats to kill are also covered by the new guidance, which has been significantly expanded for harassment offences. The crime of controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship was introduced in December 2015 to crack down on repeated abuse in domestic settings. It can apply to a range of conduct such as controlling victims through social media, spying on them online, stopping them from socialising or refusing them access to money. Offenders can face up to five years in jail. Following the consultation, controlling or coercive behaviour that results in debt or homelessness has been listed as a possible “aggravating” factor after this was highlighted as an effect of these crimes when an offender controls the victim’s access to their money. The guidelines reflect recent legislative changes that doubled the maximum sentences for stalking and harassment from five years to 10; and from seven to 14 years if the offence was racially or religiously aggravated.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/courts-get-punishment-guidelines-for-revenge-porn-offences,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/courts-get-punishment-guidelines-for-revenge-porn-offences
2018-07-05T07:00:24Z,world,World news,Tiny coffins: how Nicaragua’s spiraling violence ravaged a family,"When the mutiny against Nicaragua’s septuagenarian president, Daniel Ortega, broke out in April, Matías Velásquez was barely a month old. Two months later he is dead, the youngest victim of a spiraling conflict some now fear could plunge what was until recently considered one of Central America’s most stable nations into civil war. On a recent afternoon, Matías’s charred corpse lay in one of two tiny white coffins inside Managua’s Fuente de Vida (Source of Life) evangelical church; the other contained the body of his two-year-old sister Daryelis.
The infants were killed hours earlier when their family home was torched – allegedly by police and masked members of a pro-Ortega militia – in one of the most horrific episodes to have been caused by Nicaragua’s political convulsion. “We weren’t guilty of anything,” sobbed their aunt, Jeaneth, as she stood in the blackened ruins where they had perished, surrounded by rubble and ash. “They didn’t care that there were children,” added the 29-year-old, her face smeared with soot and tears. “They didn’t care about anything.” Nicaragua’s vice-president and first lady, Rosario Murillo, blamed the atrocity – in which the children’s parents and grandparents also died – on groups of perverse and abominable “vandals”. Nicaragua’s UK embassy claimed the family was killed by “violent criminals” from the opposition in punishment for failing to support a nationwide anti-Ortega strike. But friends, relatives, witnesses and activists rejected those accounts as government disinformation and painted a very different picture of how Matías Velásquez and his family came to die.
According to their account about 50 masked men – some wearing black, others police uniforms covered by bulletproof vests – descended on Managua’s Carlos Marx neighbourhood early on the morning of Saturday 16 June in a convoy of pickup trucks. The pro-government paramilitaries – known as “turbas” – appeared to have been tasked with destroying barricades erected to keep them out. Witnesses claimed the group set fire to the Velásquez home after Matías’s grandfather, Óscar, refused to let them use its balcony as a sniper’s nest. “[They] told my father that we had to support them, and my father said: ‘The only thing I have to support is Jesus Christ,’” said Jeaneth. “They were furious.” An uncle, Óscar Velásquez Júnior, confirmed that account: “The police and the government are totally [to blame]. There’s nobody more to blame than Daniel Ortega and his followers. There’s no bigger murderer than Daniel Ortega.”
As the fire spread, Jeaneth recalled leading her 13-year-old sister, Maribel, who also survived but sustained severe burns, upstairs in search of an escape. “Everything exploded and we threw ourselves off the balcony.” A neighbour who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals recalled trying to help. “The flames leapt out from the third floor of the house and we ran [towards it], but the police began shooting to stop anyone from getting close to the house to help.” “When they thought that everything had finally been burned down they left … so we went to help [the family]. But they were already dead,” she said. Another neighbour, who also declined to be named, said: “This was beyond reason. What happened to this family is a crime. It is not repression – it’s murder.” Human rights activists say at least 309 people have been killed and 1,500 injured since the start of protests against pension reforms, that have since swelled into a national insurrection against Ortega, on 18 April. On Monday, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) – whose members include Claudia Paz y Paz, Guatemala’s former attorney general, and Sofía Macher, the former head of Peru’s truth and reconciliation commission – announced it had sent a team to Nicaragua to investigate those killings. The violence has infected daily life, leaving residents of Managua tense and terrified. Shops once open all night now close at sundown. Neighbourhoods across the country have erected barricades to keep police and paramilitary groups out.
Hours after the Velásquez home was torched, residents of one nearby neighbourhood reportedly lynched and burned one paramilitary in an apparent act of retaliation. Graphic footage of his public cremation was posted on the internet. But the brazen daytime attack on the Velásquez family – and the deaths of two small children – has caused particular indignation. “In the name of God – no more death!” Rolando Álvarez, the bishop of Matagalpa, pleaded during televised talks between the government and the opposition designed to defuse the crisis. The United States condemned “the ongoing government-sponsored violence” including the arson attack on the Velásquez family. “Attacks and threats against peaceful protesters and the general population are unacceptable, and must cease,” state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters.
The relentless escalation of violence bodes badly for an ongoing “national dialogue” designed to find a political solution to the crisis but participants insist it is their only option. “It’s necessary to prevent more bloodshed – although there’s already been so much,” said Azalea Solís, a 59-year-old civil society leader who is part of those talks. Friends and neighbours described the Velásquez family as devout Christians who shunned politics and had worked their way out of rural poverty. “When we worked in the mountains, sometimes we had no food; it pains me to say, but we stole yuca in order to eat,” remembered Francisca, a great aunt of Matías’s father. After years of struggle, the family managed to open a mattress shop on the first floor of their home. “My father was an exemplary man,” Jeaneth said. “He always told us that we have to get ahead without owing anything to anyone, and that when he passed away, we’d need to take up the family business.” That business, the man who started it, and most of his family are now gone. In their place: the heavy stench of smoke and soggy wreckage and six coffins in the church across the street.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/tiny-coffins-how-nicaraguas-spiraling-violence-ravaged-a-family,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/tiny-coffins-how-nicaraguas-spiraling-violence-ravaged-a-family
2018-07-05T06:22:25Z,world,World news,Trapped boys may be able to 'walk out' of Thai cave as water levels drop – as it happened,"We’re going to pause our live coverage of the events unfolding in Thailand. But will resume live coverage as soon as we have more information or any rescue is attempted. Here’s what we know so far: We are now into the third day since the boys were located in the cave in northern Thailand. The boys are still trapped in the cave, but now have foil blankets, food, light, medical care and seven navy divers – including medics – to keep them company. Rescue efforts, which involve multiple international teams and hundreds of people, are proceeding on three separate fronts. Plan A is to teach the boys to dive so that they can dive out of the cave escorted by navy divers, and the governor reported that the boys have begun doing practice dives in the cave. Plan B is to drain the cave system so that the children can walk out of the caves wearing life jackets meaning they don’t need to dive. Authorities have announced they have reduced the water levels in the first section of the cave – a 1.5km stretch from the entrance to a point they are calling chamber three – by 40%. It is now possible to walk through the water up to chamber three. Plan C is to drill down to the cave where the boys are stranded and rescue them that way. The governor earlier ruled out drilling as an option because the boys are between 800m and 1km below the surface and in a confined space, so it was not thought to be safe. Monsoon rains are expected to arrive over the weekend. If they arrive before the boys have been freed, rising water levels could means the boys are trapped in the cave and cut off from supplies and communication for four months. Chiang Rai provincial governor Narongsak Osatanakorn said they were in a “race against time” and were evaluating risk levels to assess when they should evacuate rescue teams, given the predicted rainfall later this week.

2018-07-05T06:09:59Z,world,World news,Left behind: the two Thai boys who missed out on disastrous cave trip,"Nearly a fortnight ago, the boys of the Wild Boar football club finished football practice and started riding their bikes to the Tham Luang Nang Non cave for a picnic. Two members of the team stayed behind. Songpol Kanthawong, 13, did not take a bike to practice that day. Thaweechai Nameng, 13, was ordered by his parents to return home to catch up on his homework.
Both narrowly avoided the fate of their 12 teammates, who have spent the past dozen days stranded several kilometres inside the Tham Luang cave while an entire country rallies behind the effort to free them. Around 9pm on the day the boys left for the caves, Kanthawong got a call from his uncle, one of the team’s coaches. “Do you know where Ekk is?” he asked, in reference to the 25-year-old assistant coach stuck along with the boys. “They went to the cave,” Kanthawong says he replied. It set off a frantic investigation by family and club members. Around 11.30pm that night, the coach called Kanthawong’s mother back with the news. “Their bikes are still in front of the the cave.” The next morning, Kanthawong went with his parents to the cave as rescue crews were arriving. The three of them sat by the entrance for hours, quietly praying. He tried to go back to school on Monday, but was too overwhelmed with worry to study. His parents took him back to the cave on Tuesday morning, where again he prayed until the evening. “I was so shocked and I am worried and I don’t think I’m the only one,” he told the Guardian. “Everybody is.” Kanthawong showed the team’s Facebook Messenger group, which has been inundated with messages for stricken members of the team. “We miss you,” one says. “We wish we could meet you all now,” says another. No teams from the club, who mostly belong to Thailand’s Akka and Thai Lue minorities, have played since the boys vanished.
Nameng knows the Tham Laung cave well, recently visiting with his boy scout troupe. “When you’re in the cave, you don’t hear the rain,” he says. “By the time the rain came and the water started flowing, they would have been too far inside.” He says the area where rescuers found the boys’ backpacks and snacks is the furthest he has ever been, a passage where the path narrows so much that squeezing through with bags becomes extremely difficult – especially if you are rushing. “It’s scary and it’s dark,” he said. He says widespread reports that the boys cannot swim are wrong, showing a recent picture of the team at a swimming pool, some wearing football jerseys in the water. Kanthawong was asleep on Monday night when British divers found the boys. His grandmother was shouting with joy – he thought there might have been a fire. “I was so happy,” he said, showing some of the jubilant messages on the club’s Facebook Messenger thread. He is worried but feels a twinge of relief that his family is not experiencing what those of his teammates are undergoing. “My mum says if I was one of the kids in the cave she would have been in the ICU right now,” Kanthawong says. The boys are already planning their celebrations for when their friends are freed. “We will have a BBQ pork party,” they agree.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/thai-soccer-boys-missed-cave-trip-wild-boars,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/thai-soccer-boys-missed-cave-trip-wild-boars
2018-07-05T05:29:51Z,world,World news,Thursday briefing: police step up novichok poisoning investigation,"Top story: Is there a Skripal link? This is Alison Rourke with the stories making news on Thursday 5 July. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, will today chair a meeting of the government’s emergencies committee, Cobra, as police step up their investigation into the poisoning of couple in Amesbury. Britain’s top counter-terrorism officer, Neil Basu, said he was not in a position to say whether the nerve agent was from the same batch that the Skripals were exposed to, but “the possibility that these two investigations might be linked is clearly a line of inquiry”. Around 100 detectives from the counter-terrorism policing network are working with Wiltshire police on the case as the couple, Dawn Sturgess, 44, and Charlie Rowley, 45, remain critically ill in hospital. A number of sites in both Amesbury and Salisbury – areas authorities think the couple visited – remained cordoned off. England’s chief medical officer, Prof Sally Davies, said the risk to the public was low. * * * Walk out? – Thai rescuers say the 12 boys trapped deep inside a vast cave complex may be able to walk out if the path can be drained before the monsoon rain expected this weekend. Hundreds of pumps are spewing out water, reducing it inside the cave by up to 40%, but there’s still work to be done to clear a major basin on the way out where the water is still up to the ceiling. With torrential rains looming, authorities are calculating how long they are willing to let the rescuers inside the cave before they order an evacuation – which could cut the boys off for up to four months.

World Cup As the dust settles on England’s heart-stopping penalty shootout win over Colombia and the euphoria begins to die down, a reality check: there were plenty of heroes in Moscow, but England must offer more if they are to reach the semi-finals. Still, Gareth Southgate’s team have shed some old baggage and there is a cautious optimism that is rooted in humility and work ethic, rather than the arrogance with which recent sides have been associated. Fears over the fitness of Harry Kane have been allayed and the England captain is set to lead the side out against Sweden. But doubts remain over Jamie Vardy, who has a groin complaint and is in a race to be fit for the game in Samara, where Sweden say they will be on alert for the penalty box diving of Ashley Young. Meanwhile, Jordan Henderson, who missed from the spot at Spartak Stadium, has admitted he will be forever in Jordan Pickford’s debt after his teammate’s eye-catching save in Moscow.

The 1990s was a narcissistic decade, but it was a strange narcissism, premised on the idea we could remake ourselves any way we liked, virtually from scratch, writes Eve Fairbanks. Great expectations were especially great for girls, she writes, and unmanageable male lust was one of those things we hoped would become a kind of relic that we didn’t take all that seriously. Fairbanks says it sounds paradoxical, but all the power women were told we had led often not to courage, but to hesitation, rationalisation, even self-hatred and self-harm. It was portrayed as a liberation to have the chance to be everything all at once, brainy and gorgeous. But in practice, it was crushing: if we could be anything, we had to be ideal.
Nine months after it began, is there an ebbing of some energy around #MeToo – a tiredness; perhaps an acknowledgement that the contradictions and painful realities it revealed are too big to solve fast? Frantically firing offending males may make it harder for women to tell their complex stories, many of them deep-routed in their journey to fulfil hopes that this generation would of women and girls would live a different experience.

2018-07-05T05:00:22Z,world,World news,Wireless in Gaza: the whizz-kids making code not war,"It’s a scene straight from a Silicon Valley startup. Hot-desking twentysomethings type code into laptops covered with stickers. Retro Pac-Man graffiti and motivational slogans like “DO EPIC THINGS” adorn the walls. Bookshelves are filled with the tech classics: The Facebook Effect and The Founder’s Dilemmas. Wifi routers hang overhead, as do Edison bulbs, emitting more style than actual light. But this is not the San Francisco Bay Area. No electric cars quietly whirr by. Instead, this is Gaza, with its cracked streets and checkpoints manned by militants. On the perimeter of this impoverished coastal enclave are Israel and Egypt, countries that have blockaded this tiny slice of land for years.
Tight restrictions on the movement of goods and, vitally, people, have been the death of much industry here. But Gaza’s first coding academy hopes its hi-tech business model — which operates in the virtual rather than real world — will be somewhat immune to physical barriers to trade. “That’s the reason we started this. It ignores boundaries,” says 31-year-old Ghada Ibrahim, who was in the first class of coders, which started a year ago. “The blockade is a huge factor. It’s a reason why we have a lot of people who have come to sign up.” With funding from international charities such as Mercy Corps and significant tech world players such as Google, the academy provides two basic requirements its students need for a freelance career developing websites and apps: internet and electricity. In Gaza, that means paying for a generator to supply 10 hours of laptop juice a day.
“We do something that no one can cut off,” Ibrahim says, then stops herself mid-sentence and pauses for a few seconds. She adds, smiling: “Although maybe they can.” Israel provides Gaza’s internet, and as yet has never cut it off. Sixteen students (half female as a rule) enrolled in the first class, which had international support from Founders & Coders, a UK-based nonprofit providing free coding lessons. Ibrahim recalls a slightly haphazard programme: eight hours a day where students were expected to self-learn coding and present a weekly project. Of the original 16, only nine graduated. “We had a lot of problems,” she says. “It was supposed to be one month. It went on for six months.” She says the students, several of whom had degrees in information technology, struggled to adapt to self-taught techniques following a lifetime of parrot-fashion schooling: they continually looked to the teacher when stuck. “We all grew up to be taught by someone. It’s never self-learning,” she says. To combat this, the class implemented what Ibrahim calls the 20/20/20 rule. When encountering an issue, students spend 20 minutes trying to figure it out online, then 20 minutes with the help of another classmate. The final 20 minutes are with the help of a mentor.
It works. The class after Ibrahim’s had 12 graduates, and the one after that had 14. The fourth cohort is currently ongoing with all 16, she says, looking into the classroom, “but it’s only the third week.” And while the first classes had support from professional coders, all the mentors are now former students. It’s self-perpetuating. Moamin Salamah Abu Ewaida, 34, is the engagement and development manager at tech hub and co-working space Gaza Sky Geeks, which launched the coding academy last year. What is essential, he says, is that freelance business skills are also taught at the academy. Each student is trained how to pitch to international clients and use job-finding websites such as Upwork, a global freelancing platform. For real-world practice during the course, local businesses and charities are offered pro bono web development work. And, crucially, Gaza Sky Geeks helps its graduates get paid, in a place that many financial institutions avoid for fears of money laundering, not to mention the fact that its de facto government has been on a US “foreign terrorist” blacklist since 1997. Gaza Sky Geeks has partnered with banks and online payment systems that can verify its credentials. Graduates have already started developing websites for international clients in Europe. “Our end goal is to use tech as a gateway. This area [Gaza], it could be the next Berlin or Dublin,” says Abu Ewaida. He warns against dismissing that dream, and says the conditions are there for a thriving freelance coding community to develop: “We have the talent. And the price for us is a little bit less than others. We can deliver.” And, regardless, “This place can give more than opportunity,” he says. “It can give hope. It’s emotional more than professional.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

2018-07-05T04:00:21Z,world,World news,"US troops should not be fighting in Niger, says President Issoufou","The president of Niger has said American and other foreign troops working in his country should limit themselves to providing training, equipment and intelligence, not fighting jihadists, in the wake of the botched raid in which five Nigerien and four US soldiers died last year. In a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian, Mahamadou Issoufou also promised to quit as president when his second term comes to an end in 2021, committing not to abolish term limits and hang on to power. Europe is not doing enough to support Niger in addressing the root causes of migration, Issoufou added. The west African country has long been a transit point for people from other parts of the continent seeking refuge or a better life in Europe, but in recent years the government has cracked down hard on the lucrative business of moving, feeding and sheltering them. Niger is doing its part to keep the number of people crossing the Mediterranean low; Europe must do more to help fight poverty and create jobs, the president said. The foreign armies operating in Niger should limit themselves to supporting the country’s own forces, he said, and not go into combat. Last October, a joint patrol was ambushed near the village of Tongo Tongo by jihadists they had been hunting, leading to a national scandal when the US president, Donald Trump, allegedly told one of the soldiers’ widows that her late husband “knew what he signed up for”. “We’re not asking foreign forces to fight in our place,” Issoufou said, sitting with his advisers in the airy presidential palace in the capital, Niamey. “We’re battling to ensure the security of our country. What we ask of our allies is to help us reinforce the operational capacity of our security forces through training, equipment and intelligence.” Asked whether his government had known US troops were fighting on the ground, he said: “That unfortunate operation with the American soldiers – of course we knew about it, because our soldiers were together. It was an intelligence-gathering operation that unfortunately had the consequences it did.” The US originally claimed it had been a reconnaissance mission, too, before US Africa Command admitted last month that the team had misrepresented what had actually been a capture-or-kill mission. As well as being president of the world’s 11th poorest country and one that is facing threats on almost all sides – from Islamic State in the Greater Sahara in the west, Boko Haram in the east, to a chaotic, divided Libya to the north – Issoufou is president of the G5 Sahel, a joint effort by five west African countries to try to bring the vast, arid Sahel under control. “The security situation in the Sahel is still very difficult. We are facing very grave threats, firstly from terrorist organisations, but not just them,” Issoufou said. “There are also organisations trafficking drugs, people and arms. So the G5 Sahel has to fight organised crime as well as terrorism. One country can’t face all that alone.” Troops have been assembled from Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad, but though the European Union, Saudi Arabia, the US and others promised €414m in funding in February, now, halfway through the year, hardly any of the money has reached the G5 Sahel bank account. In any case, according to Issoufou, those pledges only cover one year of operations, so the G5 Sahel has asked the UN security council to help it get longer-term funding. “As you can imagine, the fight against this threat will last longer than one year,” he said. “That’s what’s happened in Iraq and Syria in the fight against Isis – the most powerful armies in the world spent more than three years there.” He added: “The G5 Sahel’s objective is not just to fight terrorism – it’s also working on development. Why does terrorism arise in certain areas of the Sahel? Because of poverty. Security and development go together.” The same factors were key to stopping migration, he said, calling on the EU to step up its support of Niger after the latter criminalised the smuggling of migrants, an industry on which thousands of Nigeriens depended. “Europe is making an effort, but it’s not enough. We need more resources for development … it’s about attacking poverty,” Issoufou said. “We need to educate young Nigeriens, to train them, to look after them, to feed them. If we want to keep our young people – and it’s rural people who usually go and look for work in Europe, they’re the source of this migration – we have to try harder with developing agriculture, as that’s what creates a lot of jobs. “Niger is doing all this, but what we often lack are the resources to do it, and it’s important that Europe does more. The EU is our number one donor, and our our cooperation with them is well known, but we ask more from them.” Issoufou’s government arrested and imprisoned 26 civil society activists over a protest that went ahead in March despite being banned. Many of them have been transferred from their hometowns to prisons around the country, including in the insecure region of Tillabéri. Asked about this crackdown, Issoufou said that it was important to have a “democratic, but strong” state. “There are two things you have to avoid. Firstly, anarchy in a country, secondly, dictatorship. In a country, democracy is what? Order, and liberty. Order without freedom is dictatorship. Freedom without order is anarchy. “There’s no dictatorship in Niger. I hear people saying: ‘Oh là là, there’s a dictatorial regime in Niger.’ No. Dictatorship is not like that.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/foreign-troops-should-not-be-fighting-in-niger-says-countrys-president,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/foreign-troops-should-not-be-fighting-in-niger-says-countrys-president
2018-07-05T04:00:21Z,world,World news,Salvini's anti-migrant pledge 'practically impossible' to fulfil,"Less than a month into the job, Matteo Salvini has made headlines by barring foreign flagged migrant rescue ships from Italian ports, calling for a census of Roma and travelling to Tripoli “to help Libya as well as Italy block migration”. Italy’s interior minister has accused NGOs of “causing trouble” by rescuing people at sea, called reports of human rights abuse in Libyan migrant centres “lies”, insisted the country will take in “not one more” refugee and pledged he will never allow his country to become “a holding pen for all of Europe”. He has lost no opportunity to show his commitment to halt the mass migration that helped bring his far-right, xenophobic League party to power. But one legally complex and hugely expensive election promise – to “send home” 500,000 illegal immigrants already in Italy – may not be so easy to keep. “Practically, it’s impossible,” said Sergio Bontempelli, a migrant rights campaigner with the Association of Rights and Borders. “But it’s been happening for years – a politician comes along and says ‘we’ll send them all home’, but they are only words, which people unfortunately believe.” Bontempelli compared Salvini’s campaign tactics with those of the US president, Donald Trump, who vowed to build a wall on the Mexican border to keep out immigrants and force Mexico to pay for it.
“Words matter a lot. They don’t produce anything in terms of deportation but they do produce a lot in terms of instigating hatred and violence,” Bontempelli said. The challenge might be huge, but Salvini has already signalled that he is determined to enact promises made to his voters. Last month he blocked the arrival of over 600 migrants who were aboard the Aquarius rescue ship and has warned others that they are unwelcome. The vessel eventually docked in Spain. On Salvini’s Facebook page, supporters spur him on with encouragement whenever he repeats his vow to “get rid of them”. But they are likely to end up disappointed. The first anomaly in Salvini’s rhetoric is the figure of 500,000. “There is no credible statistic on the number of people in the country at this time without a valid residency permit,” said Christopher Hein, a professor of law and immigration policies at Luiss University in Rome. “There is also a mixture between those who have entered the territory irregularly and those who have entered with a valid entry visa but then overstayed their period of authorisation. So long as the interior minister doesn’t reveal his source, I cannot judge. But then he could easily say 2 million; where is the truth?” Hein said that a vague indicator of how many illegal immigrants might be in Italy could be gleaned from data on the numbers who had requested asylum. About 130,000 applied in 2017, with about 50,000 being turned down. However, many of those who are rejected gain protection after appealing through the courts. Italy’s deportation procedure is messy, costly and for the most part unworkable. When an illegal immigrant receives a deportation order, they are first given the choice to return home voluntarily, a procedure that is usually organised by NGOs. But few use this option, with just 1,500 expected to take it up in 2018. If they do not go home voluntarily, they are given a deadline to leave the country: failing to do so is a criminal offence. At this stage, it is also up to the immigrant to obtain travel documents and fund their journey home. For immigrants detained in one of the five centres for identification and expulsion (CIE), then it is up to Italian authorities to obtain travel documents from the countries of origin – an often insurmountable challenge given that the relevant authorities in their home countries often do not exist or function in an efficient way or do not want their citizens back – and fund their return. Italy has bilateral deportation agreements with only Nigeria, Tunisia, the Gambia, Sudan and Egypt. It is against EU law to return people to countries at war or where they could be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhumane conditions. War-riven Libya is the main departure point for migrants and refugees, the majority of whom are from sub-Saharan Africa, setting out on the treacherous sea crossing to Italy’s southern shores. Last year, 31,624 undocumented foreigners were detected in Italy, of which 6,514 were repatriated, according to interior ministry figures. “Failure to cooperate with the country of origin means that it is impossible to repatriate an irregular migrant, unless the latter is in possession of a valid identity document,” the ministry said. A person can only be held in a CIE for 90 days, although in some cases stays last a year or more, with conditions regularly criticised as inhumane. If Italy fails to deport someone, then they are released with an order to leave the country of their own accord within a week. But the majority simply disappear. Salvini said he would boost the number of detention centres to 20, one for each Italian region, in order to accelerate expulsions. His predecessor, Marco Minniti, made a similar declaration last year but failed to make progress. “In reality these centres have never worked,” said Bontempelli. “You keep people in a type of prison, causing suffering, but as a mechanism for deportation it makes no sense.” The other main impediment to Salvini’s plan is the massive expense. On top of the cost of identification, detention, legal hearings and flights, each deported migrant has to be escorted to a plane by two police officers at a cost of about €3,000 (£2,650). The total repatriation cost for one person is estimated to be between €6,000 and €15,000. “Regularising migrants [enabling them to work] would be much cheaper and would even allow for tax contributions into the state’s coffers,” said Alessandra Ballerini, a human rights and immigration lawyer. Salvini said he would use money currently spent on hosting asylum seekers to pay for mass deportations. He told voters that the previous administration’s reception policy cost €50bn. Some of the cost of migrant reception, integration and deportation is paid for via the EU’s asylum, migration and integration fund (AMIF). “But 90% of Italian taxpayer money would be needed to deport 500,000 people,” said Hein. “The fund is already being accessed and will continue to be, but it won’t be possible to say ‘we will shift half a million people and the EU should pay for it’.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/matteo-salvini-italy-migrant-pledge-practically-impossible-fulfil,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/matteo-salvini-italy-migrant-pledge-practically-impossible-fulfil

New Zealand MP fears 'existential threat' of synthetic burgers,"A veggie burger that “bleeds” fake blood has been accused of posing an “existential threat” to New Zealand’s beef industry, amid a growing row over synthetic meat. The Impossible Burger, which is being served on the national carrier Air New Zealand, has drawn the ire of the acting prime minister Winston Peters, who has said he is “utterly opposed to fake beef,” and the airline should be using real animal products.
Air New Zealand, the country’s national carrier is offering the burger – made of synthetic meat from an American company – to business class passengers on flights from Los Angeles to Auckland. New Zealand First primary industries spokesperson Mark Patterson issued a press release warning that the veggie burger could pose “an existential threat to New Zealand’s second biggest export earner” and was a “slap in the face” for the NZ$9bn red meat sector. “We have Air New Zealand actively promoting synthetic proteins which have a genetic modification component to them. This is not a good example of New Zealand Inc working together for the greater good.” National MP and agriculture spokesperson Nathan Guy said on Twitter it was “disappointing” that the airline was offering a vegetarian option, prompting non-meat eaters to say New Zealand needed to “keep up with the times.”
“If we sit here producing meat and don’t get our foot into new technology and industries that may possibly replace our own, we’re definitely sticking our head in the sand.” wrote one Twitter user in response to Guy’s tweet. In a statement, Air New Zealand said the company spent millions of dollars every year buying New Zealand beef and lamb, and the veggie burger posed no threat to the domestic red meat industry. “In the past year alone, we proudly served around 1.3m New Zealand sourced beef and lamb meals to customers from around the world.” “Air New Zealand makes no apology for offering innovative product choices for its customers and will continue to do so in the future.” According to Juliet Sear of the BBC Good Food Guide, the impossible burger - which uses genetically engineered ingredients cooked up in Silicon Valley - was “simply delicious” despite the texture being “a tad too soft and mushy.” Reviews on Treehugger.com said the burger smelt like liver and you “could definitely tell it wasn’t real meat”, while Revelist discovered the $13 lunch had “a hint of seaweed flavor”, and a “faintly wheat-y aftertaste”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/new-zealand-fake-burger-existential-threat-red-meat,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/05/new-zealand-fake-burger-existential-threat-red-meat
2018-07-04T18:00:08Z,world,World news,Witness K: ex-judge condemns prosecution of Timor-Leste bugging whistleblower,"The former New South Wales supreme court justice Anthony Whealy has warned it would be “disturbing” to prosecute a former spy and his lawyer in secret over their role in revealing Australia’s bugging of Timor-Leste’s cabinet. Solicitor Bernard Collaery and his client, the intelligence officer known only as Witness K, are facing criminal charges for bringing to light Australia’s bugging of Timor-Leste’s cabinet rooms during sensitive negotiations over a $40bn oil and gas treaty in 2004. The spy operation was designed to give Australia an upper hand and derive a commercial benefit at the expense of the Timor-Leste government, and Witness K, a senior and long-serving intelligence officer, believed it was unlawful.
Whealy, now the chair of Transparency International, said the plight of Collaery and Witness K was “deeply disturbing”, particularly at a time when the federal government was seeking to advance whistleblower protections and promising its new espionage and foreign interference laws would be used sparingly. “By any standards, the information revealed by these two men needed to be conveyed, and indeed needed to be in the public domain,” Whealy told Guardian Australia. “On its face, the bugging by Australian interests of a foreign power’s cabinet room, if that is what happened, was detestable. “It is equally disturbing that, at this stage, the threat looms that proceedings against the pair will occur in a closed courtroom, with its doors and windows barred by a potential suppression order. “This is Australia … not Russia.” The summons for Witness K and Collaery, seen by Guardian Australia, alleges the spy unlawfully communicated intelligence secrets to his lawyer. The summons alleges Collaery communicated this information to the ABC journalists Marian Wilkinson, Peter Lloyd, Conor Duffy, Emma Alberici and producer Peter Cronau. The News Corp journalist Leo Shanahan, the first to break the story on the bugging operation, is not named in the summons. Whealy is the second senior retired judge to raise such concerns. Last week the former Victorian court of appeals judge Stephen Charles expressed alarm about the prosecution and said Australia’s behaviour in the entire episode demonstrated the need for a federal anti-corruption commission. “I think it shines a light on the level of ethics and morality of parliament in Canberra that above all demonstrates we need a national integrity commission,” he told Fairfax Media. “A lot of people in legal circles are horrified by the government’s behaviour.” Witness K first raised concerns about the bugging operation internally, with the inspector-general of intelligence and security. Collaery said the inspector general gave Witness K approval to disclose the information. Prof Clinton Fernandes, an international studies expert at the University of New South Wales and former defence intelligence officer, said the prosecution appeared deliberately timed to take place after the signing of the oil and gas treaty in March and the conclusion of a parliamentary inquiry in May. “It was always on the agenda, it was just that they were just waiting to get the diplomacy out of the way,” he told Guardian Australia. Fernandes said the lack of any whistleblower protections for intelligence officers was problematic. He has authored a paper urging greater parliamentary oversight of intelligence agencies. Fernandes said Australia’s scrutiny of intelligence agencies compared poorly with the United States model.
“In the United States, the Senate and House intelligence committees have full access to intelligence and they are briefed regularly on sensitive and non-sensitive intelligence operations,” he said. “By contrast, the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security here is only empowered to examine the administration and financing of the agencies. They are not allowed to examine any operation, past, present, or proposed.” The attorney general, Christian Porter, last week said he had approved the prosecution but said the decision was made independently by the commonwealth director of public prosecutions.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jul/05/witness-k-ex-judge-condemns-prosecution-of-timor-leste-bugging-whistleblower,https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jul/05/witness-k-ex-judge-condemns-prosecution-of-timor-leste-bugging-whistleblower
2018-07-04T15:06:18Z,world,World news,Plans to rescue trapped Thai boys rapidly developing,"Plan A for rescuers trying to free the 12 Thai boys trapped in a flooded cave is to drain enough water to allow them to be pulled out through nearly a mile of tunnels, large portions of which will still be underwater. Mermaid Subsea Services in Bangkok, a company that usually provides equipment for undersea oil and gas extraction efforts, has been in talks with Thai authorities to supply masks for any attempt to extract the children through the cave system. The company is sourcing AGA Divator masks – full face scuba models – that are specially fitted for children. The boys will be dressed in wetsuits, boots and helmets, and divers will use an 8mm static rope that is already in place to guide them through the cave system, said Ruengrit Changkwanyuen, a coordinator of the Thai contingent of the international cave diving team that located the boys on Monday night.
It is unlikely the boys will carry their own 12-litre oxygen tanks – they are more likely to be provided with oxygen from a navy diver’s supply. In addition to this, filled “stage tanks” are also in place every 25 to 50 metres along the route, allowing the boys quick access to oxygen if their stocks run low. Another crucial element, which is less technical, will be the use of Thai-speaking divers with whom the boys have formed some bond. “They need the comfort, they need to speak to someone in their mother tongue, someone who can keep them calm,” said Torsten Torsten Lechler, a diver who works for Mermaid Subsea Services.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/04/plans-to-rescue-trapped-thai-boys-developing-rapidly,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/04/plans-to-rescue-trapped-thai-boys-developing-rapidly
2018-07-04T12:22:07Z,world,World news,Merkel defends migration policy after Seehofer showdown,"Angela Merkel has sought to defend her government’s migration policy in her first speech to parliament since a showdown with the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, over the policing of Germany’s borders. The German chancellor spoke up for the compromise agreement the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) struck with its smaller partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU), to erect transit zones along the southern German border to speed up the deportation of ineligible asylum seekers, insisting migration had to be better regulated. “We must have more regulation regarding every type of migration, so that people have the impression that law and order are being enforced,” Merkel told a packed Bundestag, in a speech intended to show she is still in control after intense speculation that her 13-year chancellorship was about to end. Stressing that migration was a “global problem requiring a global solution” and countries could not go it alone, she said the EU’s future was dependent on a solution being found. “How we deal with the migrant question will decide whether Europe continues to exist in the future,” she said, referring to her fraught attempts to secure deals with other EU members to accept the return of refugees who had registered in their countries. At the same time, she underlined the necessity of protecting Europe’s outer borders more effectively as well as agreeing partnerships with African countries to tackle illegal migration and lessen the incentives for economic migration. But the chancellor, looking tired and pale after weeks of late-night negotiations in Brussels and Berlin, came under fire from almost all parties, in particular the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, whose parliamentary leader, Alice Weidel, demanded her immediate resignation. “Under your regime, Germany has shifted from being a motor and stability guarantor to a driver of chaos,” she said. She referred to the battle within Merkel and Seehofer’s conservative alliance as “undignified theatrics”, and Germany as “a madhouse, the headquarters of which is the chancellery”, before urging Merkel to “put an end to this tragedy – please resign at last”. While Weidel spoke, Merkel had her head down, concentrating on the finishing touches to a speech on the nation’s budget. Christian Lindner, the head of the pro-business Free Democrats, accused Merkel of having failed to find a satisfactory solution to the government’s refugee policy since the late summer of 2015, when nearly 1 million refugees arrived in Germany. He accused Merkel of failing to consult her junior coalition partner, the Social Democratic party (SPD), which crucially has yet to give its go-ahead to the transit zones. The party is in a quandary over whether to accept the zones, which many members have compared to prisons and even concentration camps, or risk the collapse of the coalition. The SPD was quick to attack Seehofer, who had offered his resignation as minister and CDU leader on Sunday, blaming him for bringing the government to the brink of collapse with his so-called migration masterplan, over certain details of which he and Merkel have been at loggerheads. Andrea Nahles, the SPD leader, said: “We don’t need masterplans, we need good craftsmanship.” Other SPD members stressed that the transit zones were a fudge, not least because on average, only five asylum seekers a day were currently attempting to enter Germany via the south. Among the fiercest critics of Seehofer was Dietmar Bartsch, the parliamentary leader of the far-left Die Linke. That Seehofer was sitting in the Bundestag on his 69th birthday, he said, should be viewed as a one-off birthday treat. “You will not be sitting here as interior minister on your 70th birthday,” he said. Bartsch accused the CSU of a ruthless attitude towards refugees, insisting the “C” in CDU and CSU no longer stood for “Christian” but for “chaos”. To resounding laughter across the chamber, he said: “I believe you would have smilingly deported Jesus.” Seehofer sat in contemplative silence, his chin in his hand, not once contributing to the debate. Merkel’s next hurdle will be to secure the support of the SPD, which has been holding emergency meetings round the clock to discuss whether it is ready to approve the transit zones, but has yet to reach a unified position, with most misgivings coming from the left wing of the party. Neighbouring Austria’s position also remains open. Its government, which on Tuesday expressed its scepticism about the transit zones, has yet to agree to back them, not least because this would require Vienna to agree to take back refugees who had registered in Austria. Seehofer is due to travel to Austria on Thursday in an attempt to hammer out a deal with the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz. In an interview with German television, Merkel gave a little more detail about the way the transit centres would work, insisting it was wrong to view them like prisons and adding that people would be kept in them for a maximum of two days. The centres work on the basis that they would house those asylum seekers who had registered in other EU countries before being returned to those countries. Asked by German television whether the new policy marked a toughening of her migration stance, and whether the once “open door” Merkel had turned into the “closing off” chancellor, she replied: “No, a clear no.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/04/merkel-defends-migration-policy-after-seehofer-showdown,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/04/merkel-defends-migration-policy-after-seehofer-showdown
2018-07-04T12:16:17Z,world,World news,"Fears grow for safety of 270,000 Syrians fleeing fighting in Deraa","Fears are mounting about the safety of more than 270,000 civilians who have fled recent fighting in southern Syria, with aid groups and local doctors issuing urgent appeals for people stranded in the desert without shelter. Fighting in Deraa province, a strategic area that borders both Jordan and Israel, has halted while negotiations for a surrender deal between rebels in the region and the Syrian government’s main backer, Russia, continue. But UN officials say more than 270,000 people have fled their homes in the last two weeks, including 160,000 who have headed towards the Golan Heights and the Israeli border. More than 200 civilians are believed to have been killed in the fighting in Deraa, which is meant to be a “de-escalation” zone with a ceasefire guaranteed by Russia, Turkey and Iran in place. The latest bout of violence began in mid-June after a year of relative peace, while the regime of Bashar al-Assad pursued military campaigns in other parts of the country.
“The humanitarian situation is bad,” said one doctor in Quneitra, near the Golan Heights, who asked to remain anonymous owing to concerns for his family’s safety. “It’s a small area to which entire towns and villages have been displaced, and it’s a major tragedy.” Deraa is symbolic to the Syrian opposition. Deraa city was the birthplace of protests in 2011 that spread throughout Syria before evolving into the rebellion against the Assad regime. Most of the opposition fighters in the region are members of moderate rebel groups, part of the Southern Front alliance backed by the US and UK, and managed from a command centre in the Jordanian capital, Amman. Once one of the most powerful branches of the rebellion, the Southern Front has long been hobbled by the reluctant support of their backers and fractures within their own ranks. Western allies signalled last month they would not intervene militarily to protect their proxies. The Assad regime and Russia turned their military attention towards Deraa after securing other large swaths of Syria, including Aleppo and eastern Ghouta, following a brutal siege and bombardment. The offensive in Deraa has followed a similar pattern of splitting rebel territory and negotiating “reconciliation deals”, whereby rebels lay down arms and are either forcibly displaced to opposition-held territory north near the Turkish border, or remain under government authority. Some parts of southern Syria have already surrendered, and a ceasefire has taken hold for two days amid negotiations between rebel groups and the Russians.
Medics say eight hospitals have been bombed since the offensive began on 19 June. Ahmad al-Dbis, an official at the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations, which manages hospitals in opposition-controlled parts of Syria, said three of its staff had been killed along with three other medical workers. In total, more than 210 civilians were killed and 500 injured, including rescue workers. But the massive displacement of civilians has caught many by surprise, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis in a country where half the population has been displaced over the seven years of war. The offensive on Deraa has been rumoured for months, but was politically sensitive for Israel in particular owing to the possible involvement of Iranian-backed militias and fears that they would establish a presence so close to the border. Israel has said it would not allow refugees to enter the country. Jordan is also facing mounting pressure to open its border to people fleeing the violence, particularly since local families on both sides of the border share a common heritage and often inter-married before the war. Images and video on social media showed Jordanians flocking to the border with aid supplies for the fleeing Syrians. But Amman, which sealed the border in 2016 after Islamic State militants killed border guards in a car bombing, has resisted the calls and urged a negotiated ceasefire. More than 600,000 Syrian refugees are already in Jordan. Amnesty International called on Jordan to open its borders. “Daraa residents are effectively trapped – many of those who are displaced are living in makeshift tents in the searing heat with insufficient food, water or medical care, and with the constant fear of being exposed to attacks at any given point,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty’s Middle East research director. “Jordan’s border is their only gateway to safety.” Local doctors say civilians who fled to the border areas are exposed, lacking shelter, tents, sufficient food and water, as well as sanitation. At least 12 children are believed to have died from scorpion bites, dehydration and , drinking contaminated water. Many more are in danger of sunstroke.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/04/fears-grow-for-safety-270000-syrians-fleeing-deraa-russia-civilians,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/04/fears-grow-for-safety-270000-syrians-fleeing-deraa-russia-civilians
2018-07-04T07:54:21Z,world,World news,Najib Razak charged over multibillion 1MDB corruption scandal,"The former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak has appeared in court in Kuala Lumpur where he was charged with corruption-related offences over his alleged involvement in the multibillion-dollar 1MBD corruption scandal. In a stunning fall from grace, the former prime minister was charged with three counts of criminal breach of trust and one count of corruption, in a prosecution led by the attorney general, Tommy Thomas. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Najib said: “I claim trial” in a barely audible voice as he stood in the dock at the high court. Prosecutors demanded 4m ringgit (nearly $1m) bail, but the judge granted it at 1m ringgit in cash ($250,000) and ordered Najib to surrender his two diplomatic passports. The court has also allowed an interim gag order sought by Najib’s lawyers, which restricts media discussions around merits of the case, except for what is presented in court. The attorney general said his team opposed the order and they would file a formal response. It is unclear how the scope of the order might restrict reporting of events. Najib faces allegations that, between August 2011 and March 2015, 42m Malaysian ringgit ($10m) was transferred from SRC International, a 1MDB subsidiary, to his personal bank accounts. Each count carries a possible sentence of up to 20 years in prison. Whipping is also a penalty but Najib, 64, would be exempt because of his age. The charges also carry a possible fine, which would be no less than five times the value of the funds in question. The charges, relating to offences which allegedly occurred over a period of more than three years, refer to Najib’s role in various government posts, including as prime minister and minister of finance. In the first charge, for example, Najib is accused of criminal breach of trust in relation to a sum of $6.7m, in both positions. The court charge sheets also refer to the AmIslamic bank, the bank where Najib held an account through which illicit funds were allegedly channelled.
The former leader was arrested at his home on Tuesday. After being held overnight at the anti-corruption commission, Najib arrived at 8.20am at the court complex in Kuala Lumpur, wearing a dark blue suit and a red tie. Crowds jostled to catch a glance of the former leader as he was led to a sessions court. Some members of Najib’s UMNO party chanted and held up placards in solidarity. Following the hearings on Wednesday, pandemonium erupted at the court complex when Thomas was scheduled to give a statement to the press. Raucous Najib supporters heckled intensively and demanded that he speak in Malay, knowing that he often gives statements in English. They were eventually escorted out by police. When the attorney general eventually spoke he was flanked by heavily armed police. Fahmi Reza, a Malaysian artist who was jailed last year for publishing a caricature of Najib looking like a clown, was among the throng of people that gathered outside the court . “Finally we can hope to see some justice being served,” said Fahmi. Convicted in the same court of charges that he continues to appeal against, Fahmi noted how dramatically the tables in Malaysian politics had turned. “I think this sends a really strong message to all politicians, including people in the current government, that you won’t get away,” he added. The 1MDB corruption scandal, described as the biggest in Malaysia’s history, saw billions of dollars allegedly embezzled and lavishly spent around the globe, on luxury property, a private yacht, Hollywood films and extravagant shopping sprees. Najib has consistently denied the charges, last week telling local news portal Malaysiakini that his trial would be a “test” for the Malaysian judiciary. “I believe in my innocence. Therefore, the only way I can clear my name is through a system that is fair and a system that is predicated on the rule of law,” he said, “Everybody [should have] a chance to prove themselves under the system.”
Najib was going home on Wednesday after posting the agreed bail, but told the press he maintained his innocence and hope for a fair trial. “I believe in my innocence and this is the best chance for me to clear my name after all the slander and accusations against me,” he said. “I have served the people and the country for 42 years. If this is the price I have to pay, I am willing.” Commenting on the gag order, Najib’s lawyer Shafee Abdullah said it was designed to prevent prejudicial reporting of the case. “If you and your loved ones face the same situation, then you will know the importance,” he said. The arrest and trial of the former prime minister follows a surprise electoral defeat in May, which brought Najib’s former mentor, 92-year-old Mahathir Mohamad, back to power. Mahathir had pledged to investigate the 1MDB scandal if he was elected. An investigation into 1MDB by Najib’s government previously cleared him of any wrongdoing, but there was seemingly little room for a different outcome at the time.
Several political figures, including the then deputy prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, were removed from their posts after making critical remarks about Najib’s handling of the corruption allegations, while the government suspended the licence of one media organisation that rigorously reported the case. It is unclear whether the former first lady Rosmah Mansor – who is widely known and deplored for her extravagances, from Birkin bags to diamond-studded watches and tiaras – will also be arrested in connection with the scandal. Najib and Rosmah have both been questioned by anti-graft investigators and are blacklisted to prevent them leaving the country. Recent raids on several of Najib’s properties in Kuala Lumpur revealed extraordinary wealth, with authorities seizing cash and luxury goods, including hundreds of designer handbags and jewellery worth $273m. • Additional reporting by King Chai",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/04/najib-razak-charged-over-multibillion-dollar-1mdb-corruption-scandal,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/04/najib-razak-charged-over-multibillion-dollar-1mdb-corruption-scandal
2018-07-04T07:53:08Z,world,World news,Archbishop Philip Wilson to appeal conviction for concealing child abuse,"The archbishop of Adelaide, Philip Wilson, will appeal his conviction and sentence for concealing child sexual abuse. Wilson is the most senior Catholic official in the world to be convicted of the crime. On Tuesday, Magistrate Robert Stone in Newcastle local court sentenced the 67-year-old to 12 months’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of six months. He ordered that Wilson be assessed for home detention. Wilson was found guilty in May of failing to report to police the abuse of two altar boys by a paedophile priest, James Fletcher, in the 1970s.
On Wednesday afternoon Wilson announced he would lodge an appeal. “I am conscious of calls for me to resign and have taken them very seriously,” he said in a statement. “However, at this time, I am entitled to exercise my legal rights and to follow the due process of law. Since that process is not yet complete, I do not intend to resign at this time. “However, if I am unsuccessful in my appeal, I will immediately offer my resignation to the Holy See.” The archdiocese cannot remove Wilson from his role – only Pope Francis has the authority. The prime minister and opposition leader are among those calling on him to quit. “I am surprised that he has not resigned,” Malcolm Turnbull told reporters on Wednesday. “Clearly, given the outcome of the case, the lawsuit and prosecution, he should resign.” Bill Shorten said the justice system had unequivocally spoken. “Mr Wilson’s action were inexcusable and his position is untenable,” he said in a statement. Peter Creigh and another altar boy gave evidence that they told Wilson in 1976 that Fletcher had repeatedly abused them in the New South Wales Hunter region but that Fletcher, who was then an assistant priest, had done nothing. Creigh was 10 years old at the time. The second altar boy, who can’t be named for legal reasons, said he was about 11 when he went into the confessional box to tell Wilson that Fletcher had abused him. He said Wilson had told him he was telling lies because Fletcher “was a good bloke”. Wilson told the court during the magistrate-only trial that he couldn’t remember being told about the abuse. The court heard he is potentially suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. But in delivering his sentence Stone said Wilson was primarily motivated by a desire to protect the Catholic church and that “there is no remorse or contrition showed by the offender”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/04/archbishop-philip-wilson-to-appeal-conviction-for-concealing-child-abuse,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/04/archbishop-philip-wilson-to-appeal-conviction-for-concealing-child-abuse
2018-07-04T07:00:21Z,world,World news,Nicaragua's president Daniel Ortega to stand firm despite violence,"Nicaragua’s Daniel Ortega will not stand down as president despite more than two months of unrest and violent repression, one his closest advisers has said, accusing opposition activists of trying to engineer a “soft coup”. Paul Oquist, the minister for national policies, told the Guardian Ortega would not rule out an early election if there were an end to the violence in which about 300 people have been killed. An early poll is a central demand of Ortega’s opponents, but they point out the vast majority of the deaths have been caused by government security forces or their paramilitary allies.
This week, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) sent an investigative team to Nicaragua, the members of which included Guatemala’s former attorney general Claudia Paz y Paz and Sofía Macher, a former head of Peru’s truth and reconciliation commission. In an interview in London, Oquist said the protesters had no coherent programme and included people who were committed to destabilising the country. “There are peaceful demonstrators to be sure, but there is a pro-coup movement trying to destabilise the country using organised looting parties, fake news and quite depraved killings,” he said. Ortega, a former revolutionary leader, was elected in 2006, but has been accused of increasingly autocratic rule as he and his wife, Rosario Murillo, who is also the vice-president, have tightened their control of state institutions. His opponents have warned Nicaragua risks open conflict if the ruling couple do not stand down, but Oquist said: “If we are going to have governments changed according to whichever side has more barricades on the streets, we will never get out of the violence.” Peace talks mediated by the Catholic church have so far made little progress, which Oquist attributed to the fact that the meetings have been televised and included as many as 30 opposition representatives at a time. “If the violence stops, and the barricades strangling the economy are lifted, President Ortega’s position is that there is nothing that cannot be put on the table, including when elections are held,” he said. Oquist also suggested neighbouring countries of the Central American Integration System could help mediate, claiming a statement at the weekend calling for dialogue and an end to the violence constituted “a turning point in the entire process”. “They have a credibility to look for an agreement that sticks. This is the beginning of a solution. It means the Central American presidents have come on the scene big time to support this process,” he said. Ortega’s opponents suspect his enthusiasm for external involvement is a ploy to buy time and drain energy from protesters. Regional leaders have also expressed concern that demonstrators’ roadblocks are damaging not only Nicaragua’s economy, but the mobility of transport across the region.
Oquist acknowledged the social security changes that caused the revolt were mistaken, but said they were recommended by the International Monetary Fund and had been withdrawn within four days of protests starting. An election is due in 2021, but one of the opposition’s key demands is that it be brought forward to 2019, even if some quietly fear this will not give them enough time to find a candidate after years of Sandinista domination. Oquist said Ortega was willing to discuss the timetable, but “if the violence does not cease, it would be crazy to go into an electoral process. You would have massacres in every municipality as electoral forces clash”. “The longer this takes to resolve, the worse it is going to be. Nicaragua was seen the most secure country in central America and drawing private investment as a result,” he said. “We were the one country that had blocked the drugs cartels. All that has been blown out of the water. It will take years and years to recover.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/04/nicaragua-president-daniel-ortega-stand-firm-violence-adviser-soft-coup,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/04/nicaragua-president-daniel-ortega-stand-firm-violence-adviser-soft-coup
2018-07-04T06:53:57Z,world,World news,Police clash with young people in Nantes after man shot dead,"Groups of young people have clashed with French police in Nantes after a 22-year-old man was shot dead by an officer during a police check. Cars were burned, petrol bombs were thrown, a shopping centre was set alight and a library and several buildings were damaged in the Breil neighbourhood in the early hours of Wednesday. The police watchdog has opened an investigation into the circumstances of the man’s shooting. Johanna Rolland, the Socialist mayor of Nantes, called for clarity on the death and said any investigation must take place independently and with full transparency. The local police chief, Jean-Christophe Bertrand, said the incident happened at 8.30pm when police stopped a car. The identity of the driver was unclear and officers received orders to bring the driver to the police station, he added. The driver then reversed his car, hit and slightly injured a police officer.
“One of his colleagues then fired, hitting the young man, who unfortunately died,” Bertrand said. Police sources confirmed the man was wounded during a police check after he “refused to comply” with officers’ requests. He was hit in the carotid artery and declared dead on arrival at hospital, police sources said. Steven, 24, who lives in the area, told Agence France-Presse he had heard explosions and went to investigate. “I saw everything burning. There were fires in the bins, the cars. They were breaking everything. It lasted ages,” he said, adding that the situation later calmed down. Violence also broke out in two other areas, Dervallieères and Malakoff, where cars were set on fire. Local associations and youth workers came out to try to calm protesters.
The poor relationship between police and young people on French housing estates has been a flashpoint for more than a decade, and politicians have struggled to address the issue. French police are regularly accused of using excessive force in poorer neighbourhoods, particularly against people from ethnic minorities. The death in police custody in 2016 of a young black man, Adama Traoré, in Beaumont-sur-Oise outside Paris, and the slow reaction of authorities, has led to accusations of police violence and a state cover-up. An investigation is continuing. In 2005, weeks of riots erupted after two teenagers were electrocuted when they hid in an substation in Clichy-sous-Bois, north of Paris, while being chased by police. Their deaths caused the worst rioting in France for 40 years. After a decade of legal battles by their families, police officers stood trial and were cleared of failing to help Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/04/french-police-clash-with-youths-in-nantes-after-man-shot-dead,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/04/french-police-clash-with-youths-in-nantes-after-man-shot-dead
2018-07-04T06:19:35Z,world,World news,Thai cave rescue: boys 'learning to dive' before new storm,"The 12 boys trapped in a cave in northern Thailand are being trained in how to breathe with scuba equipment as they prepare for a possible attempt at leaving the cave. Thai authorities are racing to drain water from the cave where the boys and their football coach are stranded before storms arrive, after which extraction will become “almost impossible” for months, according to a coordinator of the international rescue effort.
Teaching the boys, none of whom knows how to swim, to use breathing apparatus so they can be escorted out of the cave system by rescue divers, is thought to be the most realistic option that would allow boys to be rescued from the caves before monsoon rains hit later in the week. While they are learning to use the gear, none has made any attempt to get through the water hemming them in. Even if authorities manage to drain enough water to allow the boys to crawl most of the way out of the cave, they would still need to pass through short underwater passages.
Ruengrit Changkwanyuen, a coordinator of the Thai contingent of the international cave diving team that located the boys on Monday night, said the group was on high ground and safe from flash flooding. “But rescuers have to work quickly because by Friday a storm is coming, and if the rain starts again the cave is going to be fully flooded,” Changkwanyuen said. “If that happens it will be almost impossible to send supplies or keep in touch with them.”
New footage emerged of the children on Wednesday morning showing them being treated by a Thai navy doctor who spent the night around four kilometres inside the cave complex where the boys have been trapped for the past 11 days. A nurse and up to four soldiers are also with the group in a raised cavern near an area known as Pattaya Beach and were monitoring their health and trying to keep their spirits high. “We are taking care of them as our own kids,” said Narongsak Osatanakorn, the governor of Chiang Rai province. A spokesman for the Thai government said the mental health of the boys had been managed by their coach throughout the ordeal. “[He] is advising them that they need to lie down, of course meditation, try not to move their bodies too much, try not to waste their energy,” lieutenant-general Werachon Sukondhapatipak said. Authorities said they appeared mentally and physically healthy after receiving food and water supplies, but were yet to speak to their parents. An attempt to send a mobile phone into the cavern was botched when a waterproof seal around the device was broken. They are preparing to send another.
“Once the phone gets to them, we want the families to talk with them and a lot of pressure will be relieved,” an army spokesman said on Tuesday. Thai officials said on Tuesday that no extraction was imminent. “Today we won’t be able to,” Osatanakorn said at a morning briefing. “We have to be 100% sure all kids will come out at the same time. Some might be ready before others. If they’re not ready, or it’s risky, we will not take them out.”
Authorities were sticking to their main plan of trying to drain enough water from the cave to allow the boys to be pulled out, he said, efforts that have been aided by an unseasonably dry day in Mae Sei. “The most important thing is to lower water levels,” Osatanakorn said. “Water has decreased a lot but when it’s raining we can’t fight it. If it doesn’t rain we can have good results. Time is limited in getting the kids out.” He said more water was currently being pumped out of the site than was seeping in and divers were working to seal holes in the rocks around the boys. But he declined to set a time frame for their evacuation. “It all depends,” he said. Mermaid Subsea Services in Bangkok, a company that usually provides equipment for undersea oil and gas extraction efforts, has been in talks with Thai authorities to supply masks for any attempt to extract the children through the cave system. The company is sourcing AGA Divator masks – full face scuba models – that are specially fitted for children.
The boys will be dressed in wetsuits, boots and helmets, and divers will use an 8mm static rope that is already in place to guide them through the cave system, said Changkwanyuen. It is unlikely the boys will carry their own 12-litre oxygen tanks – they are more likely to be provided the oxygen from a navy diver’s supply. In addition to this primary supply, fully filled “stage tanks” are also in place every 25 to 50 metres along the route, allowing the boys quick access to oxygen if their stocks are running low. Chinese diver Zhou Yahui, who had just returned from the cave, said: “The water level will drop, but that doesn’t mean they won’t have to dive. It’s impossible to guarantee that.” Hundreds of Thai soldiers and police are also being airlifted into the dense jungles above the cave system to scour for access points that might provide easier ways to access the children. Any such discoveries might also allow authorities to drill directly into the cavern where the boys are sheltering, regarded as a potentially less risky method of extraction in contrast to forcing the children through a muddy, jagged cave system that is leaving some rescue divers with cuts and bruises. Volunteer divers involved with the search for the boys said bringing them out through the cave if it started to rain was fraught with risks. “It’s not the easiest way and it’s definitely the scariest way,” said Claus Rasmussen, one of the international team working with the Thai navy.
“It’s a huge cave system, almost 10km long,” said Maksym Polejaka, another cave diver who spent five days leading Thai navy seals through the complex before the boys were found. When rains are heavy, most of the cave system is completely submerged, he said. “You only have air pockets. You dive for 20 metres, then surface. Then you dive for 30 metres, then surface. The biggest passage you need to dive [takes] maybe 20 minutes.” Rain also brings strong currents that slow progress dramatically and make swimming impossible, he added. “After the current becomes slower, you can swim, but hardly.” Divers took more than three hours to reach the ledge where the boys are sheltering on Monday, but moving with the current on their return took about 50 minutes. “The water level is stable now because hundreds of pumps are removing water and people are trying to block the sources. But if you stopped pumping, or if it rained, the water level would immediately rise,” Polejaka said. Rasmussen said rescue options were being reassessed “on an hourly basis” as weather reports and water levels inside the cave changed. Even a small amount of rain would quickly flood the cave system and upend all the progress made so far to drain it. “[Rain] is the only thing that can truly upset what is going on, unless one of the kids gets sick,” he said. As well as finding ways to extract the boys in the coming days, Thai navy seals are also planning for a scenario in which the rescue cannot take place, preparing to send food and medical supplies that could last the next four months until the monsoon subsides. Thai soldiers conducted their first evacuation drill on Tuesday afternoon, locking arms to form a column from the mouth of the cave towards a field where 13 ambulances are waiting to ferry the group to hospital. Mental health workers said one of them would be assigned to accompany each child in the ambulance along with one of the boy’s parents. The group have been inside the cave since 23 June, when they wandered inside after a football training session and are thought to have become trapped by rising water levels.

2018-07-04T06:00:20Z,world,World news,The truth about Stonewall – the LGBT group that won't support London Pride,"From the outside, the spat between Britain’s biggest Pride festival and the country’s main LGBT organisation may look a bit Queer Front of Judea. Earlier this year, Stonewall pulled out of this Saturday’s Pride in London festival, citing a lack of diversity and committing to back Black Pride instead. UK Pride has hit back with a survey showing that Pride organisers rate Stonewall poorly. Ouch. Without wishing to intervene too much in this internecine grief, Stonewall does not deserve to be disparaged. Until relatively recently, the organisation seemed as though it catered for white, gay, middle-class, cis men, who dominate the LGBT world. Its focus was on securing legal rights, often via a softly-softly, “cups of tea with powerful people” approach. Even then, it refused for a long time to support equal marriage. One of its biggest letdowns was to fail to include trans people in its campaign for equality. This has changed radically under Ruth Hunt, who has run the organisation for four years. There are still clear limits to Stonewall’s radicalism – it is, after all, dependent on corporate donations – but Hunt has addressed many of its failings. It apologised for “harm that we have caused” for failing to campaign for trans rights and has proved an invaluable ally to trans people, not least during the recent anti-trans media moral panic. Hunt has been inundated with abuse for taking a brave stance, including from anti-trans activists infuriated that a cis, self-described “butch lesbian” is a leading trans ally (their narrative has been that trans rights is brocialist and anti-women). It has also been prepared to tell the LGBT world some disturbing home truths: a recent report exposed rampant racism in LGBT communities, with more than half of LGBT people of colour saying that they had experienced discrimination. Its backing for Black Pride – so critical in challenging the white, middle-class, gay, male dominance of the LGBT world – shows it understands the need to link the struggle against homophobia and transphobia to anti-racism, too. There is still a need for more radical voices, such as Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants, which is running a campaign targeting airlines that sponsor Pride while assisting forced deportations of gay migrants to homophobic countries. But, from trans rights to racism, Stonewall’s shift under Hunt has been courageous. The struggle for LGBT rights was never only about legal rights, of course: this week’s publication of the national survey of LGBT people, which showed that most (68%) are afraid to hold hands in the streets and 40% have been subjected to hate crimes, proves how far there is to go. A more assertive Stonewall will undoubtedly play a key role in the struggle for genuine LGBT equality and liberation.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2018/jul/04/the-truth-about-stonewall-the-lgbt-group-that-wont-support-london-pride,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/shortcuts/2018/jul/04/the-truth-about-stonewall-the-lgbt-group-that-wont-support-london-pride

2018-07-04T05:42:06Z,world,World news,British same-sex couple granted spouse visas in landmark Hong Kong legal battle,"Hong Kong’s highest court on Wednesday ordered immigration officials to grant spousal visas to a same-sex expatriate couple, ending a closely watched years-long legal battle.
Since 2014 a British national, known in court as QT, has been trying to apply for a spousal visa to accompany her partner, also a British national, who works in Hong Kong. The couple, who entered a civil partnership in the UK in 2004, have been repeatedly denied a spousal visa for QT on the basis that Hong Kong does not recognise same-sex unions as marriages. In a landmark decision last year, Hong Kong’s court of appeals overturned a lower court’s ruling to uphold the immigration department’s judgment. The government then appealed that decision in Hong Kong’s court of final appeal in a case that became a rallying point for LGBT advocates, as well as the city’s financial industry. On Wednesday, the court upheld the appeals court ruling, judging the immigration department’s behaviour as discriminatory and unjustified. “Today’s ruling by the Court of Final Appeal affirms what millions of us in this wonderful and vibrant city know to be true, that discrimination based on sexual orientation, like any other form of discrimination is offensive and demeaning,” QT said in a statement read out by her lawyer after the ruling. “Once again this court has said loud and clear that equality before the law applies to all persons in HK, including the LGBTI community,” she said. The court of final appeals cautioned that the decision did not change the definition of marriage, which it defined as heterosexual and monogamous. “By definition, it is not a status open to couples of the same sex,” the court said in its ruling. Advocates celebrated the decision on Wednesday as a step towards gay rights in Hong Kong, which decriminalised homosexuality in 1991. “This judgment is a milestone for Hong Kong and a watershed moment for the rights of LGBTI people across Asia,” said Jan Wetzel, senior legal adviser at Amnesty International. “The government must now follow up and end the discrimination same-sex couples face in all walks of life ... No one should experience discrimination because of who they are, or who they love,” Wetzel said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/04/uk-same-sex-couple-granted-spouse-visas-hong-kong,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/04/uk-same-sex-couple-granted-spouse-visas-hong-kong
2018-07-04T05:27:53Z,world,World news,Wednesday briefing: 'Unknown substance' alert in Wiltshire,"Top story: Pair critically ill in Salisbury hospital Hello, I’m Warren Murray with the news to start your Wednesday. Salisbury hospital is at the centre of another major incident this morning as a woman and a man lie critically ill from a possible poisoning. Authorities say the couple in their 40s were initially thought to have fallen victim to tainted heroin or crack cocaine after they were found unconscious at an Amesbury address on Saturday evening. “However, further testing is now ongoing to establish the substance which led to these patients becoming ill and we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding this incident,” said a police statement. A major incident has been declared. Several areas they visited were cordoned off in Amesbury, as well as in Salisbury, about eight miles away, where Sergei Skripal, 67, and his daughter Yulia, 33, nearly died in March after being exposed to the Russian-created nerve agent novichok. * * * Now to get them out – More video has emerged overnight of the boys trapped down a flooded cave in Thailand. Survivors of prolonged underground rescue ordeals in Australia and Chile have said keeping up morale is key as the operation to free the 12 boys and their coach continues.
Thai authorities are racing to finalise rescue plans before storms that are forecast for the end of the week – after which an extraction could become “almost impossible” for months. Authorities have drawn up several plans including drilling into the rock and pulling each one through the complex with a diver but no plan has yet been committed to, according to the governor of Chiang Rai province. * * * England go through – The curse is broken! Gareth Southgate praised his young team for creating “their own history” after England triumphed in a penalty shootout for the first time at the World Cup and secured passage into a quarter-final against Sweden on Saturday at the expense of Colombia, sparking celebratory scenes.
Eric Dier scored the winning spot kick in Moscow but it was Jordan Pickford, England’s flying superhero, who set up victory and delivered the final word for his critics. For Southgate, who missed a penalty at Euro 96, the manner of victory could be viewed, at the most basic level, as redemption 22 years in the making. There’s more World Cup news in the usual spot further down … * * * Quick catch-up – Here is the latest on this week’s developing stories. > Regions outside London will be worst hit by Brexit, according to economic forecasting. Export industry jobs will be at risk while groceries will be dearer because non-EU imports will not mitigate the higher cost of goods from the EU. > The death of a girl aged six on the Isle of Bute is being treated as murder, Scottish police have confirmed. Alesha MacPhail’s body was found in woodland on Monday. > More than 200 migrants have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean in the past three days. “Smugglers are exploiting the desperation of migrants to leave before there are further crackdowns on Mediterranean crossings by Europe,” said Othman Belbeisi from the International Organization for Migration (IOM). > The former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak has appeared in court amid hectic scenes to face charges over the 1MDB corruption scandal. > Britain is to foot £5m in extra policing costs for Donald Trump’s golf trip to Scotland. The president is predicted to visit his resort at Turnberry after seeing Theresa May and the Queen. * * * Precision medicine – New cancer patients in England will routinely have DNA tests for genetic mutations that can point doctors towards the best drugs, treatments or experimental therapies in each case. It will make the NHS the first health service in the world to routinely offer genomic medicine. The service will at first focus mainly on cancers and rare diseases but in future may be used to pre-empt adverse drug reactions and reveal the risk of severe early onset diseases such as Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis and dementia. The scheme comes in from 1 October in England, with discussions under way about possibly extending it to the devolved regions. * * * Baby murder arrest – A healthcare worker is suspected of murdering eight babies and attempting to kill another six at the Countess of Chester hospital. In all, the police investigation covers the deaths of 17 babies and 15 non-fatal collapses between March 2015 and July 2016. The hospital was recently found to have had the highest neonatal mortality rate of all similar-sized facilities in Britain in 2015. Its maternity unit has been downgraded after an official report criticised staffing levels and procedures. * * * Go for walks, they said – Doing 10,000 steps a day is not enough exercise unless you are carrying a decent load of shopping for at least some of it. Public Health England says strength and balancing exercises are also needed, especially for people aged over 40. As well as long walks “you should also do yoga or tai chi or racket sports or resistance training which could be in a structured exercise class. You can do two long sessions a week,” says Louise Ansari from the Centre for Ageing Better. Always using the stairs, making a point of carrying heavy things and dance of all sorts are also good, says Ansari. “As long as you are feeling the ache in your muscles.” * * * Bums away – “The recent police advice about warning your neighbours if you’re going to sunbathe naked in your garden is fine if it’s general advice, but it’s not in any sense a legal requirement.” The bare facts from Andrew Welch of British Naturism, after Surrey police said those planning any gardening in the buff during the warm weather needed to be mindful of others. There is indeed no law against toplessness or nakedness – but, say the police, “you will have to decide whether your desire to be naked in your garden is more important to you than being on friendly terms with those around you”. World Cup Our live blog is where the after-party is at this morning after England made the quarter finals. Sweden now stand in England’s path after their 1-0 win over Switzerland in the day’s other last-16 tie. Emil Forsberg’s deflected strike in the second half put paid to Swiss hopes. Having already accounted for Germany, Italy and the Netherlands at the finals and in qualification, at some point now people might have to stop being surprised at Sweden’s progress. And Mikel John Obi was told that his father had been kidnapped and would be killed if he reported anything – just hours before he led Nigeria into their final World Cup group phase tie against Argentina.

In the wash-up, the answer to the world’s electricity needs could be squadrons of tidal kites, an underwater metronome, seawater surging back through giant turbines, heat engines – or a combination of these and other emerging wave power technologies, as Damian Carrington writes. Sport The former Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova, struggling to reassert herself a year after returning from a doping ban, suffered her first ever defeat in the opening round while Petra Kvitová, the pre-tournament favourite after five titles in 2018 and near-perfect preparation, also endured a shock first-round defeat. In the men’s draw, Britain’s No 1 Kyle Edmund recorded a low-key victory on a day when thoughts in SW19 were on the absent Andy Murray and, more importantly, the World Cup. Rafael Nadal and Alexander Zverev, meanwhile, both made progress with the minimum of fuss. Kuldeep Yadav’s left-arm wrist-spin proved an indecipherable code for England’s batsmen as a sea of blue at Old Trafford roared India on to victory in the first of three Twenty20s between the two sides. And the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, has described Mercedes’s decision to have their chief strategist, James Vowles, publicly apologise for a strategy error at the Austrian Grand Prix as Vowles throwing himself under the bus to motivate Lewis Hamilton. Business Asian stocks have slipped after Wall Street shares declined on Tuesday a truncated session ahead of the 4 Jul holiday. China’s yuan stabilised after hitting an 11-month low as the central bank moved to reassure financial markets. The pound has been trading at $1.32 and €1.131 overnight.

2018-07-04T04:59:19Z,world,World news,London clubs and racism: ‘The West End is a hostile environment’,"It is midnight on a warm midsummer’s night in Mayfair, central London. Across wide lanes of traffic – ceaseless, even at this hour – I can just about make out the dark silhouette of Hyde Park’s trees. But it is a dozen plastic-wrapped parking tickets, slapped on a primary-coloured Lamborghini beside me, that I can hear flapping in the breeze. I am at the Hilton Park Lane hotel, the super-rich heart of the super-rich centre of London. The sports cars are not only symbols of extreme wealth, but of the attitudes that accompany it, that allow the car-owners to treat parking fines as if they were an upmarket meter system.
This is exactly the clientele Drama is here to serve. The nightclub, a compact establishment carved out of the hotel’s basement, is for “those who drip irresistible confidence”, according to its website. “Expect the loud. Expect the abnoxious [sic]. Expect drama.”Tonight, the latter is prophetic. The velvet rope separating the “abnoxious” from the rest of us is struggling to contain a show-stoppingly beautiful black woman, who is shouting at the door staff. “They know me. They invited me down here. And now they don’t want to let me in because of my colour,” she yells. “Don’t deny the fact that black people are poppin’. You play our music. Do I need to say any more?” When I talk to the 24-year-old, she explains why she is so furious at being denied entry. “I’ve been standing in the line and seeing bare white people going in before me,” she says. “Personally, I think this is a colour thing. Black people are not allowed in central London, I swear to you. The way Mayfair works for me, you’ve got to look like a certain something – you have got to be white, tall, really slim.” She describes herself as an “influencer” and says she does not want to be named because she fears the consequences to her profile. But, she continues: “I’m a party girl, I go out all the time. And as black women, we are always being disrespected – we can’t go out there and have a good time, without them reminding us about our colour.” In this sentiment she is not alone. Last month, another young black woman, out clubbing to celebrate the end of her exams, alleged that she was charged twice as much for entry to Drama as white girls in the queue. The club denied that this was the case, saying that both white and black members of the group were charged £20 for entry.
“We do not tolerate any form of discrimination against any individual or group,” the club said in a statement. “The standard door charge at Drama Park Lane is £20. Promotions are offered for various reasons, but never on the grounds of discrimination of race, colour or national origin.” The club is now investigating both the allegations. But on social media, the young woman’s mother, TV producer Nadine Marsh-Edwards, said: “My daughter went to a club in the West End last night. Black girls got charged £20 entrance fee – white girls £10 … London life right now. They need to be reminded it’s London 2018 not Mississippi 1962.” The club contacted Marsh-Edwards, although her comments have led to further allegations, many citing almost identical experiences, throwing a spotlight on reviews of Mayfair clubs on TripAdvisor, where allegations of racism are common, stretching back several years. On the night I went clubbing in Mayfair I saw this flexible door policy at first hand. Drama’s £20 entry fee was quickly waved away when I made a vague excuse, leaving me the impression that it is considered small change when compared to the takings inside. Until about a decade ago, I was no stranger to the Mayfair and central-London club scene. Devotees of hip-hop and R&B, my friends and I knew the DJ schedule at most of the clubs by heart, and would go wherever they were playing our favourite music. On a good day, we could blag our way in for free, but most of the time, we paid £10 or £20. But, as a black girl, you always felt your game had to be tight. Those of mixed race, like me, had an easier time than our friends with darker complexions who seemed to be judged more critically by doorstaff. The threat of exclusion was always lurking just under the surface. But, descending beneath the Lamborghini-lined entrance to Drama, those days seem like a more innocent time. The first thing that struck me was the prevalence of cosmetic surgery. Next, that this was a club devoted not to dancing, but to “tables” – booths topped with grey ice buckets for super-sized, frosted bottles of spirits that cost those enjoying them up to £1,000. The dancefloor is an afterthought – a few square metres of space we had to share with a disproportionate number of security guards and a couple of women in thongs, who occassionally burst into unprovoked episodes of twerking. Champagne, the drink of choice at the bar, was an eye-watering £17 a glass. About a quarter of the club’s floor space was shut off altogether – an unoccupied and unlit VIP area. It felt like a metaphor for the whole experience of going to a club that is always aspiring to a wealthier, more important and famous clientele. During the period I was in the club, out of about 150 clubbers, I saw just one group of five bored-looking black boys, slumped around a table, and one black woman in a large table-less group of white friends. Among the staff, we observed just one black man. When we moved on to nearby Scandal, a larger club closer to the heart of the West End, there were more people dancing. There were also slightly more people from minority ethnic groups and a black DJ. But with the exception of one dancer among the half-dozen or so women performing provocative moves in little cubby holes built into the walls, I could see no black women at all. The club declined to comment. It is black women, critics say, who are the net losers in the current Mayfair club game. Fashion blogger Fisayo Longe recently described her experience at Libertine, writing that she was denied entry and was told it was: “Maybe because you’re black,” and “… probably because you’re not good looking enough”. The nightclub has denied this, saying the records from their ID scanner prove they have a varied demographic. “We can categorically state that we do not have a door policy that is based on the colour of people’s skin.”
The near absence of any ethnic group from a social space in London is unusual enough for a city with a 40% non-white population. But it is all the more surprising in nightclubs that – as Drama and many other high-end Mayfair establishments do – play almost entirely black music. Those who claim black people are being deliberately excluded are becoming harder to ignore. In 2015, the nightclub DSTRKT refused entry to a group of black women who say they were told they were “too dark” and “overweight”. The nightclub denied this and says the club was full. The same year, Cirque le Soir rejected a group of New Orleans Saints NFL players, despite the fact that they had reservations. The players reported being told it was because they were “six big guys” (none was over 6ft) and “too urban”. The nightclub denied this, saying the men were refused entry because they were in an all-male group. TripAdvisor reviews of the past few years report clubs including Libertine, Drama and Cirque le Soir splitting up mixed groups of friends, with only the white members allowed in. “Eww, your kind isn’t allowed in here,” one girl reports a staff member telling her and an Asian friend. Other reviews of some Mayfair clubs dating back to January 2017 include the headlines “undercover Nazis” and “Racist Club! No black people allowed!” But in a society where British people of colour face discrimination at work, racist abuse on the streets and even deportation, do unpleasant experiences at a handful of nightclubs really matter? Marsh-Edwards thinks so. “This is the start of a young person’s life out in the world, and these sort of micro-aggressions tell you a lot about how you are seen by society,” she says. “Some of these girls are going to end up running companies, they are going to go into that boardroom one day, probably as the only woman and highly likely the only black person. And they have already been told they are not worthy, and not on a level playing field.” In a world where discretion is seen as a core asset, it was difficult to find anyone who works in the Mayfair club scene who would allow their name to be used for this article. One promoter, who is black, says he witnessed overt racial discrimination over more than a decade working in Mayfair and the West End. “I can go into any club with 10 hot, blond models and be given a table and a bottle,” he says. “But I can go with 10 black girls, who are beautiful, and be kept on the door. “I used to have so many fights with club-owners about this. My own sister got turned away on her 40th birthday from a club I was working at – she came with six black women, they had booked a table two months in advance and there was nothing I could do to get them in. Well-dressed, smart-looking black people getting turned away.” Despite his personal objection to the policy, he continued making money from it. “I was walking away with hundreds of pounds for bringing in girls. The clubs would do a ‘quality check’ – they would give you marks out of 10 for the girls that you bring. They just need to be hot. Hot, and predominantly white. “The clubs would say it’s not about being racist, it’s business,” he adds. “Clubs will do whatever it takes to bring in these big table spenders,” while promoters were valued for being able to “guarantee [the] hot girls the table spenders want to see”.A popular Mayfair club DJ argued that while there was undoubtedly racism, it was elitism that was the main issue. “I remember once bringing two black friends to a club where I worked, and being told: ‘You cannot bring two black people in here at the same time because it looks like a gang.’ So I’m not going to deny there is racism. Some of it comes from the way the media portrays black people. Some is similar to the racism you get in the fashion industry, with this idea that black people just don’t look good. “But this is not so much about race as about money,” he says, describing how a pair of Nigerian clients at Drama regularly spent £30,000 each visiting the club. “Clubs want to attract the people who are going to spend the most, so they want good-looking people, people who look desirable and enticing, because that’s what brings in the people with money. That can work against black people, but I’ve seen it work in favour of black people too.” The importance of catering to the tastes of the super-rich is a recurring theme. Another promoter, who specialises in bringing clientele from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states to London’s clubs, said it was deciphering their wishes that led to some of the most problematic decision-making in some Mayfair clubs. “The objective of these clubs is to sell alcohol, and club-owners have built up stereotypes based on spending patterns,” he explains. “So, for example, some owners will tell you that they don’t want Asians coming in because they drink before they come out. Black people don’t drink much either. The best clients are Norwegians, because they drink a lot. So there is a kind of logic behind the way they discriminate. “Right now, it’s ‘Gulf season’. Societies like Saudi are very restrictive, but Ramadan is especially strict, so as soon as it’s finished, wealthy young people go to the other extreme. All the luxury industries in Europe try to cater to them.” Essentially, racialised stereotypes are being cited as a business model. One DJ who was willing to speak openly about his experiences was Edward Adoo. He did not mince his words. “Things are getting worse,” he says. “Right now, the West End is a hostile environment for black people. There is no real diversity policy in these clubs. They can do what they please. The owners are not accountable. They don’t think they adhere to any conditions or rules, and that’s why they think they can behave like that.” Yet the serious nature and sheer volume of allegations of racial discrimination have attracted the attention of the local authorities, which are now investigating. When I put the allegations to Amy Lamé, London’s first night tsar, appointed by mayor Sadiq Khan, she said she was in touch with those involved. “We take these allegations extremely seriously and are working with Westminster council and the Metropolitan police to stamp this out.” A spokesperson from the council, which has responsibility for licensing – powers some have suggested should now be used to sanction nightclubs who practise discrimination – explained its plans to tackle the allegations: “Racism has no place in Westminster. That is why we have this week launched a task group to look into the standards of inclusion and access to the evening and night-time economy. This will include trading standards and issues such as discounted entry and promotions. If we find evidence of any racial discrimination we will take action.” But evidence could be hard to find. One promoter I spoke to said he could see why black clubbers claimed racism was involved, but insisted: “These clubs are based on image. The reason people come here is because of the exclusivity and glamour. If we let all of them in, it would no longer be either exclusive or glamorous. So in a way, by coming here and getting upset when they get rejected, they are victims of their own fantasy.”
Is racism, even if it can be proved, actually a symptom rather than the cause of what is really going wrong in Mayfair clubs? The clubs I visited – Drama and Scandal – are unapologetic about their intentions to be elitist and discriminatory, not on grounds on race, but desirability, beauty and wealth. Scandal, for example, describes itself as “the ultimate nightlife experience for a privileged few”. It is hard not to feel unwelcome in a club that plays black music, in a city with a visible black community, where black people are noticeable by their absence. It was uncomfortable for my friend Lola and me, doing our best to enjoy the music amid the tables, stunts and strippers. But, when you consider what it says about our society, and how we cater to the whims of the super-rich, it really means a whole lot more.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/04/london-clubs-and-racism-the-west-end-is-a-hostile-environment,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/04/london-clubs-and-racism-the-west-end-is-a-hostile-environment
2018-07-04T03:39:18Z,world,World news,Mining disaster survivors say 'hard yards' lie ahead for trapped Thai group,"The 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a Thailand cave will be hopeful of surviving, but must now mentally prepare themselves to be rescued, say men who survived two of the world’s most famous mine disasters.
Brant Webb, who was saved from a mine in the Australian town of Beaconsfield, Tasmania, in 2006, said he and his colleague Todd Russell had lied to each other about their prospects of survival during their 14-day ordeal. “We didn’t think we were going to get out. We lied to each other, and it worked for each other, we told each other we were going to be reunited with our families,” Webb told New Zealand radio station Newstalk ZB. Like Webb and Russell, the members of the Wild Boar football team, aged 11 to 16, had their hopes renewed after their dramatic discovery deep in the flooded Tham Luang cave on Monday. But they now face a long wait, potentially months, as rescuers work to free them. Webb, who had eaten only half a muesli bar for 10 days while trapped underground, said “hard yards” were now ahead for the Thai group. “They are doing well at the moment. They are dry, have water and hope,” he said. “They have loads of people to talk to, Todd and I had only ourselves. Fourteen days of no contact is a big ask. “When we got out we couldn’t handle society, people, crowds – we do now – but 10 days, it will be a tough task for them.” Also on Tuesday, one of the survivors of the 2010 Chilean mine disaster offered his own perspective on the challenges now facing the football team. With suggestions the rescue effort at the flooded Tham Luang cave could take months, Omar Reygadas, who was trapped underground for 69 days, said it was crucial the boys worked together. In particular, Reygadas said the boys’ coach would be need to keep them motivated. “It’s terrible for them, they’re little, but I believe that boys with a lot of strength are going to manage to be whole when they get out,” Reygadas told the Associated Press. While he said it was difficult to offer advice, he suggested the boys should “think only about leaving and reuniting with their families”. Reygadas, who was one of 33 miners trapped underground in the Atacama desert, near Copiapó, also said the young boys should feel free to show their emotions. “They shouldn’t be ashamed to be scared,” he said. “Because we were scared, too. Our tears also ran. Even as adult men, we cried.” He added that faith and prayer, as well as humour, had helped he and his colleagues stay positive while they waited to be rescued. The boys have been trapped inside the 9.5-kilometre cave since 23 June. With Thailand now in the midst of its rainy season, rescuers have raised concerns imminent rainfall could complicate their task.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/04/mining-disaster-survivors-hard-yards-ahead-trapped-thai-group-beaconsfield-chile,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/04/mining-disaster-survivors-hard-yards-ahead-trapped-thai-group-beaconsfield-chile
2018-07-04T00:22:14Z,world,World news,"NZ National party appeals order to pay Eminem $600,000 in copyright battle","The National party in New Zealand is refusing to move on from its copyright fight with Grammy award-winning rapper Eminem, arguing a decision by the high court ordering it to pay the singer NZ$600,000 ($400,000) is too high. In October last year New Zealand’s high court ruled that the National party infringed on the singer’s copyright when it used refrains from his song Lose Yourself in a campaign ad. The court awarded the rapper’s publisher NZ$600,000 in damages.
Eminem filed proceedings against New Zealand’s then-governing party in September 2014 for using a version of his chart-topping song Lose Yourself in an election campaign advertisement. The advertisement featuring a track called Eminem Esque was played 186 times on television during the 2014 election campaign over an 11-day period. The court ruled on 25 October that the National party’s use of the track was “sufficiently similar” to Eminem’s original song that it impinged on copyright and that Lose Yourself was a “highly original work”. On Tuesday National party’s lawyer Greg Arthur appeared in the court of appeal to argue the penalty imposed by the high court was too harsh, and the “hypothetical license fee” of NZ$600,000 was not proportionate to the breach as the advertisement only played on New Zealand television, Newshub reported. The outcome of the appeal has been reserved, meaning it could take weeks or months for a decision. The October ruling last year stated: “Eminem Esque has substantially copied Lose Yourself. “The differences between the two works are minimal; the close similarities and the indiscernible differences in drum beat, the ‘melodic line’ and the piano figures make Eminem Esque strikingly similar to Lose Yourself. “Eminem Esque substantially reproduces the essence of Lose Yourself. The parts of Eminem Esque used in the National party’s campaign advertisements also substantially reproduce Lose Yourself.” Lose Yourself, from the movie 8 Mile, won an Academy award for best original song in 2003 and a Grammy for best rap song in 2004.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/04/nz-national-party-appeals-order-to-pay-eminem-600000-in-copyright-battle,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/04/nz-national-party-appeals-order-to-pay-eminem-600000-in-copyright-battle

2018-07-03T22:12:53Z,world,World news,Monsoon rains may force Thai cave rescue attempt this week,"Thai authorities are racing against the clock to rescue 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a cave, saying they may attempt to evacuate the group before a fresh round of monsoon rains expected this week. The group had been missing since finishing football practice on 23 June and were found alive late on Monday after a nine-day search.
There is now a team of seven Thai navy Seals with the group on the small mud shelf where they found refuge from rising waters, including a doctor and a nurse, according to the Seal commander, Rear Adm Arpakorn Yookongkaew. Rescuers are currently weighing up rescue options. At present, the only way out of their refuge is by diving through the flooded caves, but the route is extremely challenging and none of the boys can even swim, much less dive. If a dive rescue is not possible, they face a wait of months underground until monsoon rains end and the water recedes. The wet season typically lasts from May to October in northern Thailand, where the Tham Luang cave is located on the borders of Myanmar and Laos. Two Thai medics volunteered to stay with the group until they can leave, one of the cave divers helping with rescue efforts said. For now, all 13 are healthy and being looked after by the medics. “They have given the boys food, starting from easily digested and high-powered food with enough minerals,” the Associated Press quoted the Seal commander saying.
His team is considering rescue options, but would not attempt to have them dive out without doing more checks and a dummy run. “[We] have to be certain that it will work and have to have a drill to make that it’s 100% safe.” The group is between 800 metres and 1km below the surface, and about 2km (1.24 miles) inside the cave. The navy Seal team on site had earlier sent out a request for donations of small full-face diving masks after it was found that the masks they had were too big for the children, fuelling speculation that a rescue attempt was imminent. A full-face mask is easier to use for inexperienced divers. But one of the rescuers who found the group said after days without eating or moving, they may not be ready for a dive rescue, even with extensive support.
“They are mentally quite fit, better than anticipated. They are very weak though. They did not have any solid food for 10 days, just drinking water dripping from the walls.” Ben Raymenants told Sky News. “First the boys need to get their strength again, because right now they can’t do anything at all. They have muscle atrophy, they can barely stand up. So they are feeding them slowly to get back their strength.” Thai officials have been giving out mixed messages about the urgency of a rescue attempt. Although Yookongkaew said the group were safe for now, other officials are calling for a speedy evacuation before monsoon rains set in again. “As rain is forecast in the next few days, the evacuation must speed up. Diving gear will be used. If the water rises, the task will be difficult. We must bring the kids out before then,” said Anupong Paojinda, the interior minister, according to the Bangkok Post. “Diving is not easy. Those who have never done it will find it difficult, because there are narrow passages in the cave. They must be able to use diving gear. If the gear is lost at any moment, it can be dangerous to life.”
Workers have delivered energy gels to the group in an attempt to boost their strength and are preparing more substantial meals of pork and rice, to be delivered in sealed containers. Rescue experts have suggested the safest option would be to supply the children and their coach with food and medical supplies and wait for the water level to subside, which could take weeks or even months, but the expected heavy rainfall could complicate the equation. Even evacuating the boys using diving gear could take up to five to seven days. Experienced divers have said missteps underwater with untrained divers could be fatal for the boys and the rescuers. “The best option is to leave them where they are and stabilise their environment to make sure the core ingredients are met,” said Peter Wolf, the national director of the Cave Divers Association of Australia. “Given the environment is pretty wet, to keep them warm and dry, provide them with clean drinking water, food, and clean air.” Rescue workers were scouring the hills above the cave network for other possible entry points or avenues to drill down to the trapped footballers, but the small size of the cave where they have found refuge could make that dangerous.
The decision about when and how any rescue attempt is made lies ultimately with the Thai military. The Thai navy captain Anand Surawan has previously said: “We will prepare to send additional food to be sustained for at least four months and train all 13 to dive while continuing to drain the water.” An underground headquarters has been set up, stocked with dive gear, oxygen tanks, medical supplies and food, which will be transported to the boys and their coach. Two British divers – named on social media as Rick Stanton and John Volanthen – found the team on a mud bank inside the cave about two metres above the water level. It is thought the 12 boys and their coach entered the cave on 23 June, before a sudden monsoon flooded the network. Thai police are investigating whether the coach should face criminal charges for leading the boys into the cave, Sky News reported. Warning signs discourage visits to the cave during the rainy season. Tham Luang cave is one of Thailand’s longest and toughest to navigate, with snaking chambers and narrow passageways.
The Thai prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, held a telephone conference to congratulate the rescuers at the cave site. Engineers have been pumping water out of the cave for a week and a temporary respite from the rains has lowered water levels. By Tuesday, they were removing 10,000 litres of water an hour, lowering the water level by a centimetre an hour, but coming monsoon rains could quickly erase that progress. Officials were installing telephone lines to allow the children to speak to their parents. More than 1,000 Thai military personnel are at the site, as well as teams from seven countries including the UK, US and Australia.

2018-07-03T22:09:20Z,world,World news,Mexico president-elect rejects bodyguards: 'The citizens will protect me',"He has just been elected commander-in-chief of a nation mired in an intractable drug conflict that has claimed more than 200,000 lives in little more than a decade. But on Tuesday, Mexico’s incoming president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, claimed he would waive the right to close protection in a bid to stay close to the people.
“I don’t want bodyguards, which means the citizens will take care of me and protect me,” López Obrador, or Amlo, as he is best known, told reporters as he called on Mexico’s incumbent president, Enrique Peña Nieto, to discuss the transition. Amlo, a 64-year-old leftist who trounced opponents in Sunday’s vote, was repeating an undertaking made on several occasions during his historic campaign – one of several promises designed to bolster his image as a man of the people who will rule for Mexico’s 53 million poor. “I don’t want to go around surrounded by bodyguards. I want you to take care of me, I want the people to look after me,” Amlo told a rally in Hidalgo state in May. José Antonio Crespo, a political analyst at Mexico’s Center for Economic Research and Teaching, called Amlo’s decision “an act of absolute irresponsibility”. “It is a little demagogic to say: ‘I am just like anybody else, I have no privileges,’ when he isn’t just an average citizen, he is a head of state,” Crespo told the Associated Press. “A good part of the country’s stability and rule of law depend on his security and health.” Amlo’s other populist pledges include: Refusing to live in Mexico City’s opulent 19th century presidential residence, Los Pinos (the Pines). “I won’t live in a mansion of any kind,” he told a recent gathering on the capital’s hardscrabble outskirts, promising to convert the building into an arts centre “for the Mexican people”. Selling the presidential plane and banning top officials from crisscrossing the country in private jets and helicopters. “All this is going to end … we cannot have a rich government and a poor people,” he said. Slashing his presidential salary and those of what he calls Mexico’s burocracia dorada (golden bureaucracy). “I’m going to earn half what Peña Nieto earns … and we are going to reduce the salaries of those who are on top so we can raise the salaries of those at the bottom,” Amlo pledged. “The teachers will earn more, the nurses, the doctors, the cleaners, the police, the soldiers, the marines ... the campesinos.” Amlo’s commitments have gone down well with voters furious at the extravagances and corruption of their ruling elite. “We are so happy,” said Lucero Robles, a Mexican painter who took to the streets on Sunday night to toast his victory. “But we’ll be even happier when they put the presidential sash on him [in December].”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/mexico-amlo-president-no-bodyguards,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/mexico-amlo-president-no-bodyguards
2018-07-03T20:11:03Z,world,World news,Doug Ford scraps carbon tax plan and sets up climate fight with Trudeau,"Ontario’s new rightwing government has ended a carbon pricing policy aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Canada’s most populous province. The move to scrap the cap-and-trade program puts the provincial Conservative government – led by Doug Ford – directly at odds with the federal government’s bid to ensure provinces have a price on carbon in place by the end of 2018.
Days after he was sworn in as premier, Ford – the brother of former Toronto mayor Rob Ford – expressed his opposition to the idea. “Cap-and-trade and carbon tax schemes are no more than government cash grabs that do nothing for the environment, while hitting people in the wallet in order to fund big government programs,” Ford said in a statement. Ending the program will help Ford deliver on a campaign promise to reduce gasoline prices by 10 cents per litre. “Cancelling the cap-and-trade carbon tax will result in lower prices at the gas pump, on your home heating bills and on virtually every other product that you buy,” Ford added. In the leadup to last month’s Ontario election, Ford – who has elicited comparisons to Donald Trump – explained in a televised debate that while he believed in man-made global warming, he does not believe in “putting an artificial tax called the carbon tax, the cap-and-trade, that does absolutely nothing to help the environment”. He continued: “The carbon tax is the single worst tax anyone – not just in Ontario – Canada could ever have.” In place since 2017, the policy limits greenhouse gas emissions for large companies, allowing those who are below or above the threshold to sell, buy or trade credits in a carbon market that includes Quebec and California. The decision to end the program puts Ontario, home to a third of Canada’s population and the country’s economic engine, in line for a climate showdown with the federal government, led by Justin Trudeau. Shortly after Ford’s election, Canada’s minister of environment and climate change, Catherine McKenna, said in a statement that her government would consider imposing carbon pricing on the province if Ford carried through on his promise to scrap cap-and-trade. On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the minister said work would continue to tackle climate change. “By cancelling Ontario’s cap-and-trade plan, the premier is making it clear that he is not interested in taking climate action, and is effectively withdrawing from Canada’s national climate change plan.” Ford’s government has earmarked C$30m to fight Ottawa in court over the issue. The move could prove to be a costly one for the new Conservative government, said Keith Brooks of Environmental Defence. The economic impact will be felt across sectors as the program helped fuel demand for energy efficiency and propel Ontario’s clean tech sector into the largest and fastest-growing in the country.
There’s also the question of the more than C$2.8bn in permits bought by Ontario businesses through the program – an issue the Ford government has yet to address. “The Ontario government will need to find billions of dollars to buy back those permits, or risk being sued,” said Brooks. Mike Schreiner – who made history last month after he was elected as Ontario’s first provincial parliamentarian from the Green party – slammed the government’s decision, calling it “reckless and irresponsible”, in a statement. “Ontario can address the climate crisis in a way that creates jobs, benefits our economy and leaves a livable planet for our kids and grandkids,” he added. “Instead, Premier Ford is gambling with our future.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/doug-ford-scraps-carbon-tax-plan-and-sets-up-climate-fight-with-trudeau,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/doug-ford-scraps-carbon-tax-plan-and-sets-up-climate-fight-with-trudeau
2018-07-03T18:08:55Z,world,World news,Outrage after American woman hunts and kills rare giraffe in South Africa,"Tess Thompson Talley, a 37-year-old woman from Kentucky, is facing backlash after shooting and killing an elderly male giraffe on a hunting trip in South Africa. The trip took place last summer, but a photo of Talley posing with the animal’s body has recently gone viral on social media, sourced from a Facebook post she made last year that has since been deleted. It read: “Prayers for my once in a lifetime dream hunt came true today! Spotted this rare black giraffe bull and stalked him for quite awhile.” A Twitter post of the photo by AfricaDigest has since drawn particular attention to the story. Calling Thompson Talley a “white American savage who is partly neanderthal”, it has been retweeted over 40,000 times. A number of public figures have since voiced their outrage.
The musician Moby called her “broken and soulless”, the TV journalist John Simpson called her an “idiot woman”. Comedian Ricky Gervais used far stronger expletives. Back in 2015, Gervais was quick to share a photo of Rebecca Francis, a woman who posted a picture of herself smiling next to the carcass of a giraffe, and who claimed she received “hundreds of thousands of death threats” after the photo went viral. On 27 June, Hollywood actress and former Will & Grace star Debra Messing wrote: “Tess Thompson Talley from Nippa, Kentucky, is a disgusting, vile, amoral, heartless, selfish murderer,” adding that she has a “black heart”. The backlash is similar to that faced by American dentist Walter Palmer. In 2015, he shot dead Cecil the lion outside Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe and international outrage ensued. Jimmy Kimmel cried, donations to the park quickly flooded in and conservationists condemned Palmer’s actions. Hunting a giraffe is legal in South Africa if it has been pre-arranged with a game park. However, Thompson Talley’s story raises alarm bells about giraffes being killed as trophies, especially given that there are less than 100,000 on the planet. The controversial business of trophy hunting, in which hunters pay for permission to shoot rare animals, raises large amounts of money. It is often justified with claims about the funds being raised from hunters being put back into animal conservation. The big game industry in South Africa – from hunting to breeding to tourism – is worth $2bn a year. In response to outcry over her photo, Thompson released a statement to CBS News. “This is called conservation through game management,” she said, explaining that the giraffe that she hunted was old and prone to attacking younger giraffes. “Now that the giraffe is gone, the younger bulls are able to breed.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/american-woman-hunts-kills-giraffe-for-sport,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/american-woman-hunts-kills-giraffe-for-sport
2018-07-03T17:36:48Z,world,World news,Brazil: measles outbreak that infected 500 may devastate indigenous people,"An outbreak of measles that has infected nearly 500 people in northern Brazil could prove catastrophic for indigenous Yanomami people in remote areas along the Venezuelan border who are not protected from the disease, according to the not-for-profit group Survival International, which warned that hundreds could be killed if emergency action was not taken. “This disease is a potentially devastating one,” said Jonathan Mazower, Survival International’s communications director. “It is extremely likely that people will die unless medical care is provided urgently and it is very likely that people in the forest have already died.” The World Health Organization declared the Americas free of measles in 2016, but outbreaks can still occur when the disease is imported by visitors.
The Brazilian government has blamed the outbreak on Venezuelan refugees but health experts said that a reduction in vaccination cover was also a factor. According to the Brazilian government, the border state of Roraima, where the Yanomami people live, has confirmed 200 cases of measles and another 177 are being investigated. The neighbouring state of Amazonas has confirmed 263 cases of measles and is investigating another 1,368. Three other states – Rio Grande do Sul, Rondônia and Mato Grosso – have also confirmed cases. The Venezuelan not-for-profit group Wataniba, which works with Yanomami indigenous people, said it had been approached by tribespeople concerned about the measles outbreak in communities on both sides of the border. “The alarm is great because of the epidemiological vulnerability of these people to this disease,” the group said on its website. Around 35,000 Yanomami indigenous people live on both sides of the border, according to Survival International, with many in remote communities. An estimated three groups live isolated in the forest, and in 2016 Survival published new photographs of a village home to an uncontacted group. In the 1960s, a measles outbreak among the Yanomami killed 9% of those infected, Mazower noted, and Yanomami communities on both sides of the border are suffering from the incursion of gold miners, who could transmit the disease. “There really needs to be very urgent medical care sent to this area,” he said.
TV Globo in Roraima reported this week that 82 suspected measles cases had been reported this year among Yanomami people, compared with none last year. Tânia Chaves, a professor of infectious diseases at the Federal University of Pará, said she believed Venezuelan refugees had brought the disease in but a fall in vaccine cover had helped its spread. According to the Folha de S Paulo newspaper, coverage of the triple vaccine, which includes measles, has fallen from nearly 100% in 2002 to 84%. “The cover is not ideal. This creates bubbles of susceptible people and that is where the virus enters,” Chaves said. “All of us are very concerned.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/brazil-measles-outbreak-yanomami-indigenous,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/brazil-measles-outbreak-yanomami-indigenous
2018-07-03T17:06:58Z,world,World news,How can the boys be rescued from the Thai cave?,"The dramatic discovery of 12 boys and their football coach who had gone missing inside a cave in Thailand has captivated the world. Attention has now turned to the crucial task facing the Thai navy and the teams of international rescuers: getting the group to safety.
There are essentially four options for trying to rescue the boys – all of which are fraught with danger. The first two involve waiting for a passage to emerge or be created, which would allow the group to leave without going underwater. They could stay in the cave until the water either subsides or is pumped out, or rescuers could try to drill a new passage through to their refuge. The other options involve trying to get the group out through the flood waters, either by teaching them to dive so they can swim out themselves, or wrapping them up with a breathing apparatus so they can be passed out like “packages” along a human chain of rescuers. Rescuers are currently weighing up the different risks, but whatever option they choose, experts in cave diving and rescue say it is likely to be several days at the very least before any of the group are back above ground. Wait for water to go down Waiting for water to recede is risky because Thailand is at the start of its monsoon season. Rescuers have pumped some water out of the cave systems, but more rains are expected soon, and it could be months before waters are back down near the levels they were at when the group went in. Thai navy Seals were reportedly taking in four months worth of food supplies for the boys. Create a new passage Drilling down to reach the group does not appear to be practical. Rescuers are probing near the caves for other possible entrances, but have not found any that lead near the group’s refuge. Even if they do get close, the British Cave Rescue Council said the boys are “located in a relatively small space and this would make any potential drilling attempt as a means of rescue very difficult”.Teach the boys to dive so they can be guided out This seems extremely unlikely as cave diving is difficult even for people with experience and reportedly none of the boys can swim, much less use diving equipment. They would have to learn to both swim and dive metres underground, then navigate through a passage that has proved challenging even for their extremely experienced rescuers, through water often thick with silt with near-zero visibility, managing strong currents and passages not much wider than their bodies.
Pass the boys out via a human chain of rescuers The only other option is to fit the boys with full face masks, providing them with breathing equipment and a thick wetsuit to prevent hypothermia, then effectively passing them out along a human chain of rescuers. However this would also be complicated. Parts of the cave system are reportedly so narrow that Thai Seal teams and the volunteer rescue divers had to remove their own breathing apparatus to get through, so it is not clear how the soccer team would be handed through those sections. It would also be extremely slow, with the group brought out one-by-one using a kind of relay system to minimise risks. If they left as a group, and one person got stuck in a difficult section, it could put others at risk, rescuers said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/how-can-the-boys-be-rescued-from-the-thai-cave,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/how-can-the-boys-be-rescued-from-the-thai-cave
2018-07-03T17:00:34Z,world,World news,'It felt like a movie': international team trying to save Thai football team from cave,"In a muddy clearing at the foot of Nang Non mountain, soldiers, medics and rescue workers chattered over the hum of generators and falling water, hoping for the next piece of good news. Hours before, 12 Thai schoolboys between the ages of 11 and 16 and their 25-year-old football coach were found alive by divers in the nearby cave known as Tham Luang Nang Non, which flooded while they were exploring it on 23 June.
In an instant, an anxious nine-day search operation transformed into a rescue mission, but those spending their days at the rescue camp say they never lost hope that the missing children would be returned to safety. “One thing I’d like to note about the mood in this camp is that we’ve all been in here as a family, working together, and I never sensed anyone being demotivated. In fact, I sensed a strong hope,” said US Air Force Captain Jessica Tait, a member of a unit of divers, medics, and survival specialists sent to the rescue site last week at the request of the Thai government. “When we found out the good news, it felt like it was out of a movie. I get chills when I think about that moment and being able to work hard and have such a positive outcome, because you don’t always get that,” she said. The sense of hope felt by the rescuers is also shared by the dozens of volunteers who have come from across the country to the northern tip of Chiang Rai province to contribute their skills to the rescue effort. Wisalaya, a woman in her 50s who lives in the surrounding Mae Sai district, is one of the many community members who have set up makeshift kitchens at the site to hand out free meals to anyone who passes by. Throughout the day soldiers, medics, and reporters could be seen standing in two inches of mud, happily slurping noodle soup. Wisalaya said: “I’m here because I love helping, and I love food.” Tait acknowledged the importance of the volunteers’ presence: “All the people are here working 24/7, so we’re obviously eating a lot. The Thai people keep bringing us food, and it’s so beautiful because I really think it shows their hospitality, and we’re so grateful for that friendship.”
Tait said she also finds inspiration in other kinds of international cooperation this rescue effort has necessitated. “This is a Thai-led, multi-national rescue operation, and what’s fantastic is that you see the US here, the Australians, the Chinese, the British divers, obviously,” she said. “It shows that when militaries train together, it’s for this – it’s for the real world.” But although the mood at the command centre is decidedly positive, there is little certainty about what will happen next. After the boys were found sitting on a dry mound about two and a half miles from the cave mouth, Thai officials instructed rescuers that the next phase of the mission would be to teach the boys to dive – a project that would require a food supply to last at least four months. But on Tuesday, officials said they may attempt to evacuate the group before a fresh round of monsoon rains later this week “As rain is forecast in the next few days, the evacuation must speed up. Diving gear will be used. If the water rises, the task will be difficult. We must bring the kids out before then,” said Anupong Paojinda, the interior minister, according to the Bangkok Post. Tait said that neither the diving strategy nor the four-month timeline are set in stone. “It’s hard to put a timeline on it because of all the different options being explored,” she said. “Obviously, dive operations are happening, but there’s other stuff being looked at as well.”
These other options include land surveys, searching for alternative openings into the cave, and potentially roping down to extract the boys and the coach. Tait’s unit includes personnel equipped to provide psychological treatment to the children, whose last 10 days were spent in a pitch-black environment. “Whatever’s decided, we’ll provide advice and assistance because that’s what we’re here for, and we’re actually supportive of whatever direction is the best,” Tait said. She added: “Sometimes, when there’s a problem, you think there’s just one solution, but that’s only if your mind is closed to other solutions. I’m very certain that the Thai government will choose the best solution for the safety of the children.” This article was amended on 9 July 2018 to correct the location in the caves where the boys and their coach were found.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/it-felt-like-a-movie-international-team-waiting-to-help-rescue-thai-footballers,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/it-felt-like-a-movie-international-team-waiting-to-help-rescue-thai-footballers
2018-07-03T16:45:34Z,world,World news,Israel: Hamas created fake dating apps to hack soldiers' phones,"Israel has accused its enemy Hamas of building fake dating apps to woo soldiers into downloading malicious software on to their mobile phones. Hundreds of Israel Defence Forces (IDF) troops were contacted via social media this year and asked to download one of two fake dating apps, WinkChat and GlanceLove, according to an official in the army’s intelligence directorate. Once the bogus app was installed, it granted its creators the ability to see the owner’s location and contact list and to use the phone as a listening device and video camera.
“Whatever you can do with your phone, the malicious content can do,” the official said at a briefing to journalists on Tuesday, adding the operation targeted Android phones. The soldiers were contacted via phony Facebook accounts, often with the stolen identities of young women, asking to chat on WhatsApp. They were then sent links to the apps, which were listed on the Google Play store and have since been removed. He said a third sham app, Golden Cup, promoted as a World Cup live scores and fixtures aid, was advertised to soldiers in Hebrew on Facebook. The app streamed videos of impressive goals from previous tournaments and listed details about each team. “It was actually a very good one,” the official said. The IDF said the hacks had failed to cause any “security damage at all” and said most soldiers and others working for the army who were approached to download the app had refused and reported the incident to their commanders. However, it conceded that some soldiers had downloaded the apps. While it did not provide an exact figure, the military said “less than 100” installed at least one program on their phones. The IDF, which had been monitoring the hack for months, called its operation Broken Heart as it claimed the honeytrap had failed to seduce its soldiers effectively. It said both serving men and women were targeted. Hamas attempted a similar strategy in January 2017 but used less advanced apps sold as social chat platforms, according to the military. As part of a new awareness programme to protect its secrets, the IDF has started to send its own fake messages to soldiers that asks them to click on a link. If the soldier opens the link, a warning pops up and they have to meet their commanding officers to debrief on online security.

2018-07-03T16:21:57Z,world,World news,Doubts raised over Merkel compromise on border controls,"A plan for a new border regime in southern Germany, struck on Monday night by Angela Merkel and her hardline interior minister to defuse a bitter row in the coalition government, is coming under heavy scrutiny. The border deal, hailed by the German chancellor as a “good compromise”, foresees setting up so-called transit centres on the country’s southern border, where asylum seekers who have already been registered in other EU countries will be held until they can be sent back to those countries. Like “airside” areas at international airports, the centres would be located on German soil in geographical but not legal terms, making it easier to deport people held in them.
The interior minister, Horst Seehofer, had threatened to resign over the issue of immigration on Sunday night, but the deal has allowed Merkel to avert a fallout between her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party in Bavaria, the Christian Social Union (CSU). However, critics say the scheme is at worst unworkable and at best merely moves the political crisis to another part of the coalition. The transit centre scheme was proposed in 2015 by a CSU politician, Stephan Mayer, but was rejected in the strongest terms by the Social Democratic party (SPD), then and now a junior partner in Merkel’s grand coalition government. Three years on, the centre-left SPD, wary of fresh elections, may feel less inclined to provoke a new crisis, but it could again reject the proposal at a meeting with members of Merkel’s bloc in Berlin on Tuesday. The party leader, Andrea Nahles, said on Tuesday morning that she opposed the term “transit centres”. The proposal could also shift the political crisis south to Austria, where the government said it could take its own measures to protect its borders. The compromise deal between Merkel and Seehofer suggests refugees arriving at the Austrian-Bavarian border who were first registered in EU states that now refuse to take them back, such as Hungary, should be sent back to Austria. At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, the Austrian government poured scorn on the proposals. “This agreement does not exist, and to be honest I find it hard to image how such an agreement could come about,” said the interior minister, Herbert Kickl, of the far-right Freedom party. The Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said it was not yet clear to him what exactly Germany was planning to do on its borders. “We are certainly not prepared to sign deals that come at Austria’s expense,” added Kurz, until recently seen as a supporter of Seehofer’s hardline course. Seehofer said on Tuesday he had already started to discuss a possible solution with Kurz and would travel to Vienna for further talks on Thursday. Meanwhile, migration experts have criticised the border arrangement proposed by Merkel and Seehofer. “The German government has truly made a mountain out of a molehill,” said Gerald Knaus, the architect of the 2015 migration deal between the European Union and Turkey. “Seehofer is promising his voters in Bavaria that the same Dublin system [for asylum applications] that hasn’t worked for 20 years is suddenly going to run smoothly because of new transit centres in Bavaria,” Knaus told the Guardian. “Why, no one knows.” Knaus, the director of the thinktank ESI, said the deal struck by the German government could have the unintended consequence of increasing migration into Germany, if for example the Greek government used the new agreement to unite families with people who had already arrived in Germany, while in return taking back some asylum seekers who have been fingerprinted in Greece. In addition, Knaus said, the emphasis on transit centres would mean Bavaria bearing most of the administrative burden of registering and processing refugees and migrants who arrive in Germany.

2018-07-03T16:16:32Z,world,World news,US and Russian officials hold 'frank' talks before Trump-Putin summit,"A delegation of US lawmakers has met top Russian officials and lawmakers to discuss ushering in a “new day” in relations ahead of a key summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin later this month. US Senator Richard Shelby spoke first for the eight-person delegation, including seven senators and a congresswoman, during meetings on Tuesday at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Russia’s Federation Council and the Duma.
It was the first time US lawmakers had visited Moscow as a delegation since 2013, before the annexation of Crimea, Russia’s intervention in Syria’s civil war – and meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections. “The Helsinki meeting will become the beginning of some better understanding” between the two countries, Shelby said in conversation with Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, a former aide to Putin. “Perhaps not a utopia … but perhaps a better day.” The Kremlin on Tuesday said it is possible that Putin and Trump will hold one-on-one talks, presumably with only translators present, if a “preliminary understanding is confirmed”. “You know that President Putin feels comfortable in any formats with his counterpart,” Dmitri Peskov, Putin’s press secretary, told reporters on Tuesday. Participants in the talks at the Duma confirmed they discussed interference in the US elections and the annexation of Crimea, but declined to go into details of the talks. “We got into it,” US Senator John Kennedy told the Guardian as he exited the parliament building, calling the talks “frank”. The US Congress last year passed new Russia sanctions that also severely limited Trump’s authority to lift them, effectively putting the legislature in the driver’s seat for new sanctions policy. Members of the delegation have talked about sending a “tough message” ahead of the Helsinki summit, but time was set aside for pleasantries. Russian lawmakers halted work to applaud the US delegation during a guided tour of the Duma, and Shelby spoke warmly of his impressions of the Duma during opening remarks. “It looked like full attendance,” Shelby said of the Duma, which has been accused of being a rubber stamp parliament. “Everybody was there participating. Sometimes we need more of that in the US Senate and the US House.”
Also in the delegation were senators John Hoevan, John Thune, Jerry Moran, Steve Daines, and Kay Granger from the House of Representatives. All are Republicans. The meetings came several weeks before Putin and Trump are set to meet in Helsinki for their first official summit. Trump told reporters last week that “we’re going to have to see”, when asked about whether the US would accept Russia’s claims on Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014. “I’ll talk to him about everything,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “We’re going to be talking about Ukraine, we’re going to be talking about Syria, we’ll be talking about elections, and we don’t want anybody tampering with elections.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/us-and-russian-officials-hold-frank-talks-before-trump-putin-summit,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/us-and-russian-officials-hold-frank-talks-before-trump-putin-summit
2018-07-03T14:58:05Z,world,World news,Why school trips to abattoirs are essential,"If the slaughterhouses had glass walls, would anyone still buy their meat? As a vegan, I support Countryfile presenter Tom Heap’s call for children to be taken on school trips to abattoirs. Why not – if you think the truth about what you eat is so horrific it must be kept secret, doesn’t that mean you are helping to cover up something you think is horrific?
Meat-eating is a huge part of our lives and one that is shrouded in fairytale. Illustrations in children’s books depict gorgeous, spacious farms with a handful of joyful animals. Supermarkets offer “happy eggs”, sausages from “jolly” hogs and the meat of “free range” chicken. McDonald’s has even given children a smiling toy cow when they buy a burger. What would sausage and bacon packaging look like if it were realistic? The reality is that many pigs are raised in crates barely bigger than their bodies, they are kept in hellish conditions for months, have their tails cut off without anaesthetic and squeal like terrified children when they get gassed. What sort of logo would that be? Meat bosses are nervous about the idea of children seeing inside slaughterhouses – and well they might be. Between 2009 and 2016, the welfare group Animal Aid secretly filmed inside 11 randomly chosen UK slaughterhouses and found clear evidence of cruelty in 10 of them.
A spokesman for the British Meat Processors Association said that it would be difficult to accommodate more than a handful of child visitors to abattoirs each day. How curious – they manage to shove one billion farmed animals through their doors every year. Children are often more truthful than their parents. It is the innocence of children that we want to protect, but we could also learn from it. Would a child witness animals being hurt and say the only step we need to take is to keep it secret? Let children learn the truth. Perhaps after the visit, pupils could be offered two options for their lunch: a meat dish or a vegan dish. That sounds like real education to me.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2018/jul/03/school-trips-to-abattoirs-essential-countryfile-presenter-tom-heap,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/shortcuts/2018/jul/03/school-trips-to-abattoirs-essential-countryfile-presenter-tom-heap
2018-07-03T14:10:11Z,world,World news,Mediterranean: more than 200 migrants drown in three days,"More than 200 migrants have drowned at sea in the Mediterranean in the past three days, taking the death toll for the year to more than 1,000 and prompting fears that human traffickers are taking greater risks because of a crackdown imposed by the Italian government and the Libyan coastguard.
The UN refugee agency in Tripoli reported on Monday that 276 refugees and migrants were disembarked in the Libyan capital on Monday, including 16 survivors of a boat carrying 130 people, of whom 114 were still missing at sea. Further shipwrecks were found at the weekend. On Tuesday the Libyan coastguard reported a further seven deaths and a further 123 migrants rescued. The 1,000 deaths landmark was reached on 1 July. It is the fourth year in succession that more than 1,000 migrants have died trying to reach Europe via the Mediterranean Sea. Othman Belbeisi, the chief of mission in Libya at the International Organization for Migration (IOM), claimed the “alarming increase” in deaths at sea was out of the ordinary.
“Smugglers are exploiting the desperation of migrants to leave before there are further crackdowns on Mediterranean crossings by Europe,” he said. Overall the number of migrants reaching Italy by sea is down on last year’s figures, but the proportion of those trying to reach Italy that are drowning is rising, prompting claims that the stricter Italian government policy is to blame. Figures prepared by Matteo Villa, a research fellow at the Italian thinktank ISPI, show that so far in 2018 only half of those leaving Libya have made it to Europe, down from 86% last year. The data shows 44% have been brought back by the Libyan coastguard, compared with 12% last year. A total of 4.5% died or had gone missing, compared with 2.3% last year. But in June, almost one in 10 died or went missing upon departure from the Libyan coast – the highest proportion ever. The Libyan coastguard has returned about 10,000 people to shore this year, according to the IOM. That trend is likely to continue due to three changes of policy by the new Italian government. It has closed the country’s ports to NGO rescue ships; agreed to send an extra 10 motor launches and two ships, dinghies, equipment, and vehicles to help Libyan coastguard; and extended the search and rescue area for which the Libyan coastguard is responsible, therefore reducing the area in which the NGOs and EU ships have responsibility. The EU has also reinforced its direction to the NGOs to obey the orders of the Libyan coastguard. For the first time in months, no NGO ship is operating in the Mediterranean. Two NGO vessels docked in Malta have been detained by the authorities and prevented from leaving to carry out operations. The Italian deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, a member of the Five Star Movement, said the deaths should not to be used as evidence to dispute the government’s tough new migration policy. “We will supply motor launches to Libya because the healthiest thing is that the Libyans should carry out the rescues, and take [the migrants] back to the Libyan coast,” he said. The Italian policy changes have increased the numbers of people put in Libyan detention camps, which have been widely criticised by human rights groups and by UN agencies. Matteo Salvini, the Italian interior minister and driving force behind the policy, has denied claims that the Libyan detention camps are overcrowded prisons, saying he has visited a detention centre there and found the conditions acceptable. But the IOM’s Belbeisi said: “Migrants returned by the coastguard should not automatically be transferred to detention. We are deeply concerned that the detention centres will yet again be overcrowded and that living conditions will deteriorate with the recent influx of migrants.” The UN says up to 10,000 people are being held in detention camps. At a briefing on Monday, a European commission spokeswoman said ships and boats flying the European flag and making rescues at sea could not bring migrants back to Libya. “It is against our values, international law and European law,” Natasha Bertaud said. “We are well aware of the inhumane situation for many migrants in Libya. The UN is working to improve their conditions and there is an emergency transit mechanism to evacuate these people from Libya.” The IOM director-general, William Lacy Swing, will return to Tripoli this week to see first hand the conditions faced by rescued migrants and those returned to shore by the coastguard. The overall numbers reaching Italy are still below last year, but the Italian populist government faces a problem of dealing with a backlog of more than 500,000 people whose asylum cases have not been processed. So far, the EU’s main proposal to prevent migrants reaching Europe – setting up asylum processing centres outside Europe – has been rejected by leaders in Albania, Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. But the EU has yet to apply any serious pressure on these states, which are heavily dependent on EU aid.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/mediterranean-migrants-drown-three-days-libya-italy,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/mediterranean-migrants-drown-three-days-libya-italy
2018-07-03T13:30:31Z,world,World news,"So long, suckers! Japan mourns killing of World Cup psychic octopus","Despite correctly predicting the results of Japan’s first three World Cup group matches in Russia, Rabio the “psychic” octopus was unlikely to have foreseen an event of far greater consequence: its own death. One Twitter user speculated that Rabio’s “murder” had condemned Japan to their heartbreaking last-gasp defeat against Belgium on Monday, denying them a place in the quarter-finals.
While others thought murder too strong a word for the fisherman’s actions, one agreed that dispatching Rabio was bad karma: “This will be the curse of the Octopus and they won’t win the WC for another century!” Rabio had proved the perfect pundit after being caught off the coast of Obira in northern Japan shortly before the Samurai Blue pulled off a shock 2-1 win over Colombia. After being placed in a plastic pool by Kimio Abe, who caught him, Rabio moved stealthily towards one of three boxes representing a win for Japan, a loss, and a draw, and duly predicted the team’s win over Colombia, its draw with Senegal and defeat to Poland.
But as Japan prepared to play Belgium, Abe revealed that the creature had been killed and sold as seafood at the local market soon after it had correctly forecast the result in the Poland match. “I’m glad that all the forecasts turned out correct and Japan moved on to the knockout stage,” Abe told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper. “I hope Rabio’s successor will accurately tip the results of all games and Japan will win the World Cup.” That was not to be. Coach Akira Nishino’s team did, though, win over millions of neutrals watching on TV around the world, as well as praise from fans back home who had watched the match in the middle of the night, prompting shops to sell “football hangover” kits comprising caffeine-laced energy drinks and strong mint gum.
“When we took the lead I thought we were going to win,” said Nao Okada, a university student who burst into tears at a sports bar in Tokyo when the match ended. “It hurts, but it was a really good game … I want Japan to keep playing like that next time,” she told Reuters. Nishino, whose team are ranked 61st in the world, said he took responsibility for the defeat. “When the goal was conceded, I blamed myself, and I question my tactics,” he said, according to Kyodo news. “As for the result, I am very disappointed. I am devastated.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/so-long-suckers-japan-mourns-killing-of-world-cup-psychic-octopus,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/so-long-suckers-japan-mourns-killing-of-world-cup-psychic-octopus
2018-07-03T12:26:10Z,world,World news,German border deal: how might it work and what are the obstacles?,"After weeks of tensions within the conservative alliance of the Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) over Germany’s handling of refugees and migrants, the chancellor, Angela Merkel (CDU), and her interior minister, Horst Seehofer (CSU), claim to have reached a compromise. What happened and why was it important? Germany is to establish so-called transit zones along the southern border in Bavaria to facilitate the accelerated removal of refugees and migrants who have no entitlement to seek asylum in Germany. The decision aims to bring to an end a longstanding row over Germany’s asylum policy, sparked by the refugee crisis of 2015, which has proved the biggest challenge in the almost 14 years of Merkel’s chancellorship. But questions loom over a deal that both Merkel and Seehofer are claiming as a victory, not least how it can be effectively implemented and whether it will get the approval of the CDU and CSU’s other partner in the grand coalition, the Social Democrats. The SPD roundly rejected a similar proposal by the CDU in 2015. The deal follows weeks of conflict, with Seehofer threatening to unilaterally close the Bavarian border to people who had applied for asylum elsewhere in the EU – a move that Merkel rejected because of fears it would threaten the EU partnership and could lead to the end of the passport-free Schengen zone. The row has threatened to bring down Germany’s coalition government. What was agreed? The CDU and CSU have agreed that so-called transit centres are the most effective way to secure Germany’s southern border, through which most of the newcomers have arrived, and to ensure that refugees whose asylum cases are the responsibility of countries other than Germany can be prevented from entering German territory. According to the plan, asylum seekers who have already registered in other countries with whom Merkel has secured a bilateral deal can be deported back to the relevant country after a short stay in the transit centre. There they would have their case for asylum heard according to EU rules. Others would be returned immediately, without entering the transit zone, if the EU country from which they have travelled has not signed up to a bilateral deal. The main obstacle to this is that so far no deal has been secured with Austria, from where most refugees arrive in Bavaria, and it remains unclear whether Austria will be prepared to sign up to such a deal. So far the Austrian government has said it will wait to see details of the German proposal before deciding how to proceed, but a government spokesman said the country was preparing to tighten its border controls. The rules are confusing and likely to be complicated to implement. What is a transit centre or zone, and what might it look like? The zones or centres could feasibly be fenced or guarded metal container accommodation or tent camps. They would be located directly on the border in so-called exterritorial zones – that is to say, on German soil but, legally speaking, not in Germany. The asylum seeker would be obliged to live and sleep in these contained buildings and would undergo a fast-track administrative process. During this time the asylum seeker would not be entitled to leave the transit zone. It remains unclear for how long an asylum seeker would be detained at the border. There are some suggestions it could be around a week. What are the outstanding questions or obstacles? The SPD has to agree on the compromise. In 2015 when something similar was proposed by the CDU, it rejected the idea, likening transit zones to detention centres for refugees, and in some cases comparing them to concentration camps.
Criticism has also come from the police, whose presence will be vital in ensuring the transit zones work. Jörg Radek, deputy chair of the police trade union, has called the idea “an old chestnut”, pointing out that its main flaw is that it is limited to the 500-mile German-Austrian border. Germany’s remaining stretch of border is around 1,860 miles long. The police argue that many people enter Germany outside of the main control points (there are currently three of them) on the German-Austrian border. Legally, those who do so will not be able to be put into transit centres, as they will already be miles away from the border. Arguably the new system would encourage people to enter Germany illegally along the vast swathes of so-called “green border”. Will the deal clear the air between Merkel and Seehofer? In the short term, maybe, but after such a personal and chronic squabble, which has exhausted any trust that may once have existed between the long-term rivals, it is hard to see how they can continue to work together effectively. As to whether it was worth it to have pushed the coalition government to the brink of collapse, the CSU will have to wait until 14 October, when Bavarians will go to the polls for a state election, to find out. The CSU wants to claw back the thousands of votes it has lost to the rightwing populist Alternative für Deutschland, but opinion polls suggest the row has done little to increase trust in the party.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/german-border-deal-how-might-it-work-and-what-are-the-obstacles,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/german-border-deal-how-might-it-work-and-what-are-the-obstacles
2018-07-03T11:30:49Z,world,World news,Matteo Salvini backed by politician 'with links to mafia',"Matteo Salvini’s electoral victory in the southern region of Calabria during the Italian general election this year was supported by a former politician who law enforcement authorities have claimed has close ties to the ‘Ndrangheta, the criminal organisation that controls most of the cocaine trade in Europe. The far-right interior minister and head of the League party, who has emerged as a de facto prime minister, won his senate seat in the region with the backing of a former mayor of Reggio Calabria, Giuseppe Scopelliti, with whom Salvini had a political alliance and who was arrested weeks after the March poll for forging documents while he was mayor. In a previous mafia case in which he was not charged, Scopelliti was described in court documents as being “sponsored” by one of the ruling clans of the ‘Ndrangheta. Prosecutors also alleged in records seen by the Guardian that the most powerful criminal clans in the area played a “crucial role” in Scopelliti’s political career. There is no suggestions that Salvini has any direct ties to the criminal organisation. But the Guardian has examined Salvini’s ties to individuals who are alleged to have close links to the ‘Ndrangheta, because of the interior minister’s role overseeing law enforcement and domestic security. The claims come as Salvini attempted on Tuesday to demonstrate his anti-Mafia priorities by diving into a swimming pool at a Tuscan villa that was confiscated from a mobster. The minister then swam a lap in the pool. The villa was seized from a mafia boss in 2007 after 24 years of legal procedures and turned into a resort. Salvini has also engaged in a public dispute with one of Italy’s most outspoken anti-mafia campaigners, the writer Roberto Saviano, who is a Guardian contributor. Last week Salvini threatened to remove Saviano’s police protection, even though Saviano has been under threat from the Camorra since he published Gomorrah, his breakthrough book about the mafia in Naples, in 2006. Giovanni Tizian, a Calabrian journalist for L’Espresso who has lived under police protection since 2011 after being threatened by the ‘Ndrangheta, told the Guardian that Salvini’s electoral gains in Calabria – from having virtually no support five years ago to winning office – “relied on the support of men with a troubled past and a dark political history”. “The priority was getting as many votes as he could. In this sense, Scopelliti represented a fortune for Salvini. It didn’t matter that Scopelliti was [previously] elected with the support of the clans, as investigations have revealed. Scopelliti was popular and could count on thousands of supporters,” Tizian said. A spokeswoman for Salvini declined to comment. Scopelliti became an important person in Salvini’s political orbit last December, when – before his arrest a few months later – the former mayor declared at a political rally that he would support Salvini and that “side by side” he would build a future with the far-right leader. Even though he had not then been charged with any crimes, Scopelliti was already known for alleged ties to organised crime. Scopelliti’s house was raided by prosecutors in 2016 following an investigation that revealed the existence of a so-called cupola, a secret association of ‘Ndrangheta godfathers and politicians who made decisions in Calabria and helped influence people’s votes. According to investigators in the carabinieri, the military police who led the operation, Scopelliti’s own involvement in politics had been the result of “the decisions of the mafia’s business interests”. One month after Scopelliti announced his support, Salvini – a native of Milan – took advantage of a feature of Italy’s new electoral law and decided to run for parliament in Calabria, despite his northern roots. It was seen at the time as part of his strategy to try to make gains in southern Italy, despite the League’s long track record as a northern secessionist party. It was a bold move. In 2013, the year Salvini took control of the League, his party won just four votes in Rosarno, the town that is also a major stronghold of the ‘Ndrangheta. He had reason to be cautious. In 2017, 12 local governments in the region of Calabria were dissolved because of mafia infiltration. Shortly after he decided to run in Calabria, Salvini agreed an official alliance with Scopelliti’s political party, the Movimento Nazionale per la Sovranità. Against the odds, given his party’s history, Salvini was elected in Calabria in the 4 March election. He now officially serves as a senator representing Calabria, having won about 49,797 votes there. The Five Star Movement, the populist party, won the region overall as part of its sweep of southern Italy. On 17 March, Salvini attended a rally in Rosarno to celebrate the victory. According to La Repubblica, the rally in Rosarno was attended by key members of the ‘Ndrangheta’s clans, including members of the Bellocco clan, one of the most powerful mafia crime families in Calabria. One month later, Scopelliti was arrested and convicted for forging official documents while he was mayor. He is now serving a prison sentence of nearly five years. Scopelliti has denied having any connections to organised crime. There is no evidence that Salvini and Scopelliti had a close personal relationship. The League’s relationship with Scopelliti was reportedly managed by the party’s regional coordinator in Calabria, Domenico Furgiuele, whose father-in-law, a hotel developer, was previously convicted of mafia-related crimes. Furgiuele has also faced police scrutiny. In 2012, records show, he asked his father-in-law to reserve rooms in his hotel for two men who, it later emerged, had committed a mafia-related murder in Vibo Valentia. He was never charged with wrongdoing but was questioned by police, according to La Repubblica. “I had no idea they killed a man. I’m a victim of a misunderstanding. A man asked me a favour, if I had space in the hotel for two of his friends. I didn’t know them,” he told La Repubblica. When asked about links between the League and the ‘Ndrangheta, Salvini told reporters that he was only interested in the campaigns against the mafia. Since he became interior minister, Salvini has said fighting the mafia is one of his priorities. But he has also made two policy proposals that could benefit individuals involved in organised crime: eliminating a limit on all-cash transactions, which helps to curb money laundering and tax evasion, and a broad amnesty of individuals who are being investigated for tax fraud – under a certain limit – as part of a plan for “fiscal peace”. The Five Star movement quashed the plan.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/matteo-salvini-backed-by-politician-with-links-to-mafia,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/matteo-salvini-backed-by-politician-with-links-to-mafia
2018-07-03T09:29:55Z,world,World news,Former Malaysian PM Najib arrested in $4.5bn 1MDB probe,"Najib Razak, the former Malaysian prime minister, has been arrested for his alleged role in the 1MDB scandal, in which billions were embezzled from a government fund. Najib, who was toppled from power in May, was arrested in his Kuala Lumpur home on Tuesday afternoon and will be charged in court in the Malaysian capital on Wednesday morning, according to a statement from the team investigating 1MDB. The former prime minster was picked up from his property using three unmarked cars and taken to the Malaysian anti-corruption agency (MACC) headquarters in Putrajaya where he will be held overnight.
His arrest came after the newly elected government, led by 92-year-old Mahathir Mohamad, reopened the investigation into 1MDB the moment it came into power in May and pledged to bring to justice all of those responsible for the multibillion dollar fraud. Mahathir said last week that authorities had an almost “perfect case” against Najib on charges including bribery, theft of government funds and embezzlement. Najib is expected to be charged with multiple counts of abuse of power and criminal breach of trust by a public servant, which is punishable by whipping and a maximum twenty year jail term. It is thought he will also be charged with using public office for gratification, which again carries a jail term of up to twenty years. The prosecution will be led by the newly appointed Attorney General Tommy Thomas. The 1MDB scandal, described as the biggest corruption scandal in Malaysian history, involved billions of dollars being embezzled from a government fund and fraudulently spent around the world. $681m (£516m) of 1MDB money went into Najib’s personal bank account, where it is alleged it was used to fund the lavish spending habits of Najib and his wife. In the US, the Department of Justice is seeking to seize $1.7bn in real estate, art works, yachts, and luxury goods allegedly bought with misappropriated 1MDB money. Najib was cleared of all wrongdoing when he was prime minister but the investigation was widely viewed as a cover-up. He has always denied responsibility, and reiterated his innocence in a interview last week, saying: “If I knew there was going to be misappropriation of funds, if that was my knowledge, I would have acted.” According to figures in the finance ministry, 1MDB’s losses total $10bn. Najib’s stepson Riza Aziz was also questioned by MACC on Tuesday over allegedly misappropriating 1MDB money to fund the Martin Scorsese film The Wolf of Wall Street. Aziz, who owns a film production company, denies any wrongdoing but in March it was revealed that his company agreed to pay the US government $60m to settle a civil lawsuit that sought to seize assets purchased with money allegedly stolen from 1MDB. Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, have given statements to the MACC over 1MDB.

2018-07-03T08:37:05Z,world,World news,UK to ban discredited 'gay cure' therapies under LGBT action plan,"The government will appoint a national LGBT health adviser and take measures to end so-called conversion therapy as part of a plan to deliver what Theresa May has promised will be “real and lasting change”. The proposals form part of an action plan published by the Equalities Office on Tuesday. It follows a UK-wide survey of LGBT people that had more than 108,000 responses, billed as the largest study of its kind. The 30-page plan contains a series of pledges, including to improve the police response to LGBT hate incidents, more support for LGBT students and teachers and improvements to gender identity services for transgender adults. The proposals, which will receive an initial £4.5m in funding, were welcomed by the campaign groups Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation. Ruth Hunt, Stonewall’s chief executive, said she was “really pleased that the government is listening to the thousands upon thousands of LGBT people who responded to this survey”. The online poll, which ran from July to October last year, sought views from LGBT and intersex people about their personal experiences and interactions with public services. Of those with a minority sexual orientation, 68% said they had avoided holding hands in public with a same-sex partner, while 70% said they had at times not been open about their sexual orientation. In comments released with the plan, the prime minister said the survey had highlighted where more efforts were needed. “I was struck by just how many respondents said they cannot be open about their sexual orientation or avoid holding hands with their partner in public for fear of a negative reaction,” May said. “No one should ever have to hide who they are or who they love. [The plan will] set out concrete steps to deliver real and lasting change across society.” The survey found 5% of respondents had been offered and refused types of conversion therapy – discredited techniques often based around religious views that seek to change people’s sexual orientation. Another 2% had undergone such processes. The plan promises to end these practices, with the Equalities Office to look into various legislative or non-legislative ways to do so. The techniques, sometimes called “cure” therapies, are based on the idea that being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender is a mental complaint that can be reversed. They are often modelled on mainstream methods of psychotherapy, and sometimes prayer, and are known to be harmful. All the major UK regulatory bodies for counselling and psychotherapy have banned members from using such methods, as has the NHS. However, a 2015 study by Stonewall found 10% of health and care staff had heard colleagues express the belief that sexuality can be “cured”. One man who underwent such a process and then took part in sessions to “cure” him said the experience left him suicidal. He told ITV News he underwent a combination of confession and prayers, supposedly to rid him of a gay “demon”. He then took part in sessions for others, but became depressed and prayed to die. “I wanted God to remove me from the world to lessen my suffering and to lessen the suffering of those around me,” he said. “At the time I believed this was a demon being cast out of me. And I remember the next day waking up and thinking, I don’t really know what that means now. Does it mean I’m a straight man now? Is that demon gone? Did that demon really exist?” The survey also found 26% of respondents had experienced verbal harassment or other insults in the past year, with many saying they did not report even more serious incidents to the police. New measures to improve the police’s response to such incidents will be proposed. Penny Mordaunt, the minister for women and equalities, said: “Our action plan is a step towards everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics, being able to live safe, happy and healthy lives where they can be themselves without fear of discrimination.” May is to host the annual Downing Street LGBT Pride reception on Tuesday evening. Among the guests for the first time will be Peter Tatchell. The veteran campaigner said May had invited him after he was “banned” previously. In a separate statement, Tatchell called the action plan a “welcome start”, but said it fell short on issues such as the deportation of LGBT refugees to countries where homophobia was widespread. The £4.5m budget was “derisory and insulting”, he added. Paul Martin, the chief executive of the LGBT Foundation, said his organisation had worked with the Equalities Office on the survey and he was “delighted that the government has listened”. The study and announcement are separate to government plans to amend the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, making the process by which transgender people can change their legal gender easier. A consultation on this is to begin soon. Mordaunt said she had been struck by the survey showing how poorly served transgender people in Britain were by existing systems and legislations, saying the government would examine how to best speed up and demedicalise the process of changing gender. She said the launch of the consultation was not a delaying tactic. “We want to make it less bureaucratic, more supportive and less intrusive,” she said. Asked if there should be less emphasis on medical intervention, Mordaunt told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think that is absolutely right, we already require people to live in their new gender for two years, that is causing all kinds of difficulty and anxiety for people who may have two sets of identity documents … which causes huge problems accessing public services,” she said. Mordaunt said she would also listen to the concerns of some women who have expressed fears that simplifying the process of changing gender could lead to the abuse of female-only spaces, such as domestic violence refuges. “What we are not going to do is unpick the Equalities Act, which protects women-only spaces like refuges for example, we are not going to unpick those safeguards,” Mordaunt said. “Those women raising those concerns are legitimate concerns that we need to address at the end of the consultation but equally legitimate are the concerns of individuals changing their gender and at the moment are having to make all kinds of strategies to do simple things like use the bathroom or go to the gym. We have to look at this and have a sensible conversation.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/uk-to-appoint-lgbt-health-adviser-national-action-plan,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/uk-to-appoint-lgbt-health-adviser-national-action-plan
2018-07-03T06:27:03Z,world,World news,Thai cave rescue: what we know so far,"Twelve boys, aged between 11 and 16 and their football coach, who have been missing for nine days, were found by divers on Monday night. The plan to rescue the boys is proceeding on three fronts. Plan A is to teach the boys to dive so that they can dive out of the cave escorted by navy divers, and the governor reported that the boys have begun doing practice dives in the cave. Cave rescue experts have warned that any attempts to remove the boys while waters remain high could be “unbelievably dangerous” for the boys and their rescuers, given the conditions.
Plan B is to drain the cave system so that the children can walk out of the caves wearing life jackets. Authorities have announced they have reduced the water levels in the first section of the cave – a 1.5km stretch from the entrance to a point they are calling chamber three – by 40%. It is now possible to walk through the water up to chamber three from the entrance. Khao Khiewpakdi, head of Bangkok Metro Administration’s fire and rescue unit said each pump – and there are hundreds at the site – can drain 13,000 litres per hour. Authorities are installing more pumps and are asking electrical engineers to find a way to provide more power for the operation. Plan C is to drill down to the cave where the boys are stranded and rescue them that way. The governor earlier ruled out drilling as an option because the boys are between 800m and 1km below the surface and in a confined space, so it was not thought to be safe. Narongsak Osatanakorn, the governor of Chiang Rai province, who is heading up the rescue mission, said they were in a “race against time” and were evaluating risk levels to try to assess when they should evacuate rescue teams, given that monsoon rains are predicted to arrive on the weekend. The coordinator of the Thai contingent of the rescue team said if the boys are not rescued before monsoon rains arrive and water levels rise further, the group could become cut off from the entrance of the cave, unable to communicate with the outside or receive supplies. Two videos of the group were shared on Wednesday by the Thai Navy SEALS. They are shown wrapped in foil blankets, but in good spirits. Divers will stay with the group while they wait to be extracted A medical team has assessed the health of the trapped boys and their coach and reported back that they are all in good health or having only “light” injuries. There has been jubilation in Thailand at the news the boys and their coach are alive, especially among relatives who have been keeping vigil outside the entrance since the boys were reported missing on Saturday 23 June. The Thai prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, wished the group a “safe and speedy recover” and thanked the rescuers, including the foreign teams who have flocked from Australia, Japan, the US and Britain to help with the search. The young football team, made up of 12 boys aged between 11 and 16, and their coach went missing on Saturday 23 June, after monsoon rains trapped them inside the Tham Luang cave network. They were found on Monday night after a nine-day round-the-clock search involving international teams of divers.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/thai-cave-rescue-what-we-know-so-far,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/thai-cave-rescue-what-we-know-so-far
2018-07-03T06:23:38Z,world,World news,'Today is our best day': Thailand rejoices at news of missing boys,"After eight nights and nine very long days of dimming hopes, the news that 12 teenage boys and their football coach had been safe and well was greeted with joy and astonishment in Thailand, where fears were growing that the children would not be found alive. The football team, made up of boys aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach went missing on 23 June, after monsoon rains trapped them inside the Tham Luang cave network, a 10km stretch of caves in the north of the country.
Families of the boys had gathered under sheets of plastic tarpaulin outside the cave entrance, sleeping on the floor or in camp chairs, and maintaining their vigil as cave rescue experts from around the world flew in to assist the mission. But as the days ticked by and the monsoon rains continued to pound down, hopes that the boys would be rescued were looking slim. The cave network remained flooded and treacherous, filling with water as soon as it was pumped out. Then news broke on Monday night that the team had been located, prompting an explosion of shouts and cries of relief in the makeshift rescue camp set up near the cave entrance. Family members broke down as they looked at the grainy black and white images of their children taken by cave divers. “Today is the best day,” one mother said, waiting outside the cave in darkness. “I have been waiting for my son for so many days, I thought he had a 50% chance of survival.” Other mothers said they were already planning welcome home meals to cook for their children; a Thai fried omelette for one, fried rice for another. “We found our younger brothers are safe,” said the governor of Chiang Rai, Narongsak Osottanakorn, as soldiers, the media and officials pumped their fists in the air and jumped up and down with excitement.
The Reuters correspondent Panu Wongcha-um told CBC news the “huge story” had gripped the world. “It is really a time when the entire nation has come together, to give their support, to share their concern, and at the same time their were moments of anxiety and even despair,” said Wongcha-um. “All that changed overnight. They [the families] were crying with joy, not only the relatives but people around them; officials rescuers, and journalists. I mean this hasn’t been the most easy story to cover ... but all this has changed now, and we hope that the next phase of the rescue operation will be successful.” Glued to smartphones In Chaing Rai, the closest major town to the rescue effort, Time magazine reported that locals and tourists alike were glued to their smartphones following news of the rescue, while a BBC correspondent said he became aware of the news after he awoke to shouts of joy from hotel staff, who were toasting the boys miraculous survival in the hotel bar, watching it unfold on TV. In schools around the country, children reportedly struggled to concentrate on their schoolwork, after holding daily prayers for the lost boys safe return. On social media, Thais singled out the British volunteer cave divers who located the boys, skinny but composed, perched on a muddy bank a few feet above the water. Three hashtags to do with the search started trending on Twitter in Thailand: #13ชีวิตรอดแล้ว (the 13 have survived), as well as the name of the cave in both Thai and English: #ThamLuang and #ถํ้าหลวง. “We found them. We found them. We found them. We found them” wrote one Twitter user.
Although news of the boys being found was too late to make the front pages of Thailand’s newspapers, stories of how they were found – and how now they could be rescued – swamped the nation’s media websites, with a number of international papers also choosing to splash with the miraculous discovery.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/today-is-our-best-day-thailand-rejoices-at-news-that-missing-boys-are-alive,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/today-is-our-best-day-thailand-rejoices-at-news-that-missing-boys-are-alive
2018-07-03T06:14:20Z,world,World news,'WhatsApp murders': India struggles to combat crimes linked to messaging service,"Indian authorities are scrambling to combat a spate of murders linked to rumours circulating on messaging application WhatsApp. Eight people have been killed across the country in the past few days, after rumours spread on the app about child kidnappers on the loose and a video was circulated that purported to show a boy being snatched.
In the past year the murders of at least 30 people accused of being “child-lifters” have been linked to the platform, India’s most popular social media app with more than 200 million users. Police and state governments are scrambling to respond to the violence. One of the victims killed on Friday in Tripura state had been hired by the government to tour villages with a megaphone to try to dispel rumours that gangs of child kidnappers were prowling the area.
WhatsApp, one of the most-used apps in the world with 1.5 billion users, has faced problems with misinformation in other large markets such as Brazil or Indonesia, but the consequences in India have been far more violent than elsewhere. In the latest incident on Sunday morning, five people belonging to a nomadic community were lynched in a remote village in Maharashtra state where police said messages about child kidnappers had gone viral. The group had reportedly stepped off a bus and were talking to a girl when they were surrounded by a crowd of up to 35 people, including children, and beaten to death. The mob turned on police when they arrived at the scene, injuring at least four officers. One video being blamed as a catalyst for the panic depicts a child being snatched from a south Asian street by two men on a motorcycle. The footage is part of a Pakistani child safety campaign; omitted from the version being spread on WhatsApp is a final scene in which the boy is returned.
The Facebook-owned social media app has become ubiquitous in India and been employed in innovative ways, including to assist rural doctors to get real-time advice from more experienced counterparts in cities. But WhatsApp says it is limited in what it can do to stem the spread of harmful rumours without compromising the encrypted nature of the software. Last week it introduced a feature for group administrators to restrict who has the ability to post messages to others in the group. It is also beta-testing a way to clearly mark out forwarded messages – as opposed to those written by the sender – to encourage people to apply scepticism to posts sent to them by trusted friends or relatives.
Ahead of the 2019 national elections, the app is also planning to partner with fact-checking websites in India as it did in the recent Mexican elections, where voters were encouraged to send rumours to a dedicated number which would provide factual information in response. WhatsApp’s user base in India has nearly tripled in the past four years as smartphones have proliferated and the price of data has crashed. But the trend has posed serious challenges in a country “where digital literacy is next to nothing in many parts”, according to Pratik Sinha, the founder of the fake news-busting website AltNews. “Because of the telecommunications revolution, mobiles have reached the furthest end of the country, but education has to go with it,” Sinha said. The Indian government is yet to respond to the crisis but their state counterparts have been experimenting with different ways to douse rumours that could incite violence including education programs and police hotlines where hoaxes can be debunked. Lynchings in India have become more prominent problem since 2015, when a Muslim villager in Uttar Pradesh state was killed by a mob after rumours spread that he was storing beef in his freezer. In that case the accusation was spread by a loudspeaker from a nearby temple. But Mohammad Ali, an Indian journalist who is writing a book about lynchings, said that crime and the killings of the past months had a common thread, linked to rising nationalist sentiment in the country. “Those who were lynched last month in Assam did not look part of the local culture,” he said. In Hyderabad last month, it was a migrant worker who was killed. In Maharashtra at the weekend, it was members of a fringe tribe. “The idea is to target anyone who seems different,” he said. “It is part of a discourse of nationalism and extreme polarisation the consumes anyone seen as the other.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/whatsapp-murders-india-struggles-to-combat-crimes-linked-to-messaging-service,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/whatsapp-murders-india-struggles-to-combat-crimes-linked-to-messaging-service
2018-07-03T05:36:38Z,world,World news,Tuesday briefing: British cave divers at heart of Thailand rescue,"Top story: ‘Many people are coming’ Good morning – this is Alison Rourke bringing you the top stories on Tuesday 3 July. Two veteran British cave divers were at the forefront of the mission that found 12 Thai boys and their football coach after nine days missing in a vast cave system. In footage of the moment the divers arrived in the chamber where the boys were huddled on a ledge above flood waters, the rescuers told the boys that help was coming: “Many people are coming ... we are the first.”
The two British divers, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, worked with Thai navy seal teams to reach the boys. “They managed to dive the last section and get through into the chamber where the missing party were on a ledge above the water,” said Bill Whitehead, head of the British Cave Rescue Council.
The logistical effort to get the boys out may prove much harder than getting in. Experts warn it may take months. None of the children can swim. The military is sending in food and provisions to last for more than four months. A medical team has been sent in to assess the children but they are all reported to be in good health, but hungry. * * * Petrol prices going up? – Theresa May is close to lifting an eight-year freeze on fuel duty and considering ending the cap on alcohol taxes to raise billions of pounds to help boost public spending and reduce the deficit. An inflation-linked increase would raise £800m to help pay for the PM’s promise to spend an extra £20bn on the NHS by 2023 (which May had said would be partly funded through a “Brexit dividend”). Senior government sources told the Guardian that the plan to scrap the freeze would ease pressure on public finances, with a number of ministers lobbying for funding for their own departments since the news of the NHS boost. * * * ‘Appalling treatment’ – MPs have called for a total reform of the Home Office following the handling of the Windrush scandal. A damning report from the home affairs select committee said the office needed “root and branch reform”. The introduction of a barrage of hostile environment policies at the same time as legal aid was removed for immigration cases meant the Windrush generation were unable to get help when they found themselves classified as illegal immigrants. Many lost their jobs and homes, and were denied NHS treatment and unable to travel, the report found. * * * LGBT health adviser – The UK is to appoint a national adviser to end so-called conversion therapy as part of an action plan published by the Equalities Office today. The 30-page document includes pledges to improve police responses to LGBT hate incidents, and more support for LGBT students and teachers as well as improving gender identity services for adults. It follows a UK-wide survey of LGBT people that had more than 108,000 responses, billed as the largest study of its kind. Stonewall’s chief executive, Ruth Hunt, said she was “really pleased that the government is listening to the thousands upon thousands of LGBT people who responded to this survey”. * * * Trump defends tariffs – Donald Trump has defended his controversial tariffs and trade policies, calling on the World Trade Organisation to “change their ways”. He said the WTO had “been treating us very badly for many, many years and that’s why we were at a big disadvantage”, adding that if the organisation didn’t treat the US properly “we will do something”. Trump’s comments came as signs mounted that administration policies on global trade were beginning to bite. Goldman Sachs warned the second half of 2018 would be tough for investors as they grapple with rising tariffs and interest rates. There’s more on this in the business news below. * * * Voyeurism epidemic – As the UK prepares to introduce legislation banning upskirting, South Korea is confronting a wave of secret filming of sexual images, known as “molka”. From filming in public toilets with hidden cameras, to pen and watch cameras, websites carry a deluge of footage showing women being filmed without their knowledge – some having sex, others relaxing at home or walking along the street. The president, Moon Jae-in, recently acknowledged it had become a “daily part of life”. One victim tells the Guardian of her horror when discovering a secret camera hidden in a toilet seat, which had been recording her every move.
World Cup Strap yourselves in, England’s moment of truth is here. Gareth Southgate’s side face Colombia in the last 16 tonight (kick-off 7pm BST) when the manager will hope his team can justify the decision to rest several players in their last outing. Southgate has urged his players to avoid the traps of the past when they take to the pitch in Moscow looking to reach a first knockout win at the World Cup in 12 years. The good news is that James Rodríguez is a doubt for Colombia; the bad news is that José Pekerman is confident of winning even without their star player. Either way, this being England and the knockout stage of a World Cup, so it’ll probably end in a gut-wrenching penalty shootout defeat anyway. Buildup to the big game has begun already. Aready safely into the quarter-finals are Brazil, after Neymar and Roberto Firmino goals knocked out Mexico, although accusations of diving and feigning injury continue to dog Neymar, who later said the hum of talk around his behaviour was just opponents trying to put him off his game. A mouthwatering last-eight tie against Belgium is the reward for Brazil, after Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli helped Belgium to a miraculous 3-2 comeback win over Japan. The pair, who play bit-part roles at their clubs, proved their worth with goals to crush Japanese hopes and add weight to the argument that this World Cup is absolute chaos. Lunchtime read: noise pollution isn’t just annoying, it’s deadly From heart disease to type 2 diabetes, noise is having a dire effect on people’s health. Richard Godwin writes that he “never wanted to be the sort of person who got angry about noise”. But, he says, it’s not simply that noise accelerates the “grumpification process” – it’s a pollutant, with well-established effects on multiple aspects of physical and mental health, from cardiovascular disease to depression.
“There’s consistent evidence that road traffic noise leads to heart attacks,” according to Dr Yutong Samuel Cai, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London who recently analysed the health data of 356,000 people in Britain and Norway, and found that long-term exposure to traffic noise affects our blood biochemistry, over and above the effects of exhaust fumes. Another study, from Barts and the London School of Medicine, has linked noise pollution from road traffic to instances of type 2 diabetes. One of the compounding factors is inequality, Godwin writes; houses next to busy roads tend to be cheaper. So what can you do if noise is driving you crazy? Complain ... to the right person who can do something to fix it. Sport Chris Froome is clear to attempt a record-equalling fifth Tour de France victory but anti-doping experts are unhappy with the lack of information in the resolution of his case. Serena Williams shook off some rust to make the second round at Wimbledon, where she will be joined by 19-year-old Briton Katie Swan, who stunned world No 36 Irina-Camelia Begu in straight sets on the opening day of play. French Open finalist Sloane Stephens became the first major casualty of the tournament after defeat to Donna Vekic, but there were no such worries in the men’s draw for Roger Federer who swatted aside Dusan Lajovic to begin his title defence. Meanwhile, Britain’s lack of depth in the men’s draw was highlighted by defeats for both Cameron Norrie – to Aljaz Bedene, who used to represent Great Britain – and Liam Broady. And Australia’s national basketball team “feared for their safety” during and after an “alarming” brawl during a World Cup qualifier in the Philippines that was called off after 13 players were ejected. Business Donald Trump’s trade war with the EU is costing manufacturers in the US and the eurozone, new figures show. According to the latest survey of American factories by IHS Markit, the president’s tariffs added to the cost of raw materials and components in June. It also contributed to the lengthiest delays for supplies reaching factory production lines since the poll was started in 2007. A parallel survey of eurozone manufacturers found economic activity dropped to the lowest level for 18 months in June, with the worst of the slowdown coming in Germany, France and Greece. Low-income families need their disposable income to rise by nearly a third in order to meet rising transport, childcare and energy costs, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. It said government benefit cuts were hitting lower-earning households in the UK, making it increasingly difficult for them to keep up with the rising cost of living.

The amazing story of the 12 Thai boys and their coach trapped deep in a cave system features on the front of several of the papers, including the Guardian and the i, which both carry a large picture of one of the relieved relatives. The Guardian’s caption reads: “We found them safe”. The Times splashes on a picture of the boys perched inside the cave, nine days after they went missing. The Telegraph focuses closer to home, leading on what it says is a “Cabinet schism as May seeks Brexit deal” with the FT reporting that Tesco and Carrefour have struck a deal to take on German rivals, including Aldi and Lidl. The tabloids are united in their coverage of England’s do-or-die match against Colombia tonight. “Now write your own history, boys ... ” screams the Mirror’s front page, reporting Gareth Southgate’s rallying cry to the team, with a full-page picture of Harry Kane.

2018-07-03T05:32:16Z,world,World news,Thai cave Q&A: how can the boys be rescued and what are the dangers?,"The dramatic discovery on Monday night of 12 boys and their football coach who were missing inside a cave in Thailand has captivated the world. Attention has now turned to the crucial task facing the Thai navy and the teams of international rescuers: getting the group to safety.
What are the options for getting the boys out? They really don’t have any good options and much depends on what the rain is going to do in the next few weeks, says Anmar Mirza, US National Cave Rescue Commission coordinator. Trying to dive the children out is the most dangerous but also the fastest. Mirza says the big decision is, ‘Are they are in a safe place in the cave even if the water continues to rise?’ If they’re safe, then the best option may be to supply them so they can survive while other options are developed. Butch Hendricks, a veteran rescue diver and president of Lifeguard Systems in the US, says a key point is the fact none of the boys can swim. If they’re not afraid of the water, they can be put into equipment they can breathe with, and a full face mask. They may need custom wetsuits so they don’t get so hypothermic they can’t function. Because of the narrow passages, only one boy can be brought out at a time. Hendricks said: “If a problem occurs in that passageway, we’ve going to have a stall, then they will have a back-up, which could cause life and death.” He said the system would work like a relay, where each boy is passed between rescuers. Peter Wolf, national director of the Cave Divers Association of Australia, believes the best option is to leave them where they are and stabilise their environment to make sure their essential needs are met. The environment is wet, so they must be kept warm and dry, and be provided with clean drinking water, food, and clean air. Depending on the size of the chamber they’re in, clean air is a real concern. How long is the rescue operation likely to take? Depending on what route they end up taking, it could be a few days to a few weeks to potentially two or three months, said Mirza. Hendricks said it could be five to seven days until the first person comes out. If everything goes right, it could be anything from a couple of weeks to a month or more for the group. Wolf said there was talk about leaving them in there for months and did not believe taking them out through the water was a viable option. The key factor is whether the water level can be reduced, either naturally or mechanically. What are the main risks? If going with the diving option, a rescuer dealing with an untrained diver can be fatal for both, said Mirza. The divers themselves can have trouble bringing equipment in. Hendricks said the extremely narrow passageways meant there would be points where the rescuers would have had to take off their equipment, push it ahead of them and then put it back on. Wolf said visibility was a key risk. It was likely to be very close to zero which meant they would be feeling their way along. Rescuers will be laying guidelines to their destination and to find their way out.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/thai-cave-qa-how-can-the-boys-be-rescued-and-what-are-the-dangers,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/thai-cave-qa-how-can-the-boys-be-rescued-and-what-are-the-dangers
2018-07-03T05:14:29Z,world,World news,"Rescue of boys trapped in Thai cave could take months, military warns","
The 12 boys and their football coach found alive in a Thailand cave could be stuck there for months, the country’s military has said as it prepares to bring in long-term food supplies and diving training for the stranded group. A team of two British divers found the team in the flooded cave system in Thailand’s Chiang Rai province, nine days after the boys aged 11 to 16 and their 25 year-old coach went missing. Their story of resilience under dire circumstances has captivated people around the world. However, bringing the boys and their coach up to the surface is a complicated task. Engineers have been pumping water out of the cave for a week, and a temporary respite from the rains has also lowered water levels. By Tuesday they were removing 10,000 litres of water an hour, lowering the water level by a centimetre every hour.
But heavy precipitation expected in the coming days, as the rainy season begins, could severely hamper rescue efforts and the boys might have to wait as long as several months for the waters to recede to safe levels. Thai navy captain Anand Surawan said: “[We will] prepare to send additional food to be sustained for at least four months and train all 13 to dive while continuing to drain the water.”
Peter Wolf, the national director of the Cave Divers Association of Australia, said: “The best option is to leave them where they are and stabilise their environment to make sure the core ingredients are met. Given the environment is pretty wet, to keep them warm and dry, provide them with clean drinking water, food, and clean air. “Depending on the size of the chamber they’re in, the clean air is a concern as well.” None of the boys can swim or dive, and Edd Sorenson of International Cave Rescue and Recovery warned it would be “unbelievably dangerous” for someone with no experience to navigate the cave with near-zero visibility and rushing water. “As long as the kids know we know where they’re at, they have food, a way to keep warm, water or filtration systems and light, it would really be the safest to wait it out. But taking them in the water would be extremely dangerous for the kids and the coach but also for the rescuers.”
It is thought the 12 boys and their coach entered the cave on 23 June, before a sudden monsoon flooded the 10km network. The group was found huddled on a mud bank two metres above the water level, taking shelter there as water around them rose. The wet season typically lasts from May to October in northern Thailand on the borders with Laos and Myanmar, where the Tham Luang cave is located. Since the group were found alive on Monday, divers have supplied the boys and their coach with energy gel to eat, and two Thai Navy medical personnel have joined the group to keep them company and monitor the boys as they await rescue, according to the Navy Seals Facebook page. Wolf said the length of the cave and the conditions meant “there are probably very few people on the planet who can actually get those provisions to them”. Officials at the cave said most of the boys were in a stable medical condition, and none was in a critical state.
Narongsak Osatanakorn, the governor of Chiang Rai province, said on Tuesday morning that rescuers had classified the boys using a traffic light system: red (critical condition), yellow (serious) or green (stable). “We found that most of the boys are in green condition,” he said, according to the Associated Press. “Maybe some of the boys have injuries or light injuries and would be categorised as yellow condition. But no one is in red condition.” “We called this mission impossible because it rained every day ... but with our determination and equipment we fought nature.” He said the final decision on when and how to evacuate the boys lies with the Thai navy, and one option under consideration was to teach them to swim using a type of breathing mask. Search teams had been deployed to look for other ways into the cave network.
Divers said the temperature in the cave was a about 26 degrees, with water dripping from the walls, meaning the children were unlikely to have experienced dehydration and hypothermia. Ben Reymenants, a Belgian rescuer who is part of the international team which is assisting the Thai authorities, told the BBC: “The issue is that time is not really on our side because they’re expecting heavy rains within three days and the cave system [could] just flood, making access impossible for the kids.”
The group is between 800 metres and a kilometre below the surface, and roughly two kilometres inside the cave. Bill Whitehouse, vice chair of the British Cave Rescue Council: “They are also located in a relatively small space and this would make any potential drilling attempt as a means of rescue very difficult.” Despite the looming difficulties, the news that the 12 children and their coach were alive sparked intense hope across Thailand, and an outpouring of gratitude for rescue workers online. Photos of the two British divers, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, who are believed to have found the boys widely circulated on Twitter with messages of thanks, while many on social media highlighted the international nature of the rescue effort. The Thai prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, held a telephone conference to congratulate the rescuers at the cave site. The boys were reportedly familiar with the cave. Tham Luang cave is one of Thailand’s longest and one of the toughest to navigate, with snaking chambers and narrow passageways. A sign outside the site warns visitors not to enter the cave during the rainy season. Officials were also installing telephone lines to allow the children to speak to their parents, Germany news agency DPA reported. More than 1,000 Thai military personnel are at the site as well as teams from seven countries, including the UK, US and Australia.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/rescue-of-boys-trapped-in-thai-cave-could-take-months-military-warns,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/rescue-of-boys-trapped-in-thai-cave-could-take-months-military-warns
2018-07-03T04:00:27Z,world,World news,'A part of daily life': South Korea confronts its voyeurism epidemic,"Han Jin-young was working for a trading company in Seoul when a visit to the office bathroom revealed the ugly truth about one of her male colleagues. As she was about to leave, she spotted a hole in the toilet-seat cover, a recent “gift” for female employees from the firm’s vice president. She lifted up the cover to find a tiny camera. It had been recording her every move. As the UK prepares to introduce legislation banning upskirting, South Korea has been forced to confront its own epidemic of secretly filmed images of a sexual nature, known as molka.
According to police, the number of molka arrests soared from 1,110 in 2010 to more than 6,600 in 2014, although the real number of cases is thought to be many times higher. Of the 16,201 people arrested between 2012 and 2017 for making illegal recordings, 98% were men; 84% of the 26,000 recorded victims over that period were women. The country’s president, Moon Jae-in, recently acknowledged that illegal spycam images had become “a part of daily life” and called for tougher penalties for perpetrators. Offenders face a fine of up to 10m won (£6,800) or a maximum prison sentence of up to five years, but campaigners say few feel the full force of the law. Many offenders are ordered to pay modest fines and in most cases the crime goes unpunished. ‘A deep-seated sexism’ More than 400,000 people recently signed a petition calling on the presidential Blue House to force police to properly investigate all molka allegations. And last month, an estimated 22,000 women took to the streets of Seoul in what local media reported as the biggest women’s rights demonstration in South Korea’s history. The protest was called after a woman was quickly arrested and paraded in front of the media – albeit wearing a mask – after she was found to have secretly filmed a nude male model during a university drawing class and posted the video online. The speed of her arrest led to accusations from an anonymous collective that organised the Right to be Uncomfortable march in June that a double standard was at work when the victims were men. “A deep-seated sexism lies behind the incredibly unbalanced numbers between men and women regarding this crime,” one of the organisers, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian. “The problem is aggravated by the uncooperative attitude of the police and the light penalties given out by the courts.” South Korea’s ubiquitous smartphones and miniature spycams aside, offenders can turn to an array of seemingly everyday items – including pens, watches and shoes – equipped with spycams. The filming is not confined to public toilets: websites carrying spycam footage show women being filmed without their knowledge having sex, relaxing at home and walking along the street.
‘The police believed everything he said’ Han, whose name has been changed at her request, said she “froze in terror” when she realised she had been secretly filmed. She confronted the suspect, who admitted he had installed the device but denied watching any of the footage as the camera had only been switched on the previous day. A sceptical Han persevered, and uncovered hundreds of video clips and photographs he had kept of her and other women. What happened next was typical of the response experienced by South Korean women who attempt to take legal action. Han complained to the police, who initially tried to dismiss her concerns. The vice-president, a colleague of five years, told them he was in love with her and complained that he was no longer intimate with his heavily pregnant wife. “The police believed everything he said,” said Han, who quit the firm while the vice-president, who still works for the company, was fined just 500,000 won (£340). In response to the protest in June, the South Korean government said it would take preventative measures, including checks on tens of thousands of public toilets and inspections of public buildings. Police have denied accusations that they fail to take women’s complaints seriously, citing the difficulty of verifying allegations based on footage that often does not show the victim’s face. When they are prosecuted, most perpetrators are told to pay a modest fine. Wee Eun-jin, head of the women’s rights committee at Lawyers for a Democratic Society, said the current law did little to help victims. “There have been cases in which no action was taken against a suspect because the recordings were of the victim’s legs or covered buttocks, and the judges believed that this would not have caused feelings of humiliation,” said Wee, who represents molka victims. “They live in constant fear. I often advise them not to take their complaint to court as I know it will not lead to the result they want. I often end up being their counsellor, not their lawyer. It is heartbreaking. There have only been a handful of instances where offenders who uploaded such materials were prosecuted and punished,” said the march organiser, adding that more protests were planned. “The victims have to look through countless websites searching for videos that show their genitals, then capture the image so they can show it to the police. It is humiliating.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/a-part-of-daily-life-south-korea-confronts-its-voyeurism-epidemic-sexual-harassment,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/a-part-of-daily-life-south-korea-confronts-its-voyeurism-epidemic-sexual-harassment
2018-07-03T03:39:35Z,world,World news,British divers at heart of Thai cave rescue among best in world,"Two volunteer British cave divers who are believed to be the first to locate 12 Thai boys and their coach after nine days of searches are world leaders in cave rescue, and have frequently worked together on major search and rescue operations around the globe.
The group, who went missing during an excursion with their football team coach, were found on Monday night on a small ledge inside a vast cave system in northern Thailand. In footage of the moment the divers arrived in the chamber, a rescuer with an English accent is heard trying to reassure the group that help is coming.
Bill Whitehead, vice chair of the British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC), said Rick Stanton and his colleague Volanthen spearheaded the mission. “They were pushing ahead with the other divers following on behind, creating dumps of air bottles,” he said. “They managed to dive the last section and get through into the chamber where the missing party were on a ledge above the water.” Stanton, aged in his mid-fifties, is a firefighter who hails from Coventry and is regarded as one of Britain’s foremost cave divers, with more than 35 years experience. Stanton combines expertise in dry caving and technical diving. In 2013 he described his numerous search and rescue missions as “my hobby”, telling divenet that his participation on missions had been on an “entirely voluntary” basis.
Stanton was awarded an MBE in 2012 for services to cave diving, and is often described as the face of British cave diving, and the best cave diver in Europe. Volanthen, who brushed off reporters when entering the cave six days ago, saying only “we’ve got a job to do”, started out as a dry caver who has helped pioneer new equipment that allows cave divers to stay underwater for longer and at greater depths. Volanthen’s technical skills include pushing the limits of rebreather technology, thought to be used by the pair as they navigate the six-mile (10 kilometres) Tham Luang Nang Non network in northern Thailand. Volanthen is a computer engineer who runs marathons in his spare time and lives in Bristol. In 2010, the pair attempted the rescue of accomplished French diver Eric Establie, who was trapped by a silt avalanche inside the Ardeche Gorge, near Marseille. It is believed the French government requested Stanton and Volanthen by name. The duo received medals from the Royal Humane Society for their eight-day effort to save Establie, whose body they recovered from the cave. British diver Neil Bennett of NZ Diving said the pair were brought together in Thailand because of their technical skills and experience using rebreathers; a type of diving equipment that allows air to be recirculated and reused. “In this situation where it is completely extreme and hostile you have to work with a partner who you know well, and is trained to a similar level as yourself. You can’t go down on your own – that would be suicide – you work as a team,” said Bennett. “Both John Volanthen and Rick Stanton are highly accomplished caver divers who have set achievements within a number of major cave systems around Europe ... they specialise in rebreather technology that is ideally suited for the situation faced in the Thai cave system.” The BCRC said Stanton and Volanthen were working in Thailand in a voluntary capacity, and were “experts in low-visibility cave dives within small passages”.
“They are diving daily, for long periods, in very challenging and hazardous conditions and need full rest and recuperation in the short time between dives,” a BCRC spokesman said. “Clear judgment and physiological recovery are essential for their personal safety and effectiveness in the operation to rescue the boys.”
A third British cave diver, Robert Harper, was also sent to Thailand by the BCRC, and the team has been joined by Vern Unsworth, a British cave explorer based in Chiang Rai, Reuters reported. Diving lines laid down by the British cave divers will now allow essential supplies to be ferried to the trapped boys, the BCRC said. Talking to divenet in 2007, Stanton said cave divers tended to shun the limelight. “I’m only interested in the cave, where it’s going and how it ends,” Stanton said. “I suppose that’s what motivates me – I don’t know why, but that’s it.” In February 2014, both men were asked by the Norwegian police to help rescue the bodies of two cavers who died more than 100 metres underground in a caving network know as Steinugleflaget in Norway. Stanton told the BBC at the time that despite the British team trying their best; the rescue mission was too dangerous and could not be safely executed. “It was evident that it was going to be quite a protracted affair, lots of dives, down deep and cold – and that was really beyond our remit,” Stanton told the BBC, recounting the aborted mission.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/british-divers-at-heart-of-thai-cave-rescue-among-best-in-world,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/british-divers-at-heart-of-thai-cave-rescue-among-best-in-world
2018-07-03T00:12:05Z,world,World news,British divers make contact with missing Thai football team,"Rescuers are working to free 12 boys and their football coach who have been found alive nine days after going missing in a flooded cave in Thailand. Dramatic video shared on the Facebook page of the Thai navy Seals showed the moment the emaciated youths, huddled onto a sliver of dry ground surrounded by water, were found by two British divers. Lit by feeble torchlight, the exhausted group asked for food and whether they could leave the cave as one of the divers urges them to stay calm. Asked how many of them there were, a child said: “Thirteen.” The diver replied: “Thirteen? Brilliant!” The boys, aged 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach went missing after entering the cave on 23 June and becoming trapped by rising floodwater, prompting a desperate round-the-clock search beset by torrential downpours that stopped divers going in. Another child said: “We are hungry ... Shall we go outside?” The unidentified diver replies: “I know, I understand ... No, not today.” He explained that they had to go, but others will come: “Many, many people are coming ... We are the first”. One of the two divers, named by the BBC as Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, who were flown into Thailand early last week, explained it was “Monday ... You have been here for 10 days, you are very strong.” The governor of Chiang Rai province, Narongsak Osottanakorn, said earlier the group had been found in the six-mile Tham Luang Nang Non cave, on the border with Laos and Myanmar, “all with signs of life”. In comments broadcast nationwide, he said the 13 were in the process of being rescued, but warned that he did not know their condition and they were not out of danger yet. “We found them safe. But the operation isn’t over,” he said.
A diver has been sent down to “keep them company” while a rescue plan is worked out. None of the team can swim and rescuers have said they may have to wait several weeks for the water to subside before they can be taken out. Vice chair of the British Cave Rescue Council, Bill Whitehouse, said the rescue mission has been made more difficult because there is likely only going to be a short break in the monsoon rains and because of the small space the group are in, which makes drilling difficult. Whitehouse also estimated that the boys are around 2km into the cave and somewhere between 800 m to 1km below the surface. He cautioned that diving conditions remained “very difficult”. Families ecstatic Pictures from the scene showed joyful relatives who had clustered near the cave in an increasingly fraught vigil looking at a photograph on an iPad taken by one of the rescue divers, which showed four of the boys smiling and looking in good health. Aisha Wiboonrungrueng, the mother of 11-year-old Chanin Wiboonrungrueng, said she was overjoyed and would cook her son a fried omelette, his favorite food, when he returned home. “I’m so glad ... I want him to be physically and mentally fit,” said Tinnakorn Boonpiem, whose 12-year-old son, Mongkol, is also among the 13. “I found out from the television ... I’m so happy I can’t put it into words,” another relative of one of the group told television reporters, tears of joy streaming down his cheeks.
As the days wore on with the group missing, distraught family members placed fruit, desserts, sugary drinks and sweets on mats near the cave as an offering to the mountain spirits which some people believe protect the cave and the forest. Shamans and Buddhist monks held prayers at the cave mouth imploring the spirits to return the boys safely. An international rescue effort The international rescue effort has gripped Thailand for more than a week. Cave diving experts flew in from the UK, and 17 US air force rescue and survival specialists travelled from Japan to join the 132 Thai army, navy and police officers working day and night to try to find the group. US navy Seals reached a T-junction deep into the cave, one or two miles from where the boys were believed to be, on Saturday. Other divers including Thai Seals made progress through the passageway on Monday, after the high waters began to recede. Narongsak said medical teams have been sent inside the cave and it would take them around four hours to assess the group’s health and how fit they are before coming up with a strategy to get them out. The divers located the missing group about 300-400 metres past a section of the cave that was on higher ground and was thought to be where the team members and their coach may have taken shelter. “When the medics have evaluated the kids, we will care for them until they have enough strength to move by themselves, and then we will evaluate the situation on bringing them out again later,” Narongsak said. Earlier on Monday divers took advantage of a brief window of good weather to edge further into the cave, with the water levels dropping slowly but steadily every hour thanks to round-the-clock pumping. Narongsak explained that the divers had fixed rope lines along the passageway and distributed oxygen tanks along their route, allowing them to advance through the exceptionally narrow passageway unencumbered by bulky equipment. Other teams worked to pump out floodwater and divert groundwater, he said.
The boys were said to be in a good condition but “very hungry” and they have been given energy gels to sustain them while a plan is worked out to bring them to safety. The boys are around a mile and a half underground in an area known as Patia beach, and it could be days until they are successfully brought to the surface. The director of the school where half the boys go said they only had two to three days of food with them. “These are challenging conditions and there’s a lot of consideration for safety as well as the environment outside contributing to the environment inside,” said Jessica Tait, a US air force captain who is part of the operation. Tait, who joined the Thai-led international rescue mission from her base in Okinawa, Japan, told Sky News that the rescue operation was “not done” quite yet. “We need to start thinking about isolated personnel, and it’s about being able to bring them back safely,” she said, paying tribute to the boys’ “mental fortitude”, because people can survive in unideal conditions if the “heart is there”. Thailand’s prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, thanked the international experts and rescuers who helped locate the missing for their “tremendous efforts”. The Thai government and Thai people “are grateful for this support and cooperation, and we all wish the team a safe and speedy recovery,” Prayuth’s office said. The boys, members of the Moo Pa academy, reportedly knew the site well and had visited it many times before, buoying hopes that they might have trekked to a large airy chamber in the centre.
They cycled to the cave with their coach after football practice and are thought to have crawled in through a narrow 15-metre tunnel that became completely flooded due to almost non-stop heavy rain. Rescuers found their bicycles, football boots and backpacks near the cave’s entrance and discovered handprints and footprints further in. Aektrakoon Suwanmard, a member of the football team, said he went to practice with the team on the day they went missing but opted against going inside the cave because he had to go home early. Tham Luang cave is one of Thailand’s longest and one of the toughest to navigate, with snaking chambers and narrow passageways. A sign outside the site warns visitors not to enter the cave during the rainy season between July and November. In a complex and potentially dangerous operation, rescue workers will now have to assess how to bring the group several miles through the cave, which is still partially submerged and is linked by tight passages. Anmar Mirza, a leading American cave rescue expert, told Associated Press many challenges remained. He said the primary decision was whether to try to evacuate the boys and their coach or to feed supplies through to them. “Supplying them on site may face challenges depending on how difficult the dives are,” said Mirza, the coordinator of the US National Cave Rescue Commission. “Trying to take non-divers through a cave is one of the most dangerous situations possible, even if the dives are relatively easy. That also begets the question: if the dives are difficult then supply will be difficult, but the risk of trying to dive them out is also exponentially greater.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/twelve-boys-missing-in-flooded-thai-cave-found-after-nine-days,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/twelve-boys-missing-in-flooded-thai-cave-found-after-nine-days
2018-07-02T22:16:19Z,world,World news,"Amlo's allies: the footballer, the militia leader and environmental scientist","Andrés Manuel López Obrador won a decisive victory in Mexico’s presidential elections, but his electoral coalition also scored a string of successes in gubernatorial and mayoral races across the country – as well as seizing the largest number of seats in congress.
López Obrador, best known as Amlo, had pitched a big tent which included two former leaders of the right-leaning National Action party (Pan), as well as the Social Encounter party (PES), which was founded by Evangelicals in 2014. Among those candidates who rode into office on Amlo’s coattails were an environmental scientist who became Mexico City’s first elected female mayor; a pugnacious former footballer; and the leader of a citizen’s militia who ran narco-traffickers from her town – but ended up in prison on kidnapping charges.
Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo Sheinbaum – a former member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – became the capital city’s first female elected mayor after winning a landslide for Amlo’s party, Morena. A former environment minister for Mexico City, Sheinbaum is a specialist on vehicle emissions and climate change mitigation, and supporters say her experience makes her uniquely qualified to tackle the capital’s chronic water and transport problems. She’s no stranger to the rough and tumble of Mexico City politics, having served as chief of the Tlalpan borough – which was hit hard in the September 2017 earthquake. Her win reflected the left’s dominance in the capital, where social policies have long been more progressive than the country at large.
Cuauhtémoc Blanco As a striker, Blanco outmaneuvered opponents with a move called the cuauhtemiña, in which he gripped the ball between his feet and hopped past defenders. Now, he has bamboozled the country’s political establishment by winning a whopping 50% of the vote in the Morelos state governor’s race. Commonly called “Cuauh”, Blanco hailed from the tough streets of Mexico City’s notoriously rough Tepito barrio and drew controversy and wild popularity for his bad-boy antics. In 2015 he switched to politics, winning the mayor’s race in Cuernavaca for the PES, a conservative, evangelical Christian political party that opposes same-sex marriage and abortion. Blanco didn’t show much enthusiasm for his political career at the start. But amid widespread disgust over political corruption – and rumours that local officials had stolen relief funds for victims of this year’s devastating earthquake – Blanco easily won the governship of the state of Morelos.
Nestora Salgado Salgado, a dual US-Mexico citizen, was living in Seattle, but in 2012 she returned to her hometown of Olinalá in the heroin-producing heartland of Guerrero state to lead an armed rebellion against drug traffickers and corrupt local authorities – only to be accused of kidnapping and imprisoned. The United Nations working group on arbitrary detention said her arrest was arbitrary, but Salgado spent three years in prison before the charges were eventually dismissed. She is likely to claim a senate seat for Morena. But she became controversial in the campaign after José Antonio Meade, the candidate for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party, PRI, called her a “kidnapper”– part of a strategy of trying to present Amlo as soft on crime. Salgado has threatened to sue Meade – who finished a distant third on Sunday – for defamation. Napoleón Gómez Urrutia The leader of a miners’ union who fled to Canada after being accused of misappropriating a $55m workers’ trust fund, Gómez now resides in the Vancouver area. He denies the allegations, which were never proven in court, and says he left Mexico due to political persecution for winning pay rises. In a country where union bosses are often passive and allied with employers, Gómez is known for leading long strikes, but families of 65 miners killed in a 2006 explosion in the Pasta de Conchos mine allege Gómez’s union did little for them: the union and government signed a joint safety report 12 days before the disaster. Gómez will probably take a seat in the senate. Gabriela Cuevas Cuevas, 39, made history in the early 2000s as the youngest-ever member of Mexico’s Congress for the rightwing Pan, and has an ambiguous history with Amlo. During his 2000-2005 term as mayor of Mexico City, she was notorious for following him around and attempting to goad him into intemperate outbursts. When Amlo was arrested in 2005 on allegations of violating a court order – in what he said was part of dirty tricks campaign to disqualify him from the 2006 election – she paid his bail, saying that pictures of him behind bars would allow him to become a martyr. But after spending her adult life in Pan politics, she jumped to Morena earlier this year – to keep her hopes of winning another elected position alive, critics contended. She will probably enter the lower house, where Morena and its allies won a majority.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/almo-win-mexico-president-election-coalition-partners-candidates,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/almo-win-mexico-president-election-coalition-partners-candidates
2018-07-02T21:58:02Z,world,World news,Mexico's president-elect and Donald Trump share 'respectful' phone call,"He has railed against what he called Donald Trump’s arrogant, racist and inhumane family separation policy. He has lambasted the “erratic” US president’s “hate campaign” against Latin American migrants.
But Mexico’s president-elect, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, struck a more diplomatic tone on Monday, promising to “reach an understanding” with his northern counterpart in a half-hour conversation. Just hours after his historic election victory sent thousands of supporters pouring on to the streets, the 64-year-old leftist tweeted that he had received a call from Trump. “I proposed that we explore an integral agreement of development projects, which generate jobs in Mexico and with that reduce migration and improve security. There was respectful treatment and our representatives will speak more.” In an interview with the Televisa news network, López Obrador emphasized the need for mutual respect and cooperation between the two neighbors. “We are conscious of the need to maintain good relations with the United States. We have a border of more than 3,000 kilometers, more than 12 million Mexicans live in the United States. It is our main economic-commercial partner,” he said. “We are not going to fight. We are always going to seek for there to be an agreement … We are going to extend our frank hand to seek a relation of friendship, I repeat, of cooperation with the United States.” Trump was equally tactful, telling reporters: “I think he’s going to try and help us with the border. “I think the relationship will be a very good one,” the US president said of the Mexican politician, whose swearing-in will be in December. “We talked about trade, we talked about Nafta, we talked about a separate deal, just Mexico and the United States.” Such restraint contrasted with Trump’s call to López Obrador’s predecessor, weeks after his own inauguration last year. During that call, Trump told Enrique Peña Nieto that the US military would take care of “bad hombres” south of the border. López Obrador, or Amlo as he is best known, romped to a historic landslide victory on Sunday night, capitalising on public frustration at soaring crime rates and corruption with a promise to drain Mexico’s very own swamp. Indeed, some see similarities between the two men. Like Trump, Amlo cast himself as a political outsider during his campaign, despite having been a professional politician for decades, although Amlo avoided much of the New York billionaire’s nastiness and nativism. Both men are considered inward-looking nationalists with López Obrador claiming “the best foreign policy is domestic policy” and preaching “mexicanismo”, a philosophy some have compared to Trump’s America First. But the US president was not an election issue in the recent Mexican campaign. “Trump is so despised that he is simply not an issue. He is equally opposed by every one of the candidates,” the former Mexican diplomat Jorge Guajardo wrote in the Atlantic last week. Amlo was, on occasion, moved to publicly criticize Trump’s actions. He warned Mexico would not be “the piñata of any foreign government” and hit back at Trump’s claim that Mexico wasn’t doing enough to stop a caravan of Central American migrants . “[We] won’t do the dirty work of any foreign government,” he said. Some observers said they would not be surprised if Amlo and Trump could find some understanding. “They’ll understand each other perfectly. They won’t agree – that’s a different thing,” said Federico Estévez, a political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. “At heart, these guys believe the same things, though they will disagree radically because one is on the left and one is on the right.”
Eric Olson, a Mexico and Latin America specialist from Washington’s Wilson Centre, also predicted the two leaders would find ways “to work together and to find common ground”. In recent years Mexico and the United States have cooperated closely on security matters, especially with regards to Mexico’s “war on drugs”. “The relationship with the United States – which is vitally important to both sides – may be tense and may take on different moments [under Amlo]. But it’s impossible for the US to walk away from Mexico or for Mexico to walk away from the US,” Olson said. “They are joined at the hip and need to work together even if their presidents don’t like each other and don’t get along. So I think there are some shades of grey here that will merge over time.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/mexico-president-elect-trump-phone-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-amlo,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/mexico-president-elect-trump-phone-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-amlo
2018-07-02T21:52:45Z,world,World news,Mike Pompeo to visit North Korea this week for nuclear talks,"Mike Pompeo will travel to North Korea on Thursday in an effort to press the Pyongyang regime on commitments the US said it gave at a summit last month in Singapore, the state department has confirmed. In preparation for the two-day trip, US and North Korean officials are reported to have met in the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas over the weekend, amid reports that Pyongyang is stepping up its nuclear and missile programmes since last month’s Singapore summit. Andrew Kim, the head of the CIA’s Korea department and Sung Kim, a veteran negotiator who is now US ambassador to the Philippines, met North Korean counterparts at Panmunjom in the DMZ, according to South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo newspaper.
The state department said on Monday that Pompeo would fly to Pyongyang on Thursday and stay until Saturday, to “continue consultations and implement the forward progress made by President Trump and Chairman Kim in Singapore”. Pompeo will then travel to Tokyo, where he will meet the Japanese and South Korean leaders “to discuss our shared commitment to the final, fully verified denuclearization of the DPRK, as well as other bilateral and regional issues”, the state department said. After the Singapore summit, Trump tweeted that: “There is no longer a nuclear threat” from North Korea, but in recent days, multiple leaks from the US intelligence assessment have suggested that the regime’s work on its nuclear and missile programme is not just continuing, but accelerating. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that North Korea had expanded a factory for manufacturing solid fuel ballistic missiles in Hamhung, based on satellite imagery analysed by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies (MIIS) at Monterey, California.
The Diplomat cited intelligence officials as saying Pyongyang was also continuing work on mobile launchers for one its latest generation of ballistic missiles. This follows a report by NBC News, also quoting multiple intelligence officials, which said work had been stepped up at secret uranium enrichment sites. North Korea has acknowledged running one enrichment plant at its nuclear complex at Yongbyon. However, in 2010 US intelligence found a site at a place called Kangson which it believes to be a covert parallel site. A third site is said to have been discovered more recently. Officials from the Defence Intelligence Agency were quoted by CNN as saying they believe Kim has no intention of disarming, at least for the time being, and would seek to hide much of its programme.
Pompeo is expected to present the Pyongyang leadership with a demand for a full inventory of its nuclear and missile programmes and then a timetable for dismantling them. Speaking to CBS News on Sunday, the national security adviser, John Bolton, said the US had a plan for full disarmament within a year. “I’m sure that secretary of state Mike Pompeo will be discussing this with the North Koreans in the near future about really how to dismantle all of their WMD and ballistic missile programs in a year,” Bolton told the programme Face the Nation. Most observers are sceptical that pace of disarmament is feasible even if Kim was willing to disarm, which they doubt. “It is unhelpful when Trump administration officials set arbitrary timelines for the denuclearisation process, which is going to be a long-term process that is going to require reciprocal US actions,” Kelsey Davenport, the director for non-proliferation policy at the Arms Control Association in Washington, said. “The speed at which North Korea is willing to take steps is dependent on what the US puts on the table in return.”
“Kim has not said he would disarm at any point in this process,” said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation programme at MIIS. In Singapore, Kim signed a joint statement with Trump committed to “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, but that has been the North Korean position since 1992 and does not necessarily mean the regime is ready to disarm. “What it means to them is a formal process in which the US give up its nuclear weapons and then North Korea goes along,” Lewis said. “What we want is disarmament but we started using their phrase in the misguided belief it would cause them to get confused and give up their weapons by mistake.” Jim Walsh, an expert on the North Korean nuclear programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that North Korea’s total disarmament is the wrong benchmark to judge the success of diplomatic engagement. “Hey, I’d love to have denuclearisation. But it’s the wrong frame,” Walsh said. “The issue is whether we are safer or more insecure. Is a conflict that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons more likely or less likely?”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/us-north-korean-officials-meeting,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/us-north-korean-officials-meeting
2018-07-02T20:00:18Z,world,World news,China's aid to Papua New Guinea threatens Australia's influence,"China’s aid spending in Papua New Guinea – with its focus on infrastructure and “few-strings-attached” concessional loans – risks eroding Australia’s influence in the country, with Australian aid sometimes viewed as paternalistic and unwieldy. A Deakin University submission to a parliamentary inquiry, based on interviews with Papua New Guinean business, political, academic and community leaders argues Australia risks being diminished by rising Chinese spending. PNG is Australia’s closest neighbour, and for reasons of proximity and a shared history – PNG was under Australian administration until 1975 – Australia has been its most significant international partner. But China has recently dramatically increased its aid spending in PNG, with a particular focus on signature pieces of infrastructure and concessional loans.
According to the Deakin University submission, “those interviewed noted the differences of the structure, transparency and detail of Australian aid planning to that of the more opaque Chinese aid. For one interviewee, this made ‘Chinese aid more effective. Chinese aid is unconditional, no strings attached ... the government can use this aid more flexibly’.” There was a view from some respondents that Australian aid – highly accountable, and focused on the human sectors, such as education, health and gender – was sometimes seen as paternalistic. “It was also noted that ‘Australia’s influence has diminished considerably as a result of the rise in Chinese aid flows to PNG,” the submission says. One of the authors of the submission, Prof Matthew Clarke, told the Guardian China’s aid to PNG was recognised there as a vehicle for increasing Beijing’s influence in the country, its trading sphere and leverage in the region. “When it talks to PNG, China talks about a ‘south-to-south’ relationship,” Clarke said. “It sees itself as being a developing economy, as much more of an equal partner, which is well-received in PNG. “And the type of aid China is offering also lends itself to the Melanesian context, the ‘big man’ political culture, where leaders can point to a piece of infrastructure and say, ‘look what I’ve delivered, look what I’ve brought’.”
Clarke said the PNG government was pragmatic about aid, and willing to play one donor off against another in order to achieve a desired outcome. “There are probably two broad lessons: that this is not an issue that just involves Australians and China – that the voices and views of Papua New Guineans must be considered. If we fail to listen, we won’t have a good outcome,” he said. “And that Australia needs to be smarter with its aid. For Papua New Guinean leaders, it is easier to critique the Australian aid program because another is there to compete and take its place.” The parliament’s joint standing committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade is undertaking an inquiry into the effectiveness of Australia’s aid in the Indo-Pacific region and “its role in supporting our regional interests”. Australia is the largest aid donor in the Pacific, with 90% of its $3.9bn aid budget directed towards partners in the Indo-Pacific. But China’s growing interest has been followed by reports of plans to build military bases in countries such as Vanuatu, and its assertiveness in militarising atolls in the South China Sea is seen as a template for increased military influence. Australia remains the dominant aid partner. The Lowy Institute estimates that between 2006 and 2016, Australia has dedicated $7.7bn in aid to the region, dwarfing China’s $1.7b. However, there are concerns over China’s rising interest.
The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said small states in the region could be harmed by unsustainable debt through aid “loans”, with debt-for-equity swaps imperilling their sovereignty. “We’re concerned that the consequences of entering into some of these financing arrangements will be detrimental to their long-term sovereignty,” she said. Australia also remains the largest donor to PNG, but Australia’s aid to PNG performs badly in terms of its efficacy and accountability. “That,” argues Jonathan Pryke, director of the Lowy Institute’s Pacific Islands program, “is a reflection of how difficult an environment to operate in PNG is, and how important engagement is.” Pryke said it was risk for Australia to view China’s rising presence in PNG solely as a threat. “We should not look to be rivalling with China,” he said. “Looking at our aid program through the lens of a cold war mentality – that could actually result in aid being less effective. There is a real risk in trying to outcompete China. The reality is they have deeper pockets.” But there are growing concerns over how aid is delivered. China’s approach to aid – by engaging directly with the political elites – is already undermining the weak institutions that countries like Australia seek to work through, Pryke said. “The way countries like China go straight to the ministerial level – they come in with few strings attached and do whatever the minister wants – that really undermines the strategic planning of government agencies,” he said.
Pryke said Australia needed to bring a collaborative approach to aid in PNG and across the Pacific. “I think the line Julie Bishop had was about right: recognising that other countries will be in the region, but that Australia wants to be the ‘partner of choice’,” he said. Pryke said the parliament’s review of aid was welcome. After years of disruption, the subsuming of AusAID into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the loss of development professionals inside the public service, and massive budget cuts, a re-evaluation of Australia’s aid priorities and direction was needed, he said. From 2012 to 2021, the aid budget fell by 32% while all other government spending increased by 31%. Australia’s aid budget, as a proportion of national income, is the lowest it has ever been. And Pryke said Australia’s aid program was not well understood by the public. A Lowy Institute poll this year found Australians believed the government spent about 14% of the federal budget on aid funding, and should reduce that figure to 10%. Australia actually spends 0.8% of its budget on aid. “We think of ourselves as a generous country, and that our aid program will reflect that,” Pryke said. “But we don’t concern ourselves with the details; we trust the government to do what’s right. But the government is not doing what is right.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/chinas-aid-to-papua-new-guinea-threatens-australias-influence,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/chinas-aid-to-papua-new-guinea-threatens-australias-influence
2018-07-02T18:36:09Z,world,World news,Harvey Weinstein faces three new sexual misconduct charges,"The disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was charged with additional crimes on Monday in New York, related to alleged sexual misconduct.
Weinstein, 66, was arrested in New York and first appeared in court in May in connection with accusations of rape from two women. At a further court appearance in June, Weinstein pleaded not guilty. On Monday, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr, charged the former head of the Weinstein Company film empire with an additional count of criminal sexual act in the first degree, for an alleged forcible sexual act against a third woman in 2006, as well as two counts of predatory sexual assault. Predatory sexual assault carries a minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. A statement from Vance’s office said the new charges were on top of those contained in the previous indictment of charges of rape in the first and third degrees, as well as criminal sexual act in the first degree, for alleged forcible sexual acts against two women in 2013 and 2004. “A Manhattan grand jury has now indicted Harvey Weinstein on some of the most serious sexual offenses that exist under New York’s penal law,” said Vance. “This indictment is the result of the extraordinary courage exhibited by the survivors who have come forward. Our investigation continues.” In a statement, Weinstein’s attorney, Benjamin Brafman, said: “Mr Weinstein will enter a plea of not guilty to the new charges. Mr Weinstein maintains that all of these allegations are false and he expects to be fully vindicated.” Weinstein has been free on $1m bail since the June hearing. He had been scheduled to appear in court again on 20 September. He will now be arraigned in court next Monday, 9 July. In June, Weinstein was fitted with an electronic monitoring device. At the last hearing he surrendered his passport and agreed not to travel beyond New York and Connecticut. A prosecutor told the judge the investigation was ongoing, and that authorities had encouraged other alleged survivors to come forward. “The defendant used his position, money and power to lure young women into situations where he was able to violate them sexually,” she said. In addition to Weinstein’s plea of not guilty, Brafman spoke outside court. He called the charges “constitutionally flawed” and “not factually supported”. The charges about his alleged behaviour erupted last October. Weinstein was publicly accused of rape, sexual assault and years of harassment and intimidation by a large group of women. Some of the world’s most famous film stars and actors alleged he damaged their careers after they spurned his advances. Workers at his companies said they had been repeatedly harassed. The allegations coincided with and fuelled #MeToo activism and the Time’s Up grassroots movement which aim to expose and confront such abuse of power across a wide variety of industries. The first reports about Weinstein earned the Pulitzer prize for the New York Times and the New Yorker. Weinstein has been the subject of simultaneous police investigations in New York, London and Los Angeles, with the various authorities having pledged to share information. He has so far only been charged in New York. If Weinstein’s is the signature case of the #MeToo era, the comedian Bill Cosby’s conviction in April for sexual assault was the first banner verdict in court. Experts are weighing whether alleged Weinstein victims other than those who have generated charges could be called as witnesses in any trial. Cosby was convicted of sexual assault in April. Many more of his victims testified at his retrial than at his first trial in 2017, which ended in a mistrial. Cosby is due to be sentenced on 24 September.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/02/harvey-weinstein-three-new-charges-predatory-sexual-assault,https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jul/02/harvey-weinstein-three-new-charges-predatory-sexual-assault
2018-07-02T18:22:30Z,world,World news,Four Libya oil ports closed amid corruption allegations,"Libya’s United Nations-backed National Oil Corporation (NOC) has closed four oil ports held by the military chief Khalifa Haftar, collapsing the country’s hydrocarbons production. The NOC has also written to the UN sanctions committee and foreign embassies with evidence that it says shows Haftar’s allies have for years been offering questionable contracts in breach of UN resolutions, that would lead to millions in dollars of oil revenues being siphoned out of the Libyan economy.
In the letter, the NOC chairman Mustafa Sanallah has called on the international community to back sanctions against 46 named individuals and entities, including the chairman of a rival oil corporation that is seeking to run the four ports. Fighting last month resulted in the deaths of 300 people when the four ports were attacked by a local militia and then recaptured by Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA), which controls most of east Libya. But the LNA provoked outrage when it announced that oil exports would no longer be under the control of the Tripoli-based NOC, and instead would be handed to a rival corporation based in Benghazi. The LNA, and its political allies in the east of Libya, accuse Tripoli’s Central Bank governors of failing to stop some oil revenues funding militias.
In response, Sanallah has described Haftar’s action as a “blockade” and has suspended the loading of contracts for the ports. He said in a statement “the storage tanks are full and production will now go offline”. Production is now down by more than 800,000 barrels a day, cutting more than two thirds of Libyan production with losses of £54m a day. Western states back Sanallah and the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord, and diplomats are worried that dividing the oil sector between rival governments risks creating further chaos in the country. The NOC said it was releasing the documents to show the incompetence and unlawful activities of its rival: “Collectively, these contracts imply a loss to the Libyan state of over $800 million at the very least.” A joint statement from Britain, France, Italy and the United States last week said the ports must be returned to Tripoli control: “These vital Libyan resources must remain under the exclusive control of the legitimate National Oil Corporation and the sole oversight of the Government of National Accord.” In his letter, Sanallah called for sanctions against the 48 individuals and entities. He said: “Inaction by the international community against these efforts would by itself constitute a victory for ‘NOC Benghazi’, with grave consequences for peace and security in Libya. In particular, I am concerned that these efforts may accelerate ahead of the elections planned for December, and that they may create conditions that interfere with the acceptance by certain segments of the Libyan population of elections results.” Some of Haftar’s allies believe he is determined to use his leverage to win control of the Central Bank. France, which has previously been seen as sympathetic to Haftar, is said to be furious with him, warning him he faces a political backlash if he continues on the current course. But Haftar’s two biggest external allies – Egypt and the United Arab Emirates – have not turned against him, and a key test is whether the UAE buys Libyan oil outside of the NOC structures.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/four-libya-oil-ports-closed-amid-corruption-allegations-allies-khalifa-haftar,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/four-libya-oil-ports-closed-amid-corruption-allegations-allies-khalifa-haftar
2018-07-02T17:07:51Z,world,World news,MPs press for new inquiry into UK role in rendition and torture,"The UK government will give “careful consideration” to calls for a renewed judge-led inquiry into the country’s involvement in human rights abuses after 9/11, the Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan told MPs on Monday. He made the pledge after two reports published by parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC) laid bare the extent of British involvement in rendition and the torture of detainees. The ISC found that the UK had planned, agreed or financed 31 rendition operations.
In addition there were 15 occasions when British intelligence officers consented to or witnessed torture, and 232 occasions on which the intelligence agencies supplied questions to be put to detainees who they knew or suspected were being mistreated. The former home secretary Ken Clarke led calls for the establishment of a judicial inquiry, saying the ISC had been prevented from completing its work by taking evidence from intelligence officers “who had been on the ground at the time” of the abuses. “Why was that done? What are we trying to cover up of what was done in the time of the Blair government?” The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, backed this call. She said: “As detailed as this report is, it still doesn’t give us the full truth and we will not have the full truth until we have a full, independent judicial inquiry.” An inquiry was needed, she added, “to ensure that never again is the UK involved in these illegal and barbaric acts”. Andrew Mitchell, the former international development secretary, said the abuses detailed by the ISC had “done considerable damage to Britain’s international reputation as a firm upholder of international law and human rights”. Duncan said it was right that as much information as possible about what had happened was put into the public domain. “We must ensure that we learn from past mistakes so they are never repeated.” He said the government would give its decision on a judicial inquiry within 60 days. The ISC investigation was launched after David Cameron, as prime minister, halted an inquiry headed by Sir Peter Gibson, a former appeal court judge. Cameron said that Gibson could not continue after police began investigating the role that MI6 played in the kidnap and rendition of a Libyan couple, Abdel Hakim Belhaj and Fatima Boudchar, in 2004. The Gibson inquiry had been established after a series of disclosures in the Guardian and the courts about the UK’s involvement in human rights abuses. At the end of the police investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service decided against bringing criminal charges. In May, Theresa May issued a public apology to Belhaj and Boudchar.
Only on publication of the ISC’s reports was the extent of the UK’s involvement in human rights abuses exposed. In addition to the 31 rendition operations that were planned, agreed or financed by British intelligence, there were 22 operations in which MI6 or MI5 provided the intelligence that enabled operations, and 23 in which they failed to take action to prevent a rendition, including operations in which the victim was a British national or resident. In addition to the 232 cases in which the intelligence agencies supplied questions to be put to detainees who were being mistreated, there were 198 cases in which they received information from detainees being mistreated, and 128 cases in which overseas intelligence agencies told them they were mistreating detainees.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/mps-press-judicial-inquiry-post-911-human-rights-abuses,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/mps-press-judicial-inquiry-post-911-human-rights-abuses
2018-07-02T17:05:23Z,world,World news,Decision to ban protests at London abortion clinic upheld,"A council’s decision to ban anti-abortion protesters from gathering outside a London clinic has been upheld in the high court. Campaigners lost a legal challenge to a move by Ealing council to create a 100-metre, protest-free “buffer zone” around the Marie Stopes clinic. The council was the first in the country to take such a decision in an attempt to shield women from demonstrators. Mr Justice Turner found the ban interfered with the activists’ human rights, but said the council was entitled to conclude it was a “necessary step in a democratic society”. “There was substantial evidence that a very considerable number of users of the clinic reasonably felt that their privacy was being very seriously invaded at a time and place when they were most vulnerable and sensitive to uninvited attention,” he said. “It also follows that, in this regard, I am also satisfied that the defendant [council] was entitled to conclude that the effect of the activities of the protesters was likely to make such activities unreasonable, and justified the restrictions imposed.” Ealing council’s leader, Julian Bell, said the local authority was delighted by the decision. “This sends a clear message ... The harassment and intimidation of local residents and those accessing legally available medical services was totally unacceptable,” he said. “Since the safe zone was implemented in April, we have seen a dramatic reduction in antisocial behaviour, confirming to us that we were right to take this action in the interest of those people living in the locality of Mattock Lane, and for those who visit the area.” Lawyers for Alina Dulgheriu of the Be Here For Me campaign argued the local authority did not have the power to make the public spaces protection order (PSPO), which came into force in April after reports of “intimidation, harassment and distress” of women using the facility in Mattock Lane. Dulgheriu, 34, told how she was offered financial, practical and moral help, as well as accommodation, and now had a six-year-old daughter. She said she was saddened and shocked by the judge’s decision, and was investigating options to appeal against the ruling. “I am devastated for those women that since the introduction of the Ealing PSPO have not been able to access the loving help that I did. I feel desperately sorry for the vigil members who since the move to create this PSPO have been consistently subject to abuse on the street and slander online,” Dulgheriu said. John Hansen-Brevetti, the clinical operations manager at the Ealing centre, said women had been told the ghost of their foetus would haunt them, heard chants of “Mummy, Mummy, don’t kill me” from protesters, and had holy water thrown at them and rosary beads thrust at them. Kuljit Bhogal, the counsel for Ealing council, said it had to balance the group’s rights with those of the service’s users, clinic staff and others in the area upon whom the protesters’ activities were having a detrimental effect. “In what has been a delicate balancing exercise, the council has facilitated the activities of the pro-life and pro-choice groups by providing a designated zone where they can continue their activities,” he said. The Guardian has reported that eight councils in England were considering setting up abortion clinic buffer zones after pro-choice groups said the number of intimidating protests was on the rise.
Across the country, 42 vigils and protests have taken place between 2017 and 2018, according to figures compiled by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service. They were led by anti-abortion groups such as the Good Counsel Network and 40 Days for Life. Rachael Clarke, a public affairs and advocacy manager at BPAS, said the spread of such tactics was “deeply worrying”. “In recent years, protests have become more regular, wider spread and more intimidating. What used to be a couple of nuns on the street is now groups of people approaching women and trying to talk to them about their personal medical decisions,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/decision-ban-protests-london-abortion-clinic-upheld-high-court-ealing,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/decision-ban-protests-london-abortion-clinic-upheld-high-court-ealing
2018-07-02T17:03:54Z,world,World news,Who is the Iranian group targeted by bombers and beloved of Trump allies?,"The Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MeK), the extreme Iranian opposition group who was the target of a foiled bombing attack in France, was once a sworn enemy of the United States. The cult-like Iranian group was responsible for the killing of six Americans in Iran in the 1970s; in 1979 it enthusiastically cheered the seizure of the US embassy in Tehran, when angry students held 52 American diplomats hostage for a period of 444 days. Its opposition to Tehran’s current rulers, however, has earned the group powerful allies in the west, particularly among Americans bent on regime change. Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, addressed an MeK rally in Paris on Saturday, calling for regime change in Tehran. On Monday, Belgian authorities said four people, including a diplomat at the Iranian embassy in the Austrian capital Vienna, have been arrested after being accused of preparing a bomb attack in France targeted at the MeK rally. Many in the crowd of about 4,000 that Giuliani was addressing were eastern Europeans bussed in to attend the event in return for a weekend trip to Paris. He is among a series of high-profile US politicians, including John McCain and John Bolton, who have met the MeK’s leader Maryam Rajavi or spoken at its rallies. It was only in 2012 that the US delisted it as a terrorist group. But the arrival of John Bolton, the MeK’s most powerful advocate, as US national security adviser has given the group unprecedented proximity to the White House and a new lease of political life.
“There is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs, and that opposition is centred in this room today,” Bolton said at an MeK rally in Paris last year. “The behaviour and objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself.” Bolton’s ascent to the White House has reinvigorated the group, analysts say, raising questions about the dangers of having in the earshot of the US president a group that some experts say uses human rights concerns to bury its murky past and portray itself as a democratic and popular alternative to the Islamic Republic.
Believed to have between 5,000 to 13,000 members, the MeK was established in the 1960s to express a mixture of Marxism and Islamism. It launched bombing campaigns against the Shah, continuing after the 1979 Islamic revolution, against the Islamic Republic. In 1981, in a series of attacks, it killed 74 senior officials, including 27 MPs. Later that year, its bombings killed Iran’s president and prime minister. During the eight-year Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, the MeK, by then sheltered in camps in Iraq, fought against Iran alongside the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. The US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 was a turning point for the group, which sought to reinvent itself as a democratic force. Today, it functions as a fringe exiled group with characteristics of a cult that works for regime change in Iran, though it has little visible support inside the country. It portrays itself as a democratic political institution although its own internal structure is anything but. Eli Clifton, a fellow at the Nation Institute, said the MeK’s influence in the US is multilayered. “When [MeK] members go and swarm Capitol Hill and seek meetings with the members of Congress,” Clifton said, “they’re very often the only voices that are heard, because there is simply not a lot of Iranian-American presence on Capitol Hill.” Clifton said the MeK, which operates under a set of front groups, writes very large cheques to those speaking at their events. Estimates are in the range of $30,000 to $50,000 per speech. Bolton is estimated to have received upwards of $180,000 to speak at multiple events for MeK. His recent financial disclosure shows that he was paid $40,000 for one speech at an MeK event last year. Jason Rezaian, the Iranian-American Washington Post journalist who was jailed in Tehran for more than a year, wrote in March that in the seven years he lived in the country, he saw a great deal of criticism towards the ayatollahs but “never met a person who thought the MeK should, or could, present a viable alternative”. Clifton said the MeK “shares many qualities of a cult”. That description was echoed by Iraj Mesdaghi, a Sweden-based Iranian activist who was jailed in Iran from 1981 to 1991 for his links to the MeK. Mesdaghi left Iran in 1994 and worked for the MeK in its headquarters in Auvers-sur-Oise, France, until 2001. “In the MeK, everything has to morph into leadership, and leadership means Masoud Rajavi [Maryam Rajavi’s husband, missing since 2003]. Not only your heart belongs to him, any love belongs to him, it’s forbidden to have love for spouse, mother, children,” he said. He compared working for the MeK to holding an electric wire. “You have to follow the path, you have to transfer what you’re given, you’re not meant to add or reduce anything, you can’t pose any ifs.” A 2007 state department report included claims that MeK has forced members to divorce. Human Rights Watch, in a 28-page report, has shed light on the MeK’s mistreatment of its members, including claims that those wishing to leave the group have been subjected to “lengthy solitary confinements, severe beatings, and torture”.
Iran, which considers the group as a terrorist organisation, also has a history of mistreating MeK supporters. In the summer of 1988, thousands of leftists and MeK supporters were executed in a massacre of political prisoners. Mesdaghi said MeK members kept in a massive military-style complex in Albania are particularly vulnerable because they are not given refugee status and depend on the group’s leadership for survival. From March 2013 to September 2016, about 3,000 MeK members are believed to have been sheltered in Albania, after being transferred from Iraq. Masoud Khodabandeh, a former senior MeK official, has written that MeK members in Albania are “effectively being held in a state of modern slavery”. In a recent interview, he described the group as a “destructive cult” which controls its members financially, physically and emotionally. The MeK did not respond to email queries seeking comments.
Djavad Khadem, a co-founder of Unity for Democracy in Iran (UDI), an umbrella group of exiled Iranian opposition groups, said MeK’s “collaboration with Saddam against Iranian people will never be wiped out from the memory of Iranian people”. Khadem said Bolton’s appointment by Trump may have looked liked a coup for the MeK, but argued that Bolton was bound to act more responsibly in administration. “But Bolton will use them as an instrument of pressure on the regime,” he said. “This is bad tactics, because the Islamic regime will use it to frighten the middle class in Iran, as they have done for the last 40 years.” Clifton said the MeK’s claims of intelligence revelations about Iran are often “hit and miss”, with “some monumental screw-ups”. The group, however, has revealed intelligence relating to Iran’s nuclear programme, which Clifton said was likely to have been passed on by Israel or Saudi Arabia. In 2016, Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former head of the Saudi intelligence agency, was one of several VIPs who attended a MeK conference near Paris.
The MeK, Clifton said, presents a narrative that it is a vibrant, secular, democratic government-in-waiting that has popular support within Iran. “That’s built on so many falsehoods,” he said. “It’s scary if policymakers listen to that and believe that fairytale.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/iran-mek-cult-terrorist-trump-allies-john-bolton-rudy-giuliani,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/iran-mek-cult-terrorist-trump-allies-john-bolton-rudy-giuliani

Others have painted him as a Donald Trump-style Latin American populist with a big ego and a distinctly dictatorial bent. Even some supporters admit they fret about Amlo’s authoritarian tendencies and whether he is truly a man of the left. But most analysts believe Amlo has more in common with Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a pragmatic one-time union firebrand who led his country from 2002 until 2011. Like Amlo, Lula spent years trying to become president before succeeding at his fourth attempt. He plans to rethink Mexico’s war on drugs During his victory speech on Sunday night Amlo shed some light on how he plans to tackle perhaps the most urgent problem facing Mexico: the growing drug-related violence that this year has claimed an average of 88 lives per day. Amlo vowed to change the “failed strategy” his predecessors have used to tackle insecurity – a heavily militarized 11-year “war on drugs” which has claimed 200,000 lives.
“More than the use of force, we will deal with the causes from which insecurity and violence originate,” Amlo said. “I am convinced that the most effective and humane way of fighting these ills involves combating inequality and poverty. Peace and tranquility are fruits of the justice.” He’s a writer as well as a politician Amlo isn’t just Mexico’s new president – he’s also a bookworm and author with no fewer than 14 titles to his name. His tomes include Don’t Say Goodbye to Hope, The Mafia That Took Possession of Mexico and The Mafia That Robbed Us of the Presidency about his first failed presidential bid, in 2006. One of Amlo’s latest works examines what he calls Trump’s “hate campaign” against migrants and Mexico and is called Oye, Trump! (‘Listen up, Trump!’). “[We must] make [the US] see that … the most important thing is to build, here on earth, a kingdom of justice and universal fraternity where we can live without walls, poverty, fear, discrimination and racism,” Amlo writes. The book was recently published in English with the title: A New Hope for Mexico: Saying No to Corruption, Violence, and Trump’s Wall. He’s amigos with Jeremy Corbyn
Amlo’s friends include an influential British leftist: the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, with whom he reportedly spent part of his 2016 Christmas holiday. “Today brings a new beginning for México,” Corbyn tweeted after Amlo’s landslide win. “[His victory] offers the poor and marginalised a genuine voice for the first time in Mexico’s modern history. I’m sure #AMLO will be a president for all Mexicans.” The pair are said to have met through Corbyn’s Mexican wife, Laura Álvarez, a former human rights layer who now runs a fair-trade coffee business in the UK. Corbyn, who has longstanding ties to Latin America, has spoken out against human rights abuses in Mexico and last week denounced the killing of more than 130 Mexican politicians during the election campaign. Amlo reportedly once gifted Corbyn a selection of jipi hats. “Jeremy loved them,” one member of Amlo’s campaign told the Times. He began his political career living in a shack Amlo’s political awakening is said to have come during the late 1970s when he worked as a representative of Mexico’s National Indigenous Institute in his native state of Tabasco. “He went to live in a shack just like the ones the indigenous families lived in,” José Agustín Ortiz Pinchetti recalls in a flattering new biography of his friend. During the six years he spent living with the Chontal Maya people, Amlo and his family slept in hammocks and endured “African temperatures of over 40C” with nothing but a single fan to keep them cool. “López Obrador took on that role as if it was his destiny, with a missionary’s spirit,” Pinchetti writes.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/amlo-mexico-president-five-things,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/amlo-mexico-president-five-things
2018-07-02T12:46:43Z,world,World news,Poland's supreme court constitutional crisis approaches a standoff,"The president of Poland’s supreme court fears she may be prevented from entering her place of work later this week, she told the Guardian, as a long-running standoff between the Polish government and the country’s judiciary threatens to reach a dramatic climax. Earlier this year, the Polish parliament introduced a mandatory retirement age of 65 for supreme court judges, which would result in the instant dismissal of 27 of the 74 judges currently serving in the court. Because the new law envisages expanding the court to 120 judges, this would give the government the power to appoint almost two-thirds of supreme court judges from scratch. The retirements are due to come into effect on Tuesday, but last week a general assembly of supreme court judges issued resolutions stating that the dismissals contravened constitutional guarantees of judicial independence and explicit provisions in the constitution guaranteeing the term of office of Małgorzata Gersdorf, the supreme court president. The resolutions stated that Gersdorf and all of the supreme court judges threatened with forcible retirement would continue to serve out their terms as normal. Supreme court judges are expected to gather together before entering their court building on Wednesday morning, in a show of solidarity and defiance. It is unclear how the Polish government will react, but speculation is growing that the judges could be blocked from entering the building. A group of associations of Polish lawyers has called for protests in support of the judges in front of the supreme court on Tuesday and Wednesday. “I will go to my office on Wednesday, but whether I will be let in is another matter,” said Gersdorf, whose constitutionally mandated six-year term is due to expire in April 2020. “It doesn’t happen in well-developed countries that the executive and the legislative branches destroy the judiciary. With no guarantees of basic freedoms, the fundamental rights of Polish citizens will be destroyed sooner or later.” The uncertainty surrounding the future of the court deepened further this week, as the European commission announced on Monday its intention to take the Polish government to the European court of justice over the legislation, on the grounds that “these measures undermine the principle of judicial independence, including the irremovability of judges, and thereby Poland fails to fulfil its obligations under article 19(1) of the treaty on European Union read in connection with article 47 of the charter of fundamental rights of the European Union”. The Polish government has been given one month to respond to the announcement, after which it could be ordered to desist from implementation until the ECJ has issued its ruling. “Even if the commission cannot block the removal of the present judges, it could block the appointment of their successors, so 3 July is not the end of the story,” said Marcin Matczak, a law professor at the university of Warsaw. “But in the meantime, the judges need to take a stand, to send a message to Polish society that to remove them in this way would be a constitutional crime.”
The government has accused the judges of involving themselves in politics, arguing that they should respect the will of the Polish parliament. “Just like every Pole, president Małgorzata Gersdorf is bound by the law, which she should follow,” said a spokesperson for the Polish justice ministry. Gersdorf also acknowledged the possibility that the government would attempt to appoint an “interim” president of the court in her place, raising the prospect of two rival supreme court presidents, with one claiming to derive their legitimacy from legislation passed by the Polish parliament, and the other deriving legitimacy from the Polish constitution. “From a constitutional point of view, there is only one supreme court president,” said Gersdorf. “But the authorities will only respect their interim president, not me – I will be the supreme court’s president-in-exile.” The government has argued that precedents for the curtailment of a supreme court president’s term already exist, citing the example of a supreme court president who died in 2014, four years into his six-year term. “The government doesn’t seem to understand that there is a difference between a judge choosing to retire – or dying – and being forced out of his position by the executive,” said Matczak. “Political pressure is unconstitutional – death is not.” Combined with legislation giving Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) control of the body that appoints Polish judges, the dismissals would give the government effective control of the supreme court. In addition to serving as the country’s highest court of appeal in all civil and criminal cases, the court is also responsible for verifying the validity of elections. The government is also set to introduce a new “disciplinary chamber” for Polish judges, “and a chamber of extraordinary control and public affairs”, which will give the government the power to reopen almost any case from the past 20 years and have it heard again by judges appointed by the ruling party.Last week, the Polish senate began hearings for the appointment of “lay members” of the supreme court, members of the public chosen by politicians to sit on the supreme court alongside professional judges, a new system introduced by Polish president Andrzej Duda as “a remedy that allows the natural legal order to be restored in accordance with the principle of social justice”. Any confrontation between the government and supreme court judges could yet be postponed, however, as the national council of the judiciary, the body that appoints Polish judges, is yet to appoint any successors to the judges the government wants to force into retirement.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/polands-supreme-court-constitutional-crisis-comes-to-a-head,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/polands-supreme-court-constitutional-crisis-comes-to-a-head
2018-07-02T12:23:19Z,world,World news,Justin Trudeau 'does not remember' groping reporter at festival,"Justin Trudeau has publicly addressed allegations that he groped a reporter at an event 18 years ago, saying he does not recall any “negative interactions” taking place that day. The allegation has dominated political discussion in Canada in recent days after it was highlighted by a blogger last month. At the time, Trudeau was a 28-year-old teacher and had been attending a music festival sponsored by a beer company in British Columbia. The festival was raising money to support avalanche safety, a cause Trudeau had become involved with after his brother Michel died in an avalanche in 1998.
Days after the event, an unsigned editorial appeared in the Creston Valley Advance, a local newspaper, accusing Trudeau of “groping” and “inappropriately handling” an unnamed female reporter who was covering the event. While the editorial offered no specifics on what had happened, it claimed the woman felt “blatantly disrespected” and Trudeau had apologised for his behaviour. “I’m sorry,” the editorial alleged Trudeau to have said. “If I had known you were reporting for a national paper, I never would have been so forward.” On Sunday, Trudeau was asked about the allegations for the first time since becoming Canadian prime minister. “I remember that day in Creston well,” he told reporters. “I had a good day that day. I don’t remember any negative interactions that day at all.” The reporter behind the allegations has not responded to interview requests from the Guardian. The then publisher of the newspaper told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) she remembered the reporter being “distressed” after her interaction with Trudeau. “My recollections of the conversation were that she came to me because she was unsettled by it,” said Valerie Bourne. Bourne believed the reporter was talking to Trudeau when he touched her. “It was a brief touch,” she said. “I would not classify it or qualify it as sexual assault.” The editorial was likely written by the reporter, Bourne suggested. “She didn’t like what had happened. She wasn’t sure how she should proceed with it, because of course we’re talking [about] somebody who was known to the Canadian community,” she said. The paper’s then editor, Brian Bell, said he believed the reporter’s account. “I don’t recall that the reporter was coming across as having been traumatised or distraught about it, but definitely that whatever physical touch or whatever had occurred in that moment was definitely not welcome and definitely inappropriate,” he told the CBC. “I certainly believe that it happened; this reporter was of a high character in my opinion and was professional in the way she conducted herself, and there’s no question in my mind that what was alluded to, written about in that editorial, did happen.” Trudeau’s comments on Sunday echoed a statement his office made last month that he “doesn’t think he had any negative interactions” at the music festival.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/justin-trudeau-denies-groping-reporter-music-festival-2000-british-columbia,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/justin-trudeau-denies-groping-reporter-music-festival-2000-british-columbia
2018-07-02T11:29:47Z,world,World news,French gang may have used drones before helicopter prison break,"The heavily armed commando gang that helped a notorious gangster escape from a French prison by helicopter on Sunday may have used drones to gather information for the daring breakout. Their hijacked helicopter landed in the one prison courtyard not fitted with anti-aircraft netting, suggesting a well-planned operation and several reconnaissance missions, French authorities said.
The French justice minister, Nicole Belloubet, said a number of drones were spotted flying over the jail at Réau, south-east of Paris, in recent months. She said investigators were looking at possible links to Sunday’s breakout. “Someone spotted this possible way out, and it could have been done using drones,” Belloubet said. Rédoine Faïd and his gang have been on the run since Sunday. It is the second time Faïd, a serial robber of banks and armoured vehicles and a fan of Hollywood mafia heroes, has escaped jail in five years. Faïd was facing 25 years in prison for a series of crimes, including a attempted robbery in 2010 that led to a high-speed car chase and shootout with police in which officer Aurélie Fouquet, 26, was killed. “Rédouine Faïd is someone who has freedom in his DNA. He also has law-breaking in his DNA,” Laurent-Franck Liénard, the Fouquet family lawyer, told RTL radio on Monday.
Faïd, 46, was talking to his brother Brahim in the prison’s visiting area when, using smoke bombs to create a distraction, three masked and hooded commandos, reportedly armed with Kalashnikovs and wearing “police” armbands, cut through a security door using an angle grinder and snatched him. The operation lasted less than 10 minutes. After bundling Faïd into the helicopter, the gang forced the pilot to fly to Gonnesse near near Charles-de-Gaulle-Roissy airport north of Paris, 37 miles (60km) away, where a fourth commando was waiting with a black Renault Mégane getaway car. The pilot was released unharmed and the helicopter was discovered burned out. Faïd is believed to have escaped along the A1 motorway going north from the French capital before stopping to swap the Mégane for a white van. It emerged on Monday that Faïd was due to be transferred to another prison in Dijon in September. A prison official at Réau, where he was being held, had written to his superiors to suggest the move be brought forward only a week before the break-out. In a letter dated June 22, a prison guard with 31 years experience in the service, warned of the “serious danger” posed by Faïd and insisted he should be moved sooner “Given my modest experience (I will soon have served 31 years in this institution) I have rarely insisted on a transfer concerning a prisoner,” he wrote. The guard added that if the authorities insisted on waiting until September to transfer Faïd “we are taking extremely serious risks with public order, without taking into account the risk of very serious - perhaps irreversible - violence against our staff.” About 2,900 French security forces, national and local police and gendarmes, are on high alert searching for the escaped man and his cohorts. Security has been stepped up at the Belgian border. “All forces have been mobilised to locate the fugitive … coordinated control and interception devices have been put in place taking into account the dangerous nature of the fugitive and his possible accomplices,” the interior ministry said on Monday. The French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, told RTL radio: “The police forces are fully mobilised to find this person. We know he is dangerous; we know he is determined.” Police are questioning Faïd’s brother. Prison union leaders told Le Monde they had already complained about the lack of netting over the main courtyard but accused the prison authorities of taking no notice. Belloubet added that the prisoners never used the main courtyard “except when they leave”. “Perhaps we need to re-examine this situation,” she said. Last year, Faïd was given a 10-year prison sentence after breaking out of Sequedin jail near Lille in 2013 with four accomplices. In that breakout, four guards were taken hostage and five prison security doors blown off their hinges with plastic explosives before the thief was picked up in a car and driven off. He was arrested in a hotel six weeks later. Faïd’s criminal career began in 1995 when he robbed a bank in his hometown of Creil, north of Paris, after taking the bank manager’s family hostage. In the following two years he carried out a series of robberies and was jailed for 18 years. In 2010, Faïd claimed to be a reformed character having been given a conditional release from jail and published a book, called Thief: the Organised Crime Cities, and embarked on a book tour, including appearances on French television.
A year later he was back in police custody accused of being the mastermind behind an attempted robbery in which Fouquet was gunned down. The investigative journalist Frédéric Ploquin, who met Faïd several times while researching a book on the French underworld, said the dramatic escape was “very much his style”. He said the fugitive was a fan of Robert De Niro, Michael Mann and Steve McQueen. “He always tried to make real all the things he learned in the movies,” Ploquin told BFM TV.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/french-gang-may-have-used-drones-before-helicopter-prison-break,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/french-gang-may-have-used-drones-before-helicopter-prison-break
2018-07-02T09:20:14Z,world,World news,Nauru blocks ABC from Pacific forum over 'bias and false reporting',"The government of Nauru has blocked the ABC from covering the Pacific Islands Forum, refusing to issue its journalists visas because of allegations of interference in its politics, bias and false reporting. The government’s statement, issued on Monday, prompted outrage from the Australian parliamentary press gallery and a warning from the ABC it did not intend to vacate its spot, because the Nauruan government should not dictate who covered the event. The Nauruan government promised that “at least one Australian TV outlet” would be allowed to cover the forum, to be held in the first week of September, but said it needed to restrict media numbers due to “very limited accommodation”. “It should be noted that no representative from the [ABC] will be granted a visa to enter Nauru under any circumstances,” it said. The statement blamed the ABC’s alleged “blatant interference in Nauru’s domestic politics during the 2016 election, harassment of and lack of respect towards our president in Australia, false and defamatory allegations against members of our government, and continued biased and false reporting about our country”.
“It is our right, as it is the right of every nation, to choose who is allowed to enter.” With Australian media places at the forum limited to three, the ABC was to provide one journalist, with two from Australian Associated Press. The ABC’s director of news, analysis and investigations, Gaven Morris, said it “does not intend to vacate” its position in the media pool covering the forum. “The Nauruan government should not be allowed to dictate who fills the positions in an Australian media pool,” he said. “It can hardly claim it is ‘welcoming the media’ if it dictates who that media will be and bans Australia’s public broadcaster.” The president of the press gallery committee, David Crowe, issued a statement labelling the decision an “outrageous restriction on press freedom” and noting that the ABC was assisting all media outlets by contributing a journalist to the “unusually small pool”. “All Australians should be dismayed that the government of Nauru seeks to exclude an Australian media organisation in this way.” Nauru – which hosts an Australian immigration detention facility – has been criticised in the past for restrictions on media access in part due to its decision to charge journalists a non-refundable $8,000 fee to apply for a visa, with no guarantee of approval. In 2015 the ABC reported that the president of Nauru, Baron Waqa, and his justice minister were allegedly bribed by an Australian phosphate dealer. That story was written by Alex McDonald and Hayden Cooper, who is now a media adviser to Malcolm Turnbull. On Friday the ABC issued an apology to the Nauruan justice minister, David Adeang, withdrawing any suggestion in a Lateline report from 2016 that he might bear some responsibility for his wife’s death. Morris said the national broadcaster “vigorously defends our role in doing independent reporting on our region”. Since a harsh assessment of the Nauru detention centre from the BBC in 2013 very few Australian media represenatatives have visited the island, the most notable being the Australian’s Chris Kenny in 2015 and Channel Nine’s A Current Affair in June 2016. Sky News also managed to obtain access to the island in 2016.
The Nauruan government recognised that Australian media has “a unique interest in Nauru due to our partnership with Australia as part of its border security operations”. It said all media attending the forum would have to abide by visa guidelines, “respect the laws of our country, and not engage in activities that cause or encourage disruption or civil unrest”. “There are unique security and safety issues in Nauru that must be considered and respected, and the government reserves the right to revoke the visa of any person that breaches their visa conditions.” Disclosure: Paul Karp is a member of the parliamentary press gallery committee.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/nauru-blocks-abc-from-pacific-forum-over-bias-and-false-reporting,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/nauru-blocks-abc-from-pacific-forum-over-bias-and-false-reporting
2018-07-02T09:00:04Z,world,World news,"'Bulls in a paddock': China-US struggle damaging to Australia, Andrew Robb warns","The United States is engaged in a “futile and counterproductive” attempt to contain China, and Australia should exercise its influence independently of both superpowers, former trade minister Andrew Robb has said. Delivering the Australian mining industry annual lecture in Melbourne on Monday, Robb suggested the industry faces two major challenges in containing project costs and maintaining trade relationships in Asia as the US and China struggle like “two bulls in a paddock”. The intervention from the former Coalition minister comes as the Turnbull government seeks to hose down tensions with China over its foreign interference package – of which Robb was a noted critic – and China hits back at Donald Trump in the escalating trade war with the US. Robb – who founded an investment advisory firm and controversially took a contract with Chinese-owned Landbridge a day before he left office – said China and India are “re-emerging” to positions at the “political and economic centre of gravity in the world”, which they had enjoyed for 18 of the last 20 centuries. “Unfortunately, the United States appears yet to accept this inevitability, with both sides of the political aisle in Washington endlessly focusing on ‘containment’ of China – a futile and counterproductive approach, in my view,” he told the Minerals Council of Australia event.
Robb said power-sharing between the US and China is “the biggest opportunity and potentially the biggest threat” for the Indo-Pacific region. He argued history shows both that power-sharing “can be fraught with conflict” but that “conflict is not inevitable”. “Done effectively, such a transition to a workable balance of power in our region will see the China development experience repeated in India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and the remaining Asean countries in the decades ahead,” he said. Robb said Australia was “blessed with ample quality resources” to support China as it shifts to become a consumer society and other Asian countries as they develop. “However, our potential involvement is not inevitable,” he said. Robb warned “Australia does not control the supply of any commodity”, so to capitalise on opportunities it must maintain trade relationships with China and other Indo-Pacific countries, and urgently correct “our bloated, dysfunctional and costly project approval processes”. He said Australia is a middle power but can be “effective in influencing sensible outcomes”, citing the fact Australia was able to convince China to comply with best practice governance as a condition of joining the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. “Such an approach shows that neither Australia nor any other sovereign nation for that matter needs to tug the forelock to any demand by the superpowers,” he said. Robb noted the US’s “blanket opposition” to the infrastructure bank and “relinquishment of leadership in freeing up global trade” have “alarmed many countries”, especially Asean nations, who “feel that they now have no one looking after their backs in dealings with China, as its influence grows”. As one of the most trade-exposed industries, the mining and energy sector needed Australia to show “strong but respectful diplomacy” to navigate an “increasingly tense power struggle”, he warned. “The alternative of leaving two bulls in a paddock to fight it out is no answer.”
The US recently announced it intends to target $50bn worth of Chinese goods with 25% tariffs, which prompted retaliatory tariffs from China. Malcolm Turnbull has consistently argued for free trade in the face of increasing US protectionism, but the prime minister has also angered China by targeting it in debates about foreign interference legislation, which passed last week. Robb argued Australia is in competition with new mining regions in Africa and South America, while Australian regulation is “increasingly a major deterrent” for investors. “Major duplication, lack of coordination, lengthy delays, costly reports, endless litigation and the sheer growth in the number of approvals required by all levels of government is seeing major projects face the requirement for literally many thousands of separate approvals.” Regulation should be more “common-sense and efficient”, he said, or Australia would price itself out of the investment market. Robb praised the Australian mining and energy sector for leading the world in lowering costs through innovation, including use of big data, robots, artificial intelligence, autonomous drills, driverless trains and “intelligent mines”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/bulls-in-a-paddock-china-us-struggle-damaging-to-australia-andrew-robb-warns,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/bulls-in-a-paddock-china-us-struggle-damaging-to-australia-andrew-robb-warns
2018-07-02T08:06:03Z,world,World news,Spanish hotel cleaners seek Tripadvisor's help to fight exploitation,"Booking platforms such as Tripadvisor face growing pressure to reveal the employment practices of the Spanish hotels they promote, as a cleaners’ activist group launches a name and shame campaign aimed at rooting out exploitation in the tourism industry. The campaign has been launched by the Barcelona branch of Las Kellys, a play on las que limpian (those who clean), a nationwide group of hotel cleaners who are fighting against outsourcing which has led to working conditions that in many cases have been described as virtual slavery. Speaking at the launch of the campaign in the Catalan parliament, Vania Arana, the group’s spokeswoman, said it was creating a seal of quality for hotels that followed good practices in the firm belief that most clients would not want to stay in a hotel where domestic workers, the vast majority of whom are women, were paid as little as €2 to clean a room that cost €200 a night. The group has been in touch with Tripadvisor with a view to it carrying the seal of quality on its website. Tripadvisor did not respond to a request for comment. The leftwing political coalition En Comú Podem has proposed legislation that would outlaw bad practices in the industry. “We can’t wait until this happens so we are initiating this campaign of good practices in hotels,” Arana said. “We will invite hotel managers to let us carry out an inspection so that they can receive this seal of approval.” The group plans to promote hotels that obtain the seal on social media while exposing those with bad practices. In addition to their trademark bright green T-shirts, in their role as hotel inspectors, Las Kellys will also don green safety helmets. Under labour changes passed by the recently deposed People’s party government, hotel cleaners have seen their wages cut by as much as 40% and their workload increased as hotels outsource their jobs to agencies. The women are demanding that hotels revert to employing them directly under the national agreement which guarantees them a monthly wage of €1,200 (£1,060) for a 40-hour week, instead of outsourcing the work. While the outsourced contracts often appear to offer the same pay and conditions, there is a catch: they also specify how many rooms have to be completed during a six-hour shift, on average between 25 and 30, which is not humanly possible. As a result, the workers put in unpaid overtime to meet their quota, bringing their hourly rate down to €3 or €4. If they fail to meet their quota they are sacked. Virtually all the workers complain of health problems, such as back pain and arthritis, and many say they only get through their shift on a diet of painkillers. Speaking at the press conference, Yolanda López of En Comú Podem called on the Catalan government to encourage the creation of quality jobs and penalise those who “use subterfuge to create precarious working conditions”. Las Kellys have come to symbolise the increasingly precarious Spanish job market, where more than 90% of contracts signed since the 2007 financial crash are either part-time or short-term. • This article was amended on 6 July 2018 to use a job description in line with Guardian style on gender.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/spanish-chambermaids-seek-tripadvisor-help-to-fight-exploitation,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/spanish-chambermaids-seek-tripadvisor-help-to-fight-exploitation
2018-07-02T07:21:00Z,world,World news,Mexicans celebrate new president: 'We've a chance to feel hope',"They poured on to the streets bearing banners and flags, united in joy and disbelief.
“I still can’t believe it,” said Victor Gómez, one of thousands of Andrés Manuel López Obrador supporters who had descended on downtown Mexico City on Sunday night to toast their leader’s historic election victory. Gómez, a 47-year-old artist, had brought a date to the fast-growing fiesta on the Paseo de la Reforma, a wide avenue running through the Mexican capital: a papier-mache sculpture portraying the leftist president-elect as a caped superhero. “We’ve seen too many years of cynicism; too many years of theft, of lies, of hypocrisy,” he complained. “I want to believe things can change.” Gómez was not alone. Around him, at the foot of the Ángel de la Independencia monument, hundreds of other joyous lópezobradoristas hugged, cheered, cried, leaped into the air and waved their country’s green, white and red flag. “Presidente! Presidente! Presidente!” they chanted. “Obrador! Obrador! Obrador!”
Down the road, thousands more had packed into the capital’s main plaza, the Zócalo, to hear their leader give an exultant victory speech in which he vowed to transform Mexico and rule for the poor and forgotten. “I’m happy, happy, happy – at last we got the guy we wanted,” beamed Antonio Hernández Vasquez, 63, a small-business owner who said he had been rooting for López Obrador, or Amlo as most Mexicans call him, since his first presidential run in 2006.
“It is the first time in many years that we will have an honest president, an upright president,” Vasquez said of Amlo, who made eradicating rampant corruption and political sleaze the backbone of his third bid to become commander-in-chief. “He will change Mexico for the better.” As the scale of Amlo’s triumph became clear, the street party swelled and Mexico City’s historic centre erupted into a joyful cacophony of car horns and revving engines. “This is a historic day for us,” said Luiz Gerardo, a 23-year-old English teacher. “Now we’ve a chance to feel hope.” “I feel so emotional … Amlo offers the possibility of a better life for us all,” said Eckert Baca, a 33-year-old entrepreneur, who believed Amlo would come to the resucue of the 53 million Mexicans still stuck in poverty.
Baca had brought a pink highlighter pen and a pad of A4 paper to the party and was using them to make posters celebrating Amlo’s best-known catchphrases. One read: “Abrazos, no balazos” (“Hugs not gunfire”), a reference to Amlo’s pledge to de-escalate the calamitous 11-year war on drugs. Another said: “The change has already begun.” The ecstasy in central Mexico City on Sunday night was tempered with realism. “We know it is just a small step. We know that even as president Amlo won’t magically end corruption,” said Javier Giménez, a 47-year-old actor. But his election was, he enthused, a step towards “profound change” in a country desperate for a new direction.
“He will start to transform the country,” Baca said. “He’s not a magician. It’s also about society and we must all take part.” Such details, however, were for another day. For now, only one thing mattered. “López Obrador beat them!” said Vasquez, lifting his homemade banner into the night sky. “Thank you for all these years of struggle!” it said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/mexicans-celebrate-new-president-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/mexicans-celebrate-new-president-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador
2018-07-02T07:00:02Z,world,World news,World Cup spotlights Brazil’s great players – and their single mothers,"Round the corner from a gang member with a pistol in his waistband and an automatic rifle in his hands, the Women’s Bar in Rio’s Complexo do Alemão favela was showing the World Cup on a big TV. Among the crowd watching the Brazil-Serbia game, women in team shirts outnumbered men, while children bounced on a trampoline or queued to have Brazilian flags painted on their cheeks. “You meet everyone here. There’s a great vibe,” said Maira Quirino, 26 – who like many of those at the bar – is a single mother. The Seleção has so far had a successful if unspectacular World Cup. But away from the pitch, this tournament has thrown the spotlight on the player’s mothers whose hard-luck life stories appear to resonate with ordinary Brazilians in a way that the team’s more glamorous wives and girlfriends do not. According to a widely shared story in the Brazilian edition of El País, six of the players who lined up against Serbia – Miranda, Thiago Silva, Marcelo, Casemiro, Paulinho and Gabriel Jesus – grew up without fathers. According to government figures, women are the head of the household in 40% of Brazilian families, even where they have a conjugal partner – up from 23% two decades earlier. But single mothers are often overlooked in popular culture. Many of Brazil’s great players have come from backgrounds of crushing poverty. And their mothers connect with ordinary Brazilian women because they have lived similar lives, said Debora Diniz, a professor of anthropology at the University of Brasília. That contrasts with the upscale lifestyle enjoyed by of players’ wives and girlfriends – who in many cases are lighter-skinned, unlike the team which is a typically Brazilian racial mix. “[The mothers] are much more universally Brazilian women,” she said. “There is a racial contrast that is very important. There is a class contrast that is very important.”
In Brazil – and other South American countries – feminism is on the rise and the issues it raises are increasingly discussed on television soap operas, said Leticia Bahia, a consultant to the United Nations Foundation and co-founder of feminist site AzMina. “The idea that you have to stay in a marriage because of the children has really collapsed,” she said. At the Women’s Bar, Quirino’s friend Daiane Oliveira, 23 – who has the name of her daughter Camilly, seven, tattooed on her calf – said Brazilian mothers are increasingly choosing to go it alone if relationships aren’t working out. “Brazilian women today are independent. They don’t need men for anything.” A grimmer factor in Brazil’s growing number of single mothers is the country’s ban on abortion, which forces many women into unwanted pregnancies, said Thaiz Leão, 28, who runs a Facebook page called Mãe Solo (Single Mother) with 80,000 followers. “The father can abandon the child and the woman cannot,” Leão said. Brazil’s entrenched machismo is also a factor, she said: many men regard infidelity as their birthright and refuse to help at home. “We deserve better relationships,” Leão said. For many women, the spotlight on the team’s mothers has been been a timely reminder of where the players came from. “None of them are middle class,” said Mariluce Souza, 36, who runs the Favela Art project in the Complexo do Alemão.
Vera Lúcia, mother of Manchester City and Brazil forward Gabriel Jesus, is a former maid who raised him and his three brothers alone. Now, however, she often appears on chat shows and toured Russia – alongside Neymar’s mother Nadine and Fernandinho’s mother Ane – for a six-part TV Globo series called As Matrioskas – The Russian Dolls. Her strong, supportive relationship with her 21-year-old son, a star at Manchester City, resonated with mothers in the crowd at the Women’s Bar. “Gabriel Jesus is from a favela and was raised by his mother,” says Rita de Cassia, 38, a single mother of three children – the middle of whom, Andry, 12, also dreams of becoming a footballer. Brazil’s World Cup focus on footballing sons and mothers from tough neighbourhoods was encapsulated in a photograph which went viral earlier this month Wallace Rocha, 12, from Rio’s Vila Cruzeiro favela wanted a shirt with midfielder Philippe Coutinho’s name, but neither his mother, Sandra de Oliveira, 47, an unemployed cleaner, nor his stepfather could afford one. De Oliveira asked a local seamstress to knock one up, promising to pay later. Photographer Bruno Itan captured the pair watching Brazil beat Costa Rica – then launched an online campaign to get it to Coutinho.
The photo went viral and four hours later, Coutinho replied with a video message. Wallace too wants to become a footballer, his mother said. “It’s my dream too,” she said. “It’s a good profession for him, to get him off the streets.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/world-cup-brazil-players-single-mothers,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/world-cup-brazil-players-single-mothers
2018-07-02T06:18:49Z,world,World news,New Zealand the most perilous place for seabirds due to plastic pollution,"Seabirds are more at risk of dying due to plastic in New Zealand than anywhere else in the world, new research presented to parliament has shown. New Zealand is considered “the seabird capital of the world”, according to the country’s Department of Conservation, with the northern royal albatross raising their chicks on the Otago Peninsula, unique species of oystercatchers on the Chatham Islands and more penguin species than any country in the world. There are 36 seabird species that breed only in New Zealand. Mexico is a distant second with just five. More than a third of all seabird species are known to spend time in New Zealand’s waters. Karen Baird from conservation group Forest & Bird, which produced the report, said: “Rubbish that ends up in our seas has a far worse effect on seabird species than anywhere else in the world.” “Even though we don’t have the most plastic pollution, we are unique in the world in having so many seabirds species. We also have the most threatened seabird species, many of which are found nowhere else.” Seabirds are particularly vulnerable to eating plastic because they are surface feeders, spotting food from the air and swooping down on it, scooping it up and swallowing it before the mistake is realised. Seabird chicks and adults face starvation when their stomachs fill up with plastic rather than food. Forest & Bird called on the government to ban single-use plastic bags and commit to further research into how marine life is affected by plastic in New Zealand waters.
One in three turtles that are found sick or dead in the country are caused by the animals eating plastic, Forest & Bird found, with marine mammals such as seals and sea lions also at risk. In neighbouring Australia, nine out of 10 fledglings in some shearwater colonies surveyed had eaten significant quantities of plastic, Baird said. New Zealand’s 10 shearwater species could be in for the same fate if plastic pollution wasn’t urgently addressed, Baird said. Plastic accounts for 78% of all rubbish on New Zealand beaches, with a study this year finding Wellington’s scenic Oriental Bay has some of the worst plastic pollution in the world. Associate environment minister Eugenie Sage said the government was tackling ocean pollution at its source, and “bold, decisive” action was needed to combat the estimated 1.5bn plastic bags used each year in New Zealand. “Dealing with waste on land means less makes it into the ocean,” said Sage. “In March, New Zealand signed up to the United Nations-led CleanSeas campaign to rid our oceans of plastic, and we accepted the Greenpeace petition seeking a ban on single use plastic bags.” “We are working on how to get rid of single use plastic bags but in the meantime it’s great that many retailers and supermarkets are showing leadership by phasing them out.” Microbeads have been banned in New Zealand, and single-use plastic bags are being phased out by some major supermarkets, but the government is yet to pass legislation for stricter, nationwide plastic reform.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/new-zealand-the-most-perilous-place-for-seabirds-due-to-plastic-pollution,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/new-zealand-the-most-perilous-place-for-seabirds-due-to-plastic-pollution
2018-07-02T05:25:20Z,world,World news,Monday briefing: NHS at 70 – MPs urged to 'think big',"Top story: ‘Fully developed’ NHS needed Good morning all, Alison Rourke here to start off your Monday morning. The health service needs far more financial support if it is to meet the needs of a changing population, the head of Whitehall’s spending watchdog has warned. In the week the NHS turns 70, Sir Amyas Morse has called on politicians to “think big” on where this national asset should go and says the annual spending increase to £135bn by 2023-24 will only serve to maintain current services. Morse says it won’t be enough to meet the needs of a rapidly changing demographic and calls for a “bigger and better” and “fully developed” healthcare system. He calls on NHS leaders to transform the way the service works and to treat more patients at home. “The best thing you can do for someone is to keep them out of hospital and living well. And that’s not just old people.” This week the Guardian will be running a series this week to mark the NHS’s 70th birthday, including our first offering in today’s lunchtime read on Clement Attlee’s granddaughter’s memories of what drove her famous “Grandpa” to build a health service available to all. * * * EU student fees - European students applying to universities in England next year – after Britain’s formal exit from the EU – will be eligible for student loans and tuition fees at the same rate as domestic students, the government has announced. The education secretary, Damian Hinds, said students from the EU made an important contribution to the universities sector: “It is a testament to our system that so many students from abroad choose to come and study here,” Hinds said. The government’s decision to extend the current arrangements on loans and fees to 2019-20 means EU students can continue to enrol on the same basis as British students, after the formal date for Brexit in March 2019 has passed. * * * ‘Artificial ovary’– Doctors have used human tissue and eggs in a bid to help women conceive after cancer treatment or other therapies that may have damaged their fertility. A team in Denmark showed that a lab-made artificial ovary could keep human eggs alive for weeks at a time, raising hopes that the approach may one day help women have families after treatments such as chemo- and radiotherapy. “This is the first proof that we can actually support these egg cells. It’s an important step along the road,” researcher Susanne Pors told the Guardian. * * * Merkel’s migration battle – All eyes will be on Germany’s fragile coalition today after the country’s interior minister said he would meet with Angela Merkal one last time before he made a decision on whether or not to resign. Horst Seehofer, who leads the Christian Social Union, is unhappy with the deal struck by Merkel on migration in Brussels last week. Seehofer’s departure could benefit the chancellor in the short term, removing her nemesis from inside government, but in the long term could threaten the country’s historic governing alliance. * * * ‘It stinks’ – A report that Donald Trump is looking to walk away from the World Trade Organisation and instead adopt a United States Fair and Reciprocal Tariff Act, or Fart Act, has been greeted with loud amusement on Twitter. News website Axios reported that it had received a leaked early draft of a bill ordered by the president, that would see America take the unlikely step of abandoning WTO rules, allowing Trump to raise tariffs without the consent of Congress. The bill – the existence of which has not been independently confirmed – would be a dramatic shift in trade policy with wide-reaching impacts, but it was the name of the proposed bill that caught people’s attention. * * * Butterfly boost – A sunny May and June and the harsh winter that preceded has given a boost to the country’s most endangered butterfly, the high brown fritillary. The cold winter helped knock back the bracken, said Matthew Oates, one of the UK’s leading butterfly experts, giving rise to ideal conditions for caterpillar development in May and June. “As we are having some fairly dry weather, it’s now the perfect time for seeing this large and powerful butterfly,” he said. World Cup Another day, and another big name has fallen by the wayside. The latest team to be bundled out of the tournament in Russia are 2010 winners Spain, who lost 4-3 on penalties against the host nation.
The Spaniards’ finesse was no match for Russian tenacity in their Moscow last-16 showdown – and it’s tiki-taxi for them, writes Barney Ronay. The Russian coach, Stanislav Cherchesov, said his plan to nullify Spain had worked to perfection after a gritty defensive performance that was devised in response to the threat posed by their opponents. In the day’s other fixture, Luka Modrić fluffed his big line – from the penalty spot to settle the game in extra-time – but ultimately the classy Real Madrid man prevailed in the duel with his successor at Tottenham, Christian Eriksen, as Croatia booked a place in the quarter-finals with a shootout win over Denmark. In the England camp, Gareth Southgate has defended Jordan Pickford and publicly reaffirmed his faith in his first-choice goalkeeper after the England No 1 came in for criticism over Belgium’s winning goal in last week’s final group game. Last-16 opponents Colombia are confident, with David Ospina saying his team are better than the one that reached the World Cup quarter-finals four years ago and will be lifted by the backing of around 40,000 supporters in Moscow. Arguably more importantly though, waistcoat sales are up – Marks & Spencer, which has been the official suit supplier to the England team since 2007, said demand for waistcoats had risen 35% thanks to what they say is “the Gareth Southgate effect”. But before Tuesday’s big game, Brazil, where there is a feeling among players and management that things are falling into place, meet Mexico and Belgium seek to finally play to their potential against Japan. The build-up to both matches has already started. Lunchtime read: ‘He’d be amazed at progress in the NHS’ As the NHS turns 70, Clement Attlee’s granddaughter Belinda Johnson tells how her mother’s illness helped drive the push for a national health service. “First she got meningitis and spent time in hospital, though she survived it. Then she fell off her bicycle and fractured her skull,” Johnson recalls. Attlee, who led the government that created the NHS, could afford to keep his daughter alive, but understood others could not.
“People couldn’t afford healthcare. When you got ill the rich could keep themselves alive and the poor couldn’t, which is wrong.” What would Grandpa make of today’s NHS? “He’d be amazed at the progress in technology and in pharmaceuticals,” Johnson says. “He’d be proud that we can afford to do things like screening, because prevention is better than cure.” Sport LeBron James, the NBA’s best player, has agreed to a four-year, $154m contract with the LA Lakers, leaving Cleveland for a second time to join one of the league’s most storied franchises. Andy Murray’s decision on Sunday night to pull out of Wimbledon, which starts today, has left tennis fans bewildered but he is adamant he has made the right decision. Chris Froome will on Tuesday take his chance with an appeal against his exclusion from the Tour de France but the mood in France is hardening against Team Sky and the four-times winner, thanks in part to memories of Lance Armstrong. And England cantered to a seven-wicket win in the T20 tri-series final, stamping their dominance in the format before the Women’s World T20 in November. Business More than 150 estate agency firms went insolvent last year and as many as 7,000 are at risk as high street operators face the triple whammy of online competition, a sagging property market and cuts to letting fees, a study by accountants Moore Stephens has found. Asian share markets were burdened by fresh losses in China on Monday, while Mexico’s peso firmed as exit polls pointed to a decisive victory for presidential front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s party. The pound is buying $1.321 and €1.131. The papers
The Guardian’s lead story today, as mentioned above, is “NHS funding boost not enough, spending watchdog warns May”, kicking off the paper’s coverage of the NHS at 70. Elsewhere, Brexit leads the front pages of both the Times (“May piles pressure on Brexiteer ministers”) and the Telegraph (“Mogg warns May: Give a real Brexit or face coup”). The i has “Warring Cabinet out of control”. The Daily Mail is launching a campaign to “Save Britain’s high streets” in light of revelations 50,000 retail jobs were axed in the past six months.

2018-07-02T05:21:38Z,world,World news,Japan faces backlash over push to resume 'cruel' commercial whaling,"Japan has set itself on a diplomatic collision course with Australia and other anti-whaling nations amid reports that it plans to push for the partial resumption of commercial whaling later this year. The country’s delegation to a meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in Brazil in September will attempt to alter voting rules that would make it easier to resume for-profit whaling, media reports said. Commercial whaling was banned under a 1986 IWC moratorium, but Japan has continued to hunt whales legally in the Southern ocean every winter for what it claims is “scientific research”.
A clause in the moratorium allows it to sell whale meat from the hunts on the open market, although consumption has plummeted in recent decades. Japanese officials say the proposal would cover catch quotas only for species whose stocks are no longer recognised as depleted, citing evidence showing that the populations of humpback, minke and other whale species have increased. Japan “will propose setting a catch quota for species whose stocks are recognised as healthy by the IWC scientific committee,” Hideki Moronuki, a whaling official at the fisheries agency, told Agence France-Presse. Moronuki added that Japan would propose lowering the proportion of votes required to set catch quotas from two-thirds of the IWC membership to a simple majority – a move that is expected to encounter strong resistance from Australia and New Zealand. Australia’s department of the environment and energy said it would seek to block any attempt by Japan to return to commercial whaling. “Australia will strongly oppose any proposals to overturn the moratorium or change the rules for setting catch limits,” it said in a statement to the Fairfax Media. Conservation groups accused Japan of attempting to resurrect a “cruel, archaic and unnecessary industry”. “Trying to subvert the way the IWC makes its decisions won’t change the fact that for decades the majority of IWC members have had zero appetite for a return to the bygone era of commercial whaling,” said Nicola Beynon, head of campaigns at Humane Society International in Australia. Japan faced criticism in May after reporting that its heavily subsidised whaling fleet killed 122 pregnant whales during its annual “research” hunt in the Southern Ocean last winter. Of the 333 minke whales caught during the four-month expedition, 181 were female – including 53 juveniles. In 2014, the international court of justice ordered a halt the annual slaughter of whales in the Southern ocean, after concluding that the hunts were not, as Japan had claimed, conducted for scientific research. Japan resumed whaling in the region two years later under a revamped programme that included reducing its catch quota by about two-thirds.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/japan-commercial-whaling-backlash,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/japan-commercial-whaling-backlash
2018-07-02T05:04:26Z,world,World news,Merkel and Seehofer make last-ditch bid for migration compromise,"Angela Merkel is due to meet her rebellious hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, on Monday afternoon for a last-ditch attempt to find a compromise over migration policy, following weeks of strife which threatens to bring down her coalition government. Seehofer – who threatened to resign on Sunday night both as interior minister and head of the Bavarian CSU party – and the chancellor, who is head of the much larger CDU, have signalled their readiness to meet once again in an attempt to save their centre-right alliance, which has been a force in German politics for almost 70 years. But the distrust between the two heavyweights has reached such a height it is hard to see where the room for manoeuvre between them lies. The future of Germany’s current coalition government, which has been in office for barely 100 days, is hanging in the balance after Seehofer refused to accept the merits of the migration deal Merkel hammered out with fellow European leaders in Brussels last week. The sticking point between the two concerns Seehofer’s demand that asylum seekers wishing to enter Germany should be turned away if they have already registered in another EU country. Merkel has rejected the proposal, fearing it would cause a domino effect across Europe, placing too much of the burden on countries such as Greece, Malta and Italy. She was due to meet with leading members of her party ahead of the meeting with Seehofer, in order to inform them of the current state of negotiations with the CSU. German commentators were calling Sunday the Night of the Long Knives after Seehofer rejected the arrangements Merkel announced she had made with 14 different countries, and later threatened to resign. Andrea Nahles, head of the Social Democrats, who are part of Merkel’s grand coalition, called both conservative parties irresponsible, and accused the CSU of embarking on a “dangerous ego trip which is at risk of paralysing Germany and Europe”. At a 2am media conference on Monday, Seehofer said he had agreed to meet again with Merkel’s party before he made his decision final. “We’ll have more talks today with the CDU in Berlin with the hope that we can come to an agreement,” Seehofer said. “After that, then we will see.” In the short term, Seehofer’s resignation would be a let-up for a beleaguered Merkel, removing a politician who has become the chancellor’s biggest adversary inside her own government since taking up his post at the interior ministry in March. But if Seehofer were to resign and his replacement continue his approach, it would threaten to bring an end to the historic alliance between Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, and the Bavarian CSU, pushing the government to the brink of collapse. After the EU last week hammered out a vague accord on migration, promising to set up secure centres to process the asylum claims of people rescued in the Mediterranean, Merkel drew up her own series of measures to tighten controls on the influx of migrants to Germany and presented it to her sceptical, conservative coalition partners. Seehofer threatened to turn away any asylum claimants already registered in another EU country unless Merkel came up with a solution by Sunday night. Merkel set out fresh measures to calm the row, but Seehofer reportedly voiced his dissatisfaction with the plans at his meeting with fellow CSU party leaders. The interior minister complained in Munich that he had engaged Merkel in a “conversation with no effect”, the sources said. According to sources cited by newspaper Die Welt, Seehofer directly contradicted the chancellor, who insisted in a TV interview on Saturday night that the deal she had hammered out in Brussels amounted to the same as the unilateral steps envisioned by the Bavarians. A statement from Seehofer, originally scheduled for 7pm, was postponed until late in the evening on Sunday as he remained locked in a heated debate with Bavarian party allies wary of a break with the CDU.The CSU, which is facing regional elections in October, has pressured Merkel for weeks to get tough on immigration and asylum as it fears being outflanked to the right by the anti-immigrant, anti-Islam Alternative for Germany (AfD). The chancellor rejects Seehofer’s plan for Germany to unilaterally turn away already-registered asylum seekers at the border, preferring to seek cooperation with Germany’s neighbours. Merkel fears that if Germany closes its borders, it will set off a chain reaction that destroys Europe’s border-free travel zone, regarded by the EU as one of its greatest achievements, as well as a linchpin of jobs and prosperity. At her urging, EU leaders last week agreed measures to reduce immigration to the bloc and so-called “secondary migration” of asylum seekers between countries. Merkel said she had struck deals with 16 other countries for them to take back already-registered asylum seekers. But central European nations including Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia denied any such agreement. “Germany has not addressed us and I will not sign this agreement,” said the Czech prime minister Andrej Babiš. “No negotiations have taken place between the Czech Republic and Germany on this question.” Merkel said on Sunday she wanted the CDU and its Bavarian allies to continue working together. She told German broadcaster ZDF that differences with the CSU only related to the way to achieve a reduction in migration, not to the goal.
She said: “I share the CSU’s aim of, on the one hand, reducing the number of immigrants being brought to Europe by smugglers and, on the other hand, I also share the view that asylum seekers can’t simply choose which country they want to go to.” If Seehofer rejects Merkel’s approach and orders border police to begin turning away asylum seekers, she would be forced to fire him, robbing her ruling coalition with the Social Democratic party (SPD) of a majority in parliament. While most analysts expect Merkel to survive the clash with the CSU, it is unlikely to be the last occasion on which the sister party seeks to distance itself from a chancellor it sees as too centrist for its own supporters. Spain’s maritime rescue service on Sunday picked up 160 people from five boats that were crossing the dangerous Strait of Gibraltar from northern Africa. The rescue service said 57 migrants were rescued from three boats on Sunday morning and brought ashore in Tarifa, at the southernmost tip of the Iberian peninsula. Another rescue vessel took 103 people to Algeciras, a large port city to the east. The number of people reaching Europe by the so-called western Mediterranean land and sea route to Spain has surpassed boat arrivals to Italy this year.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/merkel-fights-to-save-coalition-from-division-over-migration,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/01/merkel-fights-to-save-coalition-from-division-over-migration
2018-07-02T05:00:01Z,world,World news,Roma communities fear deportation in post-Brexit Britain,"Roma living in the UK are at risk of deportation following Brexit, charities have said, as they warn that many will be unable to provide the necessary documentation to be granted settled status. Last month, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said that EU nationals would be asked to answer “three simple questions” in an online form to continue living in the UK once it has left the EU. Applicants will be asked to prove their identity, that they have no convictions and that they currently live in the UK.
Charities working with Roma communities across the UK have said that although most Roma are EU citizens and have the right to be in the UK, many are illiterate, would struggle to provide paperwork and do not have access to computers or smartphones. Martin Burrell, chair of the Luton Roma Trust, which provides services for about 3,000 Roma in the town, said: “We’re all holding our breath to see what’s going to happen on the other side of Brexit. We’re all very worried that many of our families won’t be able to demonstrate that they have been resident in the UK. “They may not be able to provide a list of addresses that they have lived in over the years and may not be able to demonstrate that they’ve been in regular work. We are all very fearful of what might happen to these families, many of whom have been here 10 or 15 years now.” Mihai Bica, from the Roma Support Group, said: “The Roma community is the most vulnerable group when it comes to accessing their future settled status. [The Home Office scheme] is an online scheme and there are high levels of illiteracy among Roma people.” Bica, a Romanian Roma who came to the UK in 2012, said that a tiny number of the organisation’s clients used email. The Roma are traditionally a travelling group of people and are one of Europe’s most marginalised groups. Many came to the UK in the 1990s to escape persecution in eastern Europe. After the expansion of the EU in the 2000s, more Roma have arrived in search of a better life. It is estimated that around 300,000 live in the UK. The warning by UK charities comes as threats by Italy’s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, to expel thousands of Roma have drawn attention to prejudice against the group across Europe, and the problems they could face if deported to their country of origin.
Bica said some of his clients had fled parts of eastern Europe because they had been attacked or had their homes burned down. He said the UK should reflect on what was happening in Italy and examples of persecution elsewhere. “Please don’t let the same thing happen here,” he said. “The UK has been a welcoming place for so many communities and it has improved the lives of Roma a lot after their arrival here. But if people don’t pay enough attention to what is happening in other countries, the UK could go the same way.” Rebecca Hilsenrath, the chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said Roma experienced some of the worst disadvantage and prejudice of all ethnic groups in the UK. “Previous surveys have found that 50% of people living in Britain will openly express unfavourable views of Roma people. They face significant difficulties in trying to access healthcare, education, employment and housing,” she said. A Home Office spokesperson said that throughout the application process the government would be looking for reasons to grant, rather than to refuse, settled status. “We recognise that we need to reach out to and support a wide range of vulnerable groups, such as the Roma, whose needs will vary. These groups will include those that cannot access, or aren’t confident with, technology and non-English speakers.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/roma-communities-fear-deportation-in-post-brexit-britain,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/roma-communities-fear-deportation-in-post-brexit-britain
2018-07-02T04:47:10Z,world,World news,Jacinda Ardern welcomes new welfare reforms from the sofa with new baby,"Jacinda Ardern has welcomed sweeping government reform for families in a video filmed while she is sitting on her sofa, cradling her baby, Neve. The families package was a core part of Labour’s campaign promises, and aims to make New Zealand “the best country in the world to raise a family”, as well as lifting 64,000 children out of poverty by 2020. In the video, Ardern said the package was her proudest achievement as prime minister so far.
On Sunday paid-parental leave increased from 18 to 22 weeks, and to 26 weeks from July 2020. Babies born on or after 1 July will be eligible for a NZ$60 a week payment for the first year of a child’s life, with some families able to claim the payment till the child reaches three years old. Since giving birth on 21 June, Ardern has been on maternity leave in her Auckland home with partner Clarke Gayford.
In her first video since being discharged from Auckland hospital on 24 June, Ardern is pictured sitting in her living room, cradling her daughter in a woollen blanket. “This is my permanent state at the moment, either breastfeeding or this,” Ardern said, glancing at her sleeping daughter. “I’m glad no one could hear that just now!” says Ardern later in the video, laughing and glancing again at her baby. There were more than 3,000 comments on Ardern’s first video since returning home, the overwhelming majority of them supportive and encouraging of the new mother and prime minister. “A prime minister wrapped in a blanket with a new baby still putting her country first,” commented Audrie Scott on Facebook. “You are setting new boundaries prime minister!” Towards the end of the video Ardern took time to respond to questions from viewers, replying by name in real time. “Karen, I’m doing really really great thank you, I promise. I was waiting for anyone to say I look tired. I promise I am not too bad I really just don’t have any make-up on, so that’s probably why I have a bit more bags under the eyes than usual ... but we are doing great, we are doing really great.” National party finance spokeswoman Amy Adams said 1.7 million New Zealanders would be worse off under the families package. “Changes such as higher fuel taxes, rent increases and higher income taxes are costing Kiwi families over $100 a week,” said Adams. “And that’s an unacceptable burden on New Zealanders who are trying to get ahead.” Ardern signed off her video in typical fashion – with a smile– and promised to read through the thousands of comments soon. “But in the meantime I am going to sit here with my human hot-water bottle, and thanks everyone for the lovely messages.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-welfare-reforms-baby,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-welfare-reforms-baby
2018-07-02T01:48:32Z,world,World news,Mexico election: historic landslide victory for leftist Amlo,"A baseball-loving leftwing nationalist who has vowed to crack down on corruption, rein in Mexico’s war on drugs and rule for the poor has been elected president of Latin America’s second-largest economy.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a silver-haired 64-year-old who is best known as Amlo and counts Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn among his friends, was elected with at least 53% of the vote, according to a quick count by Mexico’s electoral commission. López Obrador’s closest rival, Ricardo Anaya from the National Action party (PAN), received around 22% while José Antonio Meade, a career civil servant running for the Institutional Revolutionary party, or PRI, which ruled Mexico for most of last century, came in third with around 16%. Addressing the media after those results were announced, López Obrador vowed to repay the trust put in him by millions of Mexicans. “I will govern with rectitude and justice. I will not fail you. I will not disappoint you. I won’t betray the people,” he said. Mexico’s president-elect vowed to rule for people of all social classes, all sexual orientations and all points of view. “We will listen to everyone. We will care for everyone. We will respect everyone,” he said. “But we will give priority to the most humble and to the forgotten.”
Earlier, with exit polls pointing to an Amlo landslide, his rivals began conceding defeat. “For the good of Mexico I wish him the very best of luck,” said Meade. Anaya said: “As I said to him a few minutes ago on the phone I recognise his triumph, express my congratulations and wish him the best of luck for the good of Mexico ... The citizens wanted a change and they opted in their majority for the alternative that he represents.” Donald Trump called López Obrador to offer his congratulations in a conversation which both leaders described in positive terms – even though the Mexican president-elect had recently Trump’s family separation policy Amlo recently denounced as arrogant, racist and inhuman “There was respectful treatment and our representatives will speak more,” Amlo tweeted. Trump was equally tactful, telling reporters: “I think he’s going to try and help us with the border.
As the scale of Amlo’s triumph emerged his supporters began flooding Mexico City’s intensely symbolic main plaza, the Zócalo, where he was due to make a victory speech.
“We’ve been hoping for this moment for more than 12 years,” said Oliver Izquierdo, 38, a film director who was among the jubilant crowds. “Finally democracy has made itself present in Mexico.” Exit polls also suggested the party Amlo founded in 2014 – the Movement for National Regeneration or Morena – had won at least five of nine gubernatorial races, with the winners including Mexico City’s first elected female mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum. “We won! We’ll rescue the City of Hope,” she wrote on Twitter. Earlier in the day, Amlo, who has for months towered over his opponents in the polls, flashed a victory sign to reporters as he arrived to vote at a Mexico City polling station. “This is a historic day,” he said, calling the vote “a plebiscite in which people will choose between more of the same or genuine change”. As an estimated 89 million voters descended on polling stations on Sunday it became clear that Mexicans – fed up with political sleaze, soaring violence and poverty - had overwhelmingly voted for change and to reject the only two parties to hold the presidency since the end of one-party rule in 2000. “This country is in a deep hole and he’s the only one that can pull us out of it,” Manuel Molina, a 34-year-old advertising worker, said as he voted Amlo in Mexico City’s Tacubaya neighbourhood. Civil servant Evelyn Correa said she was backing Amlo because she was tired of corrupt and shameless politicians: “He won’t resolve everything like he promises ... But we’ve tried the [other parties]. Hopefully he’s different.”
Delfina Gómez, a close Amlo ally who is running for a seat in Mexico’s senate, told the Guardian she believed corruption-weary voters were backing Amlo and Morena because they wanted “a radical transformation in the way politics is done, and in politicians themselves”. Gómez called Amlo a thrifty, upstanding man who would lead “a government of austerity and honesty”: “He finds it shameful that someone might be flaunting their wealth whilst others are dying of hunger.” Amlo has repeatedly pledged to make eradicating corruption the main focus of his presidency, once he is sworn in on 1 December this year. “We will get rid of ... this cancer, that is destroying this country,” he vowed at his final campaign rally. Analysts also expect him to pursue a less aggressive and less militarised approach to Mexico’s 11-old ‘war on drugs’ which has claimed an estimated 200,000 lives and is widely viewed as a calamity. During the campaign, Amlo has argued “you cannot fight violence with more violence, you cannot fight fire with fire” and proposed an amnesty designed to help low-level outlaws turn away from a life of crime. Eric Olson, a Mexico and Latin America specialist from Washington’s Woodrow Wilson Centre, said he saw Mexico stepping back from regional affairs under its new leader. “Amlo is not an internationalist ... we can expect him to play less of an active role in the region on Venezuela, on Nicaragua and other trouble spots.” Olson also expected tense moments with Trump whose family separation policy Amlo recently denounced as arrogant, racist and inhuman. “But it’s impossible for the US to walk away from Mexico or for Mexico to walk away from the US. They are joined at the hip and need to work together even if their presidents don’t like each other and don’t get along.” Carlos Bravo, a politics expert from Mexico City’s Centre for Economic Research and Teaching, predicted President Amlo would make fighting poverty a flagship policy, just as former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva did after his historic 2002 election with projects such as Bolsa Família and Zero Hunger. Under Amlo he foresaw “massive investment in social policy” which Mexico’s new president could use to show he was attacking not just poverty and inequality but also the social roots of crime and violence. However, Bravo said the “motley coalition” behind Amlo’s election triumph was so diverse – featuring former communists, ultra-conservatives and everything in-between – that trying to guess how he might rule was a fool’s errand. “Quite frankly, right now there is a lot of uncertainty regarding what the López Obrador government will do.” “There will be a lot of infighting [between now and his inauguration] ... and the result of that infighting will be crucial in deciding how the López Obrador government is going to look and what it’s priorities are going to be,” Bravo added. Leading members of Latin America’s left voiced hope Amlo’s election might revive the region’s rapidly ebbing ‘pink tide’. “It will signal the return of progressive winds to Latin America!” Gleisi Hoffmann, the president of Brazil’s embattled Worker’s party, predicted. Brazil’s impeached former president Dilma Rousseff said an Amlo win would “not just be a victory for Mexico but for all of Latin America”. Argentina’s former president, Cristina Kirchner, tweeted: “Andrés Manuel López Obrador represents hope, not just for Mexico but for the entire region.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/mexico-election-leftist-amlo-set-for-historic-landslide-victory,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/02/mexico-election-leftist-amlo-set-for-historic-landslide-victory
2018-07-01T19:02:17Z,world,World news,Italian minister aims to unite European nationalist parties,"The Italian interior minister and leader of the far-right League, Matteo Salvini, said on Sunday that he wanted to create a pan-European network of nationalist parties. Buoyed by his burgeoning popularity since general elections in early March, the 45-year-old said the “League of the Leagues of Europe” would bring together “all the free and sovereign movements that want to defend their people and their borders”. He raised the idea during a keynote speech in Pontida, a small town in the northern region of Lombardy where thousands of League supporters gather each year for a boisterous rally. “To win we had to unite Italy, now we will have to unite Europe,” Salvini said. Brimming with confidence, Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister, added that the League, formerly known as the Northern League, which started in the early 1980s as a northern Italian secessionist movement, would govern the country “for the next 30 years”. He also said that European parliamentary elections in 2019 would be a referendum on “a Europe without borders … and a Europe that protects its citizens”. Salvini’s declaration comes two months after he attended a gathering of Europe’s far-right leaders hosted by Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s National Rally (formerly the Front National), in the southern French city of Nice. At the event, the group, which included Geert Wilders of the Dutch Party for Freedom and Harald Vilimsky of Austria’s Freedom party, launched their campaign ahead of the European elections. Le Pen, with whom Salvini has nurtured a friendship for some time, warned that a far-right majority in the vote could “change Europe”. The League came together with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), led by 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio, in early June to form western Europe’s first populist government after the March elections produced an inconclusive result. M5S emerged as the biggest single party in the ballot, but with support for the League surging from around 18% to 30% in polls since March, the party is now about equal to its ally. Salvini’s hardline stance towards immigration has helped the League to thrive since he became leader in 2013, when it languished at around 5%.
The party’s anti-immigration policies currently have the upper hand within the coalition, with Salvini reiterating on Friday that Italy’s ports would be closed to all NGOs involved in rescuing migrants from the Mediterranean for the entire summer, a period when arrivals peak, and that those on board “will only see Italy in a postcard”. His renewed pledge came the same day the EU’s 28 leaders struck a deal on how to handle refugees and irregular migrants. The deal was reached amid intense pressure from Italy and after a ship carrying over 600 rescued migrants was forced to divert to Spain after Salvini blocked entry. Salvini said his government’s tough approach towards immigration and in negotiations with the EU had achieved more than its predecessors had done in six years. “The happiness of a people comes first,” Salvini proclaimed at the rally, drawing rousing cheers. Salvini asked rally attendees if they would “swear, yes or no, to liberate the peoples from this Europe”. “Yes!” came the resounding reply from the crowd.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/italian-minister-aims-to-unite-european-nationalist-parties,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/01/italian-minister-aims-to-unite-european-nationalist-parties
2018-07-01T17:42:43Z,world,World news,Myanmar: pleas for release of Reuters journalists mount,"Calls for the release of two Reuters journalists who have been in prison in Myanmar for more than six months are mounting ahead of a key hearing in their trial on Monday. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested in December over their reporting, which uncovered a massacre against the Rohingya. The men now face up to 14 years in prison for possessing classified documents relating to military operations in Rakhine State, charges they deny. The killings they uncovered occurred during the military crackdown that caused more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees to flee to Bangladesh, and that the UN has described as “ethnic cleansing”.
The two journalists were detained on 12 December after they met with police sources at a restaurant and were handed the documents. They have been held in prison ever since, while preliminary hearings have been ongoing. Government prosecutors are seeking charges under the Official Secrets Act. Defence lawyer Than Zaw Aung said this week the court will hear an application for discharge from the defence and then decide if the case will proceed or not. The hearing begins on 2 July. It is a trial that has prompted outpourings of condemnation from the UN, human rights groups and even Pope Francis, who called for their release, saying: “The right to information is a right that must always be protected.” Local journalists have repeatedly called for the release of the men, holding rallies in front of the court with reporters wearing black armbands and shirts with the words “journalism is not a crime”. The prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney has spoken out about the case, saying: “The outcome will tell us a lot about Myanmar’s commitment to the rule of law and freedom of speech.” Last week, Stephen Alder, the editor-in-chief of Reuters, called for an end to the prosecution. Speaking to the Guardian, he said: “They have been imprisoned for too long on false accusations.” Alder said the case was “a wholly unwarranted, blatant attack on press freedom”. Both journalists have remained optimistic throughout their incarceration. Wa Lone has become known for giving a double “thumbs up” whenever he walks into court for trial and Kyaw Soe Oo for using every opportunity to embrace his young daughter as he enters and leaves the courtroom.
“I completely believe the truth will come out,” Wa Lone said in handcuffs leaving the court on 18 June. The trial has exposed the continued control of the military in Myanmar. Matthew Bugher, head of Asia Programme for Article 19, a human rights group that defends freedom of expression, said the government has demonstrated that “it will go to any length to silence those seeking to expose the truth about the grave human rights situation in Rakhine State”. Thirty-five journalists have been arrested or charged under the current government and local journalist Hline Thint Zaw Wai said the current trial shows that the government lacks the will to protect journalists. De-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi recently broke her silence on the case in an interview with the Japanese broadcaster NHK, saying the reporters “were arrested because they broke the Official Secret Act”. Court case twists and turns The case has been marked by inconsistencies and contradictions throughout. In April, police captain Moe Yan Naing admitted in court that the documents were planted on Wa Lone to “trap” the journalist. Moe Yan Naing paid the price for his testimony and was given a sentence of one year in jail for violating police discipline. His family was also evicted from their police housing. More recently, a police witness was accused of violating police code as he copied statements from previous witnesses. A witness to testify against the two Reuters journalists also failed to show up to court on 12 June. In May police took information from the journalists’ phones and submitted it to the court. Shawn Crispin, south-east Asia representative from Committee to Project Journalists, criticised this handling of information, saying it jeopardises the confidentiality of sources. “Obviously there is a grave risk that information taken from journalists’ cell phones could be tampered with or otherwise distorted,” he said. When asked for a comment on the case, the Myanmar government spokesman, Zaw Htay, was not immediately available for a comment. Previously he has said he trusted Myanmar’s courts would conduct the case according to the law. Press freedom in shackles Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are the newest faces on a museum wall dedicated to political prisoners in Yangon. They appear next to monks marching for democracy, student protesters and poets who were imprisoned for writing prose against the military regime. “I remember when Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said one political prisoner is already too many,” says Zaw Moe, who spent five years in prison for taking part in the student protests. “They should not be on this wall,” Zaw Moe adds, shaking his head.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/myanmar-pleas-for-release-of-reuters-journalists-mount,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/01/myanmar-pleas-for-release-of-reuters-journalists-mount
2018-07-01T16:26:18Z,world,World news,'Hopefully he's different': Mexico seems poised to elect Amlo as next president,"Latin America’s second-largest economy appeared poised to elect a silver-haired, baseball-loving leftist as its next president on Sunday, as 89 million Mexicans headed to the polls.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the 64-year-old leader of the Movement for National Regeneration or Morena party, has cast the vote as an epoch-making opportunity to radically transform Mexico by electing a leader who will rid the country of corruption and rule for the 53 million Mexicans still stuck in poverty. “This is a historic day,” López Obrador, who is better known as Amlo, told reporters as he arrived at a Mexico City polling station to vote early on Sunday morning. “More than an election it will be a referendum, a plebiscite in which people will choose between more of the same or genuine change.” Amlo has tried – and failed – to become Mexico’s president twice before, in 2006 and 2012, but his decision to make the fight against corruption the bedrock of his third presidential campaign appears to have paid off. Pre-ballot polls suggested the former Mexico City mayor would trounce rivals from the National Action party (Pan) and the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), the only two parties to have controlled Mexico’s presidency since the late 1920s, by at least a 20-point margin. Speaking as she prepared to vote at a polling station in Mexico City’s Nápoles neighbourhood, civil servant Evelyn Correa said she was backing Amlo because she was tired of the corruption and “shamelessness” of Mexico’s political elite. “They know nothing will happen to them and the few politicians that are caught are just scapegoats,” the 44-year-old complained. “He won’t resolve everything like he promises,” Correa added of Amlo. “But we’ve tried the [other parties]. Hopefully he’s different.” Manuel Molina, a 34-year-old advertising worker who was voting in the Tacubaya neighbourhood, said: “This country is in a deep hole and he’s the only one that can pull us out of it.” Experts say Amlo’s success is largely the result his ability to tap into public rage at political sleaze and soaring levels of violence and present himself as an anti-establishment saviour set on fixing those problems. Mexico’s unpopular outgoing president, Enrique Peña Nieto of the PRI, vowed to halve Mexico’s murder rate when he was elected six years ago but leaves office with the country on track for its most violent year in modern history, with more than 13,000 homicides already in 2018. In a recent article about the effect the security crisis had on the presidential race, security analyst Eduardo Guerrero wrote: “It’s the violence, stupid.” A record 130 politicians have been murdered since last September when the election campaign – which will also see nine governors, 128 senators, 500 lower house congresspeople and thousands of regional legislators selected – began. “I deeply regret the loss of life during the course of the elections,” the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, an Amlo friend, tweeted on Saturday. “I hope that democracy, justice and human rights prevail in memory of the deceased candidates.” Peña Nieto’s administration has also been blighted by a series of headline-grabbing corruption scandals, including an outcry over a luxury $7m mansion his wife purchased from a government contractor. At one recent rally on the impoverished outskirts of Mexico’s capital, Amlo railed against what he calls Mexico’s “power mafia” and vowed that once sworn in as president, on 1 December, he would no longer tolerate politicians who made gangsters look like “babes in arms” or saw public office as a golden ticket to personal enrichment. “He’s a populist, this Andrés Manuel, isn’t that right? Messianic!” Amlo sneered, mocking critics who have dubbed him Mexico’s “tropical messiah” and compared him to US president Donald Trump or even Brazil’s rightwing populist Jair Bolsonaro. “I couldn’t care less about this,” Amlo insisted. Election results were not expected until late on Sunday night but Benjamín Moya García, a rural worker from Xochimilco, said he was convinced Amlo had it in the bag. “We’re not probably going to win – we are going to win,” the 59-year-old celebrated, predicting: “Things will be totally different without corruption. I hope he doesn’t fail us.” Elena Hernández Guerrero, a 35-year-old fashion designer, had already started referring to Amlo as “mi presidente”: “He’s with the people, the poor. The others only care about the rich,” she said. “It’s just like he says: the ‘power mafia’ is on top and they won’t let the rest of us rise us. He will end all this.” Delfina Gómez, a leading Morena politician who is running for a senate seat, told the Guardian she believed corruption-weary voters would choose Amlo and his party because they were thirsting for “a radical transformation in the way politics is done, and in politicians themselves”. “We are [ordinary] citizens. We’re not Martians. We’re not from the other side,” she said of Morena. Gómez described Mexico’s likely next president as a thrifty, upstanding man who would lead “a government of austerity and honesty”: “He finds it shameful that someone might be flaunting their wealth while others are dying of hunger.” But Gómez admitted ridding Mexico – which languishes in 135th place in Transparency International’s corruption perception index – of corruption, as Amlo has repeatedly promised, would not be easy and would require the full participation of society. “Of course it is a process … we don’t know if it will take six years, or 12. But we must make a start,” Gómez said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/mexico-election-amlo-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/01/mexico-election-amlo-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador
2018-07-01T15:38:03Z,world,World news,Trump: 'possible' North Korea nuclear deal may not 'work out',"Donald Trump said on Sunday it was “possible” that a deal he claimed ended the nuclear threat posed by North Korea would not “work out”.
A day after it was reported that Pyongyang has increased its production of enriched uranium at secret sites, Fox Business broadcast an interview with the president. Trump was pressed on whether he trusted Kim Jong-un, whom he met last month in Singapore and with whom he said he had “a great chemistry”, to make good on promises to destroy Pyongyang’s nuclear program. “I made a deal with him, I shook hands with him, I really believe he means it,” said Trump. “Now, is it possible? Have I been in deals, have you been in things where, people didn’t work out? It’s possible.” Trump’s words reversed his declaration upon his return from Singapore that North Korea had ended its nuclear ambitons. “Just landed – a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office,” the president tweeted on 13 June. “There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea. Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience. North Korea has great potential for the future!” Speaking to Fox, Trump also sought to shrink the perceived cost of the declared agreement falling through, seeking to frame his negotiations with North Korea as having been achieved without concessions. “We gave nothing,” he said. “Think of this. What did I do, really, when you think of it? I went there. So the papers say, ‘He went’, oh, meaning I went to Singapore. So we had a meeting. We didn’t do anything.” In fact, Trump agreed to end a range of joint military exercises with South Korea, meant to act as a deterrent against the North. In the interview with Fox, he said the exercises, “which I call war games”, were too expensive. “They’re dropping bombs all over the place every six months,” he said, “it’s unbelievably expensive to do that. The planes fly in from Guam, these massive bombers. It’s crazy.” Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, insisted that North Korea’s nuclear program could still be dismantled within a year. NBC News and the Washington Post reported that North Korean attempts to conceal nuclear work. Earlier this week, the monitoring group 38 North reported that North Korea had made rapid improvements to a nuclear reactor. Appearing on CBS’s Face the Nation, Bolton said he did not want to comment on the reports or on “anything related to intelligence” – NBC having quoted more than a dozen senior US intelligence officials and the Post four. Bolton said Trump was not being played by Kim and was “very well aware of North Korea’s patterns of behaviour over decades of negotiating with the United States”. He said: “We know exactly what the risks are of them using negotiations to drag out the length of time they have to continue their nuclear chemical biological weapons programs and ballistic missiles.”
But, he added, Kim had been “very emphatic several times in Singapore he was different from prior regimes”. “We have developed a program,” Bolton said, “…about really how to dismantle all of their WMD [weapons of mass destruction] and ballistic missile programmes in a year”. “If they have the strategic decision already made to do that and they’re cooperative, we can move very quickly. “And it’s to North Korea’s advantage to see these programs dismantled very quickly because then the elimination of sanctions aid by South Korea and Japan and others can all begin to flow.” Mike Pompeo is due to meet Kim in early July. South Korean media reported on Sunday that Sung Kim, the US ambassador to the Philippines, held preparatory talks with North Korean officials in the village of Panmunjom, in the demilitarized zone. A leading Senate foreign policy hawk, meanwhile, took a less diplomatic tone. Interviewed on NBC’s Meet the Press, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said North Korea would “regret it” if nuclear talks collapsed. “I don’t want a war with North Korea,” Graham said. “The last best chance to avoid that war is a peaceful end to their nuclear program … if they don’t take it, and they play Trump like they’ve played everybody else, they’re going to regret it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/trump-north-korea-nuclear-deal-may-not-work-out,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/01/trump-north-korea-nuclear-deal-may-not-work-out
2018-07-01T14:52:43Z,world,World news,Israel deploys border reinforcements as Syrians flee strikes,"Israel has deployed artillery and armoured reinforcements along its northern border with Syria, the Israel Defence Forces said on Sunday, as tens of thousands of Syrians fled towards its borders and those of Jordan. Russian efforts to impose a broad ceasefire in south-west Syria broke down at the weekend, prompting the Syrian regime to undertake fresh air raids. The government forces now claim to be in control of more than half of Daraa province. The fighting is in a diplomatically delicate region, abutting both Jordan and the Israel-occupied Golan Heights. As many as 11,000 refugees had already reached the Israeli border fence on the Golan Heights on Sunday, judging it the safest place to avoid Syrian air force raids. Some of the refugees were asking Israel to protect them or even annex the territory. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, discussed the humanitarian crisis in Syria during a Sunday government meeting, saying: “We will continue defending our borders, we will provide humanitarian aid as best as we can, we will not allow entry to our territories and demand strict adherence to the 1974 Agreement on Disengagement with the Syrian army.” He said he was in touch with the White House.
Neighbouring Jordan says it cannot afford to take any more refugees and is turning away the internally displaced at the border. For the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, the retaking the whole of Daraa province would be a key symbolic victory for the regime, as it is seen as the cradle of the anti-Assad uprising seven years ago that spiralled into civil war. But just under half of Daraa province – including part of the provincial capital of the same name – still remains in the hands of rebels, and the UN is putting the numbers of internally displaced at over 160,000. The fighting in the Daraa province going on even though the territory is inside the de-escalation zone agreed last year by the US president, Donald Trump, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the Jordanian government. Syrian rebel spokesman Ibrahim Jabawi, rejecting the Russian terms for a deal, said: “The talks collapsed because the Russians insisted on their conditions that want us to surrender.” He said Russia wanted the rebels to hand over their weapons followed by a return of government forces to rebel-held areas. A negotiator in the rebel-held part of Daraa city told Agence France-Presse: “All people who carried arms would be put on trial. The regime wants us to hand over everything – Daraa city, the Nasib crossing, ourselves and the heavy weapons. It’s inadmissible.” Syrian’s main opposition group, the Syrian Negotiation Commission (SNC), implored the international community to speak out against the violence, saying it should be clear to members of the UN security council that Russia and Iran “cannot be trusted to negotiate peace, since they are violating the agreement they themselves made”. “We call on the international community to condemn the brutal breaching of the de-escalation zone ... and take all possible measures to halt this assault on our people,” SNC spokesman Yahya al-Aridi said.
It is estimated that as many as 115 civilians have been killed in regime bombardments on the province since 19 June. Aa many as 20,000 refugees are close to areas near the Nasib border crossing with Jordan, a country that already hosts more than 650,000 registered Syrian refugees and says the actual figure is closer to 1.3 million. Amman says it cannot open its frontier to any more Syrians fleeing the seven-year conflict, but on Saturday announced it had sent aid across the border to the displaced. Pope Francis has decried the intensified attacks in southern Syria, asking that people there be spared more suffering. In remarks at the Vatican, he said “the military actions of recent days have struck even schools and hospitals and triggered thousands of new refugees.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/israel-deploys-border-reinforcements-as-syrians-flee-strikes,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/01/israel-deploys-border-reinforcements-as-syrians-flee-strikes
2018-07-01T14:34:22Z,world,World news,Russians protest over pension age rise announced during World Cup,"Russians demonstrated in cities across the country on Sunday in protest at a rise in the pension age. The rallies, organised by an unusually broad group of opposition forces, drew crowds of up to 3,000 in dozens of towns and cities across the country, opposition leaders said. No protests were held in World Cup host cities due to a regulation banning protest in the cities for the duration of the tournament, and also out of a desire not to overshadow it. Russian authorities announced the pension reform on the opening day of the World Cup last month and have been accused of trying to bury extremely unpopular news amid the euphoria of the tournament. The reform would raise the pension age from 60 to 65 for men, and from 55 to 63 for women, over a 15-year period. The average Russian pension is 14,000 roubles (£168). Supporters of the reform say the young retirement ages are a hangover from the Soviet period and are untenable in a market economy; critics point out that life expectancy for men is barely higher than the new retirement age. The protests were organised by a mixture of opposition forces, including the protest leader Alexei Navalny and communist and other “systemic opposition” groups that are usually broadly loyal to the Kremlin.
“Let’s say it honestly: Medvedev and Putin raising the pension age is a genuine crime. It’s a simply robbery of tens of millions of people masquerading as a ‘necessary reform’,” said Navalny, whose brother was last week released from prison after serving a 3.5-year sentence widely regarded as politically motivated. Policing at the protests was unusually relaxed, with no reports of police detentions even in cities where the protests had not received official approval. The World Cup has provided a party atmosphere in Moscow and other host cities, with revelling and singing in the streets most nights. It has led some in the opposition to complain that foreigners are allowed to gather with flags in the streets while they are not. In a video posted on social media, a Russian blogger approaches two police officers in a party district in central Moscow asking if they would be able to walk and drink when the World Cup has left town. “If you’re Russian, no. If you’re foreign, yes,” one officer answers, only half-jokingly. “They’ve been allowed to do everything. But our lot won’t be.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/russians-protest-pension-age-rise-announced-during-world-cup,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/01/russians-protest-pension-age-rise-announced-during-world-cup
2018-07-01T14:13:40Z,world,World news,British Council accused of censorship over Bahamas exhibition,"The cultural diplomacy arm of the Foreign Office has become embroiled in controversy in the Bahamas where it has been accused of censorship and causing further damage to relations already strained by the Windrush scandal. The British Council was served with an unprecedented rebuke by the National Art Gallery of the Bahamas (NAGB), its partner in a major exhibition this year, which said the council had caused “distress and disappointment” after distancing itself from an accompanying catalogue over unstated concerns about its “political” content. Artists and collaborators in the project have gone further, voicing allegations of censorship and saying they were left feeling “stunned and angry” while the gallery described it as a lost opportunity to foster goodwill in the wake of the Windrush revelations. Ironically, the project in the Bahamas was the final phase of a British Council series called Difficult Conversations – reflecting on the UK’s involvement in the slave trade in the Caribbean. The controversy centres on a catalogue for a Bahamian show in which the work of local artists has been displayed this year alongside Scottish artist Graham Fagen’s video installation re-working the Robert Burns song the Slave’s Lament. It was commissioned by the British Council for the 2015 Venice Biennale. But according to the NAGB, the UK body took a unilateral decision weeks before publication to remove its logo and texts from the document, while providing little or no little explanation for the decision other than to say that the material was “too political”. Officials in London are understood to have been particularly concerned about a section of an essay by Prof Ian Bethell-Bennett, a Bahamian academic, which deals with local concerns about the growth of Chinese influence in the Caribbean state saying: “As Downtown Nassau falls into China’s lap.” The British Council has faced accusations of censorship in the past over its anxiety about offending the Chinese government, which has been described as “a chill on artistic freedom”. Following the British Council’s removal of the texts and its logo, the NAGB moved last month to ensure that the catalogue and all of the essays would be published, saying it would be naive to expect the conversation or writings around the artworks would not be “uncomfortable, confrontational or provocative”. The gallery’s director, Amanda Coulson, has written to the council’s board saying artists and other collaborators had also accused the UK body of “fiercely editing their thoughts and voices”. “A general feeling of being silenced and exploited is the consensus,” she wrote. “How this looks from our viewpoint is that a white Scotsman is sanctioned to talk about slavery – and is considered courageous and daring, fêted at the most prestigious international art event – but black people should stay silent because their feelings are too raw, too aggressive, and too ‘political’,” added Coulson, who stressed that she and others were not criticising Fagen. “That the British Council feels that it is wise to distance itself from these voices at such a time, shows a remarkable lack of compassion, care or – frankly – a strategic PR plan.” Gemma Hollington, the British Council’s head of exhibitions, said: “Firstly we want to extend our apologies. It’s clear that the artists feel upset by how we’ve approached this and we genuinely regret that.” “With hindsight, we could have handled this differently. From our perspective, the process was not us unilaterally telling them what to do, but working to make sure the essays were published in full while not affecting our non-political status. We continued to discuss with the NAGB throughout, and are still regularly in contact.” Fagen told the Guardian he had not been given a clear explanation by the British Council. “The decision they made was for political reasons but my view of it is that they have actually made it political by taking their logo off it,” he said. Overall though, he believed that there had been a positive response in the Caribbean to the Slave’s Lament, which originated from his desire to open up the legacy of Scotland’s relations with the slave trade and the “deliberate or naive forgetfulness” around it.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/british-council-accused-of-censorship-over-bahamas-exhibition,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/01/british-council-accused-of-censorship-over-bahamas-exhibition
2018-07-01T14:00:41Z,world,World news,The mega mural movement: how India’s rundown railway stations have been transformed,"In India, 23 million people travel on the railways every day, and the stations are full of life. The poorer passengers don’t just pass through the stations – they sleep in them, cook meals on kerosene stoves, eat and wash on the platforms as they wait for unconscionably delayed trains. As a result, many Indian stations have become a microcosm of the squalor that afflicts much of the urban landscape. But all that is changing. There are now 80 stations (and some metro stations) across India where every inch throbs with colour and imagery. Indians who would normally never enter an art gallery now encounter new art by local artists or traditional art forms that had been threatened with extinction on a daily basis.
The movement began in 2014, when conservationist and tiger expert Valmik Thapar wondered why Sawai Madhopur station, which is close to Ranthambore national park, home of the tiger, couldn’t be decorated with tigers. Why couldn’t people visiting Bharatpur bird sanctuary get off the train to be greeted with murals of birds? Why couldn’t the station at Bhubaneshwar, known for its crocodiles and Buddhist statues, reflect this heritage? Thapar contacted railway officials and, with the help of the World Wildlife Fund, the stations began to change. Tiger eyes now follow you through Sawai Madhopur station. With a few brushstrokes, a decrepit dump has become an open air, public art museum.
“I’ve been visiting Ranthambore for 30 years. The gorgeous artwork is the best thing that’s happened to the town,” says Hema Maira, a retired teacher from New Delhi who frequently travels to see the tigers. “The pictures capture the essence of the park and its most famous denizens.” The railways project is part of a wider street-art revolution instigated, in 2014, by a Mumbai group called St+art India Foundation that has transformed the old Sassoon Docks in Mumbai and the Lodhi Colony neighbourhood in New Delhi into the country’s first public art district. (Brigitte Macron, wife of the French president, made a point of touring it during a visit in March.)
“What we have been attempting to achieve is a freedom meant not just for the artists, who stand to gain a wider canvas, but also for those who would be able to appreciate art they might never have had access to otherwise,” says St+art co-founder and creative director Hanif Kureshi. Ordinary people are often shocked by the size and scale of the murals, which include a massive image of Mahatma Gandhi on the facade of Churchgate station in Mumbai. “They think it’s an ad and some fool forgot to put the company logo on it,” says Kureshi. Mumbai has one of the densest suburban networks in the world, with more than 7 million daily passengers, and 36 stations in the city have been given a makeover. In October, two NGOs, Mumbai First and Making a Difference, roped in 25,000 volunteers and artists from art schools to paint for seven days, with materials provided by paint companies.
Rajiv Choudhury, Indian Railways’ station development director, says that about 80 of the country’s 3,000 or more stations have now been spruced up in this fashion. “It is up to the local communities around the remaining ones to paint those too if they wish.” And across India, dying art forms have been revived. A technique known as phad – paintings on cloth depicting stories of local deities, with every inch densely covered – is all over Jodhpur station. Udaipur City station has revived images from the Mewar School of Art, an important school of miniature painting in the 17th and 18th centuries. Jaipur station has been painted with Jogi art, a tribal form that uses dots and lines. Ajmer showcases the calligraphy for which the city’s craftsmen are famous. At Madhubani railway station in Bihar (which used to be one of the dirtiest in India), tourists go to see the traditional Mithila scenes from mythological texts and folklore that now cover almost every inch of the building. As the craze spreads, local artists are now getting work from the owners of cafes and offices who feel that one brightly painted wall might be just what they need.
In fact, an unexpected result of the project is that the painted walls have drastically reduced the amount of littering and spitting. “People are reluctant to damage something nice,” says Choudhury.Veena Joshi, a marketing executive in Mumbai who travels by rail to work every day, said that Indians are starved of nice surroundings; 60% of Mumbai’s population, for example, lives in slums. “The moment I see the colours at Khar, it lifts my mood,” she says. “It’s a small thing, but with big impact.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/india-railway-stations-art-movement-makeover,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/01/india-railway-stations-art-movement-makeover
2018-07-01T13:38:21Z,world,World news,Two British climbers rescued from Pakistan mountain,"Pakistan’s air force has rescued two British climbers after an avalanche crushed their tent near the top of a mountain in northern Pakistan, killing the third member of the party. Bruce Normand and Timothy Miller raised the alarm on Saturday night after tumbling snow and ice trapped them 5,900 metres (19,400 ft) up Ultar Sar, a mid-size mountain in the Karakoram range that includes K2, the second-tallest mountain in the world, and spans the border of China, India and Pakistan. On Sunday, an army helicopter pilot flew the two men down to Gilgit heliport along with the body of Austrian Christian Huber. The British climbers suffered only minor injuries, Abdul Kharim, of tour operator Higher Ground Expeditions, told the Guardian. Asif Ghafoor, a spokesman for Pakistan’s army, tweeted: “Pakistan army pilots in a daring mission rescued three foreign mountaineers stuck in snow avalanche at above 19,000 feet on Ultar Sar Peak near Hunza.”
Photographs from the rescue show a helicopter on a sliver of the mountain not much wider than its wingspan. Fifteen failed attempts were made to climb the 7,388 metre (24,239 ft) Ultar Sar in the 1980s and 1990s, causing a number of fatalities, until a Japanese team first reached the peak in 1996. The British high commissioner to Pakistan, Thomas Drew, tweeted his thanks to the military for a “a remarkable and dangerous rescue”. Pakistan’s military offers a rescue service to climbers who purchase insurance of around £7,000 before their trips, commandeering experienced pilots from their operations in the sensitive border region. In January, the rescue operation for two foreign climbers stranded on Nanga Parbat, dubbed “Killer Mountain”, was delayed as they had not agreed to the service, leaving well-wishers to crowdfund nearly $140,000 (£100,000) to pay for it. One of the pair died. The British Backpacker Society named Pakistan its top travel destination in 2018 thanks to “mountain scenery that is beyond anyone’s wildest imagination” and mountain tour operators have seen a surge of bookings.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/two-british-climbers-rescued-from-pakistan-mountain,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/01/two-british-climbers-rescued-from-pakistan-mountain
2018-07-01T13:36:59Z,world,World news,Thousands attend Simone Veil's burial in Paris Panthéon,"Thousands gathered in Paris on Sunday to pay tribute to Simone Veil, the Holocaust survivor and women’s rights defender, as she was given the rare honour of a burial at the Panthéon, the resting place of France’s greats. Crowds applauded and some wore “merci Simone” images to mark the opening up of the male-dominated secular mausoleum of heroes of French nationhood to a modern woman who was also a symbol of the deportation of Jews during the second world war. Veil, who became one of France’s most revered politicians and a president of the European parliament, was known for her battle as health minister to legalise contraception and abortion in France in the face of bitter opposition. She also secured improved rights for prisoners and children in the care system. On the European stage, she continually pushed for an inclusive European Union as a way of never reliving the horrors of the past.
After her death last year, hundreds of thousands of people signed petitions to have Veil’s remains transferred to the Panthéon. Veil is only the fourth woman to be honoured in her own right among the 72 men in the imposing building, over the door of which is written “The nation thanks its great men”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, in a speech on the Panthéon’s steps, said Veil’s burial there marked the entry “of generation of women who made France without the nation ever giving them the recognition or freedom that was due to them. Today, through her, justice is done for all of them.” He said Veil’s place in the Panthéon also marked the memory of the Jews deported and sent to their deaths during the second world war: “In Simone Veil, at last the memory of those racial deportees, as she herself said, those 78,500 Jews and gypsies deported from France, enters [the Panthéon] and lives in this place.” Veil was 16 when she was arrested by the French Gestapo in Nice and deported along with family members to Auschwitz-Birkenau – her mother, father and brother were killed in the Holocaust. She was one of few survivors. On her left arm, Veil forever bore the mark of concentration camp number allocated to her, which one senior French official later mockingly told her resembled a cloakroom number. Macron said that number, 78651, was the mark of Veil’s “untouchable dignity”. He said: “It will be engraved on her sarcophagus, just as it was tattooed on her teenage skin.” Veil said it was her experiences in the Nazi concentration camps that made her a firm believer in the unification of Europe. “The fact that we have built Europe has reconciled me with the 20th century” despite living with the trauma of the Holocaust, she once said. The blue carpet lain out in front of the Panthéon was chosen as a colour of peace and of Europe. Veil’s husband, Antoine, a high-ranking civil servant who died in 2013, will be buried alongside her.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/thousands-pay-tribute-as-simone-veil-given-heros-burial-in-paris,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/01/thousands-pay-tribute-as-simone-veil-given-heros-burial-in-paris
2018-07-01T09:17:53Z,world,World news,Film-maker defends use of footage shot by al-Qaida terrorists,"A Bafta-winning film-maker has defended his decision to make a documentary using video footage taken by jihadist terrorists, saying the work humanises but does not glamorise. Path of Blood, which opens in cinemas next week, has no narrator or interviewees and relies solely on the raw footage filmed by the terrorists themselves as they plot to detonate car bombs in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. “People say ‘don’t give terrorists air time’, but what they should say is ‘understand these people’. Only by understanding the nature of their faith, the nature of their psychology will you be able to combat them,” said Jonathan Hacker. Hacker, who directed the 2006 documentary Britain’s First Suicide Bombers, spent more than a year piecing the film together after gaining access to 500 hours of al-Qaida videos, seized by Saudi military forces at a jihadist training camp in the desert. “It was a mammoth, mammoth task,” Hacker said. “The translating alone took five months because there was so much jargon, slang and thick accents.” Before being allowed access to the footage, Hacker said, he had to convince Saudi Arabia’s interior ministry that he could be trusted with the material. The ministry knew he planned to make a film, he said, but its concerns were about whether it could compromise security. Shot with jerky handheld cameras, the videos capture a band of terrorists as they prepare to launch suicide attacks at residential compounds, security bases and oil refineries in and around Riyadh. “You see that these terrorists are incredibly young, incredibly naive, many of them incredibly stupid, but all of them still capable of great evil,” said Hacker. Some of Path of Blood’s most haunting footage, which covers the years between 2003 and 2009, is mundane. Men playing football, doing wheelbarrow races in the desert, goofing around drinking coffee, yet only minutes later – in real time – getting into a vehicle, driving to a target and blowing themselves up. “If you put this stuff into a drama you wouldn’t believe it. You’d say that it’s not plausible, that it doesn’t make sense,” Hacker said. Organising the videos into a chronology of events was a painstaking task. But a narrative started to develop, Hacker said, after he obtained video recordings from Saudi security forces too. Their videos, filmed as a matter of protocol, captured the aftermath of the suicide bombings. They also showed “Muslim victims and Muslims fighting the terrorists, which was a counterbalance to the western-centric view”, Hacker said. Describing Path of Blood as a “study of evil” the film-maker admitted that some of the images made for uncomfortable viewing. In one of the film’s most disturbing scenes, the American hostage Paul Marshall Johnson is seen gagged, tied up and beaten – all while enduring a brutal interrogation. The film blacks out for a short period, but the sound is kept running as Johnson – who worked in Saudi Arabia as an engineer on Apache helicopters and was kidnapped in 2004 – is murdered. “I felt with this particular scene, what was important was the line of questioning. While it is unbearably painful it tells you a lot about their mindset,” said Hacker. “That’s part of the story, that’s part of what it means to understand who these terrorists were.” Hacker accepts there will be controversy over some of the scenes but insists that what we learn about the terrorists’ beliefs is of huge importance. He said the film showed “these patterns of behaviour – young, naive people looking for simple answers, the sense of camaraderie, the sense of belonging, and in that environment how the power-hungry and the psychotic win through and create environments for evil”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/film-maker-defends-use-of-footage-shot-by-al-qaida-terrorists,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/01/film-maker-defends-use-of-footage-shot-by-al-qaida-terrorists
2018-07-01T06:00:36Z,world,World news,Mexico election: voters head to polls as leftist Amlo expected to cruise to victory,"Millions of Mexicans will head to the polls on Sunday in a watershed election that is almost certain to see a silver-haired leftist who has vowed to take on the country’s corrupt ruling elite elected president of Latin America’s second largest economy. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the 64-year-old former mayor of Mexico City and a friend of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has put promises to eradicate corruption and fight poverty at the heart of his campaign and is expected to cruise to victory. The election comes against a backdrop of widespread exasperation with political sleaze and soaring violence, with Mexico on track to register its most violent year in recent history in 2018 with more than 13,000 murders already committed.
For months, polls have given López Obrador, or Amlo as most call him, a 20-point lead over his closest rival, a 39-year-old lawyer and yoga aficionado called Ricardo Anaya. “We can already affirm that Andrés Manuel López Obrador is the next president of the Republic,” Claudia Sheinbaum, a close Amlo ally tipped to become Mexico City’s next mayor, told jubilant fans at his final pre-election rally on Wednesday night. “I am convinced we are standing at the gates of a new era.” About 100,000 lopezobradoristas had reportedly packed Mexico City’s Azteca Stadium for the rock concert-style jamboree – the final act in a punishing six-month campaign that has seen Amlo repeatedly crisscross Mexico with his promises to wipe out corruption and pump the recovered funds into social projects. “[Corruption] is the main cause of social inequality and economic inequality – and insecurity and violence also stem from corruption,” Amlo, who is making his third bid for the presidency, said in his eve-of-election address. “We will get rid of this corruption, this cancer, that is destroying this country.” Outside, street hawkers peddled T-shirts and trinkets emblazoned with the image and the gospel of a man who followers describe in quasi-religious terms and detractors dismiss as Mexico’s populist “tropical messiah”. “Peace and tranquility are the fruits of justice,” said an Amlo quotation stamped on to one mug. Another carried more words of wisdom from Mexico’s likely next president: “Outside the law, nothing; above the law, nobody.” “It’s so exciting to know that someone is going to change our Mexico,” enthused Esmeralda de Jesús, a 21-year-old campaign volunteer who was among the crowds. “I believe in his project. I believe he can change the country. That’s why I’m with Amlo.” Martí Batres, the president of Amlo’s party, Morena, in Mexico City, compared the coming sea change to the dawn of the welfare state in 1940s Britain. “It is a historic moment. This is the culmination of so many years of history.” Once sworn in as president, in December, Batres said Amlo would immediately act to pacify the country and help the poor by starting to build Mexico’s very own welfare state.
Amlo’s rise has appalled Mexico’s political establishment which – contrary to the views of most analysts – paints him as a Hugo Chávez-style autocrat-in-waiting set to cripple the country’s economy. At his last campaign assembly, Anaya told supporters: “This Sunday the future of our country is quite literally at stake – the future of a whole generation.” As well as the presidency, more than 3,000 elected offices are up for grabs on Sunday when more than 156,000 polling stations open at 8am on Sunday. Voters will also pick 128 new senators, 500 members of the lower house, nine governors and nearly a thousand local representatives. Alan Riding, a veteran chronicler of Mexican society and politics, said he sensed the country was on the verge of a epochal shift similar to that witnessed in Brazil with the 2002 election of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. “I think something has to be shaken up or else you are just going to have [six] more years of violence, corruption, minimal growth and unhappy people,” he said. “When you think what people have been through in Mexico, the notion of some saviour coming along is rather appealing,” Riding added. “If you don’t think too much about it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/mexico-election-vote-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/01/mexico-election-vote-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador
2018-07-01T05:44:31Z,world,World news,Family portraits give glimpse into Napoleon’s intimate life,"From minor Corsican noble and artillery officer to statesman and military leader, Napoleon Bonaparte’s many incarnations continue to fascinate historians and the public. Now, a rarely seen collection of miniature portraits of Bonaparte and his family could reveal a more intimate side to the warmongering emperor. The items are among 44 lots, still held directly by Bonaparte descendants and estimated to be worth just under £1m, to be auctioned in Sotheby’s annual Treasures sale of decorative arts in London. Henry House, head of furniture and decorative arts at Sotheby’s, described the miniatures as a family album from an era before photographs. “These are intimate personal portraits that have been passed on within the family,” he said. “We see Napoleon’s father, mother, brothers and sisters, and in-laws; it’s a remarkable group of items being presented at the same time. These portraits are how they see themselves in the family, rather than how they want to be presented to the public.” Most of the well-known portraits of Bonaparte and his entourage were propaganda tools aimed at establishing the family as a hereditary dynasty along the lines of the Bourbon kings, overthrown by the French Revolution. House says there is an enduring fascination for the man nicknamed Boney by the English: “He was a pretty amazing man who came to France as an immigrant, became emperor and had an incredible dynasty that stretched across Europe. There’s an enduring mystery and romanticism about Napoleon, similar to that of a rock or film star who dies young.” Bonaparte was taken prisoner by the British, with whom he had sought asylum after the French turned against him following his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815, and sent to the remote south Atlantic island of St Helena. Among the personal effects he took with him were a collection of 33 mainly tortoiseshell snuff boxes, many set with portraits of close family members. Two being sold this week portray Bonaparte’s father, Carlo Maria Buonaparte, a descendent of minor Tuscan nobility who had moved to Corsica, and his mother Maria Letizia Bonaparte. Another snuff box bearing Bonaparte’s portrait was given to General Henri Bertrand, one of his most trusted aides, who joined him in exile on St Helena and was at his deathbed there on 5 May 1821.
Among the most exciting items going under the hammer, says House, is a gold-mounted tortoiseshell snuff box with a portrait of the Empress Joséphine wearing a gold chain hung with an even more miniature portrait of Napoleon (estimate: £80,000-£100,000). She is depicted holding a letter dated 2 December 1806, announcing his victory at Austerlitz, which she had supposedly just received. Another small box from Joséphine’s collection shows portraits of her two children, Eugène and Hortense, from her first marriage to Alexandre, vicomte de Beauharnais, who was guillotined during the revolution. Despite having no blood links with Eugène, Napoleon considered him the most capable of his relatives and formally adopted him, sending him off to command the army of Italy and naming him viceroy. Hortense married Bonaparte’s brother Louis, king of Holland, and was the mother of Napoleon III, also known as Prince Louis Napoleon. Living in different European countries and separated from their mother, they remained close to her and mediated on several occasions in Joséphine and Napoleon’s tempestuous relationship.
Sotheby’s says the items come directly from descendants of the Bonaparte family but the seller wishes to remain anonymous. They are believed to have been passed down via Eugénie de Montijo, the last French Empress, who was married to Bonaparte’s nephew, Napoleon III. The couple spent their last years in Britain. An exhibition on until November at the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Arras, France, called Napoleon: Images of the legend, features more than 160 works from the chateau at Versailles. It includes one of several versions of the most famous Napoleon painting, showing him on a rearing horse, called Bonaparte Crossing the Alps by French artist Jacques-Louis David.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/napoleon-rock-star-portraits-for-sale,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/01/napoleon-rock-star-portraits-for-sale
2018-07-01T05:00:34Z,world,World news,EU’s new refugee policy under fire as children stuck in limbo in Niger | Ruth Maclean,"Stop people in Africa, before they get anywhere near the Mediterranean, and sort them into refugees and migrants there, only allowing the refugees to continue to Europe. This was the big idea that came out of last week’s EU migration summit. But campaigners say the predicament of 260 children stuck in limbo in Niger demonstrates that there is no guarantee EU countries would eventually take the refugees, even if African countries agreed to this arrangement. In November, amid horrific tales of Africans being enslaved, imprisoned and tortured in Libya, Niger agreed to act as a halfway house for refugees that UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, had identified and could get out.
Evacuated from detention camps in Libya, the unaccompanied minors are among 1,200 people waiting in Niger for resettlement. Mainly aged 14 to 17, they were all in detention, and most are deeply traumatised by the violence they experienced and witnessed there. But so far no country has agreed to take them. “In Europe we have been talking a lot about legal pathways,” said UNHCR’s representative in Niger, Alessandra Morelli. “If we want to combat trafficking, if people in need of international protection, who fit the profile of asylum seekers, get out of that flow, I have to offer an alternative. Otherwise, what are we talking about here? But when I take them out I have no alternative. You see? This is our fight.” About 54,000 refugees and asylum seekers have been identified in Libya, but no more can leave until the 1,200 in Niger have been processed. As Europe argues about how to stop people arriving on its shores, migrants continue to die at sea: at least three babies perished and 100 people were missing after the latest shipwreck off the coast of Libya on Friday. The inflatable boat sank after an explosion on board, and only 16 people were rescued by the Libyan coastguard, which had to abandon most of the bodies at sea “for lack of resources”, according to a coastguard captain who spoke to AFP.
The other African countries that Europe is looking at as possible hosts for screening centres are in no better a position. Niger is dealing with crises on multiple fronts and has hundreds of thousands of its own refugees and internally displaced people, who fled violence on the fragile Malian border and in Nigeria, where Boko Haram continues its bloody campaign. Rumours that people are being considered for resettlement in France in the Nigerien city of Agadez is one of the reasons 2,000 mostly Sudanese people have arrived in the past few months, hoping to be put on a flight to Europe. Many of them sleep on the sand, with a thin piece of cloth as a roof between them and heavy rains that have just begun, and the constant threat of snakes and scorpions. Some come from Libya, others from long-term refugee camps in Chad.
“Libyans came and took our money and said they would kill us,” said 17-year-old Ayat Abdallah, who used to dream of being a doctor. In Agadez, she spent her days teaching younger children to write, using her finger and the sand.With tension building between the Sudanese and the local population, Niger rounded up more than 100 of the refugees, including some minors, and dumped them on the Libyan border. “Libya is not safe; here is not safe,” said Tom Ahmed, who was caught by unknown men in Libya and imprisoned for six months while they tried to extract money from him with regular beatings. Three of his friends were among those dropped off in the desert.Morelli said that the idea that the Sudanese had been attracted to Agadez by the hope that they would be chosen to go to France was a simplistic narrative that didn’t take into account, for instance, the chaos in southern Libya. “To say that UNHCR has modified the migration route is a bit too much,” she said. One aspect of the migration deal reached on Friday looked to fall apart before it had even begun: four European countries – Austria, France, Germany and Italy – said they would not open “controlled centres” to assess asylum claims of people who had been rescued from the Mediterranean. At the same time they are asking some of the world’s poorest and least secure countries to do what Europe will not.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/refugees-niger-africa-eu-summit-border-policy-migrant-children,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/01/refugees-niger-africa-eu-summit-border-policy-migrant-children
2018-07-01T02:26:46Z,world,World news,MH370: memorial to the missing is put on hold,"Plans to build a memorial to missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have been put on hold until after the wreck is found. The Australian and Western Australian governments committed to build a memorial in Perth in 2014 and had already put the $126,000 project out to tender. But the WA premier, Mark McGowan, said he and the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, had decided that building a memorial before the plane was found was insensitive.
“This is a complex and highly sensitive matter, and the wellbeing of the relatives of those missing has always been our number one priority,” McGowan said in a statement. “While some relatives were supportive of the memorial, others had concerns. It was decided in the best interests of all concerned not to proceed with the memorial at this point in time. “We are very confident, after consulting with the Australian relatives, that we have made the right call.” Danica Weeks, whose husband Paul Weeks was one of the 239 people on board the Boeing 777 when it disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March 2014, told the Sunday Times in Perth that she opposed the memorial. “When they find the plane, then we at least know where they are and we can make a decision about where to build a memorial that we can visit,” Weeks said. “We should not have wasted energy on this – that energy should have been spent on finding the plane.” The plane is believed to have gone down in the Indian Ocean, and the Australian, Malaysian, and Chinese governments have funded four years of searches. A $200m effort funded by the Malaysian government was called off in May, after five months of searching.
The transport minister, Anthony Loke, told reporters at the time he remained “ever hopeful” they would discover new information which might help direct the search, and “at some point in the future the aircraft will be located”. “We remain steadfast in our unwavering commitments to solving the mystery of MH370,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/mh370-memorial-to-the-missing-is-put-on-hold,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/01/mh370-memorial-to-the-missing-is-put-on-hold
2018-06-30T22:42:16Z,world,World news,Protesters march against Trump immigration policies – as it happened,"At the end of the day, on the east coast at least, we are closing this blog. Here’s a summary of the key events in a hot day of protests against Donald Trump and his hardline immigration policy.
From New York City and Washington DC to Los Angeles and San Francisco, and in hundreds of cities and towns in between, thousands of Americans protested on Saturday against Trump administration policies that separated more than 2,000 undocumented immigrant children from their families and have left the vast majority of such children still held in federal facilities. No official figures for the protests were immediately available, but organizers said they had expected more than 750 events to be held. Protesters said they were concerned about many issues, but one message – as intended by organizers – rose above all others: Families Belong Together. The protests happened despite oppressive heat. In some cities, the heat index topped 105F (40C). Celebrities also came out to rallies to voice their opposition to Trump and his policies, including the singer Alicia Keys, playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda, actress America Ferrera, singer John Legend and many more. Progressive politicians, among them some potential Democratic candidates for the 2020 presidential nomination, joined protesters and addressed the various crowds. Their main message was simple: vote. With a high-stakes November midterm election approaching – one that could tip the balance of power in Washington – many high-profile politicians gave speeches, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Senator Kamala Harris and Representative Maxine Waters of California, and the Georgia congressman and civil rights movement veteran John Lewis, who spoke to a protest in Atlanta. Donald Trump, meanwhile, was at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. He was due to begin interviews of potential supreme court nominees.

2018-06-30T20:23:55Z,world,World news,Syria: southern towns surrender to Assad forces after thousands flee homes,"Several southern Syrian towns have surrendered to the forces of President Bashar al-Assad, after more than a week of fierce attacks forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. The United Nations says fighting has driven 160,000 people from their homes, towards borders with Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Both countries say they will not allow any Syrians to cross. Rebel fighters are trying to negotiate with Assad’s backer, Russia, as the opposition-held enclave in southern Daraa province rapidly shrinks under airstrikes and ground attacks, but say conditions offered are “hard to accept”.
Daraa is seen as the cradle of the Syrian uprising against Assad, which led to the seven-year civil war, so recapturing it would be both a strategic and propaganda victory for the government. Fighting, which began on 19 June, continued into Saturday, a second week of conflict that the UN’s Syria envoy has said could match the siege of Aleppo and last year’s assault on eastern Ghouta combined. The fighting in effect rips up a ceasefire agreed last year between Russia, the US and Jordan. It designated the area around Daraa as a “de-escalation zone” and Washington promised a strong response to any campaign that violated the agreement. However, US forces have not taken action to stop attacks, and opposition spokesman Ibrahim Jabawi accused them of having struck a “malicious deal” to stay silent.
Jabawi said rebel civilian and military officials held meetings with Russia to discuss surrender, but were offered terms they could not accept. Russia demanded the handover of weapons and said anyone who had borne arms would face trial. Since Russia joined the civil war in 2015, it has helped turn the tide of the conflict with decisive but often brutal interventions, condemned by international agencies, aid groups and human rights monitors. Government forces and their allies have repeatedly hit civilian targets including hospitals and schools, used chemical weapons and starvation sieges, in their battles to take over opposition-held areas around the country. Rebel-held areas have been slowly recaptured, and the south-west is one of just three remaining strongholds still outside government control, along with Idlib in the north-west, alongside territory held by Kurdish forces in the north-east. Even as the rebels negotiated with Russia for some limited protection from Syrian government troops, those forces were taking other towns in the area. Large parts of the rebel enclave has already fallen, and army advances near Daraa city could cut the opposition-held territory in two. State television said at least five towns had agreed to surrender and accept government rule, and one had already raised the national flag, news agencies reported. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says more than 100 civilians have been killed in airstrikes and shelling since the campaign around Daraa started. Tens of thousands of other civilians forced from their homes are gathered in extremely harsh conditions along the Jordanian and Israeli borders, some with tents but many sleeping in the open air. The fighting has been so intense that aid convoys across the border have been halted, Jan Egeland, a humanitarian adviser to the UN said this week, begging Jordan to reopen its border to those fleeing conflict. “I hesitate, in a way, to ask a small and poor county, who has more than a million Syrians on their soil, to take more,” he said. “But I have to do it, because these are women, children, civilians, who have no other place to flee if they are to escape the war zone.” Israel should also be asked to offer refuge, he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/30/syria-southern-towns-surrender-to-assad-forces,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/30/syria-southern-towns-surrender-to-assad-forces
2018-06-30T15:33:00Z,world,World news,France pays tribute to Simone Veil with hero’s burial in the Panthéon,"Simone Veil, the former minister and Holocaust survivor who led the battle to legalise abortion in France, will be buried in the Panthéon today with all the pomp and symbolism the French republic can muster. Veil’s death last year sparked a wave of emotion in France, with thousands signing a petition requesting she be buried in the secular mausoleum, the giant marble building in Paris’s Latin quarter which has become the final resting place for the country’s most illustrious citizens. Veil, who will be joined on her final journey by her husband Antoine, a high-ranking civil servant who died in 2013 after 67 years of marriage, will be only the fifth woman to be buried in the Panthéon. It was originally built in 1790 as a church to outdo St Peter’s Basilica in Rome and St Paul’s in London.Veil was 16 in March 1944 when she was arrested in Nice by the occupying German forces just days after passing her baccalaureat. She was deported with her family to the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau. They were later moved to a second camp at Bergen-Belsen, where Veil’s mother Yvonne died of typhus shortly before the camp’s liberation by British forces in April 1945. Her father and brother were last seen on a prisoner transport bound for Lithuania, but never returned. Simone and her sisters, Madeleine and Denise, survived the war, but Madeleine, the eldest, died in a car crash in the 1950s. Returning to France after the war, Veil studied law and political science at Sciences Po university and began campaigning for European reconciliation and women’s rights. In 1974 she won what many saw as her biggest political and personal victory by convincing the Assemblée Nationale to legalise abortion despite bitter opposition in what was at the time still a fundamentally Catholic country.
She served as a minister in several governments and was president of the European parliament between 1979 and 1982. She was repeatedly voted as one of the country’s most trusted and popular figures. Sunday’s interment is expected to feature many symbols of the EU – of which Veil was an unfailing supporter – and the Holocaust. The couple’s coffins, exhumed from Montparnasse cemetery last Friday, will be taken to the Panthéon from the Holocaust memorial in the city’s Jewish district in the Marais, where they were placed draped with tricolours to allow members of the public to pay tribute. They will be carried by members of the Republican Guard along Rue Soufflot on a blue carpet chosen by the presidential palace to represent “peace, the United Nations and Europe”, and will enter the Panthéon to the 1963 song Nuit et Brouillard by Jean Ferrat, a popular hymn to those persecuted for opposing the Nazi regime and victims of the concentration camps. Inside, the cortege will stop three times during which the choir will sing and films on Europe and the Holocaust will be shown. After an address by French president Emmanuel Macron, there will be a minute’s silence and a rendition of La Marseillaise. On Monday, the coffins of Veil and her husband will be placed in the crypt alongside other eminent French personalities said to have shaped the national identity, including François-Marie Arouet, known by his pen-name Voltaire, the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, Emile Zola and the celebrated French resistance hero Jean Moulin.
Out of more than 70 illustrious figures whose tombs are in the crypt, only four are female. The first was Sophie Berthelot, wife of the chemist Marcellin Berthelot, who was buried in 1907, but it was not until 1995 when Marie Curie’s remains were moved to the Panthéon that a woman was accepted in her own right. It took another 20 years before two more women were added: resistance fighters Germaine Tillion and Genevieve de Gaulle-Anthonioz, a niece of President Charles de Gaulle.About 1,000 guests will attend the ceremony, including former presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande. Five screens will relay the service to the public outside. At Veil’s state funeral last year, Macron said in his eulogy: “You brought into our lives that light that burned within you and that nobody could ever take away.” Last month, the Paris metro authorities named a station after her when the “Europe” stop became “Europe – Simone Veil”. Commemorative coins and postage stamps bearing Veil’s image will also go into circulation later this month.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/30/simone-veil-funeral-paris-pantheon,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/30/simone-veil-funeral-paris-pantheon
2018-06-30T11:20:39Z,world,World news,More than 700 anti-Trump protests planned across all 50 states,"Organizers of demonstrations expected to take place across all 50 states on Saturday are calling for Americans outraged by Donald Trump’s immigration policies and the prospect of a supreme court swinging sharply right to put aside party differences and protest with one voice. “This is an all hands on deck, stop the madness moment. It’s not a red or blue thing,” the national protest organizer, Ai-jen Poo, told the Guardian. More than 750 events are planned across the country on 30 June, under the slogan “Families belong together”, to protest against the separation of more than 2,000 children from their parents in recent weeks after they crossed the border without authorisation under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” crackdown. Poo said the protests were primarily for people who had been horrified at the news of the separations and detentions, but she said the cause would widen into a show of opposition against Trump’s travel ban, which targets five Muslim-majority countries and was upheld by the supreme court this week, as well as the threat of Trump nominating a hard-right conservative for the supreme court seat vacated by Justice Anthony Kennedy.
“What you are seeing is the downright refusal to accept this administration’s policies,” she said. With the Fourth of July holiday approaching “this is a time when we reflect on where we are as a country and, right now, what we are going to do to take it back as the multiracial democracy we know and deserve”, she added. Most children have not yet been reunited with their parents despite the president halting the summary separation policy and a judge this week ordering the administration to reunite families. The largest demonstration is planned for Washington DC, with many thousands expected to gather close to the White House, including Poo, who is a union leader and the director of the national domestic workers alliance, the Hamilton musical creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and other figures such as the actor and activist America Ferrera. There will be a rally addressed by a mother who was separated from her child by the border patrol. Mass protests are also expected in New York, Los Angeles, Seattle and other big cities. “But the beautiful thing about this day is that there are 10 events in Indiana, [vice-president] Mike Pence’s home state, protests in Lubbock, Texas, events in Alabama, rural Pennsylvania and many places like that,” Poo said.
She dubbed the administration’s immigration policy “zero humanity” and “a moral atrocity” and said the main thrusts of Saturday’s events were to demand that families be reunited, call for an end to “zero tolerance” and an end to immigration detention, even where families are kept together. Beyond the issue of family separations, the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced earlier this month that domestic or gang violence, which is rife in many parts of Central America and Mexico, will no longer be regarded as valid reasons for seeking asylum in the US. The union and the progressive advocacy body MoveOn are the principal organizers of Saturday’s events, along with more than 150 smaller groups across the country.
The Women’s March is also an event partner, and its organizer Linda Sarsour is taking part in the planned event in LA, fresh from rallying a mass sit-in over immigration at a US Senate building in Washington on Thursday, at which about 600 women were arrested. “We need a combination of direct action, mass mobilization and electoral power,” she told the Guardian.
Sarsour said plans for the demonstrations on Saturday had been given new impetus by the news last week that the supreme court had upheld Trump’s travel ban. That news was quickly followed by the announcement that Anthony Kennedy will retire, and is set to be replaced by a conservative, which presages heightened threats to legal abortion and to workers, gay rights and immigration rights. “I think news of the Kennedy retirement really shook people up,” she said. Asked if she thought many Trump voters might regret their choice as Republican politics shift further right, she said: “Absolutely.” “There’s an element of the GOP who are pro-choice women, and moderates who support marriage equality and who realize that on immigration issues, the supreme court will take us back years. The travel ban is rooted in Islamophobia, which the president himself spread during the election campaign,” she said. She urged maximum “grassroots energy” at Saturday’s protests, and throughout the summer and fall. “This administration is not to be trusted,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/trump-protests-saturday-family-separations-ice-abortions-roe-v-wade,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/trump-protests-saturday-family-separations-ice-abortions-roe-v-wade
2018-06-30T11:00:09Z,world,World news,Inside Tuscan: the other no-fly list Canada didn't tell you about,"In 2005, Rahinah Ibrahim, a Malaysian professor studying for a PhD in architecture in the US, was arrested in San Francisco while trying to board a plane. She was interrogated about ties to a terrorist group, her student visa was revoked, and her daughter, an American citizen, was forbidden to fly into the US. After the ordeal, Ibrahim successfully sued to have her name removed from the US no-fly list, one of the first persons in America to do so. But her Orwellian nightmare wasn’t over. It turned out that the FBI had also added her to a security screening list called Tuscan, which is shared with the Canadian government, and it wasn’t until 2014 that she finally had her name scrubbed from that.
The lawsuit, however, served as a smoking gun – a rare mention of a database that Canadian government officials have downplayed to the point of secrecy. Last week, the Guardian reported that Canada uses Tuscan, a vast repository of at least 680,000 names – 40% of which have “no recognized terrorist group affiliation” – to screen all travellers coming into Canada from anywhere in the world. Tuscan is generated and maintained entirely by the US, but if you’re included on the list you could be refused entry to Canada, or have your Canadian visa or immigration application denied. And, unlike Canada’s official no-fly list, Tuscan offers no clear process to remove your name if you think you have been added in error. Tuscan stands for “Tipoff US/Canada”, and dates back to 1997. Despite the fact that it has existed for two decades, there is scant mention of the program, or exactly what it does, by either government. An equivalent agreement with Australia, known as Tactics, is similarly cloaked in secrecy.
The revelations have put pressure on Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government to explain Tuscan’s significance. “It’s a sovereign Canadian decision what we do with that information,” Ralph Goodale, the security minister, said when questioned about it on television last week. “It is a source of data that is consulted to see if there are any alarm bells that should be going off.” The privacy commissioner, however, has raised concerns with Goodale that Tuscan infringes on civil liberties. Others are accusing Trudeau’s administration of hypocrisy for championing the transparency of its official no-fly list even while quietly relying on Tuscan. “Fine, Canada remains sovereign and gets to decide if it wants to use the information,” says Josh Paterson, executive director of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association. “But if it is using the information, and a Canadian never knows about it, can’t challenge and has no redress for it, doesn’t know where that report came from … then that is a significant problem for their human rights and due process rights.” ‘We’re not in control of the data’ The American database, according to the briefing notes obtained by the Guardian, is populated by information on individuals “known or suspected of being involved in terrorist activity”. Adding a name to the list can be as simple as filling out a form. Taking a name off, even if added in error, can be a lengthy court process that has been rarely successful. Canada can file a written request to the US to remove a name from the list – but the Americans are not obliged to comply.
Given the US record of adding people in error and of confusing similar names, civil liberty groups say they are concerned. “It’s hard to imagine how this is going to be exceptionally solid from a privacy perspective,” says Brenda McPhail, director of the privacy, technology and surveillance project at the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. “We’re not in control of the data.” McPhail says she has heard from Arab and Muslim Canadians who have experienced difficult in travelling despite having confirmed they are not on the no-fly list. “In hindsight, it sounds like they’re on [Tuscan],” she says. The privacy commissioner warned Goodale that the appeal process was insufficient and raised issue with the length of retention of sensitive information, according to documents obtained by the Canadian Press. A memo in response reportedly promised to “address the outstanding concerns that you have raised”. There is also a fear that, because the FBI officers of the Terrorist Screening Center update files directly, without external checks, faulty information could permeate widely. As the judge in Ibrahim’s case noted, “once derogatory information is posted to the [Terrorism Screening Database], it can propagate extensively through the government’s interlocking complex of databases, like a bad credit report that will never go away”. Derogatory indicators Despite the concerns, Trudeau has been working since 2016 to expand Tuscan behind closed doors, a process that has continued with the Trump administration. When the Tuscan agreement was first signed, in 1997, it was a very different program than it is now. The US database was managed through the state department and was primarily concerned with consular information; the original Tuscan and Tactics agreements were merely ways to export that list to Canadian and Australian counterparts.
Following 9/11, the US government began to consolidate its immigration and national security databases. As the final report of the 9/11 Commission noted, Tuscan was part of a program “which included a number of databases containing such derogatory information on individuals as prior visa refusals and federal arrest warrants”. Even then it was not, itself, grounds to arrest someone or deny their immigration or visa application. That soon changed with the creation of the Terrorist Screening Centre, housed within the FBI, which moved the data to a new Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (Tide) – which is now the the master list for the US government and its intelligence agencies. Tide comprises more than a million names. The records are reviewed and, if approved, added to the Terrorist Screening Centre database, which in turn populates a variety of other lists, including the US no-fly list; the “selectee list”, which includes those who do not meet the threshold for the no-fly list; Tactics and Tuscan. The memos obtained by the Guardian detail how border guards and immigration officials “utilize Tuscan information” to vet travellers, in Canada and abroad, and “to intercept and potentially apprehend or refuse entry to known or suspected terrorists”. Should a Canadian border guard get a hit, the Tuscan policy instructs them to delay the traveller until they can obtain more information from the screening centre. From there, the FBI can send on their passport details, citizenship and a unique identifying number in order to confirm their identity. Once their identity is confirmed, the FBI can provide “derogatory indicators”, which Canada can use to search and question the traveller. From Obama to Trump Tuscan became a priority for Trudeau after being elected prime minister in 2015, when he quickly set off to improve relations with Canada’s closest ally on a visit to Washington. There, he and Barack Obama extolled the virtues of improved border information-sharing. Obama told reporters at a joint press conference in the Rose Garden in March of 2016: “Today, we agreed to share more information – including with respect to our no-fly lists and full implementation of our entry/exit system – even as we uphold the privacy and civil liberties of our respective citizens.” The project – later dubbed the “Beyond the Border Action Plan” – committed both countries to “share information and intelligence in support of law enforcement and national security, respecting each country’s respective constitutional and legal frameworks”. Publicly, the Trudeau government said it would share entry and exit data for US citizens with the Americans: basic information on who crossed which border and when. Canada would also share its no-fly list with the US. Neither government mentioned Tuscan, but soon afterwards, Goodale authorized officials to begin formal negotiations with their American counterparts to update and expand it. The negotiations sought to vastly increase the information flow both ways. The FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center and the Canadian Border Service Agency (CBSA) would share more data on individuals, including details of interviews or searches conducted at the border. It would also empower the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Canada’s main spy agency, and Immigration Canada to pass on information to the TSC when there is a match on Tuscan. The election of Donald Trump caught Canada’s security officials by surprise, and Trump’s executive order barring travellers from several Muslim-majority countries threw Ottawa into crisis mode. For days, it was unclear if the ban would apply to Canadian citizens or green card holders, sowing confusion at the airports and borders. Nevertheless, Ottawa pushed ahead with its plans to update Tuscan under the Trump administration, with one June 2017 memo reporting that the “implementation of changes would take place into fall 2017”. A government spokesperson says both governments are continuing to “refine details” before the new program comes online. Paterson of the BC Civil Liberties Association says the deal smacks of hypocrisy. He notes that Goodale has embarked on a public consultation on national security, promising transparency and a review of the official no-fly list – even while staying silent about Tuscan, which has been functioning all along as a second, unofficial no-fly list. “It feels very much like the conversations we’ve been having with the government have been for show,” he says. “A distraction.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/30/canada-us-tuscan-database-no-fly-list-trudeau,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/30/canada-us-tuscan-database-no-fly-list-trudeau
2018-06-30T08:19:42Z,world,World news,Jamaica to boost security after murders of returning expats,"Police in Jamaica have pledged extra security for returning residents after the murder of five British and Canadian retirees on the Caribbean island. The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) said it would appoint a specialist liaison officer in each police division to monitor cases of returnees being targeted amid a pattern of violent incidents. The statement came hours after the Guardian reported a warning from senior Jamaican police officials that expats who returned to the island were seen as soft targets and were at “extreme risk” of being killed. Gayle and Charlie Anderson, aged 71 and 74, had recently retired to Jamaica from Manchester when they were fatally stabbed and their bodies burned in a firebomb attack at their home in Mount Pleasant.
The double murder in the Portland parish last Saturday followed the killing in April of 63-year-old Birmingham charity worker Delroy Walker and two Canadian pensioners in January. Selvin Hay, Jamaica’s deputy commissioner of police and head of crime, said on Saturday: “Our focus on the safety and protection of our returning residents is unequivocal. We take all reported incidents of crimes against them seriously and will further our work with our partners in government and non-government organisations to ensure communities are safe spaces for all who live, work or visit.” The JCF said it would review all serious unsolved crimes against the approximately 30,000 returning residents on the island. As part of additional security measures, the force said it would establish a point of contact for the Jamaican diaspora in Britain, the US and Canada to raise concerns. A service would also be set up for police to conduct background checks on workers who returning residents may wish to employ. The force said: “The JCF is offering assurance to returning residents that their safety and security remains a high priority of the organisation, strategies and support systems are currently being bolstered for their protection. “This comes against the background of the recent incidents against returning residents and the concerns expressed by members of the diaspora to the commissioner, whilst in recent meetings in the United Kingdom.” The targeting of returning residents is not new, with criminals viewing them as wealthy and often naive about security in a country with one of the highest murder rates in the western hemisphere. Percival Latouche, the president of the Jamaica Association for the Resettlement of Returning Residents, said he believed more than 200 British, American and Canadian expats had been murdered in the country since 2000 and he had attended 165 funerals in that time. A Guardian analysis of government data has found that at least 85 British, American and Canadian nationals have been murdered in Jamaica since 2012. Of those, at least 30 were British and eight were murdered last year, the highest annual murder toll of Britons on the island in at least five years. In an average year, there are twice as many murders in Jamaica than in Britain, which has 20 times the population of the former. Last year, Jamaica recorded 1,616 murders, the highest in six years and equivalent to 31 a week, as the homicide rate rose by 20% in just 12 months. So far in 2018 there have been more than 600 killings, mainly linked to gang activity. Only 44% of homicides result in arrests.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/30/jamaica-to-boost-security-after-murders-of-returning-expats,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/30/jamaica-to-boost-security-after-murders-of-returning-expats
2018-06-30T06:30:03Z,world,World news,'We're in the abyss': how despair in Mexico set 'Amlo' on verge of presidency,"It’s a searing afternoon in Ecatepec, one of Mexico’s most violent and deprived cities, and thousands of followers have gathered under a vast white tarpaulin to hear their pathfinder rage against the machine. For the next hour Andrés Manuel López Obrador – or Amlo to his fans – will deliver a unyielding assault on the scoundrels, mafiosos and influence peddlers he claims have plundered Latin America’s second largest economy and plunged it into a cauldron of thievery, bloodshed and want.
“This official banditry is going to end!” the 64-year-old leftist will rail. “Zero corruption and zero impunity!” First, though, he must brush his hair. After pushing through a crush of adorers, López Obrador pauses at the foot of a scaffolding stage, plucks a chesnut-coloured comb from his pocket and calmly runs it through his silver mane. Then the Amlo show begins. “Viva México! Viva México! Viva México!” he shouts from the rostrum, thrusting both arms into the air. “It feels like a dream – but we are just a few days away from achieving the transformation of Mexico!” That transformation is almost certain to begin on Sunday when 88 million Mexicans head to the polls to pick their new president. Amlo, who is making his third run for the presidency, has towered above his rivals in the polls for months. “We’re 30 points ahead!” he boasted to the sea of supporters before him in Ecatepec, who responded with cries of: “Presidente! Presidente!” Experts say three interlinked crises – security, corruption and poverty – explain why López Obrador now stands on the cusp of the Mexican presidency, and nowhere are they more visible than in Ecatepec, a gritty, neglected conurbation that is just 30km (18 miles) from Mexico City’s chic central districts but feels like another world.
Ecatepec is Mexico’s most populous municipality and one of its most impoverised, with nearly 790,000 of its 1.8 million inhabitants living in poverty. It is also one of the most dangerous regions in an increasingly dangerous country where at least 200,000 people have been killed since a catastrophic “war on drugs” was launched just over a decade ago. “Environmental degradation, femicide, insecurity, car theft, extortion, kidnapping, the disappearance of women … Ecatepec is a microcosm that illustrates all of the country’s most serious problems,” said Azucena Cisneros, a local politician from Amlo’s party, Morena. “It’s an urban tragedy.” Amlo has built his campaign around pledges to eradicate corruption and rule for the poor. Among the devotees at his Ecatepec rally, many described him as the only man capable of saving them from a crime wave they blamed on venal politicians. A cry for help had been painted on to one banner next to the stage: “We are the most violent municipality! We have been robbed and ignored by these corrupt politicians! We deserve to live better lives! We are good people! That’s why Ecatepec is with you, Andrés Manuel!”
“It’s so terribly insecure,” complained Gaby Mejía, a 46-year-old primary school teacher. “My students are always coming up to me and saying: ‘Miss, did you hear about the shootout near my house? That they killed you-know-who?’” Mejía’s mother, Josefina, 74, nodded in agreement, recalling how she had recently been held up by group of armed car thieves. “We’re already in the abyss,” she said, describing Amlo as Mexico’s salvation: “He’s one of those men who is only born every 100 years.” Many describe Amlo’s rise as the result of a furious popular revolt against the two parties that have ruled Mexico since the end of one-party rule in 2000 – the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) and the National Action party (Pan) – and which are widely blamed for the current crises. “It’s a social-civic insurrection. It’s a collective awakening,” said Germán Rufino Contreras, a former federal deputy and Amlo supporter in Ecatepec. But Viridiana Ríos, an Ecatepec-born member of Democracia Deliberada, a collective of young leftist Mexican thinkers, said she believed despair better explained why voters were embracing Amlo and change. “I think it is just that a lot of people haven’t noticed we have created a country where a lot of people have nothing to lose.” Fifty-three million Mexicans live in poverty, Ríos pointed out: “It’s a humanitarian crisis.” “[Voting Amlo is] a gamble, and when you have nothing to lose you can gamble more riskily.”
Two days after Amlo’s triumphant rally, Cisneros and a group of Morena activists embarked on a pre-election march through some of Ecatepec’s most marginalized corners, places where many have shockingly little to lose. In Vivienda del Taxista, a rickety shanty built on a rubbish-strewn wasteland, she visited the home of Marisol Gutiérrez, a Morena campaigner and seamstress who supports her daughter and two grandchildren on an income of about 600 pesos (£22) a week. “It’s not enough. But … the truth is, there’s no work,” Gutiérrez said, showing off her family’s battered stone-and-asbestos abode which had a bullet hole in its roof and had been built directly under a transmission line.
On one moldy wall hung a photograph of Gutiérrez’s son, Geovanni, who killed himself in 2016 aged 20. On another, a portrait of Jesus carried the phrase: “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.” In the hovel nextdoor Enrique Hernández, a semi-retired rickshaw driver from Oaxaca state, said he also planned to vote Amlo: “More than anything because we all have the right to an opportunity in life.” Cisneros’s next stop was La Cuesta, a tumbledown slum cobbled together from cardboard, wooden crates and repurposed advertising hoardings above a natural gas pipeline. “It’s a timebomb,” said Arnulfo Reyes Lara, a social worker who fights to keep the community’s kids off drugs and off the streets. At every turn, Cisneros was bombarded with tales of deprivation and crime.
Odilia Allende, 55, told of how her son had been murdered just a few streets away. “They shot him in the head … These are people with a future, with a reason to live and it’s not fair that the druggies just take their lives when they are on their way to work.” Juan Juárez, a 51-year-old mecanic, described how criminals had beaten his brother to within an inch of his life: “They had to put a titanium plate in his face,” he said, adding: “These days when we go out we feel fear. We need change.” Finally, a sobbing mother approached Cisneros to recount how her daughter had been abducted and raped before she somehow managed to escape alive. “How long ago?” Cisneros asked. “Five days,” the woman replied, breaking down into tears. “It hurts. It still hurts. I try to be strong. I know we have to go on.” “You will get through it,” Cisneros replied, and hugged her. After each heartbreaking petition, Cisneros grabbed her loud-hailer and marched on through the community, imploring locals to vote for change. “Es urgente un cambio en este país!” she shouted. “This country urgently needs change!” Additional reporting by Hernán Sarquis",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/30/amlo-mexico-election-president-how-despair-fueled-campaign,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/30/amlo-mexico-election-president-how-despair-fueled-campaign

Of those who got in touch with Safe in June, 83% were female and 17% male. The age groups of those most frequently in contact were teenagers, followed by callers in the 40-44 age bracket.
Māori make up 27% of callers, and the majority of reports to the service were related to historical cases of sexual harm of a “significant” nature; meaning abuse or rape. Safe had received a small amount of communication relating to pornography or inappropriate web behaviours. “The majority of people still contact us over the phone, but we also get really high contact on web chats as well, then text, then email is the least popular method of reaching out,” said Dylan Norton, development manager for mental health and addictions at the National Telehealth Service, which operates Safe. “Where we identify there is immediate, imminent harm occurring, that’s when we have processes where we may have to ‘break glass’ [break confidentiality] to keep that person safe. If there was a situation where a young person was being raped, then we’d be telling someone such as the police to intervene if we didn’t have any other avenues.” Phone calls to the hotline are not recorded, said Norton, but web chats, texts and emails are. According to statistics from the ministry of health, one is three girls in New Zealand will experience an unwanted sexual experience by age 16, and one in seven boys. One in five adult women report an experience of sexual assault, and the incidents of reported sexual violence are twice as high for Māori women and girls than Pakeha [European].
Statistically, young people aged 16-24 are at the highest risk of sexual violence in the country, which has one of the highest rates of sexual abuse in the OECD. Kyla Rayner, agency manager at Wellington Rape Crisis, said Safe was a valuable resource for people who were not yet ready to seek face-to-face help, or where it was impossible to access specialised services if living in remote or rural areas. “This is a large volume of calls and we are not surprised, given the prevalence of sexual violence in New Zealand along with the current climate, [and] with the impact of the #metoo movement,” said Rayner. “The large volume of calls through Safe to talk also has a direct impact on local specialist services ... we are seeing high demand for services across the sector.” Both Rayner and Norton said they expected the number of calls to the hotline to increase, and hoped demographic groups that were far less likely to seek help, such as men and boys, would find the helpline an easier option for seeking assistance.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/30/new-zealand-majority-of-callers-to-new-sexual-harm-helpline-are-teenage-girls,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/30/new-zealand-majority-of-callers-to-new-sexual-harm-helpline-are-teenage-girls
2018-06-30T04:00:00Z,world,World news,"Brexit will strengthen Ireland-US relations, says Irish ambassador","Brexit is likely to lead to a strengthening of the US-Irish bond and the emergence of Ireland as the main bridge between the US and Europe, Dublin’s ambassador to Washington DC has predicted. The UK’s departure would leave Ireland as the only predominantly English-speaking EU member, and a natural destination for US investors looking for a European base because of Ireland’s longstanding “special relationship” with Washington, Daniel Mulhall said. Mulhall, a former Irish ambassador to the UK, said he found anxiety over Brexit had accompanied him from London to Washington. “Since I arrived here last August, I’ve found that I’ve been asked about Brexit more often than anything else that I’ve had to deal with,” Mulhall said, adding that the greatest concerns he encountered were about the nature of the post-Brexit border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and the impact of a hardened border on the Good Friday peace agreement. The ambassador stressed that Ireland had no desire to take things away from Britain but would have little choice but to counterbalance the negative impact of Brexit by taking advantage of the upsides. He listed the two main benefits brought to US-Irish relations by Brexit as Ireland’s greater appeal as a destination for investment, and an enhanced diplomatic role as Washington’s closest EU partner. There are already 700 US firms with investments in Ireland, according to Mulhall, who added: “In the future I would expect that US companies who feel a need to have a base within the European Union would see Ireland as a more attractive option because perhaps Britain may be less attractive on account of Brexit. “There’s also potential for greater political dialogue between our two countries [Ireland and the US] and especially in a context where Ireland will be the only English-speaking country and probably will be the country in the European Union after Brexit that has the closest and most intensive relationship with United States,” Mulhall said. “Certainly in terms of economic and cultural norms.” Ireland plans to open new diplomatic missions in the US and bolster existing missions as part of a plan announced by the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, to double the country’s global footprint by 2025. “We see ourselves as a global country, not so much an island behind an island at the edge of a continent, but rather an island at the centre of the world,” Varadkar told a Washington audience during a US visit in March, generally seen as a success in terms of developing a rapport with Donald Trump. Mulhall said the coming diplomatic expansion would “ensure that we take full advantage of the opportunities that exist in the United States”. More than 35 million Americans identify as having Irish heritage. The investments of 700 US companies in Ireland, employing 150,000 people, are balanced by those of roughly 500 Irish companies in the US, employing 100,000 Americans. Trade in goods and services is more or less equivalent in both directions. Those figures are dwarfed by the US-UK economic relationship, in which each country is the biggest investor in the other’s market, with UK companies spending $480bn (£340bn) in the US, and employing 1.1 million Americans.
Ireland is looking to take over the mantle as Washington’s leading European interlocutor at a time of high transatlantic tensions over trade and foreign policy, particularly in the Middle East. The Trump administration is threatening secondary sanctions against European companies doing business with Iran. It has slapped steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU, which has responded with retaliatory tariffs on a list of US-made goods including Levi’s jeans, Harley-Davidson motorcycles and bourbon whiskey. Ireland is most concerned about collateral damage caused by US sanctions against the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, who was on the board of the Rusal aluminium company. Rusal owns a processing plant employing 450 people in Limerick, catering for more than 30% of European demand. Deripaska resigned from Rusal’s board in May but it is not yet clear whether that will shield the Limerick plant from the damaging impact of US sanctions, which have been deferred until October. “We do still retain a concern about the long-term fate of the company, which we are determined to do everything in our power to assist,” Mulhall said. “We would share the view that’s pretty universal across the European Union that we need to make a special effort on both sides to avoid a downward movement of relations. We need to stand back and to recognise the things we have in common and to avoid becoming obsessed with the things that at the moment divide us.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/30/brexit-will-strengthen-ireland-us-relations-irish-ambassador-daniel-mulhall,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/30/brexit-will-strengthen-ireland-us-relations-irish-ambassador-daniel-mulhall
2018-06-30T01:39:38Z,world,World news,"North Korea still secretly enriching uranium, say US officials","North Korea has increased its production of enriched uranium for nuclear weapons at secret sites in recent months, contrary to Donald Trump’s claims that it was “no longer a nuclear threat”, according to a new report. NBC News quoted more than a dozen US officials familiar with the intelligence assessments. Coming soon after satellite images showed rapid improvements being made to a North Korean nuclear research facility at Yongbyon, the developments will make it harder for Trump to claim that his summit with Kim Jong-un in Singapore this month was a success. Neither of the concessions the US president claimed Kim had delivered – the destruction of a missile engine testing site, and the repatriation of the remains of US soldiers killed in the Korean war – has materialised so far.
Meanwhile Trump has already made a significant US concession: suspending joint exercises with South Korea that had been due to start in August. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is reported to be planning a trip to Pyongyang in early July to continue negotiations with the North Korean government, in the hope of persuading the regime to make specific commitments on nuclear disarmament. Over the past seven months the North Koreans have conducted no new missile or nuclear tests. But NBC quoted a US official briefed on the latest intelligence as saying that uranium enrichment had been stepped up. “There’s no evidence that they are decreasing stockpiles, or that they have stopped their production,” the official said. “There is absolutely unequivocal evidence that they are trying to deceive the US.” It has long been suspected that the North Koreans have established a uranium enrichment plant in at least one secret site apart from Yongbyon complex. “There are lots of things that we know that North Korea has tried to hide from us for a long time,” a US intelligence official told NBC. The joint statement signed by Trump and Kim in Singapore was vaguely worded. Kim promised “complete denuclearisation” but that has been Pyongyang’s theoretical policy since 1992, and the regime interprets it to mean a long-term mutual process in which the US would also disarm. Pompeo was due to start follow-on negotiations with the North Korean leadership within a week of the 12 June Singapore summit. But Pyongyang appears to have dragged its heels. The secretary of state is now hoping to visit Pyongyang during a trip to the far east in the second week of July, as first reported by the Financial Times. “There was a delay but I think he has now got the agreement to go,” said Victor Cha, a former director of Asian affairs at the National Security Council. “They have to put meat on the bones of the Singapore statement. Pompeo is under pressure to get something before August, when the exercises were going to start,” said Cha, now at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. It the visit goes ahead it is possible Kim would order the repatriation of the remains of between 100 and 200 US service personnel killed in the 1950-53 war, to coincide with Pompeo’s arrival. It is a gesture that US officials had been predicting would take place last week. Trump told a rally in Minnesota last week that the repatriation had already happened. “Pompeo needs to get the remains of the POWs and MIAs [missing in action] but it’s not enough,” Cha said, arguing the secretary of state would have to extract a concrete commitment on disarmament to live up to the administration’s claims for the Singapore summit.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/30/north-korea-still-secretly-enriching-uranium-say-us-officials,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/30/north-korea-still-secretly-enriching-uranium-say-us-officials
2018-06-30T00:35:54Z,world,World news,India's huge solar ambitions could push coal further into shade,"India says it intends to launch a tender for 100 gigawatts of solar power, 10 times the size of the current largest solar tender in the world – another Indian project scheduled to open for bids next month. But analysts have said the country has neither the infrastructure nor the energy demand to warrant installing so much solar capacity in one go, saying the announcement reflects the scale of India’s ambition to become a renewable energy leader.
It is one of several green power promises made by Delhi this month on the back of continually falling renewables prices, with implications for coal projects including the proposed Adani Group mine in Queensland, Australia. The Indian power minister RK Singh flagged the 100GW tender at an event in Delhi last week. While discussing a world record 10GW solar tender set to launch in July, Singh reportedly told the audience: “Now [we] will bring out a bid of one lakh megawatts which would also include solar manufacturing and storage.” One lakh refers to 100,000 in the south Asian numbering system, equivalent to 100GW. His office confirmed the plan to the Guardian but declined to provide further details other than that the tender would be launched “in the near future”. ‘Brilliant statement of intent’ The unscheduled announcement surprised some energy policy specialists who said it was unrealistic and unnecessary. “There are many, many operational constraints to the plan in terms of land availability, transmission connections, who’s going to buy and pay for those [transmission] towers, and so forth,” said Vinay Rustagi, the managing director of Bridge to India, a renewable energy consulting firm. “I don’t think a 100GW tender makes a lot of sense,” said Tim Buckley, a director at the pro-renewables Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, but adding he thought the plan was a “brilliant statement of intent”. Delhi announced this month it was raising its target for the amount of renewable energy capacity it plans to install by 2022 to more than 227GW. The previous target, already considered ambitious, was 175GW.
About 70GW have been installed so far and another 40 are under construction or being put out to tender, according to government data from June. Buckley said on current trends India was unlikely to reach the 227GW target, but said it was setting an aspirational goal to attract investment and develop the local industry. “The idea is, aim for the moon and you’ll hit the top of the tree,” he said. There are constraints on how fast additional capacity can be added, not least the fact that India simply does not need much more power. “India is not a hugely starved country in terms of power supply,” said Rustagi. “The growth in demand on the whole is pretty stable at 4% to 5%, and there is already enough capacity being added to the system to cater to this incremental demand.”
More than 200 million Indians still live without regular access to electricity. But Indians are among the lowest per capita users of electricity in the world, especially those being newly connected to the grid. “These are all relatively poor rural households with very little demand for power,” said Rustagi. “Even if all the 250 million-odd people without electricity got power in the next year, our analysis says power demand would grow by about an additional 1%.” He chalked up the government’s big energy promises to national polls looming next year. “The election is coming up in 2019 and they are facing various economic and industrial challenges,” he said. “I think it’s more a part of putting a very positive spin on messages.” Coal put in the shade At the beginning of the decade, India had planned to power its growth almost entirely using thermal coal, with about 600GW of coal power plant projects in the pipeline in 2010. Its plan spelled disaster for global efforts to keep warming below the two-degree target set by the Paris climate accords. But as the price of renewables has crashed, and the impact of fossil fuels on Indian air and water has become clearer, the country has sought to reinvent itself as a green energy leader.
“We have missed the first and second industrial revolutions,” Singh said at an event in Delhi on Friday. “We caught up with the digital revolution, but we need to lead this revolution towards clean energy and renewable energy.” India has shelved or cancelled nearly 550 thermal coal projects in the past seven years, Buckley said. More projects are likely to be cancelled as the price of renewables continues to fall: a report released by Bloomberg New Energy Finance last week estimated the cost of solar and wind in India was now 50% cheaper than coal. Singh said on Friday coal would remain a part of India’s energy mix because it was “a backbone” to the intermittent power provided by renewables. But researchers say the proportion of energy the country derives from coal will keep falling – and that diminishing demand can easily be met by Indian mines, raising questions about the need for new projects such as the proposed Carmichael mine in the Galilee Basin of Queensland, Australia. “The incremental demand for thermal power in India is very little,” Rustagi said. “I don’t see how it makes sense to undertake a huge international project like [the Carmichael mine] … when we have enough domestic coal available.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/30/indias-huge-solar-ambitions-could-push-coal-further-into-shade,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/30/indias-huge-solar-ambitions-could-push-coal-further-into-shade
2018-06-29T22:21:23Z,world,World news,Bring on England: Colombians believe their team will triumph,"Colombia does not really do quiet: the need for music, talk and laughter is too deeply ingrained in the national soul. But on Thursday morning its second city, Medellín, fell silent as if the soundtrack had been switched off. It flipped back on at 10.33am, as throaty roars, shrieks, squeals and cries of “Gol! Gol! Gol!” burst out in unison on every street in the city. Yerry Mina’s 74th-minute header against Senegal earned Colombia a place in the World Cup second round and now they face England in Moscow on Tuesday. Colombia celebrated with car horns, fireworks and a collective sense of relief. “The triumph wasn’t so much from a footballing aspect but because of the capacity to overcome adversity,” said Alexander Otálvaro, a member of the association of Colombian sports editors. Javier Villalba, a football fan from the Caribbean city of Barranquilla, said: “In Colombia, the national team is like a big family, everyone supports each other, so even though we have big stars they are not looking out for themselves, they are looking out for the team.” With the England game just days away, the belief that the team is stronger than its individuals is becoming central as the country prepares for the challenge without its hero, the boyish Bayern Munich playmaker James Rodríguez. For much of 2018, Colombians have been hanging on news alerts on Rodríguez, gripped by the saga of his faltering marriage to a model, Daniela Ospina, the sister of his Colombia teammate David Ospina, the Arsenal goalkeeper. Now, they are gripped by the latest reports from the physio room on the No 10’s persistent calf problems. Rodríguez seems likely to sit out the England match after hobbling off in the first half against Senegal. Despite the absence of Rodríguez and doubts over whether the team’s captain, Radamel Falcao, is past his best, most Colombian fans swing between cautiously optimistic and wildly optimistic over their chances of defeating England.
Among them is Gabriel Gómez Jaramillo, a midfielder in the legendary Colombia team that thrilled the world in the early 1990s with their outrageous talent and even more outrageous hair. “It will be difficult for both,” he said. “England have a lot of good players, but they are very young. Colombia has the experience, and that is so important.” Beating England for a place in the quarter-finals would equal Colombia’s best placing in the tournament, but World Cup success means much more. “The World Cup means the opportunity to show the world we are much more than they think we are,” said Villalba. “[It] is the chance to show our best face, to show there are a lot of warm, good people here and we are much more than the drug and violence problems that we have.” The lowest point in the nation’s footballing history came when player Andrés Escobar was murdered in Medellín days after turning the ball into his own net, thus contributing to the team’s elimination from the 1994 World Cup. However, while Colombia’s darkest times may be in the past, the present is still complicated. A peace deal with insurgents followed by a bitterly partisan presidential election two days before the first match has left the country divided like never before. The World Cup, while it lasts, erases those divisions, and keeping that going for just a bit longer could be the true reward for beating England.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/bring-on-england-colombians-believe-team-will-triumph,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/bring-on-england-colombians-believe-team-will-triumph
2018-06-29T18:13:54Z,world,World news,UN snubs Trump by rejecting US pick for migration agency,"United Nations member states have emphatically rejected the US candidate to lead the organisation’s migration agency, despite the risk of financial reprisals from the Trump administration.
Ken Isaacs finished a distant third in the last round of voting for the position of director general of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), a position that has been held by an American since the 1960s. The decisive vote appeared to be a response to Donald Trump’s policies on migration as well as the rejection of a candidate who had tweeted Islamophobic comments and cast doubt on climate change science. António Vitorino, a Portuguese Socialist party member who is close to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, was elected despite a determined and well-resourced campaign by the US mission to the UN. Welcoming Vitorino to the job, the UK’s ambassador to the UN, Karen Pierce, noted in a tweet: “This is one of the most important jobs for the UN and the world today.” The loss of such an important UN post reflects the latest in a long series of steps – some unintentional but most deliberate – by which the Trump administration is peeling away from multilateral institutions, agreements and diplomacy. In recent days it has emerged that Donald Trump severely disparaged Nato and the European Union, and reportedly told aides he wants to withdraw from the World Trade Organisation. The Trump administration could well retaliate by cutting funding for the IOM, for which the US is the biggest donor. Earlier this month it pulled out of the UN human rights council, which it said had ignored its calls for reform. In January, the US cut its funding for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, by more than half, as a punitive measure aimed at the Palestinian political leadership.
According to Mark Goldberg, editor of the UN Dispatch website, Isaacs’ campaign was probably lost before it began because of Trump’s policies, but the candidate’s views contributed to the scale of the defeat. “I would say the biggest blow came before Isaacs entered the race, when the Trump administration said it would leave negotiations on the Global Compact on Migration, which the head of the IOM would be expected to implement,” Goldberg said. “And there is the Trump position on migration, with the separation of children from their parents, which Isaacs hasn’t repudiated in any public way.” After he was nominated in February, past tweets came back to haunt Isaacs, who works for a Christian charity, Samaritan’s Purse.
“Islam is not peaceful,” he wrote in one, and called on Austria and Switzerland to build a wall in the Alps “to control their borders from refugees”. He also shared online conspiracy theories and claimed that climate change was a “hoax”. Isaacs has apologised for the anti-Islam tweet and insisted he believes in climate change. Jeremy Konyndyk, a former head of US foreign disaster assistance, said: “The defeat of the United States’ candidate, Ken Isaacs, is a sad statement on US global credibility.” Konyndyk, now senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, added: “Isaacs was a capable relief expert, but carried significant baggage due to offensive prior statements about refugees and migrants, and apparent climate denialism. “Putting forward a candidate with this profile was an unwise move by the Trump administration.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/un-trump-migration-agency-snub-nomination-rejected-iom,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/un-trump-migration-agency-snub-nomination-rejected-iom
2018-06-29T18:05:48Z,world,World news,"EU's migrant centres could breach human rights, say campaigners","Secure migrant processing camps that may be set up in Europe under a deal reached by EU leaders risk becoming de facto detention centres breaching basic human rights, campaigners have said. The summit’s vaguely-worded conclusions after marathon talks in Brussels gave no details of what the “controlled centres” would look like or which states might volunteer to host them, but diplomats said they could resemble “improved versions” of existing – and heavily criticised – EU “hotspots” set up in Greece and Italy.
“Rapid and secure processing” at the proposed EU-funded centres would allow economic migrants to be identified and returned home, the statement said, while those identified as “in need of international protection” would be resettled in EU states which agreed to take them “on the principle of solidarity”. Arrivals across the Mediterranean have fallen by more than 90% compared with 2015, but a political crisis has erupted across the bloc, with deep divisions emerging among member states about how to handle the problem. Steve Valdez-Symonds, the refugee and migrant rights programme director for Amnesty International, said the latest plan looked like “more of the same”. The proposals made the prospect of “lengthy and indefinite detention” look more likely, he said, in potential breach of EU and international law and the convention on human rights. Catherine Woollard, the secretary general of the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, said her organisation’s prime concern was that the centres could become permanent detention hubs, particularly for migrants whose asylum claims have been rejected but cannot be returned. “We would also be concerned about them possibly becoming magnets for smuggling and trafficking groups,” she said, adding that some potential host countries the EU might approach, such as Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia or Serbia, had “serious problems” with organised crime. Further issues, including ensuring refugees’ rights to legal assistance and appeal, could arise if the EU gets into the business of processing asylum claims under EU asylum law in countries outside the EU or trying to join. The European commission introduced its controversial hotspots – intended as hubs where arrivals in so-called frontline states would be fingerprinted, identified, registered and moved on – as part of an effort to streamline the reception of asylum seekers at the height of the 2015 migration crisis.
Ten centres, five in Italy and five in Greece, were opened, but EU member states failed to accept even a small fraction of the refugees they had pledged to take, so the centres rapidly turned into squalid, overcrowded camps. According to an official EU audit last year, migrants’ lives were plagued by a shocking lack of basic security, water, decent food, blankets and medical facilities. Sexual abuse and exploitation of the large numbers of unaccompanied minors in the camps was widespread, adding to concern about fundamental human rights violations including the deprivation of liberty. “In Greece, people have been held for a very long time, in terrible conditions, basically trapped and with no progress at all to resolve their asylum claim … or establish who is responsible for them,” Valdez-Symonds said. The Danish Refugee Council last year found evidence of a broad range of rights violations, including de facto detention. Humanitarian standards were branded appalling in some hotspots: the Moria camp in Lesbos, built to house 1,800 people, was holding 6,250 migrants and asylum seekers at one point, but only had one functioning latrine. Dunja Mijatović, the Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights, said on Friday after a five-day visit to Greece that the country must process asylum claims significantly faster and relocate asylum seekers from its islands, where many continue to live in cramped and dangerous conditions.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/eus-migrant-centres-could-breach-human-rights-say-campaigners,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/eus-migrant-centres-could-breach-human-rights-say-campaigners
2018-06-29T17:59:04Z,world,World news,Police study UK rendition report amid pressure to investigate,"Senior Scotland Yard officers are studying a parliamentary report that revealed the true scale of the UK’s involvement in torture and rendition after 9/11, as pressure mounts for a police investigation or judge-led inquiry. Parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC) recommended that police should consider investigating the role that an MI6 officer and a military interrogator played in the torture of detainees. However the committee’s investigation, chaired by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, detailed a mass of other human rights abuses, including 598 instances of UK intelligence officers being involved in torture, and 31 rendition operations that were either planned, agreed or financed by the UK. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: “The Metropolitan police service is aware of the publication of the intelligence and security committee’s report on detainee mistreatment and rendition and is reviewing its contents.” There were warnings from a former senior military lawyer that if any of the rendition operations were conducted during armed conflict, they would amount to war crimes – and that the international criminal court at The Hague might step in if the UK does not investigate. Lt Col Nicholas Mercer, who was the British army’s most senior army lawyer in Iraq after the 2003 invasion, said: “The revelations about the security services and others and their complicity in rendition and torture are deeply troubling for the government. “Where these offences took place within the context of an international armed conflict, they amount to war crimes, and if the British government fails to prosecute then The Hague is able to do so instead.” Meanwhile, senior Labour figures also began to call for an independent and judge-led inquiry into the human rights abuses, which all happened during the New Labour era.
They are angry that Theresa May prevented the ISC from questioning junior and middle-ranking MI6 and MI5 officers, which Grieve said had hampered his committee’s inquiry. The shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, said: “It is now clear from the published reports that the intelligence and security committee was denied access to individuals, severely limiting its ability to give as comprehensive a resolution to this scandal as it would have liked. “Its criticisms of ongoing inadequacies on guidance relating to torture and rendition also makes a judge-led inquiry – that the government is so keen to avoid – inescapable.” Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, said an inquiry would need to establish what those in the government at the time knew, including Tony Blair and the then foreign secretary, Jack Straw. He said he was concerned that May had prevented the ISC from interviewing key witnesses. Lewis, who was asked about torture and rendition on the BBC’s Question Time on Thursday, said on Friday: “If the investigation was hampered by Downing Street, we really do have to get to the bottom of this.” He added that the issue should go to a security-cleared judge. He said it was important to resolve, because the UK portrayed itself as a rules-based society and there were authoritarian countries around the world that would be looking at how the UK responded. “Straw has questions to answer. People will want to know who else in the cabinet knew and you know where that leads to. That is a legitimate question to ask. “No one is above the law. It is not about a witch-hunt of Tony Blair or Jack Straw. It is about getting to the truth.” The ISC investigation began more than four years ago after David Cameron, then prime minister, shut down a judge-led inquiry into the UK’s involvement in rendition and the mistreatment of terrorism suspects. The judge-led inquiry had been set up following a series of disclosures in the Guardian and the courts. In a second report, the ISC expressed concern that too few safeguards and policies were in place to prevent the UK from again becoming embroiled in human rights abuses. Grieve said: “We find it astonishing that, given the intense focus on this issue 10 years ago, the government has failed to take action. There is no clear policy, and not even agreement as to who has responsibility for preventing UK complicity in unlawful rendition.” Last month May issued a public apology to two victims of a UK-US-Libyan operation, Abdel Hakim Belhaj and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, who was pregnant when MI6 assisted in their kidnapping.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/police-study-uk-rendition-report-amid-pressure-to-investigate,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/police-study-uk-rendition-report-amid-pressure-to-investigate
2018-06-29T17:49:10Z,world,World news,UN report criticises use of facial recognition by Welsh police,"The use of facial recognition by police in south Wales during a peaceful demonstration has been criticised as disproportionate and unnecessary in a report by the UN special rapporteur on the right to privacy, Joseph Cannataci. He issued the interim report at the end of a two-week visit to the UK to investigate privacy rights. South Wales police began experimenting with facial recognition in June last year, deploying it at various public events, including sporting and music venues. The civil rights group Liberty is supporting a Cardiff resident, Ed Bridges, who wrote to the chief constable of South Wales police alleging he was tracked at a peaceful anti-arms protest and while out shopping.
In his report, Cannataci said concerns were expressed to him by civil society organisations that the use of facial recognition technology was not only violating privacy but may also have had a chilling effect on the fundamental right to association. He wrote: “In addition to the admitted lack of precision of the technology, I find it difficult to see how the deployment of a technology that would potentially allow the identification of each single participant in a peaceful demonstration could possibly pass the test of necessity and proportionality.” He recommended the government and police conduct strict privacy impact assessments before deployment, even as a pilot, of technologies potentially affecting the enjoyment of the right to privacy. A spokesman for South Wales police said it would respond in due course to the correspondence from Bridges and Liberty. He added: “The force has been very cognisant of concerns surrounding privacy and are confident that our approach is lawful and proportionate.”
The rapporteur, whose job was created in response to the disclosures of mass surveillance by Edward Snowden in 2013, produces individual country reports on levels of privacy around the world. He will give UK organisations mentioned in his report until September to respond. He will produce a final report in December for submission to the UN human rights council early in 2019. During his two weeks in the UK, he visited Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast and London, speaking to parliamentarians, officials, civil rights groups, members of the judiciary, MI6, MI5 and the surveillance agency GCHQ. Speaking at a press conference in London, Cannataci said there had been a marked improvement by the intelligence agencies on privacy rights since he described draft legislation on surveillance in 2015 as “worse than scary”. He described the creation of a new oversight body, the Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office (IPCO), as a significant improvement on what had existed before. However, he expressed concern the IPCO had the dual task of authorising surveillance requests by the intelligence agencies as well as being responsible for oversight of how that surveillance was carried out.“To many observers, and especially people outside the UK, the new law seems to create a situation whereby somebody is expected to be marking his own homework,” Cannataci said. Security minister Ben Wallace said: “We have some of the best police and security and intelligence officers in the world. They work day and night to keep us safe from terrorists, paedophiles and other criminals that have no regard for the law. “The special rapporteur’s overarching conclusions on the system of safeguards and oversight we introduced in the Investigatory Powers Act are welcome. “Through this ground breaking and world leading legislation, we have made sure those charged with protecting us have the powers they need to keep us safe but that these powers are used in a way that does not undermine our privacy.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/un-privacy-chief-criticises-use-of-facial-recognition-in-wales,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/un-privacy-chief-criticises-use-of-facial-recognition-in-wales
2018-06-29T17:22:09Z,world,World news,EU leaders defend migration deal as doubts emerge,"European Union leaders have defended a migration deal struck during talks in Brussels as doubts emerged about whether they would fulfil their promises to build secure centres for processing asylum claims of people rescued at sea. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said Europe had made “a step in the right direction” on migration as she prepared to return to Germany to meet her coalition partners ahead of Sunday’s deadline to find a solution to stop flows of asylum seekers arriving from southern Europe. Shortly before daybreak on Friday, EU leaders ended 10 hours of fraught talks on migration with a vague accord to set up “controlled centres” in Europe to assess asylum claims of people rescued in the Mediterranean.
The centrepiece of the deal is an unspecified promise for more EU countries to open “control centres” on a voluntary basis to process asylum claims. But Austria, France, Germany and Italy made clear they had no immediate plans to open secure centres on their soil. Asked if Austria would open a centre, the prime minister, Sebastian Kurz, said: “Of course not … we are not a first-arrival country, unless people jump with parachutes.” Nonetheless, Merkel said the overall agreement was more than she had envisaged before the summit and said she believed it surpassed demands laid down by her coalition partners. Her hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, had threatened to close Germany’s borders to migrants, sparking a dispute that some feared would bring down Merkel’s government. Merkel was due to brief Seehofer’s CSU party on Friday night about the EU deal, as well as about bilateral agreements she had struck with Spain and Greece, which will require the Mediterranean countries to take back asylum seekers who had arrived in their country first before moving on to Germany.
Under EU asylum rules, first-arrival countries are responsible for processing asylum claims, putting a disproportionate burden on southern states nearest north Africa and Turkey. Italy wants to tear up the first-country principle, but the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he did not want to change the rule, setting the stage for more confrontation over the overhaul of EU asylum rules, a process that has stalled after two years of talks. Central European countries claimed they had buried the idea of mandatory refugee quotas for all EU countries. “Now everyone has dropped the topic,” said the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, hailing that as a “a big success”. Donald Tusk, the European council president, told reporters in Brussels that it was “far too early to talk about a success”. Diplomats were left uneasy about the negotiating method of Italy’s new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, who pushed the summit to the brink of collapse by threatening to veto the entire summit communique, including unrelated parts on trade.
When Conte, according to a source, told his fellow leaders: “I am a law professor,” the Bulgarian prime minister, Boyko Borissov, replied: “Well, I used to be a fireman and this is not how you negotiate.” Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Löfven, added that he used to be a welder and he did not agree with the Italian’s way of making his point, either. Borissov described the Italian threat as “unpleasant” but conceded that leaders had at best reached a “fragile consensus that does not solve the whole problem”. Several EU leaders stressed they wanted to work with international agencies who were willing to set up migrant camps in north Africa to process asylum claims. However, a paper released by the UN agency for refugees and the International Organisation for Migration on Friday strikes a different tone. They called for “strong leadership from European Union member states on upholding the right to asylum and the rights of migrants”, while stressing that the EU could not outsource the problem. The agencies say they oppose closed detention centres.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/eu-leaders-defend-migration-deal-as-snag-emerges,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/eu-leaders-defend-migration-deal-as-snag-emerges
2018-06-29T17:07:02Z,world,World news,Unesco names three new world heritage sites,"Three new sites have been awarded world heritage status by Unesco, including a remote Kenyan settlement and an ancient city in Oman. The 42nd session of the World Heritage Committee made the announcement on Friday afternoon following a meeting in Bahrain.
The first to be named was Thimlich Ohinga in Kenya, north-west of the town of Migori. Unesco said the dry-stone walled settlement was probably built in the 16th century.
It said the settlement seems to have “served as a fort for communities and livestock, but also defined social entities and relationships linked to lineage” and was the “largest and best preserved of these traditional enclosures”. “It is an exceptional example of the tradition of massive dry-stone walled enclosures, typical of the first pastoral communities in the Lake Victoria Basin, which persisted until the mid-20th century,” it added. Also listed was the ancient walled city of Qalhat in Oman, located on the east coast of the sultanate.
Unesco said: “The city developed as a major port on the east coast of Arabia between the 11th and 15th centuries CE, during the reign of the Hormuz princes. Today it bears unique archaeological testimony to the trade links between the east coast of Arabia, east Africa, India, China and south-east Asia.” The last to be added on Friday was the Al-Ahsa oasis in Saudi Arabia, described as “an evolving cultural landscape in the eastern Arabian peninsula”.
Unesco described the Al-Ahsa Oasis as “a serial property comprising gardens, canals, springs, wells and a drainage lake, as well as historical buildings, urban fabric and archaeological sites.” It added: “They represent traces of continued human settlement in the Gulf region from the Neolithic to the present, as can be seen from remaining historic fortresses, mosques, wells, canals and other water management systems. With its 2.5m date palms, it is the largest oasis in the world. Al-Ahsa is also a unique geocultural landscape and an exceptional example of human interaction with the environment.” The committee will make decisions on dozens more nominated places over the weekend.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/unesco-names-three-new-world-heritage-sites,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/unesco-names-three-new-world-heritage-sites
2018-06-29T16:39:07Z,world,World news,Estonian president delights in country’s high proportion of unicorns,"The president of Estonia has called attention to her nation’s high proportion of unicorns, delighting Twitter users who have insisted on taking her at face value.
Kersti Kaljulaid, the president, tweeted to her 13,000 followers on Friday morning: “Estonia is 1.3million people and we have 4 unicorns. There are no other so small countries in the world with 4 unicorns today.”
As her subsequent tweets made clear, Kaljulaid was in fact referring to Estonia’s proliferation of successful tech companies as the European nation pushes itself as a destination for digital entrepreneurs and innovation. The term “unicorn” was coined in 2013 by venture capitalist Aileen Lee to refer to a privately owned business valued at over $1bn – but naturally Twitter took the opportunity for the joke. “You either sell them for trillions, or put them in the Tallinn zoo and tourists will flock to Estonia,” replied one user. Another simply asked: “Photo?” Estonia is widely known as the birthplace of Skype, one of its four unicorns, along with gambling software Playtech and the money transfer service TransferWise. The country’s youngest unicorn, the ride-hailing app Taxify, was born just one month ago when it closed $175m in funding from German giant Daimler. Taxify, which competes with Uber in Europe and Africa, is the only company of the four to be currently based in Estonia – but Markus Villig, its co-founder and CEO, told ERR News that it was unlikely to be its last unicorn. “The Estonian tech scene is evolving very rapidly, and we have great companies from many industries, all the way from engineering tools to financial services to transport,” Villig said. Kalijulaid expanded on her seeming non sequitur on Twitter by saying regulation of humans and algorithms was currently a priority for her government: “We just create legal space for this technology to come and thrive in the country.”
Estonia’s high proportion of tech startups, a cornerstone of its bid to establish itself as the “digital society” of “e-Estonia”, have been chalked up to its high level of technology penetration and education. Internet access is enshrined as a basic human right in the country, and it has the second-fastest public wifi in the world. Earlier this year it announced the first official visa for so-called “digital nomads”, entitling them to work in the country for 365 days – an attempt to attract talent from beyond Europe. It will be launched in January 2019.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/estonia-unicorns-president-kersti-kaljulaid-delight,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/estonia-unicorns-president-kersti-kaljulaid-delight
2018-06-29T16:31:48Z,world,World news,Memorial to murdered refugees unveiled in Bristol,"A memorial for two refugees who were murdered and mutilated in Bristol in separate attacks is to go on display in the city. Bijan Ebrahimi was killed in 2013 by a racist neighbour who mistakenly thought he was a paedophile, and Kamil Ahmad was stabbed to death three years later by a man who had subjected him to years of racist abuse. Family, friends and politicians gathered to pay tribute to the two men at the unveiling of an artwork based on a mural that Ahmad helped to design. It will be hung in City Hall, Bristol’s main municipal building. Bristol’s mayor, Marvin Rees, said the piece, which includes an image of Ahmad clutching his head in despair, would be a permanent reminder of what happened and the challenges the city and the UK faced in protecting people like the two men. Rees apologised to the families, saying: “I’m sorry on behalf of Bristol for what’s happened to your families. Kamil’s and Bijan’s lives mattered.” He added: “By putting the artwork on the walls of City Hall I hope it sends a message that their lives mattered.” The way the city council, police, housing and health authorities acted has been heavily criticised in reports on the two murders. Rees said: “We are not trying to sweep this under the carpet. We are committed to making sure we look at everything that happened and everything that didn’t happen.” Ahmad’s brother, Kamaran Ahmad Ali, said his sibling was killed by a “brutal and racist person”. But he said the failings of the authorities made it all the harder to bear and warned that more lives would be lost if practices were not reformed. “None of these organisations and institutions managed to protect Kamil’s life,” he said. “The pain and suffering will remain forever in our hearts.” As well as the despairing self-portrait, the artwork includes a picture of a person chained to a wheelchair and a blazing sun. Ahmad used to complain: the sun shines for some people; not for others. One of the organisers, Rebecca Yeo, met Ahmad when she brought together a group of asylum seekers with disabilities for an art project. His asylum application had been refused and he drew a picture of himself being attacked, explaining: “This is my heart that has been stabbed with a dagger. The Home Office did this. I am bleeding and no one can stop it.”
Yeo, a PhD student at Bath University, said: “This was four years before Kamil was murdered. He wasn’t predicting what he thought was going to happen, he was describing what he felt was already happening.” Relatives of Ebrahimi also attended the unveiling. Ebrahimi’s sister, Manizhah Moores, praised the artwork. “It was designed by Kamil but it describes what happened to my brother. You can see the similarity – the authorities did not listen to disabled people or people from other countries. It made them feel not part of society.” Ebrahimi sought sanctuary in the UK in 2000 and was given leave to remain but he was persecuted repeatedly by neighbours. His home was set on fire and boiling water was thrown over his head. He was called a “Paki” and a “cockroach” and told: “Go back to your own country.” In 2013, at the age of 44, he was punched and kicked to death by a neighbour, Lee James, who had thought he was a paedophile. James and another neighbour dragged Ebrahimi’s body to a green in front of his home, doused him with white spirit and set fire to him. A review by Safer Bristol concluded that Avon and Somerset police and Bristol city council wrongly perceived Ebrahimi as a troublemaker rather than a victim and sided with his white abusers. It concluded that there was “evidence of both discriminatory behaviour and institutional racism” on the part of the council and police”. Ahmad, a Kurdish man, arrived in the UK after being imprisoned and tortured in Iraq and had post traumatic stress disorder. He was refused asylum and was fighting the decision at the time of his death. Over three years he suffered racist abuse from a neighbour, Jeffrey Barry, who stabbed him to death in 2016 and mutilated his body by cutting off his penis. A safeguarding review criticised the way the police council and mental health professionals dealt with the case and said the killing of Ahmad, 48, was avoidable.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/memorial-to-murdered-refugees-unveiled-in-bristol,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/memorial-to-murdered-refugees-unveiled-in-bristol
2018-06-29T15:21:43Z,world,World news,World Cup plaudits cheer Putin as Russia revels in spotlight,"Vladimir Putin wore a broad smile when the US national security adviser, John Bolton, gave him an extra special compliment on Wednesday. “We are most appreciative of your courtesy and graciousness here and I look forward to learning how you handled the World Cup so successfully, among other things,” Bolton told Putin during a meeting at the Kremlin. A top US official at the Kremlin complimenting Putin’s World Cup as they arranged a summit with Donald Trump. Was this real life or just the Russian president’s fantasy? Could it have gone any better? Not really. Russia has hosted the World Cup it wanted and the hectic group stages have passed without major incident. The stadiums have held up, as has the transport infrastructure. Central Moscow has held boozy fan parties with a relaxed police presence and St Petersburg has sparkled. The Russians are cheerful. Even towns that lacked the proper hotel facilities, such as Saransk, were gripped by the unstoppable enthusiasm of fans from Peru and Colombia. The biggest scandal so far has been MPs and Russian broadsheets arguing over whether Russian women should sleep with foreigners. It is a case study in effective soft power. For those who may have associated Russia with the Soviet Union or a police state, the World Cup has been a pleasant tour through gleaming cities. It is quite possible that the memories will last a lifetime and create goodwill to offset critical reports about the country’s leadership or rights abuses. “What you can stop doing is publishing such rubbish about Russia,” one England fan, a lawyer in Moscow, told the Guardian after England’s 6-1 drubbing of Panama in Nizhny Novgorod. Of course, there are limits as to how far the magic will go. A Russian fan recently posted a video of a frank exchange with police. “When the World Cup is over will I be able to walk around here with a beer?” he asked. “Are you Russian? Then no,” the police officer responds. Everyone laughs, but the exchange has real bite. Yevgeny Roizman, a maverick politician from Ekaterinburg, said the world was not being given a full picture of what life was like in Russia. But since when was a World Cup a reflection of everyday life, he added. It was a prazdnik, a festival – a moment when a country puts on its best face to welcome the world. Russians still fondly recall the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, boycotted by much of the west but attended by the rest of the world, when Misha the cartoon bear shed a tear to bid the Games farewell.
This could have been the legacy of the Sochi Olympics of 2014, when even the gaffes such as the malfunctioning fifth ring in the opening ceremony were charming. But the legacy was overshadowed first by the annexation of Crimea and the war in south-east Ukraine, and later by the doping scandal said to affect more than 1,000 Russian athletes. Trump and Putin will meet on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the downing of MH17, a jetliner carrying 298 people over east Ukraine. The luck of the draw has helped keep politics at bay during the World Cup. Ukraine, the United States, and the Netherlands all failed to qualify, averting the kinds of confrontations that could have led to ugly scenes or boycotts. But the success is largely due to the immense resources and political will put into holding the tournament. Russia has put its best foot forward, and the effect has been compelling. The country has a unique ability to mobilise for these super-projects. Whether it is a World Cup or a bridge to annexed Crimea, the work gets done.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/world-cup-plaudits-cheer-putin-as-russia-revels-in-spotlight,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/world-cup-plaudits-cheer-putin-as-russia-revels-in-spotlight
2018-06-29T14:35:19Z,world,World news,"More Saddleworth-style fires likely as climate changes, scientists warn","Northern Europe should brace itself for more upland fires like the one on Saddleworth Moor this week as the climate changes and extreme weather events become more common, scientists have warned. As the army joined firefighters to tackle the blaze near Manchester and a second fire was reported on nearby upland, scientists said similar events are increasingly likely in future, with potentially devastating consequences for the environment and human health. Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London, said recent studies showed “climate change is expected to increase the fire frequency and severity of wildfire in Europe”. He said the effect is predicted to be “even more pronounced in northern Europe, including the UK and Ireland”. Dr Richard Payne of the University of York agreed, saying that “devastating events like we are seeing today at Saddleworth Moor are likely to happen more often in the future”. He also warned the fires would exacerbate climate change, as the UK’s peatlands store huge amounts of carbon that is then released. “The UK’s peaty moorlands are crucial for the carbon they lock away as peat,” he said. “Since the last ice age these peatlands have helped cool our climate but fires can reverse that effect, rapidly returning carbon to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.” The fire at Saddleworth Moor could also have more immediate health implications. Prof Susan Page of the University of Leicester said peat fires release toxic chemicals into the air as well as small particulates that have long-term health implications – especially for children or those with existing respiratory conditions. “For the Saddleworth Moor fire,” she added, “a further concern is the industrial legacy of this region, with the peat soils containing the fallout from many years of heavy industry in surrounding towns and cities. The peat soils contain this pollution legacy in the form of increased levels of heavy metals, which will also be liberated into the smoke by the fires.”
The Saddleworth fire has reached seven square miles across (18 sq km), with the active “fire front” stretching up to 2.5 miles (4km), according to firefighters, who say it could take weeks to put out. People across the region have been advised to stay indoors and keep windows shut. Prof Vincent Gauci of the Open University said Saddleworth Moor had “been a sponge for regional pollutants for decades and centuries, as the region was an engine of the UK’s industrial revolution”, and warned the health implications of the fire were unknown. He said: “With none of the current pollution abatement strategies in the early industrial period, these moors were on the receiving end of a whole range of quite nasty industrial pollutants. So these peats are a store of past pollution, which could be remobilised in the current fires with unknown consequences for human health.” Campaigners have also warned that the use of UK uplands for grouse shooting makes fires more likely. Guy Shrubsole, an environmental activist who is writing a book on land ownership in England, said there was “a strong correlation” between the fire on Saddleworth Moor and “the tell-tale signs of intensively managed grouse moor”. He said there was growing evidence that grouse shooting degraded the environment and made both flooding and fire more likely. Pat Thompson of the RSPB said management of UK uplands for grouse shooting had made them more susceptible to fire over the past 150 years: “Over time large parts of the land have been transformed from wetlands with a high water table to a drier, heather-dominated environment.”
He said this made them more susceptible to fire and less able to absorb water, contributing to flooding. “What we need to do is get this dry hard habitat back to being a wetland environment that can resist fire more effectively and across which water travels much more slowly,” he said. Thomas Smith at the LSE said other UK moorlands were highly susceptible with “moderate to very high fire danger ratings across most of the UK and the Republic of Ireland”. He said that besides the Saddleworth Moor fire, there were at least two fires burning in the Northumberland national park this week, “one of which appears to be quite large at over 2km across”. “The last time we had conditions similar to this was in spring 2011,” he said, “when there were fires breaking out across the whole of the UK and the Republic of Ireland, from a forest fire in Berkshire to moorland fires in the Scottish Highlands. I should imagine that fire and rescue services in areas at risk will be preparing themselves for a busy weekend.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/more-saddleworth-style-fires-likely-as-climate-changes-scientists-warn,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/more-saddleworth-style-fires-likely-as-climate-changes-scientists-warn
2018-06-29T14:23:30Z,world,World news,"EU migration deal may force NGOs to rethink, says charity","The NGO vessels that rescue refugees in the Mediterranean may have to rethink their missions if they are forced by the new European agreement on migration to coordinate all of their operations with the Libyan coastguard, according to Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). The warning by the humanitarian group came after the European council sealed an agreement on migration that said Europe would “step up” its support of Libya and called on all vessels in the Mediterranean to “not obstruct” Libyan coastguard operations, despite reports that the Libyan officials are committing grave human rights abuses. Even as the council celebrated what some leaders hailed as a breakthrough deal – despite its notable lack of details – there were reports that 100 migrants, including three babies, had died in a shipwreck off the coast of Libya. MSF – one of a handful of NGOs that have helped save thousands of stranded migrants at sea – said it was witnessing a worrying shift in the Mediterranean since last week. The group and others like it usually take direction from Italy’s maritime authorities when they coordinate rescues in international waters. However, since last week, Italy has shifted those responsibilities to the Libyan coastguard, the group said. The Libyan coastguard has an agreement with Italy, which has helped train the force and has been charged with intercepting migrant vessels and taking migrants back to Libya. Once they arrive back in Libya, migrants face inhuman conditions, according to media reports and human rights organisations. “What is new is the fact that now the Italian and Maltese authorities are washing their hands completely of what is happening at sea,” said Hassiba Hadj-Sahraoui, a humanitarian affairs adviser for MSF. She said that last weekend, MSF was notified that it was not needed for a rescue involving six or seven dinghies in distress, and that similar notice had been given to another NGO. Once NGOs do rescue migrants, they no longer have any real options of where to take them, given Italy’s new closed-port policy. “We will try to continue but if continuing means we become agents of implementing their [Libyan] policies and forcing people to go back to Libya, this is not acceptable to us,” said Hadj-Sahraoui. Matteo Salvini, the far-right Italian interior minister who has taken a hard line against migrants, on Friday repeated his call that all ports in Italy would be closed to NGO ships. Since he became interior minister, Salvini has blocked a number of NGO ships from landing in Italy and has falsely accused them of being funded by George Soros, a common dog-whistle allegation used by the far-right. Hassiba Hadj-Sahraoui, a humanitarian affairs adviser for MSF, said NGOs, which some politicians have accused of being “pull factors” for migrants seeking to make the journey across the Mediterranean, have become scapegoats. “It is easy to say we are the problem. They say we need to abide by the law, which is something we have always done,” she said. NGOs such as MSF are to meet with authorities, she added.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/eu-migration-deal-may-force-ngos-to-rethink-operations-says-charity,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/eu-migration-deal-may-force-ngos-to-rethink-operations-says-charity

Emma Mhic Mhathúna is one of 209 women who received false negative results in smear tests between 2010 and 2104, errors that only came to light two months ago. She was told her original smear in 2013 was clear but in May she discovered the cancer had spread to her bones and she was dying. “I’m dying when I don’t need to die. And my children are going to be without me, and I’m going to be without them,” the 37-year-old told the Irish broadcaster RTÉ in a heart-rending interview in May. “I tried to do everything right by breastfeeding and being a full-time mum and sacrificing my own life for them. I didn’t see it as a sacrifice and now I’m going to miss out. And I don’t even know if my little baby is going to remember me.”.
Mhic Mathúna, who is a single mother, told RTÉ she had to sit down with her five children, aged from two to 16, and tell them she was dying. The interview triggered fury across Ireland and calls for resignations at the top of the health service. The false results were kept from the women and only discovered two months ago during a health audit. It transpired that 162 of the women had not been told about the revised results and, of these women, 17 were now dead. The crisis has to led to a public inquiry and emergency testing. Mhic Mhathúna and her children took a case against Ireland’s Health Service Executive and Quest Diagnostics, the US lab responsible for the mistake. A full hearing was due to take place on Friday but the case was settled out of court after five days of mediation between the parties. Justice Kevin Cross said he was pleased the parties managed to resolve their differences and he approved the settlement, under which the HSE admitted liability for failing to disclose the findings of the audit and Quest Diagnostics admitted liability for misreading the smears.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/irish-woman-receives-74m-over-cervical-smear-cancer-scandal,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/irish-woman-receives-74m-over-cervical-smear-cancer-scandal

David Drumm, who was jailed earlier this month over his role in a €7.2bn (£6.3bn) fraud conspiracy at the bank, admitted authorising or permitting Anglo Irish Bank to give unlawful financial assistance to a group of investors to buy shares in the bank in 2008. The “Maple 10” group consisted of wealthy builders and property developers, including one man who was an investor in luxury hotels in London, including Claridge’s and the Connaught. Drumm was produced from custody on Friday to appear at Dublin circuit criminal court where he answered “guilty” to each of the 10 charges read out by a court official. His decision to plead guilty brings to an end nine years of criminal investigations into the bank. The prosecutor Paul O’Higgins said 21 further charges listed on the indictment against Drumm would no longer be pursued and a trial scheduled for October would be cancelled. Drumm had previously being found guilty of working with two other senior executives at Anglo and the chief executive of a rival bank to give the misleading impression to shareholders that deposits in 2008 were €7.2bn (£6.3bn) larger than they were, as the worldwide financial crisis began to bite.

2018-06-29T12:28:01Z,world,World news,"Retirees returning to Jamaica face extreme murder risk, say police","Jamaican expats who retire there after decades in the UK face an “extreme risk” of murder, a former police chief on the Caribbean island has said, as official figures revealed that at least 85 Britons, Americans and Canadians have been killed in the country since 2012. Senior police figures told the Guardian that returning residents were seen as soft targets by criminals and needed much more protection following the murders of three British retirees on the island in as many months. Gayle and Charlie Anderson, aged 71 and 74, had only recently retired to Jamaica when they were fatally stabbed and their bodies burned following a firebomb attack at their “dream” home in Mount Pleasant, in the island’s Portland parish, last Saturday.
The double murder followed the killing in April of 63-year-old Birmingham charity worker, Delroy Walker, incidents that have put renewed focus on the disturbing pattern of elderly returnees being violently targeted by Jamaican criminals. Percival Latouche, the president of the Jamaica association for the resettlement of returning residents, said he had counted more than 200 British, American and Canadian expats murdered in the country since 2000 and had attended 165 funerals in that time. It is not known how many of the Britons murdered were of the Windrush generation but a large proportion of those targeted were pensioners, like Charlie Anderson, who left Jamaica as a child and returned to the Caribbean to retire after decades working in the UK.
Mark Shields, Jamaica’s former deputy commissioner of police, said returnees were seen as easy pickings by criminals, who see them as wealthy and naive to the country’s security risks. “I’ve always considered them to be an extreme risk,” he said, adding that police chiefs had previously “under-appreciated” the scale of the crime but that it was becoming a major issue. “There’s a significant risk to returning residents for robbery, fraud and the ultimate crime of murder,” he said. Shields, who now runs his own security firm in Jamaica, advised Jamaican expats to “think very carefully about immersing themselves in local Jamaican culture in a rural community when they haven’t been back that much”. Some gangs are known to wait until retirees’ pensions land before striking, while others tail them in rental cars from Kingston or Montego Bay airports and rob them once they reach their destination. Undercover police officers patrol the two airports on the hunt for corrupt baggage handlers or taxi drivers, who have been known to tip off gangs about new arrivals returning to live in Jamaica. One such gang was led by a police officer and convicted several years ago of 20 robberies, all involving returning residents, although it was suspected of having committed many more crimes over the course of a decade, said Cornwall “Bigga” Ford, a former senior superintendent who caught the group before he retired in 2015. “Once returning residents come back they need support. They need good support,” Ford said. “They work so hard, buy these nice houses all over the place and some of the places are remote. They need security, they need to put up alarms, cameras and have dogs.”
Both the Andersons and Delroy Walker are believed to have been exploited financially before their murders. Detectives told the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper that the Andersons, from Gorton in Manchester, were victims of a £50,000 credit card fraud which they reported to police before they were killed. One suspect has so far been arrested by police. Steve Walker, a television technical operator from the Midlands, said his brother was murdered following a dispute about money with a painter who was decorating his retirement home near Tower Isle, on Jamaica’s north coast. Delroy Walker died on 19 April after suffering multiple stab wounds. The painter and at least one accomplice have been charged over the murder. “If you’re from Britain, the US or Canada, you’re seen as having money,” Walker told the Guardian. “My brother might have agreed one price but they think you can surely afford another - that’s what caused the grievance. People need to be aware of their security but there definitely should be a lot more communication with people who are thinking of returning.” Jamaica experiences twice as many murders in an average year than Britain, even though the UK has a population 20 times higher. Last year the country recorded 1,616 murders, the highest in six years and equivalent to 31 a week, as the homicide rate rocketed by 20% in just 12 months. So far in 2018 there have been more than 600 killings, mainly linked to gang activity, yet only 44% of homicides result in arrests. At least 85 British, American and Canadian nationals have been murdered in Jamaica since 2012, a Guardian analysis of government data has found. Of those, at least 30 were British and eight were murdered in 2017, the highest annual murder toll of Britons on the island in at least five years. There are thought to be around 30,000 returned residents in Jamaica although the number coming back each year has dropped substantially since the 1990s, a trend that has heightened concerns about the country’s troubled economy. The newly-appointed police commissioner, major general Antony Anderson, has suggested he will make the issue a top priority. “The commissioner knows the optics, he knows reputation, he knows how this can reduce footfall in Jamaica and reduce GDP,” said Leroy Logan, a former Scotland Yard superintendent who met Anderson earlier this month and who runs the Jamaica diaspora crime intervention and prevention taskforce in the UK. “There needs to be specific protections for returnees – from the Jamaica constabulary force, the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development – while they’re in the UK and once they arrive. I don’t think they’re doing a sufficient risk assessment in preparation for their return.” Latouche, a 77-year-old former London gas station operator who now runs the island’s biggest returning residents group, said his warnings about the pattern had for years fallen on deaf ears. He met the Andersons four years ago in Manchester and was devastated by news of their murder. “This country is anarchic, there’s no law here,” he said. “It’s going to have a devastating impact on the economy.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/retirees-returning-to-jamaica-face-extreme-risk-say-police,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/retirees-returning-to-jamaica-face-extreme-risk-say-police
2018-06-29T12:03:51Z,world,World news,US criticises Ireland for insufficient action on modern slavery,"Ireland has been downgraded by the US State Department’s Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report for failing to do enough to tackle modern slavery. The 2018 TIP report, released on Thursday, gives Ireland a Tier 2 ranking, on a par with Indonesia and India, because of what it describes as the government’s failure to adequately protect victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation and labour abuse, and failure to convict traffickers. In highly critical findings, the report highlights forced labour in the Irish fishing industry, and the state’s prosecution of Vietnamese and Chinese men for cannabis cultivation despite indications that they were victims of modern slavery. The annual TIP report is the principal diplomatic tool used by the US to press foreign governments to act against trafficking, and Ireland’s Tier 2 ranking is highly embarrassing for an advanced economy, according to Mark Lagon, former TIP ambassador at the State Department. “It is a credit to the credibility of the US report that the US is willing to be candid about another western advanced market democracy,” he said. “We have learned that Global North nations like Ireland have permitted ungoverned and grey zones to allow human slavery in fishing to flourish. High-capacity governments must close loopholes permitting gross exploitation.”
The report notes concern that the Irish government’s own immigration permit scheme for trawler crew from outside the European Economic Area is making men vulnerable to forced labour. The International Transport Workers’ Federation said the downgrade of Ireland reflected the union’s own findings that “human rights are under constant attack in the fishing sector by unscrupulous and greedy employers”. The union has begun proceedings in the high court to injunct the government’s permit scheme for facilitating modern slavery. “It is heartening that a completely independent international body has validated our findings by its decision to downgrade Ireland’s ranking,” the union said. “The continuing failure of the Irish state to enforce its own laws or heed warnings has left us with no option but to initiate legal action against the government.” A Guardian investigation in 2015 first exposed allegations of labour abuse and trafficking for forced labour in the Irish fishing sector, prompting the Irish government to set up an emergency taskforce. The Immigrant Council of Ireland also called for urgent action from the Irish government to improve its record. Criticism from the Irish high court and from the Council of Europe have already made clear that the Irish systems for supporting victims of trafficking are inadequate, it commented. “The 2018 Trafficking in Persons report provides the most comprehensive global snapshot of the grotesque trade in people, so criticism that Ireland is not meeting minimum standards is grave news,” Nusha Yonkova, the council’s anti-trafficking expert, said. Ireland’s Department of Justice said it disagreed with the Tier 2 ranking and had taken it up with the US embassy. “A number of improvements in our systems have been made in the past year,” a spokesman said. He added that the permit scheme was introduced to meet a need in the fishing industry, and “provides a regulated process where non-EEA sea fishermen can be employed and protected in accordance with the state’s labour laws supported by the various enforcement mechanisms in place”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/us-criticise-ireland-action-modern-slavery-people-trafficking,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/us-criticise-ireland-action-modern-slavery-people-trafficking
2018-06-29T11:33:45Z,world,World news,Jean-Marie Le Pen seeks family reunion at 90th birthday party,"The French far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who turns 90 on Saturday, has decided life is too short for family fallouts. After three years of very public spats with his youngest daughter, Marine, and 20 years of not talking to the eldest, Marie-Caroline, Le Pen has decided it is time for reconciliation. To that end he has invited both to his birthday party this weekend, for which about 200 guests will gather at the patriarchal manor, the 17th-century chateau Montretout in the western suburbs of Paris. Marine Le Pen visited her father in hospital recently after he was admitted for 11 days with a severe bout of flu. Before that they had not met since she expelled him from the Front National – now renamed Rassemblement National (National Rally) – in 2016 for repeated racist comments. “I was happy she came,” Jean-Marie Le Pen told Paris Match magazine. “We had a very pleasant time. Despite our political differences, she’s still my daughter. I even found her to be beautiful. She came with her daughters, Mathilde and Jehanne, and Nolwenn, Marie-Caroline’s daughter.” He sent Marie-Caroline to the Gallic equivalent of Coventry, refusing to let her name pass his lips, after she supported his former general Bruno Mégret when he left the FN to start his own party in 1998. But despite the long silence, he said he hoped she would attend his party “with her husband and her sisters”. His middle daughter, Yann, married Samuel Maréchal, director of the FN’s youth wing, in 1993 and had three daughters herself, one of whom, Marion Maréchal, became the youngest politician ever to sit in the national assembly when she was elected as an MP in 2012 at the age of 22. Had the old patriarch had a change of heart or a sudden revelation of his own mortality while in hospital? “What do you want me to say … I’m at the age of indulgence,” he said. “I’ve a sense of time passing. I’m rowing against the current but I know it will eventually drag me towards the rapids.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/jean-marie-le-pen-seeks-family-reunion-at-90th-birthday-party,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/jean-marie-le-pen-seeks-family-reunion-at-90th-birthday-party
2018-06-29T11:20:11Z,world,World news,UN talks help stall Saudi-led assault on strategic Yemen port,"A full-scale assault on the strategic Yemen port of Hodeidah by a Saudi-led coalition has been forestalled by discussions about the possibility of a wider ceasefire. This includes handing over the port to the UN for supervision, the UN envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, has said. He was speaking for the first time about his private efforts to mediate an end to the conflict around the port, which has the potential to lead to a blockade of the badly-needed aid required to keep Yemen from a drastic shortage of food, water and oil.
The port is held by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, who also control Yemen’s capital of Sana’a. The Saudi coalition, including air forces from the United Arab Emirates and local ground troops, have already seized control of Hodeidah airport as a prelude to what the UAE has said is a decisive battle to weaken Houthi control by seizing the port. However, Griffiths said following talks in Aden and Muscat that the leaders of the main Houthi political movement, known as Ansar Allah, had agreed along with the government that the UN should take a leading role. He said the UN security council will meet next week to discuss the progress of the talks, adding he hoped wider negotiations about the future of Yemen, the first in two years, could start within a fortnight. He told UN Radio “the fact there has been so far no major attack on the port or the city of the Hodeidah is something that has been attributed to the talks we have been having with the parties. The Ansar Allah leadership was able to give us, the UN, the offer of having a lead role in managing the port, dependent on an overall ceasefire in the governorate”. He said this had been accepted by the Saudi coalition, but hinted the coalition was not yet willing to drop its plans for an offensive on the city, as opposed to the port.
Griffiths said further talks were needed to narrow down what is needed to push off any attack on Hodeidah. “It was clear to me that the issue of Hodeidah is intrinsically tied up with the restart of political negotiations.” He continued: “Both sides had shown a willingness to come to negotiations, saying such talks were long overdue. The people of Yemen expect this to happen as soon as possible. My principle and overriding responsibility is to bring about negotiations to end this war. The issue of Hodeidah is an incredibly important issue but it is not more important than the issue of an overall political solution.” He said the main challenge to a political settlement, and a government of national unity, was the continuance of military activity. “War [is] the main spoiler to the process of building peace,” he said, adding that was why the UN has been pressing the Saudi coalition not to press ahead with the attack. He said: “The other challenge is to make sure that the totality of Yemen is brought back into a state of civil government. It is estimated that there are one million combatants fighting in Yemen in various militia.” A massive task lay ahead in demobilising and reintegrating such forces, he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/un-talks-help-stall-saudi-led-assault-on-strategic-yemen-port,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/un-talks-help-stall-saudi-led-assault-on-strategic-yemen-port
2018-06-29T10:57:00Z,world,World news,Covering the DRC: violence and beauty in this huge and unforgiving country,"The light streamed through the curtains of the Ihusi hotel on the shores of Lake Kivu in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The hills on the Rwandan shores were wreathed in mist as the temperatures began to rise and the rain-soaked earth gave up its moisture. The sun had struck our side earlier, the mist has gone and kites wheeled and turned in the empty sky. It was a scene of stunning beauty, a reminder of the unfulfilled potential of the DRC. Over the previous week, riding through the hills and woods on the back of trail bikes, I had been struck by the power of the landscapes. If there was peace and halfway decent roads, Lake Kivu and its hinterland would be one of the great tourist attractions of Africa. Instead the region is the scene of violence, misery and chaos. There is also mystery. Killers come and go in the night; a militia is formed, then dissolves; hugely valuable metals and minerals are trafficked across frontiers in trucks that leave no trace. A reporting trip in the DRC is an exercise in sifting rumour, misinformation and speculation in the hope of finding something resembling fact. My last visit was during the political crisis that followed president Joseph Kabila’s decision not to step down at the end of his second mandate in December 2016. The humanitarian situation in significant parts of this vast country has since deteriorated. More than 13 million people need aid, twice as many as last year, and 7.7 million face severe food insecurity, the United Nations said in March. More than 4.5 million are displaced, the highest number in the DRC for more than 20 years. There are outbreaks of cholera. The priority for a reporter before travelling to the DRC is to decide where to go. The infrastructure is so bad, and the country so overwhelmingly big, that if you get this wrong you can be stuck days – if not weeks – away from where you should be to report any given story. A political story, as elsewhere, will usually require time spent in the capital, Kinshasa. But this story is happening elsewhere, in often very remote areas. So I spent several days talking to experts, other journalists, observers, local UN, contacts and anyone I could find who knew what was happening on the ground. I talked, too, to anyone who could help me get to the places I needed to go to. In Africa, NGOs are often the only people with the logistic capacity to allow you to travel safely through many areas. But too often reporters end up spending their time in country within the bubble created by the organisation they are travelling with. This is problematic, so I opted for a mixture of travelling with Médecins Sans Frontières, who I admire and who are operating in the relatively accessible but important area around Lake Kivu, and working independently. We agreed I’d spend three or four days with MSF in Masisi, a small town 50 miles west of Goma, the border town easily reached through Rwanda. They support a major hospital there, and run mobile outreach medical teams into further-flung corners. But I also organised a few days when I could work alone, and tacked on a trip to report for our environment desk on the fight to save the Virunga National park and its gorillas from poachers and militia. I would be travelling for 10 days or so. Next came jabs, a visa, flights, cash and communications. As usual, I filled in a security log for my editors, explaining where I’d be, with whom, and what dangers there may be. Within 24 hours of leaving my base in Johannesburg I was in Goma, after a smooth drive from Rwanda’s capital, Kigali. Goma was calm, and I drove through its streets to see analysts and officials, a Jordanian officer on secondment to the UN peacekeeping mission, politicians and young, courageous dissidents, who I met in an inconspicuous café garden. The local governor received me in his lakeside complex and described the region’s troubles frankly – though he denied the charge that senior government and military figures were linked to the local militias responsible for so much of the bloodshed. The governor denied, too, that the dissidents I had just met had anything to complain about. In the evening, the Ihusi hotel was full of the usual crowd in such places – UN staff, pilots talking Russian, politicians, a Chinese businessman – and a heavy-set, sunburned South African who, with little attempt at concealment, handed over what appeared to be a very substantial amount of cash to a local man in a very sharp suit. What was the money for? I hoped a few convivial beers might unlock the secret. They did not, but I learned a lot about the Springboks rugby team. A day or so later I was in Masisi. There was some fighting around the town, but not enough to stop us travelling out from the hospitable, if spartan, MSF base to more remote areas. This was done on the back of motorbikes, driven by local riders who coaxed their machines through troughs of liquid mud. One destination was the small town of Niyabiondo, an hour or so’s ride through the forest. Families had been arriving there as skirmishes intensified among local militia and the army. These fugitives had nothing – no food, water or shelter. Many NGOs had left. The UN had an armed force of peacekeepers here until last year but pulled them out. Their helicopters were flying low through the valleys ferrying wounded from firefights. I spent a day at the major clinic in Masisi, where there were wounded government soldiers and wounded rebels. I interviewed a young fighter from one of the factions. His name was Justin Kapitu, and he was 22, emaciated, in great pain. He told me he did not know why he was fighting. That was the job of his leaders. When he has to leave the hospital, there will be only very limited care available in the community. His chances of survival are slim. Security threats against medical staff and their support workers were mounting. The leader of the MSF team was concerned about potential restrictions on their movements. But for the moment they could work, helping thousands of people each week. A heavy shower had caused a landslide that blocked the road back to Goma. But the DRC is a land of boundless ingenuity. Within hours of the rain clearing, villagers rigged a single plank bridge across the worst of the damage and the bikes could get through, spraying grey-black mud into the air, engines howling as the riders kicked and pushed them through the debris. An hour’s jolting ride across Goma’s grey lava to the north is the gateway to the Virunga national park, where I was reporting on the war being fought to protect wildlife and habitat. The road traversed villages, markets, checkpoints manned by surly soldiers. The Niyangoro volcano loomed above, trailing clouds. Only a fraction of the Virunga’s 800,000 hectares was open to tourists. At the park headquarters, rangers explained that more foreigners had been coming in recent years and the park was on the road to recovery after decades of neglect. There were still running battles with local Mai Mai militia, poachers, smugglers and illegal charcoal burners, but the mountain gorillas were doing much better, they said. The 700 rangers are, for the most part, young. They are proud of their uniforms and mission, aware of the risks they are running. A few weeks or so after my departure, six rangers were killed in an ambush, the biggest single loss for decades. A month later, one of the 30 female rangers was killed escorting tourists up the road from Goma. Two Britons were kidnapped and briefly held. The incidents led to a security review and the park was shut until until next year. The story made headlines, focusing the international media on eastern Congo once more. My job is to get that attention to return as often as I can. The situation in the DRC is unlikely to improve in the near future, and elections will only fuel the instability. They are now only six months away, and levels of violence is rising. There are stories here that need to be told.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/drc-congo-violence-beauty-reporting-elections-kabila,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/drc-congo-violence-beauty-reporting-elections-kabila
2018-06-29T10:42:13Z,world,World news,Cave boys' relatives keep vigil as rescue effort grips Thailand,"The 13 bikes tied to the railings, and the small pairs of football boots strewn in the mud, are the only signs they were ever there. On Saturday morning, a young Thai football team and their coach entered the rocky tunnels of the Tham Luang caves in northern Thailand. When the monsoon rains fell, flooding the entrance, they were unable to get back out.
On Friday rescuers were still hopeful that the 12 boys, who are between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach could be brought out alive. A possible new way into the caves was found on Friday morning, and water was being pumped out as quickly as possible. Thai authorities were also considering drilling a hole through the mountain into the cave, though it could take days or even weeks. The rescue effort, which has gripped Thailand over the past week, has become an international operation. Cave diving experts have flown in from the UK and 17 US air force rescue and survival specialists have come over from Japan to join the 132 Thai army, navy and police officers working day and night to try to find the group. The boys, members of Moo Pa academy, are believed to have crawled into the large series of caves through a narrow 15-metre tunnel that is now completely flooded due to almost non-stop heavy rain over the past six days. They had cycled to the cave with their coach after football practice on Saturday morning. Since Saturday night, when they were reported missing, their relatives have gathered outside the cave’s entrance, which has become a churned-up mudbath. Some of those waiting became so overcome with distress that they were taken to hospital. A vigil has been kept at the mouth of the cave, with prayers and songs, and Buddhist monks have tried to comfort the sobbing families. Kham Chantawong, an aunt of the coach, Ekkapol Chantawong, said she knew he had visited the caves in the past and told the Guardian she was sure he would do anything to protect the boys. “He took very good care of the kids,” she said, her face pale and pained. “They all got on very well together. The children never fought or even cursed at each other.” The Thai prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha visited the scene on Friday. “They’re athletes. They’re strong,” he told the boys’ relatives in an attempt to comfort them. Speaking to officials involved in the search, Prayuth said: “Whatever can be done, do it, the government will back it. I’m not worried about the work of the staff but I’m worried about time elapsed for those lost inside the cave.”
The rain and rising water levels meant the search had to be paused for more than five hours on Thursday. The interior minister, Anupong Paochinda, described the difficult circumstances faced by the rescue divers. “Divers are in dark areas that are not flat and there’s mud and rocks everywhere,” he said. “Therefore, for the Seal team that’s there, when they dive, sometimes one tank can only go as far as 30 metres and they have they have to turn back.”
The cave is one of Thailand’s longest, at six miles, and is a popular tourist attraction. A large sign by the entrance warns of the dangers of it flooding in the monsoon season, which runs from June to November. Vernon Unsworth, a British diver who lives in Thailand, said he knew the cave intimately as he had been exploring its tunnels for six years. He said the conditions were “getting hostile”, and whether or not the boys were alive “depends where they are”. He said: “If they’re in the right place they can survive for five or six days. But the water now, the floodwater, is getting higher and higher, so there will be a point in time where even this cave here, the entrance will close.” Florian Witulski contributed to this report",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/cave-boys-relatives-keep-vigil-as-rescue-effort-grips-thailand,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/cave-boys-relatives-keep-vigil-as-rescue-effort-grips-thailand
2018-06-29T10:01:33Z,world,World news,Wayne Swan: ending progressive taxation will turn Australia into the US,"Labor’s new national president, Wayne Swan, has launched a full-throated defence of progressive taxation, declaring the system is not class warfare, but “created to counter the class warfare that had ripped the world to pieces before, during and after, the great depression”. After a fortnight in politics dominated by arguments about income tax, and on the same day as Bill Shorten backflipped on a company tax repeal position he’d flagged earlier this week – Swan told a dinner at the New South Wales Labor conference on Friday night the “demolition job on progressive taxation is being sold to us as some sort of mainstream economic solution”. “Uncontroversial, common sense, accepted by all economists, but it’s anything but that. It’s a radical agenda that will dramatically widen income inequality and strip back the social wage that has defined our country since the second world war.” “It will take our country right down the American road to a nation of haves and have-nots, forgotten communities, social division and anger – Trump’s America.” Swan declared on Friday night “the Australian dream” was built on the pillar of progressive taxation. “It’s what helped pay for our successful industrial development from the 1940s onwards, our national infrastructure in the 1950s and 60s, the creation of Medicare in the 1970s, the increases in year-12 retention of the 1980s, the expansion of universities in the 1990s and now the NDIS.”
“Progressive taxation gave us one of the most egalitarian societies in the world. And in Europe, the United States and elsewhere, progressive taxation gave the world decades of social peace and stability. It lowered social tensions and held at bay the dangerous extremes of left and right.” He says social democratic parties around the world have come under assault from populists on the right and the left, and warns “unless we show we have the answers people are looking for, we could be swept away too.” Swan says Labor is currently “in a battle of political wills and ideas that will determine the future of our party. “Our task is to tear down neoliberalism and its trickle-down economics, to argue that inequality is not inevitable, and to prove that our social democratic alternative will create a richer and better society.” Swan’s speech also contains implicit criticisms of an alternative manifesto outlined this time last week by the left-wing frontbencher Anthony Albanese. Albanese said the ALP needed to cherish its historical union links, but also appeal to people who were not union members. “This is not 1950,” Albanese noted, “when most Australians were members of trade unions.” The Labor president says one of the reasons there has been a declining share of GDP going to working people is that the government in Australia “has sought to supress the voice of organised labour.”
“We in this room know that unions are the most effective check on inequality that has ever been invented,” Swan said. Declaring himself “unapologetic about being on the side of working people” Swan says recent history demonstrates that when parties of the centre-left move away from their base, they lose. “Insipid and tame economic agendas which fail to provide a clear alternative in the key areas of inclusive growth simply make it easier for right-wing populists to use race and gender to divide and defeat us. That’s the big lesson for us.” He says politics must be disabused “of the destructive idea that government and collective action by people are somehow illegitimate. “This stupid idea, endlessly advocated by right-wing ideologues, is what had brought America undone. “We don’t need it. Instead, we need to convince people once again that collective power, expressed through their unions, their communities and government, funded by means of progressive taxation, can help us solve our country’s greatest problems.” Swan’s outing on Friday night followed Shorten’s decision to recant a position articulated by him on Tuesday repealing the Turnbull government’s tax cuts for medium-sized businesses, a reversal which followed mounting internal pressure. Shorten told reporters he’d recommended to shadow cabinet that businesses already in receipt of legislated tax cuts should keep them. He said it had become necessary to “amend” Tuesday’s announcement because it was “causing confusion and uncertainty for business” and because Labor had received updated financial information. The final decision only covers tax cuts that have been legislated and have taken effect, so that means the Turnbull government’s cut in the tax rate paid by medium sized firms to 27.5% will stay. A staged tax cut to 25% beyond 2024-25 promised by the Turnbull government will still be rolled back if Labor wins the next federal election. Pressed on why he’d articulated one policy position on Tuesday and another on Friday, Shorten said smart politicians did not just lead, “they also have to listen”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/wayne-swan-ending-progressive-taxation-will-turn-australia-into-the-us,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/wayne-swan-ending-progressive-taxation-will-turn-australia-into-the-us

She found it in a union. Young people like Motley-Gibson are starting their work lives at a time when activism has been mostly absent from low-wage industries. In the airline workforce, unions have long represented flight attendants and other professionals. But the labour movement hasn’t penetrated the precarious airport-catering sectors, staffed mostly by low-wage immigrants and people of colour. Things began to stir at the Newark airport kitchen when the service workers’ union, Unite Here, recruited Motley-Gibson to help organise her colleagues to demand better working conditions. Last month she helped arrange a rally on behalf of 2,700 fellow catering workers at United Airlines kitchens around the country, calling for fair contracts and the right to form a union. The campaign has bridged social and racial divides. “This is the most that we’ve all come together,” said Motley-Gibson, a first-time organiser. “Each department, each race, each age group … [Companies] want us to be against [each other]; now we talk to each other.” Motley-Gibson isn’t the only young American talking about unions for the first time. Last year, bucking a long trend of decline, union membership in the US grew by 262,000 members. Three in four new recruits were, like Motley-Gibson, under 35. That’s a major upheaval considering the wilting of unions’ political clout over the past two decades. From about 20% of the workforce in 1983 (the earliest year for strictly comparable data), union membership declined to just under 11% last year. On Wednesday, the supreme court dealt another major blow to unions by ruling that non-union members in the public sector no longer have to pay for union representation in collective bargaining negotiations.
The hard hats and smokestacks of yesteryear are making room for tablets and tweets as the labour movement gets a millennial upgrade. One in four new hires was unionised last year, of nearly 860,000. An era of inequality, insecure work and Donald Trump has begun to galvanise frustration among a generation often dismissed as self-absorbed. Now hyper-networked millennials are rediscovering the potential of organised labour to seed economic empowerment at work.
Young workers have realised that “a generation of corporate-driven policy choices have decimated the rights and economic security of working people”, according to Liz Schuler, secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the largest federation of US labour unions. “The millennial and Gen Z generations are more civic minded and acutely in tune with the power of collective action … a union card helps them leverage their power.” Even the ivory tower is embracing worker solidarity. Graduate students at Columbia University recently staged a week-long strike for official recognition of their new union of teaching and research assistants, historically not treated as regular employees. Though the administration has resisted contract negotiations, organisers are building momentum on campus, while a nationwide movement to organise student workers is growing.
“Income inequality and disparities are at one of the peaks since the recession,” said Ian Bradley-Perrin, a Columbia graduate worker. “It could be a moment when people are looking for solutions. And the solution [that] has been in existence for a long time, that maybe people haven’t given credit to, is unionisation. Cultural perceptions of unionisation and unions have changed.” Entrepreneurial and creative opportunities have expanded for some in an era of instant global communication and commerce. But millennials dreaming of careers in traditional white-collar professions such as finance and publishing are facing the hamster wheel of temp gigs and unpaid internships. Unions offer a ballast as they navigate an uncertain economy: a boost in wages, especially for women and workers of colour, as well as insurance benefits; steady schedules; and an advocacy network to challenge exploitation, sexual abuse or discrimination in a post-#MeToo era. About two-thirds of professionals responding to a recent AFL-CIO survey said they “would support a proposal for a union at their current job” if they had an opportunity to join one. Despite usually having spent more time in formal education than their parents did, young workers cannot bank on the financial and social security their parents’ generation enjoyed. About 11% of young US college graduates are unemployed or lacking full-time work, and gender and racial income disparities are growing for millennials. The re-energisation of labour parallels other youth-powered activism. Young community activists have bolstered worker-driven protest movements from Occupy to the Fight for $15 to #MeToo, linking issues of living wages, labour protections and social justice. And younger “gig” industries have spawned organising campaigns and legal battles to expand labour protections in sectors such as ridesharing apps, retail and computer programming. Some fresh blood is long overdue for a union movement grown anaemic since the 1970s, strafed by globalisation, automation and rightwing rollbacks on union protections. “Right to work” laws have helped deplete union coffers in many states by restricting their ability to collect fees from all workers at unionised firms, while Wednesday’s supreme court ruling imposed similar barriers on public sector unions.
At the media website Curbed NY, editor Amy Plitt’s beat is high-class real estate. As a young journalist, Plitt had never seriously considered unionising. “It didn’t seem like something you could do,” said Plitt. But office murmurings about workplace concerns eventually crystallised into a union drive, and within months a collective bargaining committee was established representing each outlet of Curbed NY’s parent network, Vox Media. In January, the management officially recognised the union as part of Writers Guild East, which represents several other digital news outfits. Last week (6 June) staff at the New Yorker joined the growing list of media workers forming unions. Now embarking on her first contract talks, Plitt said she was attracted to “the possibility of joining together with colleagues and really having a voice at the table”. “The more people in this industry come together and do this, and demand certain rights and different priorities … I think it’s only going to make the industry stronger,” she said. And as long as the old story of bad bosses and angry workers persists in the “new economy”, the union promise will age well: a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work.

2018-06-29T08:49:20Z,world,World news,EU migration deal gets wary welcome from Germany and Italy,"Allies of Angela Merkel have hailed talks in Brussels as a toughening of the EU’s stance on migration, but it remains unclear if the deal will win over the German chancellor’s staunchest opponents in Bavaria and thus save her fraying coalition government. Emerging from the summit on Friday morning, Merkel said the joint message was a “good signal”. While a lot of work was needed to create a joint asylum system, the chancellor said, “I am optimistic after today that we can really continue to work on this”. Günther Oettinger, the European commissioner for budget and human resources, described the outcome of the summit as a “genuine breakthrough”. “I believe there are good reasons why the CSU [Christian Social Union] will recognise this as a big step in the right direction,” Oettinger told German radio. “We in the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] will recognise it as a big step in the right direction.” The former Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz said the agreement was a pragmatic decision that should appease the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, who has threatened to start turning away migrants already registered in other EU states from German borders if Merkel does not come up with a European solution by the start of July. “Merkel has given Horst what he wanted,” Schulz told Die Welt, adding that the statement’s language about taking “all necessary internal legislative and administrative measures” to prevent secondary movement across the bloc’s internal borders looked tailor-made for Seehofer’s concerns. Schulz, a former president of the European parliament, predicted that a “coalition of the willing”, consisting at least of Germany, France and Spain, would set up bigger processing centres for asylum seekers inside the EU, and called for more money from the EU budget for those who volunteered to take an active role. The Bavarian CSU, the CDU’s sister party which had created the pressure for Merkel to emerge from the summit with a new deal on migration, had already switched to de-escalation mode before the German delegation went to Brussels. The deal was hailed as a success by Italy’s populist prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, who said it showed his country was no longer alone in dealing with the migrant crisis. However, back in Rome the man who has single-handedly set Italy’s agenda since the far-right/populist alliance came to power a month ago was more cautious. The far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, said on a morning talkshow that progress had been made in principle on the issues of protecting the EU’s external border and “real investment” in Africa. His tone, however, suggested a wait-and-see approach and he reiterated that Italy’s ports would be closed to all NGOs involved in rescuing migrants from the sea: “They will only see Italy in a postcard.” Far from endorsing any of the vague proposals that have been adopted, Salvini emphasised that Italy had an outsized role in the summit, and had succeeded in in setting the agenda, forcing EU partners to recognise his country’s issues and problems. In Germany, Seehofer had told German TV before the summit that, while the situation was serious, the conversations that had been started were “quite sensible”. On Thursday night, the former Bavarian state premier Edmund Stoiber said on a talkshow: “I am confident after hearing what is coming out of Brussels. I believe that a way can still be found.” The CSU delegate Hans Michelbach described the deal as a “positive signal” but did not rule out that his party’s interior minister could decide to take drastic actions on the German border. “You have to recognise with pleasure that the path of a joint European asylum policy is the right path,” he told the German broadcaster ARD on Friday morning. “The question is what it means for the national border and taking in [of migrants] at the moment and in the coming months: is it necessary to take action immediately?” Heads of the CSU and the CDU will meet separately in Munich and Berlin on Sunday afternoon to discuss the outcome of the summit. While the EU leaders’ resolution did explicitly address the Bavarians’ bugbears about asylum practices on Germany’s borders, it represented a toughening of language on migration. The aid organisation Médecins Sans Frontières warned that the deal would lead to further deaths in the Mediterranean sea and people being stuck in internment camps in Libya. “The EU states have to come to their senses,” MSF said. “They are withdrawing from their responsibility to save human lives.” However, the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, described the agreement an “important step in the right direction”. “We are happy that there is at last a focus on the external borders,” said Kurz, who is often portrayed as an ally of Seehofer and apparently threatened Germany with retaliations if it moved to unilaterally turn away asylum seekers from its borders. “If Germany takes measures in this respect, then we will obviously also take the same measures on our borders in order to avoid damage to the Austrian republic,” Kurz said on Thursday.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/eu-migration-deal-gets-wary-welcome-from-germany-and-italy,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/eu-migration-deal-gets-wary-welcome-from-germany-and-italy
2018-06-29T08:30:46Z,world,World news,EU migration deal: what was agreed and will it work?,"After a marathon session in Brussels, European leaders claim to have struck a deal on how to handle refugees and irregular migrants. Here is a look at what was agreed, and whether it will be enough to end the bloc’s political crisis over migration and save Angela Merkel’s fragile coalition government in Germany. What happened and why was it important? EU27 leaders emerged at 4.35am on Friday from nearly nine hours of talks to announce they had reached an agreement on migration. Although the number of migrants arriving in Europe has fallen by 90% since their 2015 peak, the fallout has fuelled a political crisis between and within EU capitals. The new populist government in Italy – where most migrants land if they make it across the Mediterranean – was demanding that the rest of the bloc take “concrete steps” to share its burden (and was prepared to veto any deal if they did not), and anti-immigration leaders in countries such as Hungary and the Czech Republic were rejecting even the idea of automatic quotas. In Germany, which took in more than a million migrants in 2015, Merkel’s conservative coalition partner had threatened to shut the border to migrants who had applied for asylum elsewhere in the EU, a move that could trigger the collapse of her government and mark the end of the EU’s totemic passport-free Schengen zone. The German chancellor had said migration could “decide the fate of the EU”. What was agreed? Like many EU deals, this was a carefully but vaguely worded fudge to satisfy divergent views. It stopped well short of decisively solving the problem, but may have raised enough of a platform to build on. Satisfying Italy, member states agreed to send rescued migrants on EU territory to “control centres” across the bloc – at locations still to be decided, and only in countries that volunteered to have them. There, “rapid and secure processing” would sift economic migrants from refugees with a potential right to asylum, “for whom the principle of solidarity would apply”. Appeasing some of the central Europeans, no relocation measures would be compulsory. Leaders also backed plans, broadly agreed by all members, to tighten the EU’s external border, give more money to countries such as Turkey and Morocco to help prevent migrants leaving for Europe, and set up processing centres in countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Niger and Tunisia. And in an apparent lifeline for Merkel, the accord said governments should “take all necessary internal legislative and administrative measures” to stop refugees and migrants crossing Europe’s internal borders. Will it be enough? Italy sounded happy, with its prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, saying the country was “no longer alone”. Merkel said the deal was “a good signal” but much still needed to be done, and France’s Emmanuel Macron said it was an important step which had delivered a “European solution and cooperation”. Perhaps more importantly, a senior politician from Merkel’s rebellious coalition partner, the Christian Social Union, said “something has moved in the right direction”; and Matteo Salvini, Italy’s pugnacious, anti-immigration interior minister, said “real progress” had been made. The deal, and whatever actions eventually follow, is not enough to heal Europe’s deep political divides over migration – but for the time being, at least, it may be enough to paper over the cracks.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/eu-summit-migration-deal-key-points,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/eu-summit-migration-deal-key-points
2018-06-29T08:00:32Z,world,World news,Canada: Syrian children's choir turns down US festival trip over border fears,"A Canadian children’s choir made up mostly of recently arrived Syrian refugees has turned down an invite to perform at a prestigious international festival in the US over fears of crossing the border under the Trump administration’s travel ban.
Launched in 2016 as tens of thousands of Syrian refugees were arriving in Canada, the Nai Kids choir has been gathering weekly in Toronto to belt out a repertoire of English and French tunes along with Syrian favourites. The choir has given its members the chance to make friends, practice their English and gain a foothold in their new home, said Fei Tang, the choir’s founder and general manager. “I think the biggest thing they get is the sense of belonging,” Tang said. “Even though the general public is very sympathetic, because of the language barriers and cultural barriers, they could not blend in that quickly. The choir serves as a buffer.” The choir has also become a refuge from constant worries over family members still in the Middle East and haunting memories of loss and destruction. Tang said: “We’re singing to give back.” So far more than 200 children have been part of the choir, including newcomers from Yemen, Eritrea and Tunisia. These days it consists of about 60 children, ranging in age from five to 15, all of whom are from Syria. They have rapidly become a homegrown hit; donning their yellow polo shirts and singing about peace, love and grief for prime minister Justin Trudeau and other MPs, as well as at festivals in Toronto. But recently the choir was forced to turn down its most remarkable invitation so far: an all-expenses paid chance to perform at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC, as part of the Serenade choral festival.
When the invitation arrived in October, the choir did not immediately see the potential for complications. “We didn’t think about the visa situation at first. We were panicking about ‘we’re not good enough to be presented at the Kennedy Center’.” They soon began canvassing immigration experts and other newcomers to find out how the visa process might work. Although most of the kids have lived in Canada for the past two years, Syria is among the five Muslim-majority countries targeted in Trump’s travel ban. And other Canadians from the affected countries have reported being turned away at the border and warned that they would now have issues entering the US for the rest of their lives. “The choir is very diverse,” said Tang. “Some kids have been in Canada longer, some kids have fair skin, they’re blond and Christian, they probably won’t have a problem. But what if our Kurdish children or children with hijabs got stopped at the border?” The final straw was the story of a musical group who had ended up detained at the border for days after trying to cross into the US. “That’s not something we wanted to risk,” said Tang. “It’s just too much, given what these children already have been through.” Organisations across Canada have made similar decisions in the wake of Trump’s travel ban, from the Girl Guides of Canada who last year cancelled all travel to the US to the Toronto district school board. The Serenade festival – which has showcased more than 85 choirs from countries ranging from Norway to Zimbabwe in the past eight years – got under way this week, just as the US supreme court upheld the travel ban.
Neeta Helms, the founder and president of Classical Movements, the organisation behind the festival, said the choir’s decision to avoid crossing the border was understandable. “We’re in kind of a difficult world right now. It’s definitely not easy to predict who will qualify for entry.” Instead of performing, the choir will appear in a prerecorded video which will be shown at Kennedy Centre during the festival’s grand finale on Sunday. The aim of the video is to reinforce to the children that politics – rather than personal feelings – are behind the decision to stay home, said Tang. “Of course you don’t talk politics to the children, but when they asked why are we doing the recording, we said that Americans love you guys, they wanted you to be there. It’s just Mr Trump doesn’t want us to be there,” she said. “So we are sending our love through our songs.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/canada-syria-childrens-choir-border-visa,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/canada-syria-childrens-choir-border-visa
2018-06-29T05:31:14Z,world,World news,Friday briefing: Carnage in the newsroom,"Top story: ‘Loss is unimaginable’ – but Capital Gazette journalists get their paper out Hello – I’m Warren Murray and sadly we are ending the week with the aftermath of more deadly gun violence in the US. Five people have been killed and several more injured in a shooting at the Capital Gazette newspaper office in Annapolis, Maryland. Staff at the US local daily paper said the assailant shot his way in through a glass door and then opened fire on people inside. Some of those trapped tweeted for help during the attack. When officers entered the building they found the suspect under a desk with his weapon lying nearby. No gunfire was exchanged. Smoke grenades were also used in the attack, according to police and county chiefs. The suspect in custody was named in reports as Jarrod W Ramos, 38, from Laurel, Maryland, who had previously sued the paper for defamation and lost. The victims were named as Rob Hiaasen, assistant news editor; Gerald Fischman, editorial page editor; Wendi Winters, special publications editor; Rebecca Smith, sales assistant; and John McNamara, staff writer. “The loss is unimaginable,” said Joshua McKerrow, a photojournalist at the Gazette. Journalists at the Capital Gazette promised to publish an edition on Friday. “We are putting out a damn paper tomorrow,” tweeted reporter Chase Cook. Gavin Buckley, mayor of Annapolis, expressed shock: “What’s wrong with our society that we’re this tightly wound that you can be this upset at a newspaper that reports stories on cats being stuck up a tree … [a paper that] reports on our kids’ soccer games and good, local, interesting stuff that we want to hear about?”
Donald Trump’s muted condolences drew criticism. The Baltimore Sun, sister newspaper of the Capital Gazette, ran an editorial pointing to an atmosphere of hostility toward journalism in the US: “That’s why so many reporters across the nation got a sickening feeling Thursday afternoon – they couldn’t believe something like this had happened, except that they could.” * * * Brussels immigration ‘breakthrough’ – European leaders this morning are claiming to have reached a deal on migration after all-night talks. We are working through the details in our live blog on the Brussels summit. The plan agreed upon aims to bolster the bloc’s external borders and improve solidarity between member states, to reduce pressure on countries like Greece, Spain and Italy, which are points of arrival into Europe. Italy’s new prime minister Giuseppe Conte said: “We are satisfied. It was a long negotiation but from today Italy is no longer alone.” On the Brexit talks, leaders of the EU minus Britain are calling for an intensified effort and warning of the prospect of the UK leaving the bloc on 29 March 2019 without a deal. Leaders arriving in Brussels criticised division and indecision in May’s government. Theresa May responded by calling on the EU27 leaders not to put their citizens’ safety at risk by excluding Britain from policing and information-sharing networks that are used to track criminals and terrorists. * * * London house prices lagging – House price growth in London has slowed to a nine-year low, according to Hometrack. London is one of five cities – along with Cambridge, Oxford, Belfast and Aberdeen – in the survey where house prices are falling in real terms when adjusted against consumer price inflation. In other areas of the country, prices are still growing strongly: by 7.1% in Edinburgh and 7% in Manchester, year on year. Richard Donnell from Hometrack said: “We expect house prices to keep rising across regional cities such as Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh over the next two to three years. During this time house price growth in London will remain flat.” Manchester and Birmingham are expected to be the first cities to move closer to London prices, with demand for housing likely to be boosted by strong job growth. * * * Pervert loophole to be closed – Cross-party MPs will seek to strengthen the “upskirting” bill that is before the Commons so that it makes the voyeuristic activity a sex crime without exception. They fear the current form of words could let perpetrators get away with it by arguing, for example, that they only did it for fun. MPs also want to amend the bill to make distributing upskirt images a crime. Conservative MP Maria Miller is to call for other forms of online “revenge porn” to be made a sex crime as well. The bill’s second reading is expected to be on 3 July. * * * End of the ATM? First the phone booth, now the cash machine. ATMs are closing at the rate of 300 a month, according to Which?, as contactless payment for small purchases leads to fewer people carrying cash. Rural areas are worst hit as the Link network and other operators pull their machines out of shops, partly because banks are paying them less for withdrawals. According to the banks, debit card payments have overtaken cash as the most popular form of payment in the UK. But David Clarke from the campaign group Positive Money says 77% of people still regard free access to cash as essential: “This is all about the banks wanting to cut the fees they have to pay rather than anything else.” * * * Find a GP for life – If you like your doctor, stick with her or him and you will have less chance of an untimely death, research suggests. So-called “continuity of care” was already known to produce better medical outcomes and now a “study of studies” has pointed to corresponding benefits in reducing mortality rates. “This phenomenon applies to specialists as well as generalist doctors,” said Sir Denis Pereira Gray, first author of the research from St Leonard’s Practice, Exeter. “We think this is a human effect that goes across medicine.” But doctors say it is increasingly a challenge to maintain continuity of care with stretched resources. “Ultimately the answer is more GPs and more resources for the profession,” said Professor Kamila Hawthorne, vice chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners. World Cup It’s still coming home, right? On an underpowered, slightly strange night in Kaliningrad, England fell to a 1-0 defeat to Belgium to finish second in Group G and book a last-16 date with Colombia. Gareth Southgate had to defend his weakened selection, and a reluctance to bring Harry Kane off the bench as his side chased an equaliser, by suggesting England’s next fixture is the nation’s “biggest game for a decade”. Defeat has certainly thrust England into a favourable half of the draw but only if they quell the considerable threat of the South Americans in Moscow on Tuesday. Japan snuck into the knockout stage in rather undignified fashion, courtesy of a goal scored 400 miles away in Samara by Colombia’s Yerry Mina and by virtue of the fact they accrued two yellow cards fewer than Senegal. The Japan coach, Akira Nishino, unhappily admitted his tactics were “very regrettable”. Reaction to Germany’s exit continues, with Toni Kroos making no attempt to downplay its significance, nor any attempt to deflect the blame. Today marks the first day in two weeks with no live football. But our daily liveblog cares not – we are up and running with reaction to last night’s games and a look ahead to the last-16 lineup. Lunchtime read: ‘They talk about Sicario as if it’s a documentary’ “They separated the families as if they’re criminals. Wait; keep them together and investigate. Some of those people deserved to have a second chance to start their lives in a new setting like the United States.” As Benicio Del Toro promotes the narco thriller Sicario: Day of the Soldado, he has been drawn into the debate about immigrant children being taken from their parents at the border of the US and Mexico.
“That’s separate from Sicario,” he cautions, and makes clear he is less than impressed with how some journalists have interpreted the sequel. “Someone just said to me: ‘Your movie has to do with the exact same thing that’s going on right now. You take a child and you separate her from her father.’ … I say: ‘No, no, I kidnap the girl. It’s very different.’” Lanre Bakare interviews the actor who, across four decades, has made the drug-war genre his own. Sport On the back of a fine fielding display England’s women cantered to a comprehensive seven-wicket victory over New Zealand in a dress rehearsal for Sunday’s T20 tri-series final. Lewis Hamilton believes Mercedes are in a stronger position than ever to enhance his Formula One world championship advantage at the Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday. Kyle Edmund’s Wimbledon preparations suffered a setback as the British No 1 went down to Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Kukushkin in the quarter-finals of the Nature Valley International. Ben Stokes will return from injury next week to make a rare appearance for Durham and thus create a selection logjam in England’s batting lineup for white-ball cricket. And former Australia captain Steve Smith notched a half century in a Canadian T20 game on his return to cricket while he serves a 12-month international and first-class ban for ball tampering. Business Asian share markets have rallied from nine-month lows after China eased foreign invesment limits on sectors including banking, automobiles, heavy industry and agriculture. But underlying sentiment has been dampened by worries over trade frictions a week before initial US and Chinese tariffs are set to take effect. The pound traded at $1.31 and €1.126 overnight. The papers “Revealed: true scale of UK role in torture and rendition after 9/11”. That is the splash in the Guardian while the Mail phrases it as “Cash for torture”, saying British spy chiefs paid the US to fly suspects to “black ops” prisons. A similar headline on two fronts for the EU summit story: “EU putting lives at risk over Brexit, warns May” says the Times. The Express explains it better: “EU ‘risking lives’ in row over security”. The i puts the heat back on the PM: “Divided cabinet dismays Europe”.
Several papers take the prospect of playing Colombia, instead of more favoured sides, as the consolation prize from England’s loss to Belgium in their World Cup match. “Well played, lads!” encourages the Sun’s front page. “Look on the bright side – at least England will avoid Brazil” says the Telegraph in its pic slot, while splashing on calls for a boost to NHS mental health care for children. “Second’s best”, says the Mirror, about the football – its main story concerns a book that makes “distasteful and tawdry” claims regarding the Queen’s marriage. The FT splashes on BAE winning a £20bn contract to build warships for the Australian navy.

2018-06-29T05:27:30Z,world,World news,EU leaders hail summit victory on migration but details scant,"European leaders have papered over the divisions on migration with a promise that some EU countries would take in migrants rescued from the Mediterranean sea, after marathon talks at an EU summit lasting nearly 10 hours. Announcing the end of tense summit talks shortly before dawn, the head of the European council, Donald Tusk, tweeted that EU leaders had reached an agreement, including on migration. Hours earlier that outcome had been in doubt, when Italy threatened to veto the entire text unless other EU states did more to help with people arriving on Italian shores. Opposition from Poland, Hungary and other central European states to any hint of mandatory action meant talks dragged through the night.
The euro jumped 0.6% on news of the deal, while the French president, Emmanuel Macron, declared that European cooperation “has won the day”. Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said: “We are satisfied. It was a long negotiation but from today Italy is no longer alone.” But the bloc dodged an agreement on controversial refugee quotas, as a quartet of central European countries resisted language on EU-wide responsibility. The outcome is already being seen as a thin deal. It is also unclear whether Angela Merkel has a deal that will secure the future of her coalition government, which has been rocked by disputes over handling refugees. Allies of the German chancellor on Friday morning praised the outcome of the meeting in the highest notes. Günther Oettinger, the European commissioner for budget and human resources, hailed the outcome of the summit as a “genuine breakthrough”. “I believe there are good reasons why the CSU will recognise this as big step in the right direction”, Oettinger told German radio. “We in the CDU will recognise it as a big step in the right direction”. On leaving the summit, the German chancellor conceded that “we still have a lot of work to do to bridge the different views”, but said it was “a good signal” that the EU had agreed a common text. Merkel had warned on Thursday that the future of the European Union hinged on whether it could find answers to the “vital questions” posed by migration.
Leaders agreed EU countries should help migrants rescued in the Mediterranean to alleviate the burden on Italy and Greece, but the details remained unclear. The issue has risen to the fore, since Italy closed its ports to migrant rescue ships, leaving several boats adrift at sea, until other countries stepped in to help. In an effort to avoid a chaotic situation, leaders agreed there should be “a shared effort”, but “only on a voluntary basis”. Countries will take in rescued migrants and establish processing centres to assess asylum claims on their soil. In an attempt to force the issue, Italy’s Conte was accused of hijacking the summit when he threatened to block the entire summit conclusions unless he received more help. “I am a law professor,” Conte told his fellow leaders, protesting about the EU’s working methods, promoting an unusual exchange, according to a source. The Bulgarian prime minister, Boyko Borissov, replied: “Well, I used to be a fireman and this is not how you negotiate.” Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Löfven, added that he used to be a welder and he did not agree with the Italian’s way of making his point either. The summit exposed Europe’s longstanding divisions on migration between central Europe, which refuses to take any refugees, versus western countries, which are seeking “solidarity” even in a token way. Finding a more consensual note, EU leaders called for migrant processing centres in north African countries. They agreed to “swiftly explore the concept of regional platforms in close cooperation” with non-EU countries and the UN refugee agency and the International Organisation for Migration, also a UN-backed agency. In essence, this means migrant processing centres in countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Niger and Tunisia. EU funds would be available to persuade countries to sign on, but so far no countries have agreed, while a couple have ruled themselves out. In a sign of the political complexities involved, the UN agency vision for the scheme clashes with those of some EU leaders, who put the accent on closing borders and stopping arrivals. Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, called for a “strong border” to stop what he called an “invasion” of migrants. In contrast, the UNHCR/IOM paper seen by the Guardian calls for “strong leadership from European Union member states on upholding the right to asylum and the rights of migrants”, while stressing that the EU could not outsource the problem. “The idea is really not us and them, either Europe or North Africa,” Eugenio Ambrosi, Europe director for the International Organization for Migration, told the Guardian. “It is a Mediterranean approach that is shared by those countries that are willing.” “What we do not want is external processing centres and we definitely do not want an Australian model,” he said, referring to controversial detention centres on Pacific islands. Conte said his government had not decided whether to set up a migrant processing centre and had not been urged to do so. But the first test from the summit may be for Merkel, who needs to convince her conservative coalition partners that she has a way to control migrants travelling to Germany from southern countries. Germany’s hardline interior minister Horst Seehofer, who is also the leader of the CSU, has threatened to close Germany’s borders to refugees unless Merkel comes up with a plan by 1 July. This has prompted fears that closing Germany’s frontier would lead to a domino effect of closures, destroying the border-free travel area that underpins jobs and trade. At the summit, EU leaders also agreed to roll over wide-ranging economic sanctions against Russia, an outcome that had been in doubt following the recent election of Italy’s populist government that is more sympathetic to Vladimir Putin of Russia.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/eu-leaders-summit-migration-doubts,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/eu-leaders-summit-migration-doubts
2018-06-29T04:00:26Z,world,World news,Italian officials allegedly met with Syria's top military adviser,"A secret meeting that is alleged to have taken place between a senior military adviser to Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, and top Italian officials has come under scrutiny from human rights organisations. Italy’s decision to host the clandestine meeting violated EU rules, the European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) has claimed. In its legal complaint, filed against Italy at the European commission, the ECCHR has alleged a meeting took place in early 2018 between Ali Mamlouk, the head of Syria’s national security bureau, and Marco Minniti, a former intelligence chief who was serving as Italy’s interior minister at the time. It claimed the meeting violated an EU travel ban that was put in place against Mamlouk in 2011. Italy’s head of intelligence, Alberto Manenti, also allegedly attended. Initial unconfirmed reports in February stated that Italy had provided Mamlouk with a private jet to fly to Rome, but the alleged meeting was not officially recognised or announced. The ECCHR stated in its complaint that it had “received confirmation about the visit and the meetings by several government officials as well as journalistic sources”. Minniti served under the government of the former centre-left prime minister Paolo Gentiloni. He has since been replaced by the new interior minister, Matteo Salvini – the populist leader of the far-right party League. Manenti remains in his post. Reports had suggested the alleged meeting involved a discussion of national security issues. Mamlouk was singled out and placed on a “blacklist” by the EU in 2011 – a decision that put travel and financial restrictions on the military and intelligence official – because of his alleged involvement in violence against demonstrators in Syria. According to the complaint, the European council’s decision obliged all EU member states to take “necessary measures to prevent entry into, or transit through, their territories”. Mamlouk is known to be one of the most high-ranking security officials in Syria and reports directly to Assad. Human rights organisations said Mamlouk’s national security bureau was allegedly responsible for arbitrary arrests and torture, as well as the execution of Assad’s political opponents. The ECCHR added that European allies were not informed of the alleged meeting, including the high representative of foreign affairs and security policy, Federica Mogherini, who is Italian and a member of the Democratic party, which was in control of the government at the time. The Italian government – now led by a different party – did not have an immediate response to the claim. Other human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Redress, said it supported the decision to file the complaint. The groups called on the commission to initiate a formal infringement procedure against Italy, and said the Syrian government needed to be “held to account because justice shall not be set aside in the interest of intelligence cooperation”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/italian-officials-allegedly-met-with-syrias-top-military-adviser,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/29/italian-officials-allegedly-met-with-syrias-top-military-adviser
2018-06-28T22:32:00Z,world,World news,Former Pakistan prime minister barred from re-election,"Pakistan’s former prime minister and a member of his cabinet have been controversially barred from contesting next month’s general election. It is the latest in a series of blows to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party that have fuelled accusations the country’s military is trying to deny the party a second term. On Thursday, the supreme court found the former privatisation minister Daniyal Aziz guilty of contempt, disqualifying him from parliament for five years.
The verdict came one day after an election tribunal barred ex-prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi from contesting his home-constituency of Murree. A single-judge bench ruled that Abbasi was “guilty of concealment of facts” on election papers and therefore disqualified from politics for life under article 62 of Pakistan’s constitution. That clause, which requires politicians to be “honest and righteous”, was also used in 2017 by the supreme court to justify the ousting of prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Sharif, who has opposed the military establishment since he was removed from office in a 1999 coup, is calling on voters to back the PML-N on 25 July in the face of what leaders describe as a familiar conspiracy between the army and the judiciary. Aziz told the Guardian the charges against him were “flimsy”. “There has been a long history of mangling the democratic process by state institutions,” he said, using a common codeword for the army. “Here I am, Mr Clean, and I’m pulled up on flimsy charges drummed up from a year ago.” The supreme court had objected to Aziz claiming the court was following a “script” in its ruling against Sharif. Mosharraf Zaidi, a Pakistan commentator, told the Guardian that the remarks Aziz made constituted little more than “overheated political rhetoric,”, adding that he worried the series of unexpected twists ahead of the vote was undermining public faith in the electoral system. In an appearance on television on Wednesday night to discuss his own dismissal, Abbasi said: “It’s an election for parliament. They have made it a joke.” The tribunal ruled that he had made an error in his declaration of the value of his home in Islamabad. According to Abbasi, who will appeal against the ruling, the value he set down legitimately represented the cost at which the property was purchased in 1974. He further claimed the election tribunal went beyond its remit in applying article 62. Legal experts were divided over whether Abbasi can still run for the second seat he is contesting in Islamabad.
Several leaders from the main opposition party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), have also been knocked out of contention under the same clause in the constitution. However, analysts note a preponderance of verdicts against the PML-N. Earlier in the week, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), an anti-graft court, arrested another PML-N candidate, Qamarul Islam, shortly after he announced he would contest a seat against the pro-military former interior minister. On Wednesday, Islam’s 12-year-old son was driven around the constituency in his place, hailing supporters via megaphone through the vehicle’s sunroof. The NAB is widely expected to convict Sharif on charges of corruption in the coming days.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/28/former-pakistan-prime-minister-barred-from-re-election,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/28/former-pakistan-prime-minister-barred-from-re-election
2018-06-28T16:36:37Z,world,World news,"Future of EU hinges on solving migration issue, says Merkel","Angela Merkel warned on Thursday that the future of the European Union hinged on whether it could find answers to the “vital questions” posed by migration, as she received muted support from some of her fellow leaders arriving for a crucial summit likely to determine whether her fraying coalition government survives. Addressing the Bundestag before heading to Brussels, the German chancellor said European leaders should find a solution to asylum challenges “by allowing ourselves to be guided by values and rooting for multilateralism rather than unilateralism”. If the heads of government gathering in Brussels failed to do so, Merkel warned, they risked creating a situation where “no one believes in the value system that has made us so strong”.
Migration is dominating the EU summit in Brussels, whose agenda has been dubbed by some insiders as Saving Private Merkel. Germany’s coalition government is under immense strain, after the hardline interior minister Horst Seehofer threatened to turn away any asylum claimants already registered in another EU country, unless Merkel came up with a solution by 1 July. Merkel fears that if Germany closes its borders it will set off a chain reaction that destroys Europe’s border-free travel zone, regarded by the EU as one of its greatest achievements, as well as a lynchpin of jobs and prosperity. The leaders of Spain, Finland and Luxembourg expressed support for Germany to curtail “secondary movement” of migrants who have made an asylum claim in another European country. “I understand when Germany says ‘why do we have to deal with everything?’” said Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel. The Spanish PM, Pedro Sánchez, said European solidarity on migration was vital, “especially with Germany which is now suffering a political crisis”. But Italy threatened to veto the summit agreement if it did not meet Rome’s demands for more help managing arrivals to its shores. European leaders are at odds over how to reform EU asylum policy, which is based on the principle that the first country of arrival takes responsibility for asylum claims. The system has put frontline states Italy, Greece and Spain under immense pressure, while Germany faces “secondary movements” of migrants, who may be seeking to speed up asylum claims. Greece said it was ready to help Germany by taking back asylum seekers, a political boost for Merkel, but one that does not solve her problem, as the numbers returning to Greece would be small. Merkel also needs help from Italy, but its new populist government wants European countries to share the burden of looking after the migrants arriving on its shores. Since Italy began turning away migrant rescue boats from its ports, Europe’s divisions over migration have burst into the open. After days adrift in international waters, the German NGO ship Lifeline, carrying 234 people, has now been allowed to dock at Malta. The Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, announced that nine European countries, including Malta, had agreed to accept people rescued at sea. European leaders are likely to sidestep the divisive issue of refugee quotas that has roiled the EU since 2015, when Brussels attempted to force through mandatory quotas.
Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who was recently re-elected after a harsh anti-immigration campaign, made clear his country would not be welcoming refugees. In typically uncompromising language, he said the EU had to stop migrants arriving. “The invasion should be stopped and to stop the invasion means to have a strong border.” Faultlines over managing internal migration means EU leaders will focus on action to prevent migrants arriving in Europe, a policy that commands consensus. EU leaders are expected to call for migrant processing centres to be set up in north African countries, but details remain sketchy. The rightwing Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said that “being rescued in the Mediterranean must not automatically become a ticket to central Europe”. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said the EU needed to come to a “Turkey-like agreement” with African countries, a reference to the 2016 migration pact with Ankara that led to a 97% fall in arrivals across the eastern Mediterranean. “We are not ready for the next crisis,” Rutte said, adding that it was not right that countries such as Spain and Italy were left to shoulder all the burden. The EU needed to decide “how to kill the business model of cynical boat smugglers, people dying in the migration sea”, he said. Questions persist about the proposed migrant processing centres, which no African country has agreed to host. The EU will call for further study of “regional disembarkation platforms”, a vague term for a scheme that EU officials admit is lacking detail. Merkel, the architect of the EU-Turkey deal, told German MPs that it was time to seek conversations with African states about deals to return migrants “who absolutely have no right to stay”, modelled on the 2016 agreement. In a 26-minute speech to the German parliament, notably in Seehofer’s absence, Merkel sounded a note of pessimism about the chances of striking an EU-wide deal on migration. Throughout Merkel’s speech she was heckled by delegates of the rightwing populist party Alternative für Deutschland. At one point she interrupted her own speech with the words: “My God, seriously now.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/28/future-of-eu-hinges-on-solving-migration-issue-says-merkel,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/28/future-of-eu-hinges-on-solving-migration-issue-says-merkel
2018-06-28T13:47:05Z,world,World news,Five held in Spain over alleged sexual assault on underage girl,"Spanish police have reportedly arrested four men and a boy on suspicion of drugging and sexually assaulting an underage girl at a resort in the Canary Islands. Local media reports said the five suspects called themselves la nueva manada (the new wolfpack), after a gang that was jailed for sexually abusing an 18-year-old woman in Pamplona two years ago and released on bail to widespread outrage last week. In defiance of a travel ban imposed by the court, one of the Pamplona attackers was caught trying to obtain a new passport days after handing over his documents as a condition for his provisional release, police said on Thursday. Police have released few details about the latest incident, which took place last week, but El Diario reported that at least one of the suspects filmed the incident on his phone. The suspects are being held in the town of Maspalomas on Gran Canaria. Marco Aurelio Pérez, the mayor of San Bartolomé de Tirajana where the incident took place, denounced what he described as “a totally intolerable, mean, vile” act, and said such incidents risked “dangerously awakening social anger”. Women’s groups and the Spanish media have linked the case to the early release the previous day of the original “wolfpack”. That group got its name from a WhatsApp chat the men used to discuss their plans during the San Fermîn bull-running festival in 2016. In April, José Ángel Prenda, Alfonso Cabezuelo, Antonio Manuel Guerrero, Jesús Escudero and Ángel Boza were sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment and five years’ probation and ordered to pay €10,000 (£8,800) each to the woman after being acquitted of rape but convicted of sexual abuse. Both the sentence and the court proceedings – which allowed evidence of the victim’s personal life but excluded the perpetrators’ phone messages – provoked anger and nationwide protests at what many women denounced as a patriarchal justice system. The men were found guilty of the continuous sexual abuse of the woman in the lobby of a building in the early hours of 7 July 2016, but the case was widely seen as a cross-examination of the victim.
Last week’s decision to free the five men while a higher court studied the sentence prompted further demonstrations by women’s groups in several cities including Pamplona, Madrid, Zaragoza, San Sebastián and Barcelona. The 18-year-old victim of the Pamplona assault made her first public statement this week, which was read by a presenter on the Telecinco TV station. She urged all victims of sexual assault to speak out and report all abuse. “Do it in whichever way you want, but tell your story,” she said. “Do not remain quiet because if you do, you are letting them win.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/28/five-held-in-spain-over-alleged-sexual-assault-on-underage-girl,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/28/five-held-in-spain-over-alleged-sexual-assault-on-underage-girl
2018-06-28T13:23:09Z,world,World news,Outcry as Indian film body readmits actor accused of kidnap plot,"A star of Indian cinema accused of involvement in the kidnapping and sexual assault of another actor has been readmitted to an industry association, triggering a wave of resignations from the group, including by his alleged victim. Gopalakrishnan Padmanabhan Pillai, better known by his stage name Dileep, is awaiting trial over an incident in February 2017 in which a group of men allegedly forced their way into the woman’s car and sexually assaulted her as they drove around Kochi city, in Kerala state, for several hours.
Dileep, one of the most popular actors in Mollywood – as the industry in Kerala is known – is accused of masterminding the kidnapping as revenge for the woman telling his now ex-partner about his alleged affairs, according to the police charge sheet. He denies any involvement and is out on bail. Following the allegations, Dileep was expelled from the Association of Malayalam Movie Actors (Amma). But at its annual general meeting on Sunday – which the media were barred from attending – a majority of board members voted to reinstate his membership. Amma’s general secretary, Edavela Babu, told the Hindu newspaper that Dileep’s expulsion had not been decided in accordance with the organisation’s rules. “No one can be ousted like that without following due process,” he said. Absent from the meeting were members of the Women’s Cinema Collective (WCC), a group established after the incident to advocate for safer working conditions for women in the industry. Four members of the collective, including the survivor of the alleged assault, resigned from Amma the following day. “You are taking back a person who is accused of heinous crimes like rape and whose trial has not even been completed,” WCC members said in a statement posted on Facebook. “Isn’t the victim who was subject to the harassment also a member of the organisation? By taking this decision, aren’t you insulting that person?” The alleged victim said in a separate statement that Amma had failed to step in as Dileep had “scuttled many of my acting opportunities” in the years before the assault. “Now, when such an unfortunate incident happened in my life, the organisation again tried to protect the accused,” she said. The WCC, the first women’s group of its kind in the Indian cinema industry, was set up after male industry figures rallied around Dileep in the aftermath of the accusations. Some criticised the complainant, suggesting she had staged the alleged attack for publicity. Padmapriya, an actor and founding member of the WCC, told the Guardian the decision to reinstate Dileep had come as a shock. She said Amma did many good things for the industry but “needs to evolve”. Growing numbers of Indian film workers have spoken out in recent years about a culture of sexual exploitation, and particularly actors being pressured to exchange sex for roles. But the industry is yet to undergo a reckoning of the kind that has gripped Hollywood since the producer Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual assault last October.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/28/outcry-as-indian-film-body-readmits-actor-dileep-accused-of-kidnap-plot,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/28/outcry-as-indian-film-body-readmits-actor-dileep-accused-of-kidnap-plot
2018-06-28T11:53:12Z,world,World news,Giulio Regeni murder: 'unexplained gaps' in CCTV tapes,"The investigation into the torture and murder of Giulio Regeni, the Cambridge doctoral student who was killed in Cairo more than two years ago, faced another setback this week after prosecutors said video surveillance of the metro station where he was last seen contained unexplained gaps and no images of the Italian student. Italian prosecutors leading the investigation said in a statement on Wednesday that “further investigations were needed to ascertain the causes” of the gaps in the surveillance footage from 25 January 2016. Italian authorities had demanded the surveillance tapes for more than two years from Egyptian authorities, who have been accused of stonewalling the investigation.
Regeni, 28, was conducting sensitive research into labour unions at the time of his death. He is widely believed to have been killed by forces within Egypt’s security services, although the precise nature of why he was targeted, and who was responsible for his murder, have remained a mystery. His tortured and mutilated body was found in a roadside ditch near Cairo on 3 February 2016, eight days after he disappeared. Egypt has denied any involvement in his murder. The tapes have been seen as a vital piece of evidence of where Regeni was going and who might have abducted him. Egyptian authorities reportedly secured the videos one week after they were initially requested. They were deemed useless by the Egyptian authorities, who said the critical footage had already been erased. It nevertheless took more than two years to negotiate the handover of the footage from Egypt to Italy, where investigators were disappointed with what they found.
The case has been at the centre of intense diplomatic tension, not only because of the alleged involvement of the government of the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, but because Egyptian authorities have failed to offer adequate assistance to Italian investigators. Italy sought to improve diplomatic relations with Egypt last year, and reinstated its ambassador there after tensions over the Regeni investigation prompted the former centre-left government to remove its top diplomat from Cairo. At the time of the reinstatement of the ambassador, the then-foreign minister, Angelino Alfano, called Egypt an “unavoidable partner”, but Regeni’s parents criticised the move, calling it a “dressed-up surrender”. The new populist government appears ready to forge an even closer relationship, despite the ongoing questions over Regeni’s murder. Matteo Salvini, the interior minister, said earlier this month that he understood the desire of Regeni’s family to seek justice “but for us, having a good relationship with an important country like Egypt is fundamental”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/28/giulio-regeni-unexplained-gaps-in-cctv-tapes,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/28/giulio-regeni-unexplained-gaps-in-cctv-tapes
2018-06-28T11:28:02Z,world,World news,UK criticised for refusing to extradite Briton to Myanmar,"The UK has been accused of failing in its judicial obligations after refusing to extradite a Briton wanted in Myanmar on suspicion of murdering a friend and colleague in his Yangon apartment. The Home Office said it declined to extradite Harris Binotti, a Scottish teacher, because of the lack of an extradition treaty, adding that such a move would breach its human rights obligations. Binotti, 27, is wanted in Myanmar on suspicion of murdering his fellow British national Gary Ferguson, 47, in 2016. He remains at large, with reports that he may be in Scotland. Zar Li Aye, a national legal adviser for the International Commission of Jurists, said under the legal principle of aut dedere aut judicare (either extradite or prosecute), the obligation fell to British authorities to prosecute Binotti at home. By not prosecuting him, she argued, the UK was enforcing a jurisdictional gap. “Why haven’t they opened a case in the UK? Do they not have a law that protects their citizens abroad? Do they not have a law that permits them to prosecute their own citizens for felonies committed on foreign soil? What is important for us right now is to hold them accountable after their decision to not extradite an accused murderer,” Zar Li Aye said. “The fact that Harris Binotti is walking free in Scotland is a very worrying thing …The responsibility is now on [the UK]. If no action is taken, they will have failed as a justice system.” The two men taught English at Horizon International school in Yangon. Ferguson, who was married and had a four-year-old son, had worked there for a year, and Binotti for three months. Martin Ferguson, the victim’s brother, said in a Facebook group for supporters of the family: “We will never give up. No matter what.” He said he was informed by email of the Home Office’s decision not to extradite Binotti. “The request was refused due to there being no extradition treaty in place between the UK and Burma. In addition, to extradite Mr Binotti, the UK would violate several human rights obligations,” the email said. Yangon police discovered Ferguson’s body with fatal head and chest wounds on 6 November 2016 after breaking the lock to Binotti’s apartment with the help of a neighbour. According to the police statement, Binotti and Ferguson went to the apartment together after a night out. Neighbours said they heard fighting at midnight and 4am on 5 November, and a woman and two men screaming. Though Binotti, from Dumfries, remains on Interpol’s red notice database, which allows law enforcement authorities beyond Myanmar to arrest him, there is little pressure from Myanmar to do so. Myo Thant Pe, the director general of the consular and legal affairs department under Myanmar’s ministry of foreign affairs, said: “Normally, if someone committed a crime, he should meet justice where he committed it … But for this case, I don’t know.” Myanmar’s lack of urgency to extradite is compounded by pressure within the UK against extradition. After Myanmar filed its extradition request last year, Amnesty International reportedly urged the British government to deny it on the grounds that Myanmar still has the death penalty.

2018-06-28T10:00:07Z,world,World news,The US children working in tobacco fields: 'I wanted to help my mama',"Luis is just 14 years old, but he already has an exhausting, dawn-till-dusk job. Last summer, he started working in tobacco fields in North Carolina. Even though Luis is just a child – too young to buy cigarettes – it is legal for him to work here in the US. The job pays about $7.25 per hour.
Monday through Saturday last summer, when he was not in school, he rose at 5am, dressed in long sleeves, jeans, boots, gloves, a hat and a plastic poncho, and waited for a van to drive him to fields as far as an hour away. He came home around 7pm. This is a typical schedule for laborers in this tough and dangerous job. Workers in tobacco are vulnerable to heat sickness, in temperatures which regularly reach 32C (89F); they risk injuries from sharp objects; and, if the Trump administration has its way, children will return to using the most toxic agrochemicals. Then there is the plant itself. Tobacco naturally contains water-soluble nicotine. This makes morning dew or overnight rain a vehicle for huge doses of nicotine. Workers are regularly exposed to six cigarettes’ worth of nicotine per day, one study found. This can result in acute nicotine poisoning, called green tobacco sickness, characterized by nausea, vomiting, headaches and dizziness.
“I wanted to help my mama,” said Luis. He wanted to work, he said, “to get school supplies, so she doesn’t have to waste money”. Luis is the son of a cervical cancer survivor. He started to work when his mother, a waitress, was too ill to hold a job. (The Guardian has changed the names of workers and their families in this report.) “It’s heavy work, very hard,” said Luis’s mother. But, she said, “there’s no choice”. Children need to help buy “clothes, shoes, their own things, things they need”. She said it would be “better when they were older, but he started because I had cancer ... He was helping me as well as my older son.”
In the US, lax laws and an informal economy in which landowners are removed from hiring laborers allow teens to work growing and harvesting tobacco. This contravenes some tobacco companies’ own policies, which often prohibit children from performing hazardous work. “There’s a lot of 14-, 15-year-olds working in the fields,” said Antonio, a 19-year-old who has done so since he was 15, a history confirmed by his mother. “They need money or they want to work,” Antonio said. Altria, parent company of Philip Morris USA, which produces Marlboro cigarettes, said growers were “prohibited from hiring those less than 16 years of age, and may only assign hazardous duties to workers 18 and older. Both are above the legal requirements. We require parental consent for those under 18 working in tobacco farming.” The company also said it reviewed all growers every three years. In 2017, it found only one case of child labor, in which a farmer hired two 15-year-olds. “While the individuals were no longer employed by the grower, the contract requirements were reviewed with the grower to strengthen their understanding of the minimum age requirement,” the company said. The company also said it had hired third-party assessors to monitor labor conditions. Miguel Coleta, director of sustainability for Philip Morris International, said the company had been “making progress in tackling complex labor issues on farms supplying to PMI and our standards exceed US in many areas”.
“Challenges remain, and PMI continues to work with Verité and the Farm Labor Practices Group on systemic issues associated with child labor, grievance mechanisms to protect workers’ rights and to achieve meaningful improvements on the ground,” said Coleta. In 2015, PMI adopted a new leaf-buying model in the US, and it now buys through the third-party leaf buyers Alliance One International Inc and Universal Leaf North America. At the time, Human Rights Watch said the move would improve labor conditions on US farms. The Guardian interviewed several teens, parents, and labor organizers for this story. They described a picture in which child labor was commonplace. However, many said they depended on their children’s income to make ends meet. Many of those interviewed also work in other crops, including picking cucumbers, peppers or other vegetables.
“It’s the fact that we have to do it, because there is no alternative,” said Laticia Savala, a labor organizer with the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (Floc) in North Carolina. Floc does not support outlawing child labor in fields, because organizers feel it would harm families who depend on children’s income. However, needing the money does not lessen the harm. “What mom wouldn’t want their kids studying [rather] than working in the fields?” asked Savala. “You’re forced into doing something.” If labor conditions on farms “were better, probably child labor wouldn’t exist”. The world’s largest tobacco-producing countries span the globe. They include Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malawi, Pakistan and the United States. Together, North Carolina and Kentucky produce 70% of the 700m pounds of tobacco grown in the US each year. Only 0.04% of US farmland grows tobacco, but the United States is still an international juggernaut, the fourth-largest producer in the world. North Carolina is just one part of a global supply chain that feeds cigarette makers with tobacco leaf. However, the value of tobacco farming is dwarfed by the value of the global tobacco products. Tobacco farming was worth $19.1bn in 2013. Once leaf is manufactured, marketed and branded, tobacco products were worth $783bn the same year. North Carolina’s farmers employ mostly Latin American workers, who toil in fields owned by white, ageing farmers. The US does not grant agricultural workers collective bargaining rights and workers are sometimes undocumented. Workers are vulnerable to wage theft, exploitation and dangerous working conditions. Because children work in an informal economy, there is no data on how many might work in fields in summer months, or even when they should be in school. A 2014 report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) was the first in recent memory to ignite debate about child labor in tobacco in the US. The advocacy group followed up the report in 2015, and found little had fundamentally changed in fields.
“If you appear younger than 16, they’ll ask,” said 19-year-old John about children working on the fields. “But otherwise, no,” they don’t ask. Many contractors, one mother said, encouraged children to lie about their age. Attempts have been made to regulate tobacco growing in the past. In 2012, the Obama administration attempted to make it illegal for children younger than 16 to work in tobacco. But the Department of Labor backed down after Republicans falsely argued the measure would prevent children from working on family farms. At the state level, as recently as 2017, the Democratic Virginia delegate Alfonso Lopez tried to introduce a bill to bar child labor on tobacco farms. He was blocked by Republicans. “If this was your kid, would you be OK with having them work in this job?” Lopez asked at the time as the bill was shelved. “Would you? I don’t think you would. So why is it OK for kids you don’t know to do this job?” When criticism of child labor on US farms reached its peak in 2014, Philip Morris International hired a company to audit its supply chain. It found children working in hazardous conditions on 16% of the US farms it visited. However, auditors concluded: “The root cause of many labor related issues in the US is the lack of sustainable, reliable workforce exacerbated by poor US immigration policies.” The US has signed an international human rights convention meant to protect children “from economic exploitation” and work likely “to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development”. To that end, it encourages trading partners to meet these standards, and publishes an annual report on the “worst forms of child labor” around the world. One country singled out in the report was Malawi, visited by the Guardian earlier this year as part of an investigation, where children “continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in the harvesting of tobacco”, the most recent report by the US Bureau of International Labor Affairs said. The tobacco industry, through its Eliminating Child Labor in Tobacco Growing Foundation, agrees “in principle” children should be prohibited from hazardous work, “particularly the use of of machinery and agrochemicals by children in tobacco farming”.
The Trump administration, meanwhile, is hoping to further deregulate farm labor. Rules put into place after the 2014 HRW report are being rolled back by the US Environmental Protection Agency, which is examining whether children should again be allowed to work with dangerous pesticides on farms. “I’ve worked in the field as well; it’s very difficult. For a young person it’s worse,” said Antonio’s mother, a 37-year-old with three sons who works behind the counter of a rural convenience store. Teens often prefer farm work to other work, she said, “because they’re given jobs despite their age”. Dominance of American tobacco has waned in recent decades, as the tobacco supply chain has globalized. This and the deregulation of US tobacco price controls has encouraged consolidation. Where in 1978 there were 188,000 tobacco farms, today there are around 4,200. “A lot of times they’re underage and they lie and say they’re 16 or 17, but they’re actually 13 or 14 years [old],” Antonio’s mother said. “It’s hard, but there aren’t any more options.” She said claims that child labor was not happening on tobacco farms were “a lie”.

2018-06-28T08:33:50Z,world,World news,Deluge of electronic waste turning Thailand into 'world's rubbish dump',"At a deserted factory outside Bangkok, skyscrapers made from vast blocks of crushed printers, Xbox components and TVs tower over black rivers of smashed-up computer screens. This is a tiny fraction of the estimated 50m tonnes of electronic waste created just in the EU every year, a tide of toxic rubbish that is flooding into south-east Asia from the EU, US and Japan.
Thailand, with its lax environmental laws, has become a dumping ground for this e-waste over the past six months, but authorities are clamping down, fearful that the country will become the “rubbish dump of the world”. The global implications could be enormous. A factory visited by the Guardian in Samut Prakan province, south of Bangkok, which was recently shut down in a raid for operating illegally, illustrated the mammoth scale of the problem. Printers made by Dell and HP, Daewoo TVs and Apple computer drives were stacked sky-high next to precarious piles of compressed keyboards, routers and copy machines. Labels showed the waste had mainly come from abroad. For locals, it is unclear why Thailand should be taking this waste. The Samut Prakan factory sits in the middle of hundreds of shrimp farms and there were concerns it was poisoning the landscape, with no environmental protections or oversight in place.
Paraton Gumkum, 32, who owns a nearby shrimp farm, described the smell that enveloped the area when the factory was operating. “I wish that Thailand would say no to the e-waste trash. I am worried because it contaminates the air and the water with dangerous chemicals,” he said. “We have been very worried that the chemicals will leak into our shrimp farm.” Until the beginning of this year, China was a willing recipient of the world’s electronic waste, which it recycled in vast factories. According to the UN, 70% of all electronic waste was ending up in China. But in January, having calculated that the environmental impact far outweighed the short-term profit, China closed its gates to virtually all foreign rubbish. It has prompted something of a global crisis, not just for e-waste but plastic waste as well. Asian nations such as Thailand, Laos and Cambodia stepped in. Chinese businessmen have set about attempting to open about 100 plastic and e-waste recycling plants across Thailand since January. However, after five months in which e-waste imports have increased to 37,000 tonnes so far this year (more is thought to have entered illegally), Thailand has become the first south-east Asian nation to follow China’s example and crack down on the legal and illegal e-waste coming in. “We already have too much electronic waste here in Thailand. It is not our burden to bring this pollution from the rest of the world to the next generation of Thai people,” said Thailand’s deputy police chief, Wirachai Songmetta. Songmetta, who has led raids on more than 26 illegal e-waste factories in recent weeks, described some of the recycling set-ups as “frightening”, with primitive and contaminating methods used to extract valuable metals from the electronics while the rest is thrown into vast incinerators that pump out toxic smoke. “These factories have been polluting the environment because of all the heavy metals in the e-waste like lead and copper, which can poison the soil and the water,” he said. “They also burn the plastic, which brings toxic fumes into the air. So it is very dangerous for the Thai people living near these factories.”
While the word recycling implies doing good for the planet, in fact most of the e-waste recycling plants involve a dirty and toxic process to extract lead and copper that does huge amounts of environmental damage. The plastic in e-waste, such as computer screen casings, also contains high amounts of flame retardants that are poisonous if burned or recycled into cheap food packaging, as is happening in some of the factories. Thai customs officers are now pushing back 20 containers of e-waste a day that are landing in Thai ports, and in the next two months the government plans to pass legislation to bans foreign e-waste and plastic waste from entering Thailand. But with countries such as the US and the UK already relying on south-east Asia to pick up the e-waste and plastic waste slack in the wake of China’s ban – in the past four months alone, UK exports of plastic to Thailand have risen fiftyfold – this presents a problem. In Hong Kong and Singapore, where most of the world’s e-waste is sent before it is bounced to less-developed countries, there is already a backlog of e-waste in shipping containers. If south-east Asian countries do not take it, it has nowhere to go. Jim Puckett, of the Basel Action Network, which works globally to tackle the problem of toxic waste, said that in the short term a ban by Thailand would “inevitably lead to countries resorting to perverse ways to get rid of their e-waste, probably dumping it in terrible places and incinerating it all.” But he emphasised that in the long term a ban on e-waste imports across the region was “extremely necessary”. “Places like America and Europe need to realise they are going to have to start recycling their own electronic waste and stop sweeping the negative effects from north to south,” he said. “If a crisis does hit, hopefully this will make these countries think hard about how to be cleaner and more efficient about this waste we are producing on such an enormous scale, and finally take some responsibility.” Additional reporting by Navaon Siradapuvadol",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/28/deluge-of-electronic-waste-turning-thailand-into-worlds-rubbish-dump,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/28/deluge-of-electronic-waste-turning-thailand-into-worlds-rubbish-dump
2018-06-28T08:00:02Z,world,World news,"EU migration row risks aiding authoritarians, says Donald Tusk","The EU must tackle the migration crisis or risk losing ground to authoritarian leaders, the head of the European council, Donald Tusk, has said before the start of a summit that will be dominated by Europe’s response to people fleeing war, poverty or seeking a better life. The leaders of 28 EU countries, including Theresa May, will gather in Brussels on Thursday to discuss migration and EU-US relations. Migration has shot to the top of the political agenda in several EU nations, including Germany, where doubts surround the political future of Angela Merkel after she opened the borders to 1 million refugees.
On the eve of the summit, Tusk said the issue was providing ammunition to opponents of liberal democracy around the world. “There are voices in Europe and around the world claiming that our inefficiency in maintaining the external border is an inherent feature of the European Union, or – more broadly – of liberal democracy,” he said. Decrying new political movements that offered “simple answers to the most complicated questions”, he said: “More and more people are starting to believe that only strong-handed authority, anti-European and anti-liberal in spirit, with a tendency towards overt authoritarianism, is capable of stopping the wave of illegal migration. “If people believe them, that only they can offer an effective solution to the migration crisis, they will also believe anything else they say. The stakes are very high. And time is short.” In the last year, far-right parties have come to power in coalition governments in Italy and Austria, and an anti-immigration nationalist party has entered the German parliament for the first time in 60 years. Populist governments in Hungary and Poland have been making political capital with anti-immigration campaigns.
In an interview with the Guardian, Spain’s new prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said “inflammatory rhetoric” was no way to solve the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean. He did not mention Italy’s hardline interior minister, Matteo Salvini, by name, but said: “As effective as the inflammatory rhetoric from some Italian leaders may be in electoral terms, from the point of view of responding effectively to a humanitarian crisis like the one we’re seeing in the Mediterranean and on the Italian coast it’s not the answer.” The EU is sharply divided over how to manage refugees inside the bloc, but it has proved far easier to agree on more action aimed at would-be arrivals from Africa and the Middle East. EU leaders are expected to call for the development of migrant screening centres in north Africa, in an attempt to deter people from making life-threatening sea crossings of the Mediterranean. A senior EU official insisted the centres, known as “regional disembarkation platforms”, would not be migrant camps, while conceding it was not clear exactly how they would work. The official said details needed to be worked out with UN agencies and north African countries. “We know what our objectives are, we know with whom we want to work on it and we know we need to respect international law. But the key priority from our perspective is to break the business model of smugglers and prevent the tragic loss of life.” It remains unclear whether European countries are ready to pay €3bn (£2.6bn) to fund refugee aid in Turkey, the second tranche of money promised in 2016. The pledge was part of an EU-Turkey deal that has drastically cut migration across the eastern Mediterranean to Greece.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/28/eu-migration-row-risks-aiding-authoritarians-says-donald-tusk,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/28/eu-migration-row-risks-aiding-authoritarians-says-donald-tusk
2018-06-28T07:58:23Z,world,World news,Two boys fatally stabbed near school in Shanghai,"Two boys have been killed near a primary school in Shanghai after a 29-year-old man attacked a group with a kitchen knife, according to local media. At about 11.30am local time (0430 GMT) on Thursday, police in the Chinese city’s Xuhui district received a report that three boys and a female parent had been attacked by a man in the street near Shanghai Shiwai elementary school. The four victims were taken to hospital. Two of the boys died. A witness told Beijing News the assailant was caught by pedestrians and an air conditioner repairman helped restrain him. A video posted by the news outlet showed a man lying face down, with his feet and wrists bound together with rope. A crowd of people stood around him, one with his foot on the back of the man’s head. In the video, bystanders can be heard shouting “Beat him to death”, and “He’s a psycho”. The video also showed adults crouched over an injured boy. Police said the assailant was an unemployed man identified only by his surname, Huang. He was detained at the scene, according to the Shanghai-based daily the Paper. The incident has renewed fears about safety at Chinese schools, after a number of attacks by knife-wielding men over the past decade. Nine schoolchildren in Shaanxi province were stabbed to death in April by a 28-year-old man. After a series of attacks in 2010, authorities increased security at schools.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/28/two-boys-fatally-stabbed-near-school-shanghai,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/28/two-boys-fatally-stabbed-near-school-shanghai
2018-06-28T05:30:03Z,world,World news,"Mexico election: the candidates, the stakes and the key issues","What’s the story and what is at stake? Latin America’s second largest economy will go to the polls on Sunday to choose its next president and a new congress at a time of widespread disillusionment at unchecked corruption, poverty and violence that has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2007. The presidential frontrunner, a 64-year-old leftist called Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has claimed his widely anticipated landslide victory will represent the fourth great sea change in Mexican history after independence in 1821, the 1857-1860 War of the Reform and the Mexican revolution of 1910. “It seems like a dream but we are just a few days away from achieving Mexico’s transformation,” López Obrador, or Amlo as he is best known, told flag-waving supporters during a recent rally in the rundown satellite city of Ecatepec. Amlo’s foes beg to differ, painting him as a democracy-allergic, Hugo Chávez-style demagogue who will indeed transform Mexico – by crashing its economy. But many on Mexico’s left are not convinced Amlo will be much of a radical once in power, and analysts say that a better comparison is with Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who oversaw a period of economic growth even as he battled inequality. Who else is in the running for the presidency? Amlo’s consistent dominance in the polls has been such that his opponents have often seemed an irrelevance.
Perhaps the only man capable of spoiling his party on Sunday is Ricardo Anaya, a shaven-headed 39-year-old lawyer from the National Action party (Pan) who profilers have described as a curious mix of yoga fanatic and cut-throat political operator. In a recent interview with the Guardian one of Anaya’s campaign chiefs, Jorge Castañeda, described him as a “young, dynamic, intelligent, quick-footed [and] very well-trained” candidate with a vision of the future that contrasted with what he called Amlo’s backwards-looking nationalism. Voters seem unsure, however. In recent weeks the campaign of Anaya’s left-right coalition appears to have stalled amid corruption allegations he has denied and questions over his supposedly machiavellian bent. Behind Anaya is José Antonio Meade, a career civil servant standing for the now widely loathed Institutional Revolutionary party, or PRI, to which Mexico’s equally unpopular current president, Enrique Peña Nieto, belongs. Meade’s efforts to project himself as a likable everyman have also failed to impress voters. Bringing up the rear is Jaime “El Bronco” Rodríguez, an eccentric former governor who is running as an independent and boasts the support of just 3% of voters, according to the latest polls. His main contribution to the presidential race has been an incendiary pledge to tackle corruption by chopping the hands off criminals. What are the key election issues? Some analysts have attributed Amlo’s runaway lead to Donald Trump’s attempts to browbeat Mexico’s leaders over immigration and trade. According to that version, Mexican voters are intent on electing a strongman leader capable of hitting back at Trump’s bullying.
Amlo has dropped some hints that he might take a tougher line with the US president, including publishing a book called: A New Hope For Mexico: Saying No to Corruption, Violence, and Trump’s Wall or in Spanish simply, Oye, Trump (Listen, Trump!). Last week he denounced Trump’s “arrogant, racist and inhuman” family separation policy. But this year’s election is far more about domestic issues than foreign policy: primarily the rampant corruption and crime that have left Mexico’s 88 million registered voters furious and afraid.
In May, Mexico suffered nearly 2,900 murders, its most violent month in two decades. More than 120 political candidates have been killed since campaigning for this weekend’s election officially began last September. Meanwhile the country has been rocked by a succession of eye-watering corruption scandals, including that of Javier Duarte, a PRI governor who went awol in a government helicopter in 2016 after being accused of corruption and whose wife recently turned up living in luxurious exile in one of London’s poshest boroughs. On the campaign trail, Amlo has hammered home his determination to end the bloodshed and theft that have become rampant under the PRI and the Pan, the only parties to have held Mexico’s presidency since its democratic transition in 2000. “This isn’t any old election,” he told the Ecatepec rally. “It’s a vote for more of the same, or for genuine change … It’s change, yes or change, no.” Alan Riding, author of a seminal book on Mexican politics and society called Distant Neighbors: A Portrait of the Mexicans, described Amlo’s success as “a product of total disenchantment” with the Mexico’s ruling elite. “The PRI and the Pan have had their turn and they have failed, time and time again.” So who is the man preparing this shake-up? Amlo was born in the Tabasco river town of Tepetitán, in November 1953, the first of seven children. He became politically active in the late 1970s, working with local indigenous populations, and later moved to Mexico’s capital where he was elected mayor in 2000. Friends and supporters describe Amlo as a taco-loving baseball enthusiast and bookworm who is happier with his head in a book or out enjoying nature than socializing. “He’s a monastic man,” says Azucena Cisneros, a candidate for Amlo’s party in the state of Mexico. “Marvelously disciplined but monastic. He has no social life.” He is also a friend of Jeremy Corbyn and his Mexican wife, Laura Álvarez. And what kind of president might Amlo turn out to be? Critics cast Amlo as a Mexican Chávez or even a Mexican Trump. Some detractors have even accused him of posing as “a tropical messiah”.
But many experts believe a better, if still imperfect comparison, might be Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a one-time union firebrand who was elected on his fourth attempt, in 2002. Fears over Lula’s election sent stocks tumbling and had investors in a sweat. But he ruled for two terms as a pragmatic centrist credited with slashing poverty in one of the world’s most unequal societies. Like Lula, Amlo has tempered his discourse in what is his third bid for the presidency (he ran unsuccessfully in 2006 and 2012) and has vowed to rule for the poor. “We will care for everyone. We will listen to everyone. We will respect everyone,” he told the crowds in Ecatepec, home to nearly 790,000 of the 53 million Mexicans stuck below the poverty line. “But we will give preference to the humble. For everyone’s wellbeing, the poor will come first.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/28/mexico-election-the-candidates-the-stakes-and-the-key-issues,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/28/mexico-election-the-candidates-the-stakes-and-the-key-issues
2018-06-28T05:30:03Z,world,World news,Thursday briefing: Alarm as Trump gets new supreme court pick,"Top story: ‘Democracy is at stake’ Hello – Warren Murray here to read you in. There are warnings that Donald Trump could taint American justice for decades after veteran judge Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement from the US supreme court. Democrats and progressives say it opens the way for the president to appoint an arch-rightwinger who could unravel access to abortion, advancements for LGBT people and voting rights. Kennedy had been a crucial swing vote on the panel of the top court for more than a decade. Democrats have vowed to block any new nomination until after November’s midterm elections – the Republicans did the same to Barack Obama when he tried to appoint a judge before the 2016 presidential poll following the death of Antonin Scalia in February of that year. * * * PM insists talks on track – Theresa May will insist the government is making progress on Brexit when she updates EU leaders over dinner in Brussels tonight. Leaders are likely to ratchet up the pressure on Britain to make a choice about the future relationship it wants with the EU. The PM travels to Brussels after a week of public cabinet disunity, including over whether Airbus was right to warn of the risks of a no-deal Brexit. Whitehall sources say May is increasingly leaning towards a Norway-style approach that would involve accepting single-market membership, at least for goods, while Brexiters want a much looser deal. * * * Joe Jackson’s legacy – “Fearsome”, “cruel” and “estranged from his family” are some of the ways that epitaphs to Joe Jackson are being qualified this morning. The father of Michael Jackson has died aged 89 from cancer. “He may not unequivocally be the most tyrannical and monstrous father in pop history”, writes Alexis Petridis. But he “has a shot at the title” for the catalogue of physical and mental abuse that the talented Jackson siblings endured on the road to a success that their father never achieved himself. Watch footage from 1983 of Michael breaking out the moonwalk for the first time and “it seems almost insulting to the level of talent on display to suggest that it required physical and psychological abuse to bring it out”. Joe Jackson died in a hospital in Las Vegas, having reportedly kept his family at bay during his decline. * * * Deportation bonus culture – The Home Office paid out over £21m to people wrongfully held in immigration detention while its staff chased bonuses for meeting targets to remove people from Britain. Figures reveal that more than 850 people detained between 2012 and 2017 were living in the UK legally. In 2016-17, 23% of people working in immigration enforcement received an end-of-year bonus for good work, some of which is related to removals. Confusion over whether removals targets were in place led to Amber Rudd’s resignation as home secretary. The most senior Home Office official, Philip Rutnam, has indicated to the home affairs committee of MPs that deportation target figures will no longer be pursued. * * * Toxic greaseballs from space – Space is full of dirty, toxic grease that could cloud the windows of interplanetary craft, astronomers have revealed. The solar wind sweeps our own stellar environs clean of the gunge, which is part of the exhaust plume from what are known as carbon stars. Scientists are trying to work out how much is floating around in space that might be available to create life. You will also need windscreen wipers if passing through the more pleasant-sounding atmosphere of Saturn’s moon Enceladus (I nearly type “enchilada” just there). Plumes of ocean spray rise up from the icy surface, according to data from the Cassini space probe, bringing with them traces of organic molecules that could be signs of life or the potential for it. * * * Unicorn farts – We’ve had another glimpse at Elon Musk’s ugly side after his Tesla company ripped off a farting unicorn. Colorado potter Tom Edwards started making his unicorn mugs in 2010 and was initially thrilled to find out Musk was a fan, until realising the image was being used without his permission in Tesla promotional material.
“He can sue for money if he wants, but that’s kinda lame,” Musk told Edwards’s daughter in an exchange on Twitter. Edwards has lawyers on the case: “He [Musk] is really really interesting. But he isn’t above copyright law.” World Cup Our live blog is under way and there is plenty to talk about. The curse of the defending champions struck again with Germany becoming the fourth winner of the last five tournaments to crash out during the group stages. Backlash has been swift and predictably furious among both fans and the German media, with leading newspaper Bild contrasting the nation’s shock exit with the elation experienced four years ago with its 7-1 decimation of then hosts Brazil. Former national team player and Guardian columnist Thomas Hitzlsperger struggled to process a result that in his own words left him “completely empty”. It was jubilation for Mexican fans, however, who earned an unexpected reprieve following their side’s disappointing 3-0 capitulation to Sweden. They will now progress as Group F runners-up at the expense of Germany. Elsewhere, fellow tournament favourites Brazil navigated a tricky fixture against Serbia thanks to goals from Paulinho and Thiago Silva, while Switzerland drew with a resurgent Costa Rica to set up a knockout round encounter with Sweden. All eyes turn to tonight’s Group G and H final fixtures, as England and Belgium jockey for second spot, and the chance to avoid a potential quarter-final showdown with Brazil, but Gareth Southgate is adamant his side will play to win. He also expressed himself “hugely fortunate” to be in charge, fearing he’d spurned his chance when he turned down the job two years ago. Lunchtime read: Ukip goes further right That Ukip these days needs the likes of “Sargon of Akkad”, “Count Dankula” and an editor from InfoWars to prop up its numbers could seem a reassuring confirmation of the party’s irrelevance after Brexit. “All three,” writes Nesrine Malik, “have built their reputations and social media following primarily by spreading conspiracy theories.”
“Unable to woo back its old voters with the carrot of Brexit, Ukip’s last manifesto focused on trying to mop up the most hardcore anti-immigration sentiment by more clearly spelling out an anti-Muslim agenda. How much the party accepts these far-right individuals will be a good indication of what Ukip is prepared to do to stay relevant – and also how much its new members’ support can be leveraged. These individuals could either be a kiss of death for Ukip … or a shot in the arm.” Sport Andy Murray is still to confirm whether he’ll return at Wimbledon, but the Scot did not disgrace himself as he built fitness in a 6-4, 6-4 loss to Kyle Edmund. On the eve of the Austrian Grand Prix, local team Red Bull Racing remain hopeful a new engine may entice Daniel Ricciardo to remain with them, amid ongoing speculation the Australian could join a rival next season. England’s cricket team has produced the same standard of excellence that saw it sweep the five-match ODI series against Australia in a one-off ODI, with Jos Buttler once again leading the way. And gymnast Aly Raisman has spoken of the “exhausting and traumatizing” after-effects of abuse at the hands of disgraced former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. Nassar was sentenced to up to 300 years in prison for his crimes. Business Asian markets have been mixed, with White House statements on trade leaving investors divided on whether the administration is interested in soothing tensions with China. Sterling has been buying $1.311 and €1.133 overnight. The papers “May insists Brexit talks still on track ahead of key EU summit” is the Guardian splash. The Telegraph (“Britain heading for ‘worst’ Brexit deal”) and the Express (“Fury at Blair bid to wreck Brexit”) also have Brexit on their fronts. The latter also wins the prize for the best front page take on Germany’s defeat at the World Cup, with “Don’t mention the score”.
The Sun leads with the defeat of Germany, with its headline laid out like a dictionary definition: “Schadenfreude: Pleasure derived from another person’s misfortune” over a photo of the devastated German World Cup side. “The death of free banking”, says the Mail on a story about how big banks make a profit from almost all customer accounts. The Times has, “China in driving seat to control HS2 trains”, the FT leads with “John Lewis profits collapse as retail woe moves up high street” and the Mirror features the Moorlands fire, with the headline “Fire fight”.

2018-06-28T05:08:41Z,world,World news,"Company that builds 'floating islands' offers $100,000 bounty to any takers","A company attempting to build floating man-made islands as a means of adapting to climate change have offered $100,000 to start-ups and entrepreneurs able to convince their government to host a floating island in their seas. Blue Frontiers had been in discussions with French Polynesia to build a prototype of a floating island in their territory. However, after protests and opposition the government said it would no longer pursue the project or pilot island with the company. Now, it has launched a desperate global campaign to find a new host country that will allow it to build sustainable floating island communities, which it promotes as a solution to urban overcrowding, and a means of mitigating the threat of sea-level rise. The concept has been criticised by sustainable development experts, who say the islands would exclusively cater to the privileged and wealthy, and create an “apartheid of the worst kind”. The concept and philosophy of the movement has become known as “seasteading”, with the floating communities having a unique form of government, independent of the host nation. Greenhouses, restaurants, homes, hotels and offices would all be built on the islands. PayPal co-founder and New Zealand citizen Peter Thiel contributed seed funding to the Seasteading Institute, which later launched Blue Frontiers. “Between cyberspace and outer space lies the possibility of settling the oceans,” wrote Thiel in a 2009 essay. To enter the competition entrepreneurs need to secure “a general letter of invitation from a government official” in their home country, as well as submit photos and videos of the proposed floating island site, and pass a background check. The top 10 entrepreneurs will visit the company’s base in Rotterdam, before a winner will be chosen “once your host government passes the legislation required to implement the pilot project, you will be awarded 100,000 Varyon [a cryptocurrency] immediately, and $100,000 USD once the pilot is actually built.” The floating island would bring $60m in investment to the host nation, Blue Frontiers said. According to the competition website, entrepreneurs who have already entered hail from Vanuatu, Cambodia, the Maldives, Vietnam, Columbia and Mexico, among others. “Seventy per cent of the planet is water, not tamed by civilisation” says the competition video. “Are you ready to build on the next frontier?” Floating islands have long been discussed as a potential solution to sea-level rise, particularly in the South Pacific Islands. In 2011 then-president of Kiribati Anote Tong said he was seriously considering moving his country’s entire population of 100,000 people to floating islands resembling oil rigs. “The last time I saw the models, I was like ‘wow it’s like science fiction, almost like something in space. So modern, I don’t know if our people could live on it,” Tong said the the time, addressing the Pacific Islands Forum. “But what would you do for your grandchildren? If you’re faced with the option of being submerged, with your family, would you jump on an oil rig like that? And [I] think the answer is ‘yes’” Around the globe, Holland, Japan, Dubai, and Hong Kong have all built artificial islands for airports or new housing.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/28/company-that-builds-floating-islands-offers-100000-bounty-to-any-takers,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/28/company-that-builds-floating-islands-offers-100000-bounty-to-any-takers
2018-06-28T05:00:50Z,world,World news,"China caps film star pay, citing 'money worship' and fake contracts","Chinese authorities are capping the salaries of celebrities, blaming the entertainment industry for encouraging “money worship” and “distorting social values”. The salaries of on-screen performers should be capped at 40% of the total production costs, according to a joint notice from five government agencies including China’s tax authority, the television and film regulator, and the propaganda department. Leading actors should receive no more than 70% of total wages for the cast, according to the announcement, published in Xinhua. The directive – the same as guidelines released last year by the China Alliance of Radio Film and Television – comes after a series of Chinese celebrities were accused of signing fake contracts to evade taxes. In May a well-connected Chinese TV presenter, Cui Yongyuan, posted photos of contracts believed to belong to Fan Bingbing, one of the country’s highest paid actors. The contracts, one for $1.56m and another for $7.8m, were meant to be an illustration of “yin-yang contracts”, a common method of tax evasion in which only the smaller contract is reported to authorities.
Fan has denied any wrongdoing while Cui has accused other celebrities of the same behaviour. Tax authorities in Jiangsu province, where Fan runs a film studio, said this month they were investigating tax evasion by “certain film and television professionals as alleged in online discussions”. Wednesday’s directive criticised the use of yin-yang contracts, saying they damage not only the quality of the country’s film industry but encourage China’s youth to “blindly chase stars”. The notice said the industry should put social benefits foremost: “Box office ratings and click-through rates should be firmly opposed.” Chinese regulators have been working on reining in the entertainment and film industry, especially online content. Chinese citizens may support the restrictions, as many have grown critical of the exorbitant salaries of the country’s stars. “Society has given them too much and look at what they give back,” one Weibo user wrote in response to news of the salary caps. Others were supportive but sceptical of any real change: “Thunder sounds loud while the raindrops are small. Other departments have made such announcements before.” Chinese propaganda authorities are wary of too much debate.

2018-06-28T05:00:06Z,world,World news,MoD campaign to stop killing of songbirds on Cyprus hailed a success,"When Britain’s armed forces minister, Mark Lancaster, assumed office he was surprised by the amount of letters in his mailbag regarding an issue the military would not ordinarily address. One after the other spoke of the killing of migratory songbirds on Cyprus. Hundreds of thousands of robins, blackcaps, thrushes and other much-loved garden species were being illegally slaughtered by trappers on Ministry of Defence land. Was there nothing he could do? Lancaster, who served in Cyprus during a gap year commission in the army in 1987, resolved to right the wrong. He made good on the promise last weekend. Under a baking sun, on the easternmost edge of the British sovereign base area of Dhekelia, Lancaster witnessed the weapons being deployed in the battle to curb a practice blamed for the death of more than 800,000 birds on the military facility in 2016 alone. “Today we are here to mark a success story,” he told the Guardian. “I was getting a huge number of letters expressing concern and it is very nice to be able to report back that there has been such a reduction.” There was a 72% drop in the illegal killing of birds in the area over the last year, which Lancaster, who continues to serve in the army reserves as a colonel, said “demonstrates the wider utility of defence above and beyond military action”. Cyprus’s resident infantry, currently the 2nd Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment, supporting the police-led crackdown, more usually prides itself on its high readiness to respond to threats in the Middle East. And the base’s police force ordinarily focuses on counter-terrorism and maritime crime. Poaching was once a cottage industry, the result of a traditional fondness for the island delicacy ambelopoulia. But it has expanded into industrial-scale organised crime, and the black market culinary industry is now worth millions of pounds. Birds are subjected to agonising deaths on glue-coated sticks or in fine mist nets that trappers deploy.
“I’m told that 12 birds are potentially sold for €60 (£53), ” said Lancaster, standing under a tent pitched on scrubland in the firing range at Cape Pyla, where the confiscated paraphernalia of trappers had been laid out for him, along with equipment used by police. “Its very encouraging that we have had success but we are not going to be complacent. We will continue.” No other place in Cyprus is targeted as much by poachers as the British base area. The historic lack of development has not only turned the territory into an area of outstanding natural beauty but one of special conservation, home to unique habitats and species. Migratory birds en route from Africa to Europe instinctively head towards Cape Pyla as they navigate around the bright lights of Larnaka and the resort of Ayia Napa. From August to October, base authorities have their work cut out for them. The war has become increasingly high-tech. In the last year, thermal-imaging drones, night-vision goggles and hidden cameras have been deployed by police on the base, who are also equipped with stun guns. In their headgear and bulletproof vests, officers working with forces personnel conduct “Operation Freedom” with the precision of a military campaign. The equivalent of 45 football pitches of purposely planted fast-growing acacia trees, used to conceal nets and capture birds, have been destroyed. Just under 45 miles (70km) of illegal water pipes, employed to irrigate the non-native trees, were removed last year. Fines have also been augmented, and legislation bolstering prosecution will be passed by August, when the next migratory season begins. But while a great deal of equipment used by trappers has also been seized, including electronic calling devices used to lure the birds, the poachers remain determined. “This is not Surrey-on-sea” said the military base’s police chief constable, Chris Eyre. “These people are not afraid to use firearms. Our field officers face huge risk.” Ambushes are common, with officers reporting fights, and worse, when they encounter trappers. Several have been injured. “We’ve had shotguns fired at our feet, rottweilers let loose on us, vehicles that have tried to run us over, all because we have taken a more robust approach,” said Sgt Andy Adamou, who was honoured during Lancaster’s visit for the courage he had shown during one especially tense showdown. “They see us as a threat to their livelihoods. And as long as there is demand, there will be the need for supply.” In theory, the Cypriot government prohibits the illegal trade. But the delicacy is readily available, albeit behind the counter and usually camouflaged by lettuce leaves, in villages across the island. Some island officials have openly bragged that the industry helped pay their children’s education fees in Britain and beyond. “To beat the target we have already achieved is going to be tough,” said Michalis Zacharia, the police officer in charge of the bird crime team. “We are going to have to come face to face with criminal elements and you never know how they will react. Our only form of protection are the Tasers, but we are determined and we are going to do it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/28/ministry-defence-campaign-stop-killing-songbirds-cyprus-success,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/28/ministry-defence-campaign-stop-killing-songbirds-cyprus-success
2018-06-28T04:21:45Z,world,World news,"Timor-Leste bugging whistleblower faces criminal charges, MP says","Criminal charges have been filed against the spy-turned-whistleblower who revealed Australia had bugged Timor-Leste’s cabinet rooms, federal parliament has been told. The independent MP Andrew Wilkie has used parliamentary privilege to claim the man, a former employee of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service known only as Witness K, and his lawyer, Bernard Collaery, were being targeted. “The commonwealth director of public prosecutions has filed criminal charges against Collaery and his client,” he told the House of Representatives on Thursday.
“This is obviously an insane development in its own right.” At a press conference after the speech Collaery said he and Witness K were both charged with conspiracy to breach section 39 of the Intelligence Services Act for allegedly communicating information they obtained in the course of employment or an agreement with Asis. “There is no allegation by the commonwealth director of public prosecutions of any national security breach,” he said. In a statement the attorney general, Christian Porter, confirmed Witness K had been charged with “an offence” under that section and Collaery with “further offences” under the same. Collaery said Witness K was not a whistleblower because he “went with his complaint to the inspector general of intelligence and security” and received approval to disclose the alleged bugging. Similarly, Collaery said he had received approval to act for Timor Leste in international proceedings. Collaery said the case was “unprecedented” and meant that Australia was “not a safe country to represent another sovereign power any more”. He said the Australian government risks a judgment that Asis’s actions in bugging the cabinet rooms were unlawful. He was constrained in what he could say about the case because his summons to the ACT magistrates court was accompanied by an anti-terrorism legislation gag order. He said the charge was a summary offence with a maximum two years in prison. He did not fear prison, but rather believed the charge amounted to “a vindictive prosecution to ruin my reputation and career”. The case will begin with a directions hearing on 25 July in which the court will consider whether to hear it in private. Collaery blasted the commonwealth for seeking a closed hearing, describing publicity as the “soul of justice” and encouraging media companies to join him in opposing the application. Witness K has been denied a passport since 2012 and been unable to leave Australia. The former Asis agent was a key witness for Timor-Leste in a case against Australia over allegations Dili’s cabinet rooms were bugged during negotiations over a gas and oil treaty in 2004. Witness K was supposed to give evidence at the permanent court of arbitration in the Hague but was unable to leave Australia because his passport was seized in 2012. Timor-Leste dropped the spy case against Australia last year as an act of goodwill ahead of signing a new resources treaty. “With the diplomacy out of the way it’s time to bury the bodies,” Wilkie said. “This government wants to turn the former Asis officer and his lawyer into criminals.” Wilkie said the intelligence operation to bug Timor-Leste cabinet room was “illegal” and “unscrupulous” because Australia had used spy tactics to deprive Timor-Leste of its oil and gas revenue. The Greens senator Nick McKim questioned why the attorney general had given sign-off for the prosecution, arguing it was “hard to escape the conclusion [the case] is politically motivated”. Wilkie and McKim both pledged to use parliamentary privilege to shed light on the case. Porter said the commonwealth director of public prosecutions made an “independent decision that a prosecution was the appropriate course of action” and he then provided consent. “Having formally confirmed the process regarding these matters, I can also confirm that I will not be providing detailed comment on their substance and that is because the matters are now before the court,” he said. Last year Collaery called for a Senate inquiry. The two countries signed the treaty in March, carving up $56bn in potential revenue from oil and gas reserves in the Timor sea. Timor-Leste, one of the world’s most impoverished nations, will reap between 70% and 80% of the revenue from the Greater Sunrise fields under the agreement.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/28/timor-leste-bugging-whistleblower-faces-criminal-charges-mp-says,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/28/timor-leste-bugging-whistleblower-faces-criminal-charges-mp-says
2018-06-28T00:03:57Z,world,World news,"Cambodian PM now 'fully fledged military dictator', says report","Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen has become a “fully fledged military dictator” according to Human Rights Watch in a report released on Thursday investigating the extent of his personal control over the military and the police. The new report, Cambodia’s Dirty Dozen, names the 12 military personnel who have been the “backbone” of Hun Sen’s “abusive and authoritarian political regime,” which he has led since 1985. According to the report, Hun Sen has “remained in power by creating a cadre of ruthless members of the security forces to implement his vision and orders”. While Hun Sen while has always been notorious for his autocratic rule – his official title is princely exalted supreme great commander of gloriously victorious troops – and his use of force against anyone who defied him, his crackdown on the opposition, the media and civil society has escalated in the past year in the build up to elections in July.
“Hun Sen really has become a fully-fledged military dictator, a fact that he hopes to hide behind the fig-leaf of a national election in July that will be neither free nor fair,” said Phil Roberton, deputy director of Human Rights Asia. Last year Hun Sen dissolved the opposition party, the CNRP, shut down the Cambodia Daily newspaper, Radio Free Asia and dozens of local radio stations. Journalists, opposition politicians and civil society leaders are now in jail and an atmosphere of fear and self-censorship has gripped the country. Hun Sen was able to carry out the brutal crackdown in less than six months without any backlash, because of his control over 12 senior military and police commanders and their subordinates. Twelve different institutions, from the supreme court, to local courts and government ministries, were used to implement the crackdown. With no legitimate opposition, Hun Sen’s victory in the elections is now seen as a foregone conclusion. “What this report reveals is the deep military roots that characterise Hun Sen’s rule,” said Roberton. “At each step of the way in his years in power, Hun Sen has sought to centralise control over the military and police under his direct command, aided by this group of dangerous men.” Many of this group of 12 – which includes General Pol Saroeun, supreme commander of the royal Cambodian armed forces and General Neth Savoeun, supreme commander of the Cambodian national police – served in the Khmer Rouge military with Hun Sen, the Communist regime which saw the execution, starvation, and disease of an estimated 1.2 to 2.8 million Cambodians (between 13 and 30% of the population) between 1975 and 1979. The Human Rights Watch report lays out how most of these men have been “implicated in the use of unnecessary, excessive, and sometimes lethal force against protesters” and have been involved in “non-political abuses against the ordinary population, such as land-takings, murder, torture, and arbitrary detention.”
The complete absence of separation between military and politics is seen in the fact that hundreds of police and military now sit on the central committee of Hun Sen’s party, and that Hun Sen’s bodyguard unit – a military force personally under his control and out of the usual chain of command – went from having around 60 people in it in the mid-1990s, to having around 23,000 soldiers by 2015, according to Lee Morgenbesser, an expert on authoritarian regimes in southeast Asia. Hun Sen’s crackdown, carried out when he feared the opposition was gaining too much popularity in the lead up to the election, was made possible by broader international circumstance.China is investing billions into Cambodia as part of its belt and road initiative, and is willing to back Hun Sen’s authoritarian regime; they have already declared that the election in July will be “free and fair”. The Trump administration in the US are also no longer holding the regimes in Cambodia and Vietnam to account over human rights abuses, as happened under President Obama. “To put it simply, this American administration don’t care about human rights and democracy in southeast Asia and that gave a pretext for Hun Sen’s crackdown,” said Morgenbesser. “The game has changed now . He almost doesn’t need to feign legitimacy to the US administration anymore about this election being ‘democratic’ – no one there is paying attention anymore.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/28/cambodian-pm-hun-sen-fully-fledged-military-dictator-says-report,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/28/cambodian-pm-hun-sen-fully-fledged-military-dictator-says-report
2018-06-27T21:31:53Z,world,World news,Syria's role in chemical weapons attacks to be investigated,"The Syrian government’s alleged role in a wave of chemical weapons attacks during the country’s civil war will be investigated, it has been confirmed. Members of the world chemical weapons watchdog agreed to expand its powers to identify those behind the attacks in the past three years. Meeting in the Hague, more than 140 countries affiliated to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) voted by 82 to 24 to expand the body’s powers from simply investigating whether a chemical attack had occurred, to attributing responsibility. A challenging two thirds majority had been required, but the threshold was reached easily. The result was hailed on Twitter by the UK ambassador to the OPCW, Peter Wilson, as “an overwhelming majority to restore the taboo against chemical weapons”. The resolution, largely promoted by Britain and other western powers, specifically called for the OPCW to “put in place arrangements to identify the perpetrators of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic by identifying and reporting on all information potentially relevant to the origin of those chemical weapons”. Expressing concern , it said: “the use of such chemical weapons by the Syrian Arab Republic, by direct implication, establishes that the Syrian Arab Republic failed to declare and destroy all of its chemical weapons and chemical weapons production facilities. The resolution demanded “that the Syrian Arab Republic immediately cease all use of chemical weapons and declare all of the chemical weapons it possesses, including sarin and its precursors”.
More generally the motion said in future, and not just in Syria, there was “added value” in the OPCW secretariat investigating alleged use of chemical weapons “with a view to facilitating universal attribution of all chemical weapons attacks”. A rival motion, promoted by Russia and China, calling for the OPCW to undertake special missions without specifically widening the organisation’s narrow technical mandate was withdrawn once it became clear it commanded little support. Four other amendments promoted by Russia and its allies which tried to water down the UK proposals were all thrown out. The votes represent a diplomatic success for Britain, but leave Russia, Iran and Syria claiming that the OPCW is being politicised by the west. Russia said it would make no immediate decision on whether to quit the group, but its industry minister, Georgy Kalamanov, called its future into question and said the OPCW was “a Titanic which is leaking and has started to sink”. Russia is Syria’s closest political ally, and has repeatedly used international forums, including the UN security council, to block independent investigations into chemical weapons attacks allegedly launched by the regime of president Bashar al-Assad. Boris Johnson, the UK foreign secretary, welcomed the outcome of the OPCW vote on Wednesday, saying chemical weapons were “an affront to human dignity.” “The international community has quite rightly come together today to strengthen the ban on chemical weapons and prevent impunity for their use,” he said. The OPCW has yet to report into whether it found samples of chemical weapons in an alleged chemical attack in Douma in April that led to the reported deaths of more than 70 people.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/opcw-granted-powers-to-identify-source-of-chemical-attacks-in-syria,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/opcw-granted-powers-to-identify-source-of-chemical-attacks-in-syria
2018-06-27T21:24:12Z,world,World news,Najib raids: $273m of goods seized from former Malaysian PM's properties,"Malaysian police have seized a cache of jewellery, handbags and watches worth up to $273m (£207m) in a series of raids on houses of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak. Police commissioner Amar Singh confirmed that in the raids on six properties linked to Najib and his wife Rosmah Mansor, as part of the 1MDB investigation, the police seized a treasure trove of expensive goods, including 1,400 necklaces, 567 handbags, 423 watches, 2,200 rings, 1,600 brooches and 14 tiaras. Police described it as the biggest seizure in Malaysian history. The total market value of the goods was estimated to be between $223m and $275m.
“About 12,000 jewellery [items] were seized worth RM440m,” said Singh, adding that it had taken 16 days to count the value of them all. The most expensive item was a gold and diamond necklace worth $1.6m. The value of the Hermes handbags alone was $12.7m, while the watches, which were from 100 different makes including Rolex, Richard Mille and Chopard, were valued at $19m. 274 pairs of designer sunglasses, made by brands such as Cartier, Versace and Dior, were also part of the seized stash. The raid on Najib’s properties are part of the ongoing investigation into his role into the 1MDB scandal where billions of dollars were embezzled from a government fund and fraudulently spent. $681m of 1MDB money went into Najib’s personal bank account, where it is alleged it was used to fund the lavish spending habits of Najib and his wife. He has denied responsibility. Najib was cleared of all wrongdoing when he was prime minister in an investigation widely viewed as a cover-up, but since he lost power in May, the new government, led by 92-year-old prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, has made a renewed 1MDB investigation the priority. Mahathir said last week that they had an almost “perfect case” against Najib on charges such as bribery, theft of government funds and embezzlement. It is thought his arrest is now imminent.
The large amount of jewellery seized in the raid also puts the spotlight further on the role of Rosmah in 1MDB. She has denied putting any pressure on Najib to provide funding for her ostentatious lifestyle, but a profile in the Wall Street Journal this week claimed that her “pursuit of the trappings of wealth played a crucial part in pushing Najib’s administration deeper into graft, ultimately leading to the government’s downfall”. The report alleged that she had been the one to set up the connection to Jho Low, the Malaysian businessman at the centre of the 1MDB embezzlement allegations, and led efforts to block the 1MDB investigations. Rosmah denies these claims. Mahathir said this week it was hard to prove Rosmah’s involvement as her signature, unlike Najib’s, was not on any 1MDB documents.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/najib-raids-273m-of-goods-seized-from-former-malaysian-pms-properties,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/najib-raids-273m-of-goods-seized-from-former-malaysian-pms-properties
2018-06-27T20:41:20Z,world,World news,"Abortion rights in 'dire, immediate danger' as Anthony Kennedy retires","The US supreme court legalized abortion in 1973. Now, 45 years later, activists say the departure of the court’s moderate, Justice Anthony Kennedy, represents the most direct threat to reproductive freedom since abortion was legalized.
Pro-choice advocates said Kennedy’s retirement represents a “dire, immediate danger” to women’s reproductive freedom. Though the supreme court is not expected to rule on abortion matters in the near future, all of the potential nominees shortlisted by the Trump administration are believed to be jurists who would overturn the landmark decision, Roe v Wade, given the opportunity. “Today, Justice Kennedy announced his retirement, and because President Trump will nominate the next supreme court justice, a woman’s constitutional right to access legal abortion is in dire, immediate danger – along with the fundamental rights of all Americans,” said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America.
“Our country faces a moment of deep crisis – a crisis of rights, of values and of leadership,” she said. “The deeply-divided decisions from the supreme court this week are a clear warning that our most cherished values are in jeopardy, and now hang in the balance. Women will not go back to the days when abortion was illegal in this country.” Anti-abortion activists, meanwhile, described Kennedy’s retirement as a turning point in the movement. “Justice Kennedy’s retirement from the supreme court makes a pivotal moment for the fight to ensure every unborn child is welcomed and protected under the law,” said Susan B Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser. For decades, American anti-abortion activists have chipped away at reproductive freedoms, as legislatures piled on restrictions. That strategy was developed, in part, to avoid court decisions that could strengthen Roe’s precedent. Kennedy’s retirement is likely to further embolden anti-abortion activists, who have already started to pass some of the world’s most restrictive anti-abortion laws. For example, in Iowa, activists successfully passed a ban on abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, roughly six weeks into a pregnancy. That is before most women know they are pregnant. At the time, activists intended for the law to end up in court, which it has, where it could be appealed to higher and higher courts. Eventually, they hoped, it would land in the supreme court. Trump has also made dozens of conservative nominations to lower courts, making it more likely for Roe to be challenged in the supreme court. Kennedy’s departure is Trump’s second opportunity to nominate a justice to a lifetime supreme court seat. There are nine justices, four conservative and four liberal. Kennedy, 82, considered a moderate conservative, was an unpredictable swing vote. Trump pledged to use the same shortlist of justices released when he nominated his first supreme court justice, conservative Neil Gorsuch. The list was assembled with help from the Federalist Society, an anti-abortion, conservative legal organization.
Among those on the shortlist is William Pryor, an Alabama judge who once called Roe the “worst abomination in the history of constitutional law”. He also wrote that the decision “led to the slaughter of millions of innocent unborn children”. Another shortlisted judge is Charles Canady of Florida. As a congressman, Canady coined the term “partial birth abortion” to describe the surgical procedure, and introduced a bill to ban the practice in 1995. The bill was vetoed by former president Bill Clinton, but later approved by former president George W Bush. “We also know that for decades, a multimillion-dollar, extreme, anti-choice movement has quietly and aggressively chipped away at that right in state legislatures, in lower courts, and now from within the Trump administration,” said Hogue. “Their stated goal, clearly and loudly, is overturning Roe v Wade.” Since Trump took office, he has instituted a “global gag rule” that bars doctors receiving US aid from providing abortion information, created a department to protect health workers who have religious objections to procedures or policies, and Republicans have moved to defund Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest women’s healthcare provider.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/abortion-rights-immediate-danger-anthony-kennedy-retires,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/abortion-rights-immediate-danger-anthony-kennedy-retires
2018-06-27T19:14:33Z,world,World news,Mexican police force armed with slingshots after guns confiscated,"Police in a troubled Mexican municipality have been equipped with slingshots and stones after state officials stripped officers of their weapons. Only 30 officers of the 130-member police department in Alvarado, on Mexico’s Gulf Coast, have passed control tests and been deemed fit for service, prompting the Veracruz state public secretariat to disarm the force, media reported.
Mayor Bogar Ruiz Rosas said the force was made up of mostly new hires, who were scheduled to start training in the state police academy. Mexican media showed the mayor handing out catapults and small bags of rocks to officers, in a symbolic act of protest. He insisted the disarming of local police in Alvarado was a political vendetta ahead of the 1 July elections on the national and state levels. “This can only be understood as something political and we have to be prepared to do work in a professional manner,” Ruiz said in a ceremony, where he handed police officers slingshots and small bags of rocks.
The state governor, Miguel Ángel Yunes Linares, who belongs to a rival party and whose son is running to replace him, told media a council coordinating security in the state confiscated the force’s weapons because its members were not accredited. Veracruz has been the setting for a string of horrors over the past decade, including forced disappearances, mass graves containing the remains of hundreds of people and the murders of at least 20 journalists.
Yunes’ predecessor as state governor, Javier Duarte, was detained on corruption charges, while his former prosecutor and public security secretary have been arrested on accusations of participating in schemes to commit forced disappearances. The online news organisation Animal Politico noted the slingshot ceremony took place near a site where 47 skulls had been discovered in a clandestine grave. Fixing police forces across Mexico has also proved difficult – something analysts attribute to politicians preferring to pawn off security problems on the army rather than investing in local law enforcement.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/mexico-police-slingshots-alvarado-veracruz,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/mexico-police-slingshots-alvarado-veracruz
2018-06-27T18:41:43Z,world,World news,"EU must 'prepare for worst-case scenarios' under Trump, top official warns","Donald Trump has been accused by the European Union of pioneering a new American doctrine in which there are “no friends, only enemies”. Ahead of what is set to be a stormy Nato summit next week – and with EU leaders gathering in Brussels to discuss a developing transatlantic trade war among other issues – the bloc’s most senior officials expressed deep anxiety about the future.
The European Council’s president, Donald Tusk, said the EU had to now prepare for the worst due to the policies of Trump’s White House. Tusk is planning to engage in a discussion with the leaders of the 28 member states on Thursday. Given the impending trade war, a US decision to renege on the Iran deal and the Paris climate change pact, and the repeated attack on European allies for underspending on defence, there are concerns in Brussels over the long-term stability of the relationship. Indeed it is feared that the US change in attitude could outlast Trump’s presidency. There is also concern among British officials in Westminster over Trump’s foreign policy, particularly his impending meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. A senior Kremlin aide said on Wednesday that a time and location for the summit had been agreed and would be announced on Thursday. In a pre-summit invitation letter to the leaders of EU countries, Tusk wrote that “trans-Atlantic relations are under immense pressure due to the policies of President Trump”. A senior EU official added: “We are more and more concerned that these are not just incidents, it starts to look like a pattern. The pattern of an American doctrine in which there are no friends only enemies.” The US has slapped punitive tariffs on EU steel and aluminium on grounds of national security. The EU has hit back with “rebalancing measures” that hit around €2.8bn ($3.25bn) worth of American-made products. Trump has, in turn, warned in recent days that a study into the allegedly skewed trading relationship on cars, in which German manufacturers are said to have an advantage, will soon be published. The US president previously suggested that he would like to effectively ban the sale of Mercedes-Benz, Audi and other German cars. Tusk said, however, in his letter to leaders before the two day summit in Brussels that “unfortunately, the divisions go beyond trade”. He said: “It is my belief that, while hoping for the best, we must be ready to prepare our Union for worst-case scenarios.” Earlier this month, Trump launched an unprecedented attack on Angela Merkel’s government, tweeting that “the people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition”. With Brussels seeking to find a consensus among its members on how to deal with migration from Africa and elsewhere, Tusk writes: “There are voices in Europe and around the world claiming that our inefficiency in maintaining the external border is an inherent feature of the European Union, or – more broadly – of liberal democracy. “We have seen the creation of new political movements, which offer simple answers to the most complicated questions. Simple, radical and attractive. The migration crisis provides them with a growing number of arguments.
“More and more people are starting to believe that only strong-handed authority, anti-European and anti-liberal in spirit, with a tendency towards overt authoritarianism, is capable of stopping the wave of illegal migration.” “If people believe them, that only they can offer an effective solution to the migration crisis, they will also believe anything else they say. The stakes are very high. And time is short.” The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has been formally invited to Washington DC to discuss trading relations, although a spokesman in Brussels said a date had yet to be fixed. Trump called Juncker “brutal” during a recent G7 meeting, where the US president appeared determined to isolate himself from his western allies.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/eu-must-prepare-for-worst-case-scenarios-under-trump-top-official-warns,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/eu-must-prepare-for-worst-case-scenarios-under-trump-top-official-warns
2018-06-27T18:23:39Z,world,World news,Syrian forces' push into east Daraa 'could spark humanitarian crisis',"A new Syrian government offensive to recapture rebel territory in the south-west of the country is endangering the fragile peace process and could provoke a humanitarian crisis worse than that which followed the siege of Aleppo, a senior UN official has warned. Staffan de Mistura, the special envoy for Syria, told the UN’s security council the attack by Syrian armed forces, backed by Iranian militia, would put more than 750,000 lives at risk. He said more than 45,000 people had already been displaced. The Russian-backed assault is in one of the “de-escalation zones” that were painstakingly negotiated for by the US, Jordan and Russia last year. The zones were hailed as a sign of Washington-Moscow cooperation by Donald Trump on the sidelines of last year’s G20 summit in Hamburg. But the Syrian government forces appear to be trying to divide the rebel forces in east Daraa as part of an attempt to retake the area. The region was the birthplace of the Syrian revolution and is diplomatically sensitive because it borders Lebanon, Jordan and Israel. Israel will not tolerate having Iranian militia so close to its border. De Mistura said the attacks had the potential to be as lethal as the sieges of Aleppo and eastern Goutha combined. He said the assault was also likely to put back the delicate progress he had made on building diplomatic support for a new Syrian constitution. Speaking to the UN after De Mistura’s briefing, the US deputy ambassador to the UN, Jonathan Cohen, dismissed claims from Russia that it was seeking to de-escalate the crisis, and instead accused Moscow of mounting some of the airstrikes. “The United States is deeply concerned by the Syrian regime’s new offensive – with direct support from Russia – in the south-west, where ongoing airstrikes, barrel bombs, artillery and rocket attacks are taking a significant toll on the civilian population,” Cohen said. He said the region had enjoyed relative calm for almost a year because all parties were abiding by the de-escalation zone. “Once again, Russia is justifying a military offensive by the Assad regime by saying that more than half the de-escalation zone is controlled by terrorists. That is just not true. The predominant armed opposition groups operating in the de-escalation zone belong to the moderate Free Syrian Army”.
It is unlikely, however, that the US will intervene militarily to protect the opposition fighters. Thousands of civilians have streamed towards makeshift camps and shelters along Syria’s south-western border but the refugees are unable to enter Jordan because the Jordanian government has closed it. Moscow is interested in brokering a deal in which Israel allows the Syrian army to take back control of the region, on the understanding that Iranian forces withdraw. But Israeli diplomats are dubious that Russia can deliver on this pledge. The Norwegian Refugee Council has urged Jordan to take in thousands of Syrians who it says have “nowhere else to turn” as they flee from the Bashar al-Assad’s forces. It said Jordan could not be expected to shoulder the burden alone. Instead, the international community must “offer substantial support”. Aid groups are ready to help potential new arrivals settle in Jordan’s Azraq camp, which could accept 80,000 more people, the council said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/syria-assad-forces-eastern-daraa-humanitarian-crisis-un,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/syria-assad-forces-eastern-daraa-humanitarian-crisis-un
2018-06-27T18:00:46Z,world,World news,China’s social credit system ‘could interfere in other nations’ sovereignty’,"China’s social credit system, a big-data system for monitoring and shaping business and citizens’ behaviour, is reaching beyond China’s borders to impact foreign companies, according to new research. The system, which has been compared to an Orwellian tool of mass surveillance, is an ambitious work in progress: a series of big data and AI-enabled processes that effectively grant subjects a social credit score based on their social, political and economic behaviour. People with low scores can be banned or blacklisted from accessing services including flights and train travel; while those with high scores can access privileges. The Chinese government aims to have all 1.35 billion of its citizens subject to the system by 2020. But a new report by US China scholar Samantha Hoffman for the ASPI International Cyber Policy Institute in Canberra claims the system’s impact beyond China’s borders has not been well understood, and is in fact already shaping the behaviour of foreign businesses in line with Chinese Communist party preferences. It has the “potential to interfere directly in the sovereignty of other nations”, she said.
She said recent incidents where Chinese authorities pressured international airlines in the US and Australia to use Beijing’s preferred terminology to refer to Taiwan and Hong Kong were high-profile examples of this new extension of the social credit system rules to foreign companies. “The civil aviation industry credit management measures that the airlines are accused of violating were written to implement two key policy guidelines on establishing China’s social credit system,” she explains. “Social credit was used specifically in these cases to compel international airlines to acknowledge and adopt the CCP’s version of the truth, and so repress alternative perspectives on Taiwan.” As of 1 January 2018, all companies with a Chinese business licence – a necessity for operating in the country – were brought into the social credit system through the new licence requirement to have an 18-digit “unified social credit code”. Through this business ID number, the Chinese government keeps track of all businesses, reporting transgressions on its National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System, Hoffman said. The system extends to non-profits, NGOs, trade unions and social organisations after 30 June. “Companies don’t have a choice but to comply if they want to continue doing business in China,” Hoffman told the Guardian Australia. Sanctions for companies so far have come in the form of fines, she said, citing the example of the Japanese retailer Muji, which was fined 200,000 yuan in May for labelling on products sold in China that listed Taiwan as a country. The fine cited a violation of PRC advertising law banning activity which damages “the dignity or interests of the state”, but the violation was also recorded on the social credit system’s National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System. This listing can trigger further fines from other state agencies, Hoffman said. It is not clear whether foreign companies have access to the information kept on their social credit record, nor if foreign citizens could find out if their nation’s companies have made concessions or changed their behaviour as a result. Guardian Australia unsuccessfully sought comment from Qantas, which announced earlier this month it would change the language used on its global websites in accordance with the Chinese government’s preferred terminology for Taiwan. Hoffman is a visiting academic fellow at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. Her report, Social Credit: Technology-enhanced Authoritarian Control with Global Consequences, was published on Thursday by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a security-focused thinktank which has urged the Australian government take a harder line on Chinese government interference in its democracy.
The report comes amid a difficult period in Australia-China relations; in the same week Australia’s parliamentary committee released a bipartisan report paving the way for the passage of new draft laws against covert, coercive or corrupt foreign interference. What is the social credit system? Critics of China’s social credit system say it is an Orwellian tool of social monitoring and political repression; but the Chinese government says it is a way of boosting administrative efficiency and encouraging trust and moral behaviour by its citizens. People can be blacklisted for transgressions such as smoking on trains, using expired tickets or failing to pay fines, as well as spreading false information or causing trouble on flights, according to statements released by China’s National Development and Reform Commission in March. Citizens with high credit scores can access better hotels, rental homes and even schools; while those with low credit scores can be temporarily or permanently banned from taking planes or trains, as happened to 6.15 million people in 2017, on the government’s own figures. A pilot version of the scheme run this year in Hangzhou City reportedly saw citizens with high social credit ratings get free access to gym facilities and shorter public hospital waiting times. On the business side, the Brookings Institute has reported that businesses that pay tax on time and “abide by government demands” will get better loan conditions and easier access to public tenders; noncompliant businesses will face more difficult business conditions. But some researchers believe its power and reach may be overstated. Queensland University of Technology researcher Meg Jing Zeng has said that while the social credit system can be used to punish political dissenters such as journalist Liu Hu, it may have positive benefits for Chinese citizens because government officials can be blacklisted for corrupt behaviour. Over 1,100 officials were on restricted lists at December 2017, according to the state media organisation People’s Daily. An academic study of the social credit system released last month by Belgian researcher Rogier Creemers said that while the Chinese government had high ambitions for the system, at present it remained a relatively crude tool. “It is perhaps more accurate to conceive of the social credit system as an ecosystem of initiatives broadly sharing a similar underlying logic, than a fully unified and integrated machine for social control,” he wrote.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/28/chinas-social-credit-system-could-interfere-in-other-nations-sovereignty,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/28/chinas-social-credit-system-could-interfere-in-other-nations-sovereignty
2018-06-27T18:00:45Z,world,World news,'You hate us that much?' Mother of  refugee who killed himself on Nauru berates Australia,"The mother of Fariborz Karami, the Iranian asylum seeker who died by suicide on Nauru two weeks ago, has pleaded with the Australian Border Force to give her son’s body back so she can bury him “anywhere but Nauru or Iran”. In an excoriating letter written to the ABF, Fazileh Mansour Beigi blames those who held her son on Nauru for his long mental decline and ultimate suicide. “For five years you incarcerated me and my innocent children in Nauru and ignored us. I know that your violence and cruelty is deeply rooted and against that I am a powerless woman. You even deprived me from having a mobile phone, lest I speak up? But I always told you if any harm befell my children, I wouldn’t remain silent,” she has written. “My 26-year-old son had his last breaths in your mouldy tents and closed his beautiful eyes to your abomination, injustice, and disgusting policies.” In the lead-up to her son’s death, Mansour Beigi repeatedly pleaded for help for her two sons, arguing they were severely depressed and in danger. Just two days before Karami’s death, his mother wrote to camp manager Canstruct, contracted by the Australian government to run the regional processing centre, warning that “if my kids and I get worse, you will be responsible”.
Karami, whose initial claim for protection had been rejected, had recently married a refugee on Nauru. On the morning of 15 June, he was found unconscious by a family member in the tent he lived in inside the Australian-run regional processing centre. He could not be revived. Mansour Beigi, who, in the wake of her son’s suicide, is on “high watch” and monitored by guards 24 hours a day everywhere she goes, says she wants to bury her eldest child as soon as possible, but not in Nauru or their homeland Iran. But Mansour Beigi says too, she is consumed by fears for the health and future of her youngest child, 12-year-old Ali, who, doctors have said, is at acute mental health risk and should be moved from the island. An autopsy has been completed on Karami’s body, but his mother says she has been told it could be three months before she is told its findings, and her son’s body is released to her for burial. Karami’s wife is on a hunger strike, drinking only water. She is sleeping outside the connex container where her husband’s body is being kept. Mansour Beigi has given permission for Guardian Australia to publish her letter in full. Hello my oppressors and heartless prison officers, Hello again ABF, Do you know me? I am the same suffering and miserable mother who repeatedly begged you to help. Frequently, I implored you to assist me. An ill mother who could not stand to see her children in this situation any more. Often, I told you and I wrote to you that my sons are depressed and exhausted ‘please help a sick and feeble mother’. But, instead of support, you replied that if I couldn’t tolerate it, I should return to my country. Again I made a complaint to you and I wrote that after five years facing torture, I am not able to go back to my country. I asked you to please upgrade our tent as it might change my kids’ mood. Again you ignored me. For five years you incarcerated me and my innocent children in Nauru and ignored us. I know that your violence and cruelty is deeply rooted and against that I am a powerless woman. You even deprived me from having a mobile phone, lest I speak up? But I always told you if any harm befell my children, I wouldn’t remain silent. Since Friday, you have kept my son’s corpse in IHMS’s fridge, to look for his murderer? Since then, have you not smelled your own hands? My 26-year-old son had his last breaths in your mouldy tents and closed his beautiful eyes to your abomination, injustice, and disgusting policies. You even hesitate to provide him a bottle of cold water. For five years, you tortured his athletic body under deadly heat. Now, you confiscated his dead body and keep him in a cold place. You don’t allow me to bury him and entrust him to eternal peace with his beautiful face and body. I doubt if you are human! Where in the world would they keep a young corpse in the fridge for long time, inside a connex [container] near a place his mother is living? Are you even scared of our dead bodies? Do you hate us that much that you are afraid of us alive or dead? You still disrespect us. I prop myself up until I bury my son’s body with respect otherwise all the world is meaningless for me and not worthy even to breathe. If you don’t want to have another corpse, lying next to my son, as soon as possible give me written permission to bury him anywhere except Nauru and Iran. Fariborz’s mournful mother, Fazileh Mansour Beigi Slaughterhouse and torture house of Nauru 24/6/2018 In response to a series of questions regarding Karami, a spokesman for the Australian department of home affairs told Guardian Australia: “These are matters for the Nauruan authorities”. Karami’s body remains refrigerated on the grounds of the regional processing centre, which is run by contractors to the Australian government, and is under Australian control.

2018-06-27T17:47:07Z,world,World news,Ten face charges in France  over suspected far-right terror plot,"Ten alleged extreme-right militants suspected of a terrorist plot to attack Muslims in France are to appear before a judge and face preliminary charges. Nine men and one woman aged 32 to 69 – including one retired police officer – were arrested in raids across France on Saturday, in the Paris area, the Mediterranean island of Corsica and the western Charentes-Maritimes region. Police had linked the ten to a little-known group called Action des Forces Operationnelles (Operational Forces Action), which urges French people to combat Muslims, or what it calls “the enemy within”. Rifles, handguns and homemade grenades were found during searches. The Paris prosecutor’s office said on Wednesday that it had asked an investigating judge to file preliminary charges. In a statement, the prosecutor said an array of weapons and potential bomb-making equipment were found and authorities feared a violent act but “at this stage” couldn’t determine the exact targets. The group, which was seeking to expand, offered combat and survivalist training and held meetings to define its objectives and how to attain them, the prosecutor said. Some had tested homemade grenades and explosives. The “Guerre de France” (War for France) website of the shadowy Operational Forces Action group depicts an apocalyptic battle scene under the Eiffel Tower, and claims to prepare “French citizen-soldiers for combat on national territory”. France’s TF1 television reported earlier this week that the group had allegedly planned to randomly target women wearing headscarves in the street and had also allegedly planned to hit targets linked to radical Islam. “I’m not surprised by these arrests because the current climate of Islamophobia encourages this sort of passage from words to deeds,” said Abdallah Zekri of the French Council of the Muslim Faith after the arrests. The Council said it was particularly worried about the security of the country’s roughly 2,500 mosques. France registered 72 violent anti-Muslim acts last year, up from 67 in 2016. In a statement at the time of the weekend arrests, the interior minister, Gérard Collomb, emphasised the “total mobilisation” of security services “to prevent any disturbance to public order and any threat to people and property, especially those targeting a particular religion.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/ten-face-charges-in-france-over-suspected-far-right-terror-plot,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/ten-face-charges-in-france-over-suspected-far-right-terror-plot
2018-06-27T17:40:03Z,world,World news,"'You have not been forgotten,' Prince William tells Palestinians","The Duke of Cambridge was clapped and cheered by Palestinians as he visited a refugee camp in Ramallah during an historic first visit by a member of the British royal family to the occupied West Bank. A red carpet, marching band and honour guard welcomed the 36-year-old prince on his official visit, during which he toured a clinic and school in Jalazone camp, where 15,000 people live. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, told William during their meeting that he hoped his homeland would be a fully independent state by the next time he visited the Middle East. The duke ended the day with a speech at the British consul-general’s residence in Jerusalem, in which he told Palestinians: “My message tonight is that you have not been forgotten ... I hope that through my being here and understanding the challenges you face, the links of friendship and mutual respect between the Palestinian and British people will grow stronger.” The duke met Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin, on Tuesday, who had asked him to deliver a “message of peace” to Abbas. The Palestinian leader, who met the duke in his Ramallah offices on Wednesday morning, reaffirmed his “full commitment to achieving a full and lasting peace based on a two-state solution where the state of Palestine lives side by side with the state of Israel, with both supervising peace and security”.
He added: “I hope this will not be the last visit ... that your next visit will be in the state of Palestine when we have our full independence.” William responded with his own hopes for “peace for the region”. At one point the duke told Abbas he was “very glad that our two countries work so closely together” – a break with diplomatic protocol, which does not refer to the Palestinian Authority as a country. Later dozens of young men cheered and clapped and took photographs of their royal visitor at the refugee camp, which opened in the wake of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war; the camp’s unemployment is high and violent clashes between Palestinians and a neighbouring Israeli settlement and its forces are common. William ate hummus and other local dishes and visited a school and clinic run by UNWRA, the UN relief programme that assists Palestinian refugees. The duke then attended a cultural event at the Ramallah Municipality that included Dabke, the traditional Palestinian dance, and the chance to meet some local entrepreneurs. “It was really exciting,” said Lina Saadeh, 50, who along with her sister, Carmen, runs a business making homemade bags based on Palestinian designs. Saadeh gave William a bag made from an olive tree, a sign of peace. Saadeh said he told her he would show it to the Queen. While diplomats and media have praised the visit as historic, some Palestinians questioned the motive behind William’s trip. Tarek, a grocer from the nearby al-Amari refugee camp, said he hoped William was nothing like the US president. “Trump is the problem. He’s destroyed the Palestinian people. If he’s like Trump, I don’t like him,” he added, as others agreed. “If the trip is for the sake of the Palestinian people, he’s welcome,” said Ahmed Ali, another stallholder. “But we’re against anyone who visits just for the sake of Israel … We haven’t forgotten Britain’s old stance, the Balfour declaration and the division of Palestine.” “It’s very important that the visit isn’t just because of [interest in] Israel and Jerusalem,” said Hanna Haj Yehia, 27, who has a teaching degree from Tel Aviv University. She travelled to Ramallah from her mother’s Palestinian village in central Israel for shopping. “[William] should see the conditions in Gaza. The most important thing is the people of Gaza and the sanctions that are on them.” Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967. Under the Oslo peace agreements, the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority has jurisdiction over parts of the West Bank. The duke’s visit comes amid growing tensions in the region, with deadly clashes on the Gaza border following protests as Israel marks its 70th anniversary year, and the decision by Trump to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the disputed city of Jerusalem.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/prince-william-palestinians-west-bank-middle-east-visit-ramallah,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/prince-william-palestinians-west-bank-middle-east-visit-ramallah
2018-06-27T17:29:08Z,world,World news,Suspect in Charlottesville protest killing charged with hate crime,"Federal hate crime charges have been filed against a man accused of plowing a car into a crowd of people protesting against a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year, killing a woman and injuring dozens more. The Department of Justice announced on Wednesday that a federal grand jury agreed to indict 21-year-old James Alex Fields, of Ohio, with 30 crimes, including one count of a hate crime resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, and 28 other hate crimes involving an attempt to kill other people, who were injured.
Fields already faces state charges of first-degree murder and other crimes. Fields was photographed hours before the attack with a shield bearing the emblem of one of the hate groups taking part in the “Unite the Right” rally. The event last August began with white nationalists marching through the small university town, holding torches, chanting supremacist slogans and giving Nazi-style salutes. A march on a local park the following day, which contains a Confederate statue, quickly descended into shocking levels of violence as the far right, many wearing armor and carrying clubs and sticks, clashed with those protesting against the event. The volatility escalated when Donald Trump weighed in to blame both sides for the clashes. Fields is accused of deliberately driving a car into a large crowd of anti-nationalist protesters in a narrow street, who were walking away from the main event. He has been in custody since then. The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, issued a statement on Wednesday, saying: “We remain resolute that hateful ideologies will not have the last word and that their adherents will not get away with violent crimes against those they target. Last summer’s violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation. Today’s indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/charlottesville-james-alex-fields-charged-heather-heyer,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/charlottesville-james-alex-fields-charged-heather-heyer
2018-06-27T14:11:23Z,world,World news,Poland makes partial U-turn on Holocaust law after Israel row,"Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, has signed a legal amendment to decriminalise the false attribution to Poland and Poles of crimes committed by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust, signalling a partial retreat on contentious legislation enacted this year. The legislation, which threatened prison terms of up to three years for any breaches, sparked a war of words between Polish and Israeli politicians and an outpouring of antisemitic rhetoric in Poland, as nationalist and pro-government media sought to portray the country as under attack from an international anti-Polish campaign orchestrated by foreign powers and Jewish advocacy groups. The amendment was passed by both houses of the Polish parliament during emergency sessions on Wednesday, and means anyone who “publicly and against the facts” accuses the Polish state or nation of being “responsible or complicit in” Nazi crimes will be guilty of a civil rather than a criminal offence. According to reports in the Polish press, MPs from Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party were made aware of the changes only when they were reported in Wednesday’s morning news bulletins. On Wednesday evening the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, held press conferences to present a joint statement on the controversy, in which they emphasised their commitment to working together to resolve the differences. “We believe that there is a common responsibility to conduct free research, to promote understanding and to preserve the memory of the history of the Holocaust,” said the statement. “We have always agreed that the term ‘Polish concentration/death camps’ is blatantly erroneous and diminishes the responsibility of Germans for establishing those camps.” Netanyahu expressed satisfaction with the outcome. “We fulfilled our duty to safeguard the historical truth about the Holocaust,” he said. Earlier on Wednesday, Morawiecki claimed his government had succeeded in its aim by raising international awareness of Poland’s role during the second world war, and he told MPs the courts could still fine those who broke the law. “The purpose of this law was and still is one fundamental message: fight for the truth of world war two and postwar times,” he said. “A publisher in the United States or in Germany will think twice before publishing today an article using the expression ‘Polish SS’, ‘Polish gestapo’ or ‘Polish concentration camps’ if he risks a lawsuit and a fine of 100m euros or dollars.” In May the Guardian reported that staff at the Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial and museum in southern Poland had been subjected to a wave of “hate, fake news and manipulations” at the height of the controversy. The legislation also appears to have placed great strain on Poland’s relationship with the US. There have been reports that the government was warned high-level contacts with US officials would be affected until the issue was resolved. Some critics of the legislation argue that the government has not gone far enough to water it down. Further movement is still possible, however. Duda referred the legislation to the constitutional tribunal in February, expressing concerns about it even as he signed it into law. The tribunal has yet to make a ruling.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/poland-partial-u-turn-controversial-holocaust-law,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/poland-partial-u-turn-controversial-holocaust-law
2018-06-27T12:17:29Z,world,World news,French butchers ask for police protection from vegan activists,"Butchers in France have asked the government for police protection from animal rights activists, claiming their security was being threatened and that vegans were trying to impose a meat-free lifestyle on the nation. The French federation of butchers wrote to the interior minister saying shops had been sprinkled with fake blood and covered in graffiti. It claims that a growing media focus on veganism was threatening butchers’ safety. The letter said France’s 18,000 butchers were worried about the consequences of “excessive media hype around vegan lifestyles”, and that vegans wanted to “impose their lifestyle on the immense majority of people”. “We count on your services and on the support of the entire government so that the physical, verbal and moral violence stops as soon as possible,” the federation wrote. Seven butcher shops were vandalised and sprayed with fake blood in the Hauts-de-France region in the north of the country in April. Other incidents were reported in southern France. A butcher and a fishmonger in the north had seen windows broken, with the slogan “Stop speciesism” left behind in spray-paint by the vandals. It is not only purveyors of meat who have faced the wrath of the animal rights activists: last year a cheesemonger in Lyon said his shop was painted with the words “milk is rape” and “milk is murder”. In March, a vegan cheesemaker was given a seven-month suspended jail sentence for condoning terrorism after she said on Facebook that she had no compassion for the supermarket butcher killed in a terrorist attack on a store in Trèbes and likened being a butcher to being a murderer. “We condemn all violence,” said Sébastien Arsac of the non-violent L214 campaign group against animal exploitation, which has recently made high-profile films of practises in French abattoirs. He told French media that while meat sales were going down, it was not the 5% of vegetarians in France that threatened butchers’ livelihoods but the 50% of people who were considering cutting down on meat. Some have suggested butchers are seeking to generate publicity on the back of a small number of incidents. Jean-François Guihard, a Brittany butcher and the head of the butchers’ federation, said he was not not asking for a police officer to be stationed outside each butcher shop but said the state must monitor what he called “extremist” vegan groups. Asked by Le Parisien newspaper if he was against all vegetarians, Guihard said: “Not at all. If they refuse to eat meat, that’s their choice. We just want people to respect our craft and our customers, which means the majority of French people. Vegans are in a small minority.” Faced with declining meat sales, farmers’ groups have effectively lobbied the centrist government of Emmanuel Macron in recent weeks to prevent “anti-meat” measures. A proposal to require schools to provide a vegetarian meal at least once a week was dropped in parliament, while food producers have also battled to ban the use of the terms “steak”, “fillet”, “bacon” and “sausage” to refer non-meat products.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/french-butchers-ask-for-police-protection-from-vegan-activists,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/french-butchers-ask-for-police-protection-from-vegan-activists
2018-06-27T08:53:31Z,world,World news,Zimbabwe's president blames rally attack on Grace Mugabe faction,"Emmerson Mnangagwa, the president of Zimbabwe, has blamed an apparent assassination attempt at a political rally last weekend on a faction led by Grace Mugabe, the wife of the ousted president Robert Mugabe. In an interview with the BBC, Mnangagwa said he believed the so-called G40 faction was responsible for the grenade thrown at the podium in the White City stadium in Bulawayo on Saturday afternoon. The 75-year-old leader, who took power in November following a military takeover that led to the resignation of Mugabe after a rule of 37 years, stopped short of blaming the former first lady directly. The attack killed two people and injured 49. Both vice-presidents were slightly injured in the blast, as were several other top officials in the ruling Zanu-PF party. Mnangagwa earlier said the attack had been “calculated to achieve a bloodbath” and destabilise the ongoing electoral programme. The upcoming parliamentary and presidential election is the latest turning point in the most tumultuous few months in almost four decades of Zimbabwe’s political history. Though the poll on 30 July is realistically a two-horse contest between Zanu-PF against the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), the longstanding opposition, more than 20 candidates are contesting the presidency. “My hunch without evidence is that the people who aggrieved by the new dispensation… are the G40 so that is the logical conclusion,” Mnangagwa told the BBC. “I think this is a political action by some aggrieved persons by the current democratic dispensation in the country.” There is much bitter history between the current president, a veteran of Zimbabwe’s liberation wars and a close aide to Mugabe for decades, and the G40 faction. The November takeover came after Mnangagwa was sacked as vice-president by the ailing 94-year-old autocrat, a move that he and Zimbabwe’s powerful military saw as clearing the way to power for the 54-year-old first lady and her supporters. A number of previous alleged assassination attempts have been blamed on the G40 by Mnangagwa and his supporters, including an apparent poisoning last year. No evidence has emerged to implicate any individual or group. Mnangagwa told the BBC that Grace Mugabe was “politically immature and was easily used as a tool by those who wanted to get at me”. Many of those who were close to the former first lady have fled Zimbabwe. Opposition leaders in Zimbabwe fear the bombing may serve as a pretext for a wide-ranging crackdown by the government or the military in the southern African state. Manangwa said such concern was unfounded. “There is no need for a security crackdown … this is a criminal activity … but of course we must make sure the population is protected … and only when we have got them are we going to be able to assess the extent to which the network is spread.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/zimbabwe-president-blames-rally-attack-grace-mugabe-g40-faction,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/zimbabwe-president-blames-rally-attack-grace-mugabe-g40-faction
2018-06-27T07:55:56Z,world,World news,EU migration crisis: what are the key issues?,"This week’s EU summit will be dominated by a deepening political crisis in the bloc over how to handle irregular immigration. Here is a look at the main issues, which countries want what, why all this matters and how it might develop. Why is this happening now?
It is the delayed political reaction to Europe’s 2015 migration crisis. Since arrivals via the Mediterranean peaked that year at more than 1 million, migrant numbers have plummeted to 41,000 this year, according to the UN. But polls show migration has become voters’ number one concern across the bloc and the issue has swayed elections including in France, Germany, Austria, Italy and Hungary. The immediate cause is twofold. First, the far-right League, which campaigned on a pledge to halt illegal immigration, is in government in Italy. The country has taken in 650,000 migrants since 2014 and is the point where most migrants who are still making it across – mainly via Libya – now land. The country’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, the League’s leader, wants to ensure other EU members share Italy’s burden. He sparked the current crisis by closing the country’s ports to foreign-flagged migrant rescue ships. Second, Angela Merkel’s conservative sister party in Bavaria, the CSU, risks losing seats to the anti-immigration AfD in regional elections this autumn. A leading CSU member, the German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, wants the right to unilaterally turn away at the border those registered for asylum elsewhere in the EU unless the bloc agrees to spread them round more evenly. The chancellor, whose open-borders policy resulted in more than 1 million migrants arriving in Germany, opposes this because it would undermine Europe’s core Schengen passport-free zone. Merkel wants an EU-wide solution – which Seehofer has demanded she bring back from the summit. Who wants what? Of the key players, Germany is seeking accords, particularly with Italy, allowing it to send migrants back, in line with the EU’s Dublin principle that asylum-seekers should stay in the first state they landed in. Italy, however, is unlikely to play ball: the last thing Salvini wants is to take migrants back who have already left. Rome’s objective is to sever the link between the concept of a “first country of arrival” and a responsibility to process asylum claims. It has also said all EU countries should accept a share of refugees and economic migrants or see their EU funding cut.
That idea is anathema to the Visegrád Four – Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia – which have refused to take in asylum seekers under any EU plan and want no more discussion of such schemes. Austria, which will soon hold the EU’s rotating presidency and also has a far-right party in government, wants a “coalition of the willing” to step up. It has drafted radical plans to force most refugees to file asylum applications outside the EU. France, which has been vocal in its criticism of the Italian approach, and Spain broadly back Merkel’s quest for an EU-wide – or at least a multilateral and European – approach based on “solidarity and responsibility”, favouring holding centres if necessary inside the EU (though preferably not on their soil) and sanctions against member states that fail to pull their weight. What will come of it? Broadly, pretty much everyone is agreed on measures to tighten Europe’s external borders by boosting the EU’s frontier and coastguard. They also back giving more money to third countries, mainly in Africa, to dissuade migrants from trying to reach Europe, and setting up controversial “disembarkation” centres outside the EU, probably in north African coastal states, to process migrants rescued at sea and sift asylum seekers from economic migrants. However, that plan is fraught with huge practical and legal challenges. Where they will struggle to agree, even bilaterally, is on how to distribute irregular migrants and refugees who are already here, and those who continue to arrive in the future. Some bilateral or trilateral progress may be made but whether it will satisfy the likes of Salvini or Seehofer is unclear.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/eu-migration-crisis-what-are-the-issues,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/eu-migration-crisis-what-are-the-issues
2018-06-27T07:00:32Z,world,World news,Mexico election: why is the leftwing frontrunner so quiet on social issues?,"In both of Mexico’s last two presidential elections, Julieta Brambila voted for Andrés Manuel López Obrador because she supported his plans to tackle corruption, curb poverty and overturn “neoliberal” economic policies. Polls ahead of this Sunday’s vote suggest that the silver-haired left-winger is finally on the brink of victory, but Brambila admits to some mixed feelings over his surprisingly conservative positions on social issues.
“I agree with a good part of his policies on the economy, combatting corruption and security,” said Brambila, who is a trans woman and professor of communications. “But on issues like diversity, I don’t think he – or any candidate – has any proposals.” López Obrador, known as Amlo, has built a commanding lead, capitalizing on growing frustration over political corruption and rising violence. But social issues such as abortion and marriage equality have been secondary in the race, with all four male candidates seeking to appeal to an electorate craving change – but often showing an aversion to risk. On the campaign trail, Amlo, 64, often speaks of faith and values. He has promised to draft a “moral constitution” but mostly dodged clear answers on social issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion.
He has also forged an electoral alliance with a socially conservative party founded by evangelical Christians, which could end up claiming 10% of the seats in Congress. “I don’t think rights will be rolled back [with an Amlo administration and conservatives in his congressional coalition]” Brambila said. “But progress is going to be more difficult.” This year’s election comes after a well-funded “pro-family” lobby made an aggressive push into Mexico politics with a high-profile campaign against marriage equality. Politicians of all stripes have sought support from Catholic priests, evangelical pastors and social conservatives But Amlo’s positions on marriage equality and abortion have stirred disquiet among the LGBT community and women’s groups.
As mayor of Mexico City from 2000-2005, Amlo held off on promoting same-sex marriage and the decriminalisation of abortion – both of which were eventually introduced in the city by his successor, Marcelo Ebrard. In a 2015 interview with W Radio he suggested that fighting poverty and graft were more important priorities for progressives: “The most important thing is honesty. [Decriminalizing abortion and marriage equality] – with total respect and authenticity, I consider it something not that important. What’s important in Mexico is that we end corruption.” Some political observers say Amlo has appealed to “traditional” and religious values in an attempt to soften a radical image after accusations from opponents that he planned to turn Mexico into another Venezuela. “It’s served to lower the resistance,” said Diego Petersen Farah, columnist with the Guadalajara newspaper El Informador. Amlo’s party, the movement for national renewal, is better known by its acronym “Morena” – another name for the Mexico’s patron saint, Our Lady of Guadalupe. He announced his candidacy on her feast day, 12 December. His exact religious affiliation – Catholic or Protestant – is the subject of speculation. But one journalist in his home state of Tabasco – where votive candles bearing his image sell briskly – says it’s a moot point.
“It’s not so much church with Andrés Manuel, rather ethics and ethical behaviour,” said Juan Urcola, who has interviewed Amlo often. Amlo’s electoral coalition includes the Social Encounter Party (PES), which was founded by evangelical Christians and in 2016 voted against a presidential proposal to enshrine same-sex marriage in the constitution. The PES president, Hugo Eric Flores, has previously said that marriage equality was “a fad”. In an interview, he promised tolerance, but also said: “We are in favour of the traditional family, and that’s not a bad thing to say so.” Same-sex marriage is allowed in some Mexican states, though any couple can marry in any state so long as they first obtain a court injunction. Abortion on demand is only legal in the country’s capital, but when Amlo’s campaign released a document on women’s issues, it omitted any mention of the subject. In an interview, his pick for interior minister, former supreme court justice Olga Sánchez Cordero, promised that an Amlo administration would make abortion legal nationally by including it in an expanded federal criminal code. But Amlo’s refusal to be drawn on social issues has raised disquiet among potential supporters on the left. “There are these mixed signals,” said Estefanía Vela Barba, a professor at Cide, a research university. “They’re making us wait until he is in the presidency to see what he actually thinks.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/mexico-election-candidates-avoid-stances-on-same-sex-marriage-and-abortion,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/mexico-election-candidates-avoid-stances-on-same-sex-marriage-and-abortion
2018-06-27T06:00:32Z,world,World news,Mexico: children toil in tobacco fields as reforms fail to fix poverty,"Lucia Reyes is five months pregnant and winces with pain every time she bends down to cut the big, floppy tobacco leaves. The 35-year-old has had six stillbirths over the years, which means it’s down to her daughter Maria, aged 11, to step up and work alongside her father, Camilo Gonzalez. Side by side they pick, stack, heave and finally thread the sticky green leaves through long sharp needles. Maria has been helping her parents every season for as long as she and her parents can remember. Now, with Reyes unable to do much, the pressure is really on, as the family is paid per “sarta” – an approximately three-metre length of threaded tobacco. Tonight, there is nothing for dinner and they won’t be paid until the end of the week, when the grower who farms this plantation will pay 16 pesos ($0.85) for each sarta hung to dry between eucalyptus poles. The family managed 20 sartas today, but they’ll need to get faster to make ends meet.
Camilito, Maria’s wide-eyed, cheery little brother, who is almost four, sometimes helps by carrying tiny piles of leaves – but only when he tires of playing alone. “It’s not much, and not often, but every little bit helps,” says Gonzalez, 36, who started picking tobacco when he was nine years old.
The Guardian visited with the family at the start of harvest season in mid-February, when they were weary after making the gruelling journey to the lowlands of Nayarit, as they do every year, on foot and rickety bus. They, like most of the tobacco pickers, come from surrounding remote mountain communities, which are home to some of the poorest and most marginalized people in Mexico. They come in search of seasonal work in Nayarit, a tiny fertile state in the north-west of Mexico. A series of exposés in the 1990s in Mexico revealed widespread use of child labour and banned agrochemicals and detailed abysmal living and work conditions in Nayarit’s tobacco fields.
With improvements since then, Rodolfo Coronado, president of the industry-aligned tobacco growers’ association, told the Guardian that child labour was “virtually eradicated”. But during a visit to the Santiago fields in March, the Guardian found that while schemes had improved the situation for some families, there were children working on seven of the 10 plantations visited.
Families all spoke of the need to thread as many sartas as possible to make enough money to buy food and save a little to buy fabric for clothes and supplement home-grown crops until next season. Tobacco is one of the toughest harvests, shouldered by only the poorest of the poor migrant families who come generation after generation from as far as Jalisco, Durango and Zacatecas to pick and thread the leaves. The vast majority are indigenous Huichol, Corra, Tepehuan and Mexicanero families. The jornaleros work, sometimes sleep, eat, and play in the plantations exposed to snakes, insects, toxic pesticides, and the sticky black resin linked to a type of nicotine poisoning called green tobacco sickness. The firms say safeguards for workers and their families are a priority, and that they have taken significant steps to improve conditions, including protecting against nicotine poisoning. The big tobacco companies say exploitative child labour is unacceptable and that they were working hard to stop it happening in their supply chains. They say they are encouraging farmers to grow other crops, though added that tobacco gave farms a better income.
Production is booming Nayarit is Mexico’s main tobacco-growing region, producing just over 19 tonnes on 7,300 acres of prime land last year, mostly in the municipality of Santiago de Ixcuintla. In its heyday, during the 1960s, the region harvested five times as much tobacco. After years of decline, production is again booming. The growers deal with British American Tobacco (BAT) or the Mexican company Tabacos del Pacifico Norte (a subsidiary of Universal Leaf Tobacco) – which sells most of its product to the market leaders, Philip Morris International (PMI) and BAT. The only contact between the jornaleros and tobacco giants are the field engineers who inspect the crops. The growers are responsible for hiring and paying the seasonal workers, but it’s the tobacco companies that stipulate what services and conditions the jornaleros should receive. This year, the official rate is 17.5 pesos ($0.89) per sarta, compared with 9 pesos in 2010, but the Guardian found payments ranging from 14.5 to 18 pesos, depending on the producer. A family group, depending on size and experience, threads between nine and 100 sartas per day. Dotted around Santiago are small American-style houses built with money made picking tobacco in Kentucky and Virginia, where this year migrant workers, including many growers from Nayarit, will earn about $11 per hour.
“A seasonal worker now earns up to 400 pesos (approximately $20) a day, which is not only competitive but above the price paid to workers on other agricultural farms and the minimum daily wage in Mexico,” said a BAT spokesperson.
The Prospera scheme In an effort to eradicate Mexico’s child labour, the Prospera scheme, launched in 1997, offers small cash incentives to impoverished parents to keep children in school and attend health checks and workshops on nutrition, hygiene and family planning. The government paid out $500m to 6.1 million families in 2016, but audits suggest the impact on child labour has been modest. Several jornaleros told the Guardian that Prospera helped keep some of their children away from tobacco labour, including Gonzalez and Reyes’s five-year-old son. But no matter how hard some families try to get away from these plantations, poverty drags them back.
Every January until the age of 15, Pamela Cruz spent four months helping her father harvest tobacco. Cruz, now 33, vowed never to come back and registered her children with Prospera. But last year, an economic crisis forced Cruz to return with her malnourished daughters, aged two, five and nine, in tow. Cruz, sitting cross-legged under a shady palm shelter surrounded by piles of leaves, said: “Of course I don’t want my daughters playing and sleeping next to the tobacco, but I have no one to leave them with in the Sierra and we need money or else we’ll eat only beans, tortillas, eggs and instant noodles every single day.” A few metres away, the girls dart in and out of the hanging sartas with their 11-year-old cousin, squealing with giggles. The threading is fiddly; children with their small dexterous hands can be good at the work, but it’s dangerous and Cruz thinks Graciela, nine, is still too young to be doing it. “Next year I’ll teach her to thread, but not yet. She could cut herself. As their mother, I have to teach them tobacco because there is no work in the Sierra, nothing. But only after school; my daughters don’t miss school,” she said.
The girls attend an industry-sponsored albergue or children’s centre, set up in 2001 in response to criticisms about child labour and run in conjunction with government institutions (health, education and rural development). There are now nine albergues – four Florece centres funded by BAT, which it says benefit almost 1,000 children each season, and five Philip Morris Child Care and Education Centres (known by the Spanish acronym CAEI). The Guardian visited two centres under supervision. One brightly painted Florece in the La Presa community was built next to a tobacco plantation. Thirty-six excited children aged six to 13 were squeezed into one classroom, with one enthusiastic teacher trying to adapt a lesson on shapes to suit all abilities and ages. At the CAEI in Puerta de Mango, government money had just paid for new bathrooms, showers and classrooms equipped with oversized televisions. Both albergues provide two meals a day plus snacks, and showers with treatment for lice and fleas, the Guardian was told. An ad hoc survey of 10 children the Guardian spoke with revealed that like Cruz’s girls, they all help in the fields after school – a few in the morning, too, before the minibus arrives. One burly 11-year-old boy playing football at the CAEI said it was his first day. “I like it, it’s fun here, but my family needs me.” Jennie Gamlin of University College London, who investigates structural violence and health inequalities, said: “Tobacco workers are the poorest of the poor forced to work and live in poor conditions which expose them to preventable harms that reproduce inequalities. Parents know that it is harmful and wrong according to law for children to work in tobacco, but they’re poor, need the money and don’t see another option. Even when the kids aren’t working, they are playing and sleeping within the tobacco.” BAT and PMI are tackling some avoidable harms reported by Gamlin. For the first time, portable toilets are installed in the fields this year. Some families have been lent portable iron cooking grills, a few have a wooden table and chairs for meals, and one teenage couple showed the Guardian a protective suit they don’t use because “it makes you hotter than an oven”.
To stop people sleeping under palm shelters skin-to-skin with the tobacco leaves, BAT is providing 350 new lightweight tents it calls temporary accommodation, as part of its support for migrant families. When we visit Gonzalez and Reyes two weeks later, they’re delighted with the tent, as there are lots of spiders and scorpions lurking around. Years ago in the Sierra, their three-year-old son died after being stung by a scorpion. “Things are better now,” said Gonzalez. “There used to be empty chemical containers everywhere in the fields. It smelled so bad. Now it’s much cleaner, and the patron brings us water every day.” Philip Morris has gone a step further, banning jornaleros from working past sunset and from sleeping in the fields. Its growers must provide accommodation away from the plantations, dropping the jornaleros off early in the morning and collecting them at sunset. Griselda Romero, 39, a mother of five, has been harvesting tobacco since she was nine, and this is the first year she has not slept in the fields. While glad that her two youngest children attend the albergue, she thinks they should be able to help out after school. The family is averaging 20 sartas a day; last year it was closer to 30. “It’s not enough. It was better when the whole family was here together, we made more money,” Romero said. Last year, her 10-year-old daughter suffered a skin condition doctors said was probably caused by pesticides or resin from carrying leaves. But given the low pay, Romero says she needs the children to chip in.
“Child labour is unacceptable and we make every effort to stop it happening in our supply chain,” said PMI in a statement and highlighted changes last year it said improved “conditions for 5,000 workers and their families on farms supplying PMI in Nayarit”. PMI added “there were significant improvements in terms of resting and lunch areas, toilet facilities, and access to drinking and washing water on the vast majority of farms” and to “further mitigate the risk of children being present in the field, we extended the schedule and capacity of five operating daycare and educational centers”. BAT said it took welfare and safety “very seriously”, and that BAT Mexico supported workers and families and “set rigorous standards relating to working conditions”.
BAT Mexico provides training to avoid nicotine poisoning and distributes personal protective equipment, he said, and invests in social responsibility schemes that directly help families, including Project Florece. Universal said its subsidiary Tabacos del Pacifico Norte took the issue of child labor “very seriously” and shared its commitments to fight child labour and other labour abuses throughout supply chains. ‘I’ll work in tobacco until I die’ Antonio López, 34, a Huichol, is harvesting tobacco for the 27th consecutive year. Tobacco has kept his family afloat over the years, and conditions have undoubtedly improved some, he says, but it’s still tough. “We still eat with resin-covered hands as it hurts to wash it off straight from the fields, and we can’t afford to wait and waste two hours, so Sunday is the only day we eat clean.” Like all parents, López wants better for his children, but here they are, playing and working by his side. “Tobacco is the best and the worst, but I don’t know anything else. I’ll work in tobacco until I die.” The tobacco pickers’ names have been changed",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/mexico-child-labour-tobacco-fields-nayarit,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/mexico-child-labour-tobacco-fields-nayarit
2018-06-27T05:28:43Z,world,World news,"Wednesday briefing: With Brexit, speed is the hardest word","Top story: ‘Decisions will be needed’ Good morning all, Graham Russell here with what’s happening in the middle of your week. Arranging a Brexit deal was never going to be a swift process, but the current rate has caused enough alarm to bring together unions and business groups from across the UK and Europe to demand “pace and urgency”. The TUC and the CBI joined forces with their continental counterparts to call for progress, especially on measures to avoid a hard border in Ireland, saying the cost of disagreement would be “dire” for companies and workers. Flashpoints in vehicle manufacturing have already been raised by Airbus and BMW, but the TUC and CBI said 23 industrial sectors, ranging from banking to broadcasting, would want “regulatory alignment” after the divorce. Theresa May tried to allay some of the concerns on Tuesday by saying it is “right that we listen to the voice of business”. Tomorrow she is due to head to Brussels for a European Council meeting, and it doesn’t look like she has many friends there, either. The business secretary, Greg Clark, appeared to suggest he agreed with industry concerns, in a sign of emerging cabinet divisions over the issue. “What [business] don’t want is a running debate ... Business looks with dismay where there is disagreement. That does not inspire confidence. My approach is to be very engaged with businesses,” he said. * * * Moorland fire – Dozens of homes around Manchester have been evacuated as firefighters worked into the night to tackle a moorland fire that police described as a major incident. The army was on standby to help as fire crews tackled intense heat and challenging terrain, said Phil Nelson from the Greater Manchester fire and rescue service. No injuries have been reported as a result of the fires, which were revived by the heatwave. Health officials have advised people in Tameside to stay inside their homes and keep doors and windows closed.
* * * Child separations – US immigration authorities have been ordered by a federal judge to reunite families separated after crossing the US-Mexico border. More than 2,300 migrant children were separated from their parents after the Trump administration began a “zero-tolerance” policy in early May. The judge granted a preliminary injunction after a lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union. * * * Dark days ahead – Today’s rampant nationalist populism and widespread rejection of multilateral alliances has brought back the spectre of 1930s politics, Tony Blair is expected to say in a Chatham House speech. The former PM will say he has never been so worried about the UK, and will criticise movements that brought Donald Trump to power, saying: “Once it is clear the populism isn’t working because, ultimately, it offers only expressions of anger and not effective answers. The populists may double down, alleging that failure is the result of half-heartedness.” Blair will call on the US president to affirm that the transatlantic alliance matters or face weakening the west in its struggle with China. * * * Not content to sit idle – Google, Facebook, YouTube and the like could be forced by law to remove extremist content within 24 hours under a Labour push to replace a voluntary approach it says is failing. An amendment to terrorism legislation suggested by Stephen Doughty would also require tech companies to proactively check for extremist material and take it down within six hours. He said: “If these companies can remove copyrighted video or music content from companies like Disney within a matter of hours, there is no excuse for them to be failing to do so for extremist material.” * * * Buzz of the city – Bumblebees are a cherished part of most scenes of arcadia but, frankly, it appears they would rather move to the city. Colonies planted in urbanised areas fared better than their rural cousins, with more food stores, fewer invasions from parasitic “cuckoo” bumblebees, and longer life expectancies, UK research has found. A greater risk of exposure to pesticides in the countryside might be having an effect, said researcher Ash Samuelson. * * * World Cup Argentina have a new hero and his name is Marcos Rojo. With the Albiceleste on the verge of elimination, the Manchester United defender arrived to send them through to the last 16 at the cost of Nigeria. “I knew that God was with us and would not leave us out [of the competition],” Lionel Messi said. It was all a bit too much for Diego Maradona, who celebrated the goal in exuberant fashion before he had to receive medical attention. Harry Kane expects to start England’s final Group G fixture against Belgium as he continues his pursuit of the World Cup’s golden boot. Meanwhile, hundreds of England fans could expose a loophole in the Russian security service’s ticketing system to travel to Russia for the World Cup as excitement grows behind Gareth Southgate’s team. Coming up today: the conclusion to Groups E and F. Jogi Löw is out to prove himself by tackling Germany’s structural flaw against South Korea, Mexico are daring to dream as they prepare to face Sweden, and Tite has warned that Neymar should not be expected to win the World Cup on his own as Brazil prepare for Serbia. Switzerland take on Costa Rica in the day’s other game; the buildup to all four matches has already started. Lunchtime read: From fat to flat to fixated
“It was just a bit of fun. Something to tell the grandkids, maybe frame in the downstairs loo some day.” So says Men’s Health journalist Dan Rookwood, whose personal journey “from fat to flat” became the magazine’s biggest-selling issue of all time. You may think: what is the harm, but the masculine frame fetishised today can be as pernicious as the blight of uber-thin supermodels. The body plans do work, provided you are a staff journalist at a magazine with access to high-end trainers, a sympathetic boss and the time to spend hours meal-prepping protein-based meals. Aziz Sikdar, 29, became unhappy with his body after gaining weight at university and rapidly developed an “unhealthy” relationship with food. “I always had to know the breakdown of what I was eating,” he says. “I’d binge a lot, completely overeat, then starve myself out of guilt.” Sam Thomas of the charity Men Get Eating Disorders Too points out that, because diet is imperative in achieving muscular goals, “even men who appear in prime health can be in the grip of a devastating illness”. Sport Not a lot fazes John McEnroe but, when asked if he felt “uncomfortable” about being paid “10 times more” than Martina Navratilova to lend his magic to the BBC commentary box at Wimbledon he trod a careful path. The LTA has been left with a bitter taste in its mouth as Maria Sharapova lost to Maria Sakkari at the Hurlingham Club after opting not to play in Birmingham this year, despite having a deal in place with the LTA. And Paul Farbrace has confirmed his interest in becoming England’s next full-time cricket head coach and made a positive first move as the interim for the Twenty20 against Australia tonight by promoting Jos Buttler to open. Business Dozens of America’s largest retailers, car manufacturers and agriculture businesses have united to warn of the “serious negative economic impacts” of Donald Trump’s trade disputes. Amazon, General Motors and Walmart were among those “deeply concerned”. Libya’s UN-backed government has been forced to urge the UN to block any sales from its main oil terminals after they were seized by a local strongman who decided to send the revenue elsewhere. The pound is buying $1.322 and €1.134. The papers “Unions join business leaders to demand urgency in Brexit talks,” is the Guardian splash. The Daily Telegraph also has a Brexit story on the front, with “Cabinet at war over ‘Project Fear mark two’”.
The Daily Express has high hopes for Prince William’s visit to Israel, asking whether a “seemingly impossible breakthrough” in the Middle East might be achieved by “William the peacemaker” [bold bit is the headline, other bit is just a quote]. The Times has “Billions more needed for defence, says Williamson”, the FT leads with “GE takes stride towards break-up by spinning off two big divisions” and the Daily Mirror has “Stressed GPs seeing 70 patients a day”. The Sun headline is “Fly George!”, announcing their campaign to have St George’s flag flown up and down Whitehall in support of England’s World Cup efforts, and the Daily Mail splash is “A green light for criminals” as the justice minister calls for some sentences of less than a year to be dropped to reduce the prison population.

2018-06-27T04:33:51Z,world,World news,Childless couples are 'selfish' says Japanese political chief,"A senior Japanese politician has described couples who decide not to have children as “selfish”, and cited the postwar baby boom as evidence that hardship needn’t be an obstacle to having bigger families. Toshihiro Nikai, the secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic party [LDP], is the latest conservative politician to urge people to have more children, as demographers warn that Japan’s population will decline dramatically in the coming decades. “During and after the war when people were living on the edge of starvation, nobody said it’s better not to have children because it’s too much trouble,” Kyodo news quoted Nikai as saying at a meeting in Tokyo on Tuesday.
“These days, some people have a selfish idea that it is better not to have children.” The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has vowed to raise the birthrate and the number of women in the workplace, but his government is struggling to deliver on promises to meet demand for childcare places. In a recent survey, 70% of parents said they would like more children but were deterred from having bigger families by financial worries and difficulties balancing work with home life. Almost 348,000 children have been denied places at childcare facilities, according to a recent report by the Nomura Research Institute, suggesting Abe will struggle to achieve his goal of raising the number of working women aged 25-44 to 80% over the next five years. Nikai is one of several LDP politicians to have drawn criticism for telling couples to have bigger families. In May, Kanji Kato, a lower house MP, said women should have multiple children and warned those who preferred to remain single that they would become a burden on the state later in life.
Later that month, Koichi Hagiuda, the party’s executive acting secretary general and an Abe confidante, said childrearing was a woman’s job, and suggested that being raised by their fathers could impair children’s development. “We talk about cool ideas such as gender equality and men’s involvement in childrearing, but they are unwelcome ideas for children,” Kyodo quoted Hagiuda as saying. About 941,000 children were born in Japan last year, the lowest number since records began in 1899. The country’s birthrate remains low despite the introduction of financial and other incentives to encourage couples to have bigger families. Among 32 countries with a population of 40 million or more, Japan ranks lowest in terms of the percentage of children in the overall population, at 12.3%, according to the UN demographic yearbook.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/childless-couples-are-selfish-says-japanese-political-chief,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/childless-couples-are-selfish-says-japanese-political-chief
2018-06-27T04:00:29Z,world,World news,Libya urges UN to block oil sales after clashes between rival factions,"Libya’s oil industry – the sole reliable source of revenue for the strife-torn country – has been plunged into chaos after its United Nations-recognised government was forced to urge the UN to block any sales from its main oil terminals. The key terminals in the east of the country were captured from local militias last week by the so-called Libyan National Army, headed by strongman Khalifa Haftar. But on Tuesday Haftar announced his forces would send the revenues to a rival oil corporation in the country’s east rather than the UN-recognised National Oil Corporation (NOC).
Haftar won control of the key oil terminals in the Gulf of Sirte from militia last week after 10 days of fierce fighting that left more than 300 people dead. The transfer of the ports, including Libya’s biggest, Es Sider, threatens to unsettle markets as purchasers are left struggling to identify legitimate Libyan traders. Haftar, the dominant figure on the east of the country, clearly feels he will benefit if the Tripoli-based government of national accord is starved of oil revenue. His decision threatens to deepen divisions between the east and west of the country, and makes it hard for oil firms to know who to deal with. The clash will also complicate efforts by European leaders to reach agreements with Libya on controlling the flow of migrants through the country. The current populist surge in Europe has largely been fuelled by the three years of migration from Africa to Italy. The absence of political unity in Libya has made it easier for the traffickers to operate in the country.
Despite the turmoil, the Libyan National Oil Corporation, headed by Mustafa Sanalla, had managed to remain largely above the political fray, and gradually brought production back up to nearly 1m barrels per day – helping to finance the UN-recognised government which controls the west of the country. Outside governments are divided over whether to back Haftar – whose LNA is a coalition of military unites and local militias – or the Tripoli-based government of national accord, which is recognised by the UN. Many had hoped that presidential elections scheduled for December might bring about reconciliation. The Tripoli government said: “Handing over oil terminals to an illegitimate entity only exacerbates the division.” Sanalla said: “UN security council resolutions are very clear; oil facilities, production, and exports must remain under the exclusive control of NOC and the sole oversight of the government of national accord. We are confident that the GNA and our international partners will take the necessary steps to stop all exports in breach of international law.”
He added: “Libyans want a country of laws, not of guns. Instead of defending the rule of law in Libya by handing the Gulf of Sirte ports over to the operational control of the legitimate and internationally recognised NOC, the Libyan National Army has decided to put itself above the law.” Leaders from east and west of the country had met in Paris to agree a timetable to stage elections this December, but Sanalla said “the LNA has turned its back on the Paris accords and on the path to peace”. Sanalla also said it would sue any company that tried to buy oil from the eastern authorities and that no purchase contract signed with them would be honoured.

2018-06-27T03:54:46Z,world,World news,North Korea making 'rapid' upgrades to nuclear reactor despite summit pledges,"North Korea has continued to upgrade its only known nuclear reactor used to fuel its weapons program, satellite imagery has shown, despite ongoing negotiations with the US and a pledge to denuclearise.
Infrastructure improvements at the Yongbyon nuclear plant are “continuing at a rapid pace”, according to an analysis by monitoring group 38 North of commercial satellite images taken on 21 June.
The cooling system for the plutonium production reactor has been modified and at least two new non-industrial buildings have been built on the site, possibly for use by visiting officials. A new engineering office building has been completed and construction has continued on support facilities throughout the complex, according to a blog post written by Frank V Pabian, Joseph S Bermudez Jr and Jack Liu. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has committed to “complete denuclearisation” in meetings with Donald Trump and South Korean president Moon Jae-in, but the details of how and when that will happen have not yet been decided. Kim announced earlier this year the the North’s nuclear arsenal and weapons capable of striking the US were complete, and the North closed its only known nuclear test site in May. “Infrastructure improvements continue at Yongbyon,” Jenny Town, managing editor of 38 North, wrote on Twitter. “Underscores reason why an actual deal is necessary, not just a statement of lofty goals.” The status of various parts of the nuclear complex remains unclear, and experts cautioned linking ongoing improvements to negotiations with the US. “Continued work at the Yongbyon facility should not be seen as having any relationship to North Korea’s pledge to denuclearise,” the experts warned. “The North’s nuclear cadre can be expected to proceed with business as usual until specific orders are issued from Pyongyang.” Despite the lack of clarity on any nuclear deal, South Korea has pushed ahead with diplomatic efforts. The two sides met for military talks this week aimed at restoring communication lines, and railway officials agreed to explore connecting the two countries by rail. Checks will begin next month on long-unused lines that once allowed travel across the entire peninsula. Talks began a decade ago, but were suspended amid rising tensions. South Korea already has a gleaming steel and glass station just south of its highly militarised border with the North, with tracks marked for service to the North’s capital, Pyongyang. Kim singled out the South’s advanced railway infrastructure during his meeting with Moon in April, acknowledging in a rare admission of weakness that the North lagged far behind its neighbour. But progress on the nuclear issue and the lifting of sanctions would have to come before any joint rail projects.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/north-korea-nuclear-reactor-upgrades-summit-pledges,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/north-korea-nuclear-reactor-upgrades-summit-pledges
2018-06-27T03:20:58Z,world,World news,'You just shut down': New Zealand politician talks about being sexually abused,"Co-leader of the New Zealand Green party Marama Davidson has given her first interview about being sexually abused as a child; a revelation that saw her thrown out of parliament when she first went public with the experience three years ago. In 2015 Davidson was the first of several female MPs who were ordered to leave the chamber after their revelations that they had been victims of sexual violence were ruled out of order by the Speaker. “We got feedback from around the world, around the country, that that action had touched people, and I didn’t know that that was going to happen,” Davidson told the New Zealand Herald this week. “What I felt in the house immediately as I was listening and watching my peers, was a sense of collective strength ... it felt safer than what I’ve ever felt.”
In April, Marama Davidson was elected as co-leader of the Greens party, which holds eight seats in Jacinda Ardern’s coalition government. On Wednesday Davidson detailed for the first time the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of a distant relative in her family home when she was eight or nine years old. Charges were never brought against the relative, who has since died. “When I was a young girl I was frequently visited in my bedroom at night by an older relative, a slightly distant relative who had been staying with my family for some time. And I think that should give enough essence.” Davidson said she didn’t know what was happening to her at the time, didn’t have any words to describe it, and pretended to be asleep as a form of psychological protection. “It was such an assault, such a personal, embarrassing, shameful, shameful assault that you just shut down,” Davidson said.
According to Rape Prevention Education, one in three New Zealand girls will be subject to an unwanted sexual experience by age 16, with over 70% considered “serious” and involving genital contact. Davidson said she told no one about the assault in a bid to protect her family, but said she “acted up” and displayed “troubling behaviour” as a young girl because she didn’t know how to respond to what was happening to her. She would scream loudly whenever her parents had to leave the house, because this was when the abuse occurred. The MP, whose portfolios include Maori development and ethnic affairs, was visibly upset when recounting the trauma, and restarted her story a number of times, apologising to the interviewer. “Here I am, I am now the co-leader of a political party, in one of the most powerful positions that women could be in, but I am still thrown by this, when I have to go back to that time. So if I am feeling like that with all my privileges and supports, I can’t imagine how others feel.” she said. But her decision to go public with the experience has been met with widespread support in New Zealand.
Davidson added: “It feels unsafe to be speaking out against what happened to me, the sexual abuse that happened to me, because at the moment that sexual abuse happens to you, you are silenced and you feel like you have been pushed out to a space that is dark and alone and cold. “And that is essentially what I went through when it was happening to me, and it happened over time, and I just felt further and further and further, like I needed to shut up. And its a downward spiral because the abuse silences you, and then you feel like cannot talk to anybody and it just keeps going down and down and down.” Years later, Davidson discovered that she was not the only victim of the relative who abused her, and other girls had been harmed.
“I am speaking now to try and help others and I know this is very yuck and probably very painful, but none of it was [my family’s] fault ... sexual violence is its own monster. And it sections us off as individuals and we need to come together and tell the stories that will help other people speak up and tell someone.” Minister for Women Julie Anne Genter said she admired Davidson’s “courage and bravery” in speaking out. “No one should have to deal with unwanted sexual attention, especially children. Marama’s leadership is sending a message of hope and survival for others out there who might be struggling.” Kyla Rayner, agency manager of Wellington Rape Crisis, said it is always significant when a woman with the “influence and platform” of Davidson publicly discloses an experience of sexual violence. “Whenever stories such as these appear in the media we have a number of clients reference its importance in sessions, along with survivors reaching out to us to discuss their experiences; often resulting in an increase in new clients for our agency,” said Rayner. “These stories provide a pathway for survivors to think “I’m not alone, this has happened to others and I’m worthy of support”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/new-zealand-politician-child-sexual-abuse-marama-davidson,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/new-zealand-politician-child-sexual-abuse-marama-davidson
2018-06-27T03:13:57Z,world,World news,Australia urged to cut ties with Myanmar military over Rohingya atrocities,"Amnesty International has urged Australia to cut all financial ties with Myanmar’s military, and to support a push to try 13 of the country’s most senior security officials in the international criminal court over atrocities committed against the ethnic minority Rohingya. In the wake of the Myanmar military-led pogrom against the Rohingya in Rakhine state last year, militaries all over the world, including those of the European Union, Britain, the United States, France and Canada, cut ties with the Tatmadaw over its “disproportionate use of force” that “strongly indicates a deliberate action to expel a minority”. Australia, however, has remained in cooperation with the Myanmar military, offering $400,000 towards training in humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, peacekeeping and English classes.
“Australia must suspend all military cooperation and assistance with the Myanmar military,” the human rights lawyer and Amnesty crisis campaigns coordinator Diana Sayed said, as Amnesty released a report naming 13 security officials it argues should face trial. “It’s just outrageous that Australia maintains this relationship which all other countries have been very unequivocal in cutting. “It’s not a big amount of money but it is symbolic. It will make sure we are on the right side of history when it comes to a consistent approach on human rights.” The rationale for Australia’s involvement with the Myanmar military, which also dominates the country’s parliament and controls key government posts, is that through engagement Australia gains leverage, can assist with Myanmar’s transition to democracy, and educate its military’s senior officers. A briefing note produced by the defence department and revealed under freedom of information legislation, says: “This engagement is designed to expose the Tatmadaw to the ways of a modern, professional defence force and highlight the importance of adhering to international humanitarian law.” Australia has also donated $70m to help the Rohingya who have fled over the border to the Cox’s Bazar refugee camp in Bangladesh, and has earmarked $76.9m in official development assistance for Myanmar this financial year. The Amnesty report released in New York on Wednesday names top military and police officials allegedly implicated in the murder, rape and torture of Rohingya people. Chief among those named is Myanmar’s army chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who in April met Australia’s ambassador to Myanmar, Nicholas Coppel, in Naypyitaw for talks on bilateral cooperation in defence services and the situation in Rakhine. Also named was the Vice Senior General Soe Win, with whom Australia’s army chief, Lieutenant General Angus Campbell, held talks at a military conference in Seoul last September. Both Ming Aung Hlaing and Soe Win had previously been sanctioned by Australia between 2007 and 2012. General Maung Maung Soe, the commander of western command in Rakhine state, was also named. The Myanmar government fired him this week after direct sanctions were imposed against him and six other military officials by the EU. More than 700,000 Rohingya were forced to flee a systematic campaign of violence beginning in August last year that saw villages razed, men, women and children murdered, and rape used as a weapon of war. The UN has described the situation as a “textbook case of ethnic cleansing”. Myanmar denies the accusations.
The Muslim Rohingya are an ethnic and religious minority inside Buddhist-majority Myanmar. They are not formally recognised as a minority in Myanmar, and have faced generations of persecution and oppression, are denied citizenship and freedom of movement, have previously had limits placed on the size of their families, and are restricted in their access to healthcare and education. The Myanmar military has consistently claimed its operation last August was in response to attacks on military officials by the insurgent Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army. But Amnesty wants countries, including Australia, to support a push to have the 13 officials tried before the ICC. Its report details allegations that soldiers were given orders to shoot any Rohingya if there was any ARSA activity in the area or anyone did any “wrong”. In an audio recording obtained by Amnesty, someone purported to be a Myanmar military officer tells a Rohingya resident of Inn Din: “We got an order to burn down the entire village if there is any disturbance. If you villagers aren’t living peacefully, we will destroy everything.” Amnesty has gathered significant details about attacks on three townships – the villages of Chut Pyin, Min Gyi and Maung Nu – where it is alleged thousands of Rohingya women, men and children were murdered: bound and summarily executed; shot while running away; or burned to death inside their homes.
Amnesty also interviewed 20 women and girls who were raped, 11 of whom were gang-raped, and 23 men and two boys who allege security forces arrested and tortured them. Last month the Myanmar government announced the establishment of an “independent commission of inquiry” to investigate allegations of human rights violations “as part of its national initiative to address reconciliation, peace, stability and development in Rakhine”. The Myanmar government has also signed a memorandum of understanding with the UN for the repatriation of Rohingya refugees, so that verified displaced people could “return voluntarily in safety and dignity”. But Amnesty said previous government and military-led investigations had been whitewashes that had exculpated officials for gross abuses. “The international community should not be fooled by this latest attempt to shield perpetrators from accountability,” said Amnesty International’s senior crisis adviser, Matthew Wells, adding: “The United Nations security council must stop playing politics and urgently refer the situation in Myanmar to the international criminal court, impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Myanmar and impose targeted financial sanctions against senior officials responsible for serious violations and crimes.” ICC judges have met to discuss a possible investigation and prosecution of Myanmar over atrocities against the Rohingya. Evidence has been sent by a coalition of Bangladeshi organisation to ICC prosecutors, and the legal argument for an ICC investigation is being led by the prosecutor Fatou Bensouda. Myanmar is not a member state of the ICC, but its actions, in pushing Rohingya over the border into Bangladesh – which is a member – potentially bring it within the ICC’s remit.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/australia-urged-to-cut-ties-with-myanmar-military-over-rohingya-atrocities,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/australia-urged-to-cut-ties-with-myanmar-military-over-rohingya-atrocities
2018-06-26T22:00:21Z,world,World news,"Murders of farmers in South Africa at 20-year low, research shows","Murders of farmers in South Africa are at a 20-year low, research by one of the country’s biggest farmers’ organisations claims. Forty-seven farmers were killed in 2017-18, according to statistics compiled by AgriSA, an association of hundreds of agricultural associations across South Africa. This is consistent with a steady decline since a peak of violence in 1998 when 153 died. Between 80 and 100 were murdered each year from 2003 to 2011, and around 60 until 2016. The new lower totals contradict recent reports in Australian and other western media describing white farmers in South Africa facing “a surge in violence’.
The Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said earlier this year that white South African farmers who wanted to migrate to Australia “deserve special attention” and “help from a civilised country like ours” due to the “horrific circumstances” of land seizures and violence. His comment prompted a diplomatic row with Pretoria. The figures have been challenged by other organisations representing farmers in South Africa, but AgriSA said its research was “reliable” and an important contribution to understanding the threat faced by farmers in South Africa. The chair of the association’s Center of Excellence on Rural Safety, Kobus Breytenbach, said there had been a rise in the number of attacks on farms to 561, from 478 in 2016-17. But the numbers remain much lower than the 1,068 reached in 2001-02, seven years after South Africa’s first free elections marked the definitive end of the apartheid regime. Breytenbach, a farmer in Free State province, said the threat to farmers remained high and any decline in murders was due to precautions taken by farmers “to protect themselves and their livelihoods”. “The rural community has become alert and prepared … They are working with the South African police service and are much more organised than 20 years ago. Everyone is aware of the situation,” he said. There is fierce debate over the reason for the increase in attacks on farms in recent years. Some suggest it is in line with a general increase in violent crime. Others say it is a consequence of growing tensions between communities. Land is a focus of deep resentment. According to the Land Audit Report, 72% of agricultural land is owned by white farmers, down from 85% when apartheid ended. Much remains in the hands of the minority Afrikaner community, the white descendants of colonial-era settlers. Of 56 million South Africans, about 8% are white, according to the census. All major political parties now agree on the need for extensive land reform. In February parliament passed a motion to begin the process of amending the constitution to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. Earlier this month the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, told an audience including hundreds of Afrikaners that land reform should not be seen as a threat. “Let us not see the issue of land as a reason to pack up and go ... The future of the Afrikaner is intrinsically linked to the prosperity of the country as a whole,” he said. The ruling African National Congress party may be tempted to accelerate expropriation to head off a political threat from Julius Malema, the leader of South Africa’s radical left wing Economic Freedom Fighters party, before elections scheduled for next year. In 2016 Malema called on his followers to “occupy …. land that was taken from us by white people by force through genocide”. Johan Burger, a former policeman and expert at the respected Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria, said such heated language could contribute to violence. “There is more than one incident during which attackers claim that their actions are justified because the victims have stolen the land,” he said. “What is very difficult to explain is the level of exceptional violence,” Burger said. “One could understand the torture of victims to gain access to a safe or get a PIN number and that may be true in many instances, but there are examples of victims tortured for many hours, sometimes even until death, after information is given up. Some say attackers are motivated purely by racial hatred but it is very difficult to quantify.” The isolation of farms and the limited protection provided by police are also factors often cited to explain the level of violence in attacks.
Statistics for farm murders also include farmworkers, who are usually not white and who are also often hurt in violent attacks. Dozens of non-white farmers have been killed since 2001. There are some reports of South African farmers selling up and moving overseas, though no statistics that indicate any substantial emigration. Caty van der Merwe of Afriforum, a campaign group with specific focus on the rights of South Africa’s Afrikaner minority, said she had “come across lots who want to leave”. New Zealand was a favoured destination, said van der Merwe, who works with victims of farm attacks. Others move elsewhere in southern Africa. Breytenbach said AgriSA did not think “the solution was to run away”. “We believe it is better to stay in South Africa and make a difference here rather than to run away overseas, though it is clearly everyone’s right to make their own decisions.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/murders-of-farmers-in-south-africa-at-20-year-low-research-shows,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/27/murders-of-farmers-in-south-africa-at-20-year-low-research-shows
2018-06-26T21:00:20Z,world,World news,"Revenge porn victims must be given anonymity, Labour says","The victims of revenge porn must be given anonymity like victims of other sexual offences, Labour will argue as the government pushes through its “upskirting” bill. Research suggests one in three people who have had intimate images posted online without their consent withdrew their complaints when they could not be assured of anonymity. The issue of revenge porn hit the headlines again last week when two Love Island constants, Zara McDermott and Laura Anderson, were reported to have had intimate images and videos shared on pornographic websites while they appeared on the reality TV show.
A Labour source said the party would not seek to amend the government’s bill to specifically outlaw upskirting – where victims have intimate areas photographed under their clothes by attackers – because it did not want to delay the introduction of the new law. Instead, Labour hopes to persuade the government to bring forward legislation in government time to change the law. The government has promised to fast-track its own legislation on upskirting this week after the Conservative backbencher Christopher Chope obstructed a private member’s bill submitted by the Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse. The government bill will go before a second reading bill committee on Monday, which will mean a quicker legislative process. Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, said it was a “gross injustice” that victims of revenge porn did not have anonymity. “They have already had their privacy violated in a disgusting betrayal of trust, face having their identity made public when seeking to pursue charges,” he said. “It puts pressure on victims not to do so and lets perpetrators off the hook. The law needs to change. The Tories must act.” Image-based sexual abuse, the legal term for revenge porn, is not classified as a sexual offence, meaning victims are not granted automatic anonymity when they pursue charges. Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, said: “People who post revenge porn to try to humiliate their partners or exes are committing a serious, warped sexual offence, and should be treated as so by law. “The government must act to grant anonymity to victims of this vile crime, which has destroyed lives and sadly pushed some to taking their own lives. The Tories should ensure parliamentary time is given to change this law, which Labour will be proud to support.” The call to give revenge porn victims anonymity has cross-party support, including from Maria Miller, the Conservative MP who chairs the women and equalities select committee. Miller said the practice should be classified as a sexual offence. A Labour source said: “We are considering all options to get the law changed as quickly as possible to better protect victims. The Tories should set aside government time and bring forward legislation to parliament, which Labour will support.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/revenge-porn-victims-right-to-anonymity-labour-upskirting-bill-sexual-offence,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/revenge-porn-victims-right-to-anonymity-labour-upskirting-bill-sexual-offence
2018-06-26T20:34:25Z,world,World news,Canada's largest national park risks losing world heritage status,"The world’s second-largest national park is under threat from a destructive combination of climate change, oil and gas development and hydroelectric projects, according to a new report from the Canadian government.
Wood Buffalo national park, which straddles Alberta and the Northwest Territories, is at risk of being placed on Unesco’s endangered list following a 2017 report, whereby Canadian authorities were given a year to develop a solution to stem the rapid deterioration of the park. The UN body warned that inaction would “constitute a case for recommending inscription of Wood Buffalo national park on the List of World Heritage in Danger”. But before of a Unesco meeting in Bahrain this week, the federal government’s report has confirmed problems are only getting worse: “Desired outcomes for the world heritage values are not being met,” said the report.
The sprawling 4.5m hectare park has long been a home to the Cree and Dene indigenous peoples. It is also critical habitat for the largest free-roaming buffalo population in the world, who walk its forests, and its watershed is the only untouched breeding ground for endangered whooping cranes. Wood Buffalo – which became a world heritage site in 1983 – includes part of the world’s largest boreal river delta, formed by the Peace and the Athabasca rivers, which both run through the park and create the conditions for an extremely diverse ecosystem. But in 2014, the Miskew Cree First Nation contacted Unesco over fears the ecosystem was rapidly deteriorating. Community members no longer drink the fresh water from lakes or streams over fears of contamination and have reported that wild fish and game have developed abnormal flavours and deformities, said Melody Lepine, director of government and industry relations for the Mikisew Cree First Nation. “The community has been seeing first hand the the way the Peace Athabasca Delta has been deteriorating,” said Lepine from Bahrain, where she is representing the First Nation as Canada delivers its report. While there is no clear explanation of what has caused problems in the food sources, the Canadian government’s environmental assessment report says high levels of mercury have been found in fish and bird eggs.
A 2016 study by Unesco researchers warned that the pace and complexity of industrial development around the park was “exceptional” and found the proper mechanisms to adequately study its impacts were absent. The report also found that “the long-term future of the property’s two most iconic species, wood bison and whooping crane, remains uncertain and requires permanent attention”. A 2017 report by Unesco and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature determined the problems facing Wood Buffalo were “far more complex and severe than previously thought”. The park’s diversity makes it particularly sensitive to upstream development projects. Two dams already cut across the Peace river and a new multibillion dollar hydroelectric project – known as Site C – has prompted warning from First Nations and environmental groups that river flows will continue to be weak in the delta.
Further complicating the situation, oil and gas operations in the northern reaches of Alberta continue to draw large amounts of water to sustain their operations. “Seasonal flows in the Athabasca river have declined over the past 50 years due to a combination of increased water withdrawals and (past) climate change,” said the Canadian government’s report. Experts on the UN committee also fear increased development in the region –including recently approved mining permits – creates near-unavoidable risks of chemical spills into the water system. “Canada is responding to the 2017 request of the World Heritage Committee to develop an action plan for the site, and is taking concrete steps to address the recommendations of the recent reactive monitoring mission to Wood Buffalo national park,” said Parks Canada in an emailed statement, adding that the “work is well underway”. “Nothing Canada’s doing today is demonstrating they are really taking this seriously,” said Lepine. “Our health, our way of life and our culture depend on Wood Buffalo. We have the spiritual ties to that area go far deeper than Canada’s commitment to it.” This article was amended on 28 June 2018 to clarify that Wood Buffalo, although its heritage status it at risk, has not been placed on Unesco’s List of World Heritage in Danger.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/canada-wood-buffalo-national-park-report-climate-change,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/canada-wood-buffalo-national-park-report-climate-change
2018-06-26T17:20:11Z,world,World news,Is Rebekah Vardy starting a World Cup feminist revolution – or taking us back to the 50s?,"It feels like it must have been the 1990s, but it was actually 2006 that the term Wag was coined. It describes the wives and girlfriends of the football team who, without looking it up, just by the law of averages, I am going to call “doomed England.” Indeed, part of the flurry around the women surrounding the players was a resigned displacement activity, in the way that you go on and on about Christmas carols when you know you are not going to get any good presents. The problem then was the dual sexism of both objectifying the Wags – so much attention was fixed on their breasts that the issue became impossible to drop, and the entire summer thereafter was taken up chasing Cheryl Tweedy and Coleen McLoughlin (this was before they became Cole and Rooney) around beaches shooting for a proper view – and defining them by their husbands and boyfriends. It was like a horrific Doctor Who time-travelling mashup of 50s and 90s sexism, the worst of both, no decent argument lodged against either.
The full-voiced rebuttal of Rebekah Vardy (“Wag is a dated term because we’re not defined by what our husbands do. We’re individuals”), wife of Leicester City and England striker Jamie, is to be welcomed regardless of what she says, really, because a core problem of the first Wag wave was that no one ever listened to anything they actually said. Except … “The wives and girlfriends have a much lower profile now and that is how it should be. Our job is to be supportive,” she said this week. “I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely pissed knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.” This distils modern life, for me: there was so much wrong with the 2006 Wag trope, but it did one thing right, which was that they were followed around because they looked as though they were enjoying themselves. There was something so exuberant about the scene. The spinoffs were wonderful – Wags Come Dine With Me was joie de vivre on a plate, and everyone would have laughed at their pronunciation of “vivre” or “de”, as they did when Jessica Lawlor pronounced Thai chicken “thigh chicken”, but that was really just an edge to mask the embarrassment of the national affection for them.

2018-06-26T17:11:01Z,world,World news,Supreme court rules in favour of anti-abortion clinics in free speech case,"Clinics that call themselves crisis pregnancy centers are not obliged to tell women when state aid may be available to obtain an abortion, according to a US supreme court ruling that represents a blow to pro-choice groups. Crisis pregnancy centers are storefronts which have the look and feel of women’s health clinics, but are often backed by Christian groups that try to persuade women not to have abortions. The split ruling by the justices, coming from a case in California that went all the way to the supreme court, is a win for anti-abortion groups, which have gained ground under Donald Trump’s administration. “We are pleased that today’s decision protects Americans’ freedom of speech,” said Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, after the ruling. “Speakers should not be forced by their government to promote a message with which they disagree, and pro-life pregnancy centers in California should not be forced to advertise abortion and undermine the very reason they exist.” He continued: “This department will continue to vigorously defend the freedom of all Americans to speak peacefully in accord with their deeply held beliefs and conscience.” Anti-abortion groups called the decision on Tuesday a “win for life”. America’s highest court legalized abortion in the landmark 1973 decision in Roe v Wade. Since, abortion foes have sought to chip away at those rights and have accelerated their efforts under Trump, who has been supportive of their cause. The new decision is a significant victory for groups that operate pregnancy centers. As the ruling was announced, reproductive rights protesters were already outside the court. The justices sent the case back to lower courts, where the law requiring clinics to tell low-income women about abortion options is likely to be struck down. “We will not stop fighting. This is not about abortion – this is about controlling women,” said Ilyse Hogue, the president of pro-choice group Naral, told protesters.
In an opinion written by the conservative Judge Clarence Thomas and joined by the court’s swing vote, Justice Anthony Kennedy, the opinion ruled California’s law would be “unduly burdensome”, that it would “chill” the protected speech of employees of anti-abortion clinics, and the state “has offered no justification that the notice plausibly furthers”. All three of the court’s female members dissented, in an opinion joined by Justice Stephen Breyer. There are roughly 2,700 crisis pregnancy centers in the United States, including about 200 in California. The clinics vastly outnumber health clinics where women can obtain abortions. California officials said some centers mislead women by presenting themselves as reproductive health facilities, going so far as to resemble medical clinics, down to lab coats worn by staff. California’s Reproductive Fact Act required licensed family planning facilities to post or distribute notices about state programs offering free or low-cost birth control, prenatal care and abortion services. The law also mandated unlicensed centers, which may have no medical provider on staff, to inform women about these programs.
Reproductive rights advocates compared the law to the kind of information anti-abortion campaigners compelled doctors to read to patients in some states, even though, in some cases, the material contained errors of scientific fact. In one case cited by Justice Elena Kagan’s dissent, Akron, Ohio once passed a law requiring doctors to tell women about the “physical and emotional complications” that may occur after an abortion, and “the unborn child is a human life from the moment of conception”.

The first hint of trouble for Ottawa’s Bluesfest, an outdoor festival that draws some 300,000 people each year in the nation’s capital, came last week after workers at the site stumbled across an agitated killdeer, a brown and white bird that weighs less than five ounces. The bird – which enjoys protected status in Canada – had laid four speckled eggs on a cobblestone patch, effectively claiming the main stage area as its nesting grounds. “This is one of the most challenging problems we’ve been presented with, but we feel we can work through this,” said Mark Monahan, the executive director of the festival, which is due to start on 5 July. “Anything that disrupts the schedule has a major effect, so we’re taking it very seriously.”
The discovery brought set up for the main stage to a standstill. Federal officials rushed to protect the nest and the eggs, hiring a security guard to watch over it 24 hours a day and cordoning off the area with yellow tape. Environmentalists – who noted that killdeer eggs generally need to be incubated for up to 26 days – were also brought in. “We don’t know when the eggs might hatch,” said Monahan. What is known is that the young killdeer will likely leave the nest soon after they are hatched, leading many to hope that the eggs might hatch in the next day or so. If that’s not the case and a solution can’t be found, he added, “then we’re faced with some delays that could start to snowball”. The festival is now seeking permission from Environment Canada to relocate the nest some 50 metres away or take it to a wildlife centre, so that as many as 10 tractor trailers a day can continue to bring in equipment for the festival’s five stages. Moving the nest would also ensure the bird and its young would be protected from stomping patrons during the festival’s 11-day run, said Monahan. “It is highly unlikely that the activity level – which will be tremendous in a week – would be conducive to the eggs or the bird continuing to be here.” Monahan was confident that the festival, which features acts ranging from Bryan Adams to the Foo Fighters, would go on as planned. “Most of the people we’re working with … are looking for a positive solution,” Monahan said. “There is no one saying that the festival can’t go on.” As news of the dilemma spread, it left residents divided. Some rallied behind the bird, named after its shrieking call that sounds like “kill deer”, worried that moving the nest might result in the eggs being abandoned. Others expressed annoyance that the small plover, which is widespread across North America, was risking a festival that contributes more than C$30m annually to the local economy. The killdeer’s propensity to build its nest in open fields or flat areas with little vegetation has caused a flap in other jurisdictions; earlier this year construction on a US$4m health center in Ladysmith, Wisconsin was temporarily halted after a killdeer and its clutch of four eggs were discovered.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/ottawa-tiny-bird-threatens-cancellation-of-giant-music-festival-ottawas-bluesfest,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/ottawa-tiny-bird-threatens-cancellation-of-giant-music-festival-ottawas-bluesfest
2018-06-26T16:51:40Z,world,World news,EU hearing puts Poland in dock over judicial changes,"Poland has been put in the dock by its fellow EU member states in an unprecedented hearing over the country’s alleged failure to respect democratic norms. In a move the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said he deplored, France and Germany laid out the case against the country’s rightwing government during a meeting of ministers in Luxembourg. Three hours were set aside for the process, during which the Polish government was asked to respond to a series of questions over contentious changes to the country’s judiciary. There will be an assessment of Poland’s responses to the questions from the other 27 member states at a further meeting in July, along with a decision on the next steps, reporters were told after the hearing.
It is the first time an EU member state has been subject to a hearing over the strength of its democratic institutions. The European commission launched its rule of law procedure against Poland in December over an alleged erosion of judicial independence under the ruling Law and Justice party. Under the terms of the so-called “nuclear option” of article 7 of the treaties, the procedure could ultimately result in Poland losing its EU voting rights, although Hungary’s rightwing prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has vowed to veto any such move. A potential vote, requiring a qualified majority of member states, could lead to the EU taking so-called “preventative measures” against Poland, if it was agreed that the Polish government posed a systemic risk to the bloc. The substance of those measures has yet to be spelled out, with commission sources admitting they were in unchartered territory. The Netherlands foreign minister, Stef Blok, said in Luxembourg: “The rule of law is one of the backbones of European cooperation, and there are a number of laws in Poland that raise questions.” Frans Timmermans, the commission’s vice president, who has repeatedly clashed with the Polish government over the issue, said: “We are in a new phase with a hearing and the inclusion of member states is extremely important.”After the hearing, Timmermans said he had not seen any change in the Polish position during a presentation given by delegation from Warsaw. He insisted the door for dialogue was still open for Poland, but that the EU needed to see fresh thinking. “I have not had any indication of that today,” he said. The Polish government, which came to power in 2015, claims it was merely seeking to reform a corrupt justice system that had failed to modernise in the 30 years since the fall of communism. A new supreme court law, coming into effect on 3 July, could force the resignation of 40% of current judges, with presidential assent being required for those who wish to stay on. The new laws additionally created a new “extraordinary appeal” chamber within the supreme court that could reopen cases from the previous 20 years on appeal from the prosecutor general, who is also the justice minister. Morawiecki said, however, his government had shown “goodwill and readiness for compromise” by making some amendments to its judicial reforms this year at the request of the commission. The Polish prime minister, speaking in Warsaw, said: “Our partners don’t understand what the post-communist reality looks like. The justice system had a problem with self-cleansing.” It is unclear how widely shared the commission’s concerns about Poland are among the EU member states. Arriving in Luxembourg, the UK’s minister in the room, Martin Callanan, expressed the British government’s belief that the commission should not be meddling in the domestic affairs of an EU member. Lord Callanan said: “We hope that the dialogue will continue and they will reach an agreement. We think dialogue is always best in these situations and we want to see a negotiated outcome.” However, Luxembourg’s foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, said the defence of Europe’s democratic institutions was vital. He said: “We are not here to judge Poland or criticise Poland. We’re here to say that in Europe, the independence of the judiciary is sacred, so everything has to be done to protect it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/eu-hearing-puts-poland-in-dock-over-judicial-changes,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/eu-hearing-puts-poland-in-dock-over-judicial-changes
2018-06-26T16:23:48Z,world,World news,European parliament 'won't pay for offshore migrant camps',"A senior European politician has warned that MEPs would seek to block any use of EU funds for offshore migrant camps in north Africa. The opposition to offshore centres for processing asylum claims raises tensions before an EU summit that will be dominated by a political crisis over migration that threatens Angela Merkel’s future as German chancellor. As Mediterranean countries spar over who is responsible for people rescued at sea, the EU is reviving the idea of processing asylum claims in countries outside Europe. Claude Moraes, a British Labour MEP who chairs the European parliament’s influential justice and home affairs committee, said the parliament “wouldn’t cooperate on the budget” for such centres, because “we think these ideas are extreme and we are not going to touch them”. The parliament must give its consent to the EU’s next seven-year budget, which foresees spending €35bn (£31bn) on border management from 2021-27, compared with €13bn in the current budget. Moraes chairs the committee that co-legislates EU migration law and said that many of its MEPs shared his legal and ethical qualms about offshore processing. However, the centre-right EPP bloc is understood to be more supportive of offshore centres, as long as they are not set up in Libya, where the UN human rights chief has reported “unimaginable horrors” in migrant detention camps. Even if the European parliament were able to block EU money for offshore migrant camps, member states could still fund them. But opposition from the European parliament would be a setback for credibility. “Offshoring has been tried before,” Moraes told the Guardian. “[It] is not an asylum system in our view, because you wouldn’t guarantee human rights, you wouldn’t guarantee proper processing and you wouldn’t have any guarantee that someone who had any asylum claim would end up in the European Union.” The MEP said the United Nations refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration were wrong to encourage offshore centres, in a rare criticism of the two UN-linked agencies. The UNHCR wrote to the European commission last week, proposing discussion of “disembarkation centres”, while EU officials are seeking involvement of the IOM, which has concerns, but is yet to state its official position. At an EU summit on Thursday, leaders are expected to give their blessing to “regional disembarkation platforms”, according to a draft communique, but many questions remain unanswered. It is not clear whether the camps would only be for people rescued at sea or for any migrants, or where they would be. No country has agreed to host the centres, while Tunisia has flatly refused. At an emergency meeting of EU leaders on Sunday, some – such as Belgium’s prime minister, Charles Michel – asked for details of the scheme’s legality. The European commissioner for migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, insists the EU will be guided by international law. “I am against Guantánamo Bay for migrants,” he told journalists. “This is not what we are discussing or what we have proposed.” Brussels officials see the plan as an acceptable alternative to one recently floated proposal of expelling migrants from the EU to camps in neighbouring countries. Austria, which takes over the EU rotating presidency on 1 July, is seeking an overhaul of European asylum laws, which would mean Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis would no longer be able to make an asylum claim on European soil. The Austrian government, a centre-right and far-right coalition, wants “a new, better protection system under which no applications for asylum are filed on EU territory”, with limited exceptions, according to a leaked discussion paper. The paper highlights “weaknesses in the fields of external border protection” and provides a window into official fears about migrants. It states that large numbers of lone, poorly educated young men are travelling to Europe, many of whom are “particularly susceptible to ideologies that are hostile to freedom and/or are prone to turning to crime”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/european-parliament-wont-pay-for-offshore-migrant-camps,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/european-parliament-wont-pay-for-offshore-migrant-camps
2018-06-26T16:19:51Z,world,World news,Thai cave rescuers consider options as search continues,"There are few more difficult environments for rescue efforts than flooded caves. Divers must navigate through darkness and kicked-up silt that can reduce visibility almost to nothing even with underwater lights, and progress is painstakingly slow . The challenges have been starkly underlined as Navy Seal divers and other rescuers re-entered a partly flooded cave in northern Thailand on Tuesday to search for 12 boys and their football coach believed to have been trapped there for three days. As helicopters hovered overhead, large crowds amassed around the cave’s muddy entrance on Tuesday, including distraught parents in plastic raincoats who prayed for the team’s safe return. “I asked for all God’s wishes, but I’m certain in my heart that they will survive. They have been inside the cave before,” said the father of one of the boys. Divers have been trying to move through the chambers of the Tham Luang Nang Non cave complex, in Chiang Rai province, but the flooding has hindered their progress. Officials have also been seeking alternative ways in, deploying helicopters and search parties on foot to look for cave openings. There have been suggestions from some Thai rescuers that they could teach the trapped boys basic scuba techniques to get them out, but Martyn Farr, a celebrated cave diver and author of The Darkness Beckons, cautioned against it. Describing his involvement in the rescue of two non-diving cavers in Wales around six years ago, he said: “I was dispatched through the flooded passage and found the two cavers. My advice was to leave them there until the waters receded because that is the safest option for the non diver: treat them as being trapped and bring food and what they need to them. “Because of the bad weather forecast, the decision was made to lead them out. It was uneventful because it was only a 5-6 metre long passage and only 2 metres deep, but you can drown in a swimming pool.” Farr emphasised the difference between entering cave systems in optimal conditions and after heavy rain, when there is heavy water flow as well as visibility problems. “If there has been heavy rain it is going to be turbid and very disorienting. In narrow tunnels like you find in the UK it is easier to navigate but if this was a big walking passage it will be difficult. It could be meandering with alcoves and high ceilings which means that navigating through it could be painfully slow.” The Thai boys, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach are believed to have entered the cave late on Saturday afternoon. The search began after a mother reported that her son had not returned home from football practice that day. After days of searching, officials said on Tuesday they had found a previously unknown opening in the cave through which they would attempt to airlift rescuers and food inside. “If we find [the boys], the first thing is to provide first aid and food before thinking of how to bring them back up,” said the interior minister, Gen Anupong Paochinda. “We will not stop, we will work 24 hours. We’re racing against time and we want them to be safe.” The cave complex extends for several miles and has wide chambers and narrow passageways with rocky outcrops and changes in elevation. Officials have said they hope the missing group found a safe space away from the floods. In previous incidents, tourists trapped in the cave by rising waters have been rescued after the water receded a few days later. At a prayer session on Monday evening, some of the relatives walked into the cave’s entrance. One woman called out: “My son, come on out! I am waiting for you here!”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/thai-cave-rescuers-consider-options-as-search-continues,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/thai-cave-rescuers-consider-options-as-search-continues
2018-06-26T13:02:33Z,world,World news,"Why the naked hermit of Japan has had to leave his island after 29 years
","Name: The Naked Hermit. Real Name: Masafumi Nagasaki. Age: 82. Appearance: Well, you know … he’s an 82-year-old naked hermit. I see. Doesn’t he get cold? Not much. Until a few months ago, he lived on Sotobanari, a tropical island on the far southern tip of the Ryukyu Islands below Japan. He had been there since 1989. Holy moly! Agreed. He was like a real Robinson Crusoe, with a few minor differences. Such as? Well, he was naked apart from a pair of sandals. Yes, I got that. And he bought rice cakes from another island once a week, using money from his sister.
Hey, that’s cheating! Look, surviving alone on an island is actually quite difficult. You don’t say. And of course he wasn’t shipwrecked like Crusoe. He chose to be there. Why? The details of his life before Sotobanari are vague. According to Alvaro Cerezo, an explorer who stayed with him for five days in 2014, Nagasaki used to be married. And for some reason Mrs Nagasaki didn’t want a naked hermit for a husband? One imagines not. He was a photographer at one point, and may have been working in a factory in Osaka when the hermit plan first came to him. Osaka? The futuristic metropolis? That’s right. As he told Cerezo, he was a “city man with no outdoor experience” but civilisation didn’t appeal to him. He planned to stay for only two years. And a typhoon stripped away much of the island’s vegetation and many of his possessions. Like his clothes? Exactly. But then he found his groove, and has since largely given up killing or eating animals, even the deadly pit-vipers that sometimes slither into his tent. Wow. So he’s, like, a super-hippie? Not quite. He’s super-practical and secular. He spends all day tidying the beach, and keeps to a rigid routine governed by a wristwatch he keeps on a tree branch. Between 6.30pm and 8.30am he stays in his tent to avoid mosquitos. He became furious if Cerezo was even a couple of minutes late. I guess you pick up a few quirks as a hermit. I guess. So why did he stop? These details are vague, too. But it seems he was spotted looking weak and taken to the city of Ishigaki to recover. Now he’s not allowed to return. “My wish is to die here without bothering anyone,” he once told Cerezo. “I want to be killed by a typhoon, so nobody can try to save me.” Poor guy. I know. I’m sure the vipers miss him. Do say: “I renounce the evils of civilisation!” Don’t say: “Except sandals, watches, tents, rice cakes, boats and money from my sister.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2018/jun/26/why-the-naked-hermit-of-japan-has-had-to-leave-his-island-after-29-years,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/shortcuts/2018/jun/26/why-the-naked-hermit-of-japan-has-had-to-leave-his-island-after-29-years
2018-06-26T12:39:41Z,world,World news,UK poised to overcome Russian objections in chemical weapons vote,"The west appears to have the votes to defeat Russia and force through changes that would give weapons inspectors expanded powers to identify those responsible for using chemical weapons in Syria. The changes are being proposed by a UK-led alliance angry at the way Russia has shielded the regime of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, from culpability over the repeated use of chemical weapons. The UK has convened a special conference of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague at which it is proposing the OPCW should be empowered not just to investigate whether chemical weapons have been used in an incident, as at present, but also to identify the group or government responsible. Russia, already at loggerheads with the UK over the use of a nerve agent in Salisbury, is fiercely resisting the move, saying it will politicise the OPCW. It claims British Russophobia risks wrecking a respected and largely scientific body that is responsible for overseeing adherence to the chemical weapons convention. After a bitter procedural battle in the opening two hours of the conference, the OPCW finally adopted its agenda, brushing aside Russian objections. With 107 countries voting, 98 countries backed a US-led call to adopt the conference agenda, with nine led by Russia opposing. The vote suggests the west probably has the numbers win a substantive vote on Wednesday empowering the OPCW for the first time to identify the parties using chemical weapons in Syria. The motion requires a two-thirds majority, not counting abstentions. A total of 147 countries are accredited to the conference, but the credentials of 32 countries were under challenge. Mounting a relentless series of points of order, delaying the conference’s start, Russia, Syria and Iran tried to have the meeting adjourned until questions about the validity of the 32 delegations were resolved. But the US ambassador Kenneth Ward eventually demanded that the conference go ahead and vote to adopt the agenda. “I insist on a vote right now,” he said, leading to further Russian protests. The UK’s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, told the conference:“At present the OPCW’s experts will say where and when an attack happened, but not who was responsible. If we’re serious about upholding the ban on chemical weapons, that gap must be filled.”Any extension of the OPCW’s powers would unnerve Assad’s army, which has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons to drive out opposition forces, most recently in Douma, a suburb of Damascus. The Douma attack led to a cruise missile assault on Syrian chemical weapons sites led by the US, France and the UK in April. OPCW inspectors visited the site of the Douma attack 12 weeks ago and have yet to report. Assad, supported by his sponsor Russia, has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons, dismissing the incidents as stunts mounted by western intelligence. At present the OPCW’s inspectors only have powers to say whether chemical weapons have been used following a fact-finding visit, but not to identify the group or country suspected of deploying them in any specific incident. Last November at the UN, Russia vetoed the renewal of the mandate of the Joint independent Mechanism, the body charged with identifying the perpetrators. The west claimed Russia had used its veto as a permanent member of the security council because the JIM’s reports had shown the Assad regime was repeatedly breaking the weapons convention mainly by using sarin or chlorine on Syrian citizens. The JIM had found the Syrian government responsible for an attack at Khan Sheykhun in 2017 that killed as many as 90 people. Britain has the support of the secretariat of the OPCW to give the body wider powers and to enforce the previously established prohibition of the use of chemical weapons. It says the attribution responsibility is within the existing mandate of the OPCW. The UK is specifically calling for the attribution powers to be used initially in Syria, and for a wider strengthening of the OPCW to be endorsed and considered at a further special conference in six months’ time. It says the OPCW must adopt a higher profile or it will drift into irrelevance. Russia has tabled a counter-proposal that the UK says would give Russia the right to veto the OPCW conclusions and would undermine the independence of the OPCW director-general. Diplomatically, it would be a blow for the UK if the special conference – which is open to any country that has signed the chemical weapons convention – votes both for the British resolution and the resolution backed by Russia. OPCW procedures require a vote to be held on Wednesday on a show of hands after a 24-hour cooling-off period has been exhausted.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/uk-on-collision-course-with-russia-over-chemical-weapons-vote,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/uk-on-collision-course-with-russia-over-chemical-weapons-vote
2018-06-26T11:59:52Z,world,World news,Second Spanish church falls prey to well-intentioned restorer,"For 500 years, the painted wooden effigy of St George that adorns a chapel in the Spanish town of Estella has been locked in a silent struggle against his old foe, the dragon. Today, however, the saint faces a different battle thanks to a feat of restoration that has prompted comparisons with the infamous “Ecce Homo Monkey Christ” and exasperated the mayor.
An attempt to freshen up the 16th-century polychrome statue has left St George with a rosy pink face and a bold, red-and-grey suit of armour. The restoration is believed to have been carried out by a handicrafts teacher at the request of the parish authorities of the Church of St Michael. The mayor of Estella, which lies south-west of Pamplona in the Navarre region, is demanding to know why the council was not consulted before the work went ahead. Koldo Leoz told the Guardian: “The parish decided on its own to take action to restore the statue and gave the job to a local handicrafts teacher. The council wasn’t told and neither was the regional government of Navarre.” The mayor said he had been to see the statue and was not happy with the result. “It’s not been the kind of restoration that it should have been for this 16th-century statue. They’ve used plaster and the wrong kind of paint and it’s possible that the original layers of paint have been lost.” Leoz said experts had been called in and were checking whether it would be possible to undo the restoration work and restore the statue to its previous state. “This is an expert job it should have been done by experts,” he added. “Today, Estella isn’t in the news because of its spectacular historical, artistic, architectural or cultural heritage,” he tweeted on Monday, above a picture from the local paper headlined: “Navarre’s own Ecce Homo.” It was in the news, he added, “because of the unfortunate actions in regard to a 16th-century statue of St George that can be found within one of the most impressive churches in the city”. Six years ago, a well-intentioned woman’s attempts to restore a fresco of the scourged Christ in a church in the north-eastern Spanish city of Borja went viral, with her efforts dubbed “the worst restoration in history”. However, Cecilia Giménez soon found herself a minor celebrity after visitors flocked to the church to see her handiwork.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/second-spanish-church-falls-prey-to-well-intentioned-restorer-st-george-ecce-homo-monkey-christ,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/second-spanish-church-falls-prey-to-well-intentioned-restorer-st-george-ecce-homo-monkey-christ
2018-06-26T11:47:25Z,world,World news,Myanmar fires general who led violence against Rohingya,"Myanmar has fired the military general who led the campaign of violence against the Rohingya, after the EU imposed direct sanctions on him and six other officers. On Monday, the EU and Canada named seven Myanmar military officers who would be subject to a travel ban and have their assets frozen for their pivotal role in the violence in Rakhine state, which has led to 700,000 Rohingya fleeing over the border to Bangladesh since last August. In a rare example of Myanmar bowing to pressure from the west over the actions of the military, the government responded to the sanctions with an announcement that Maj Gen Maung Maung Soe was being removed from his position.
He had been the head of western command in Rakhine during the assault on Rohingya villages and, in a statement, the EU described him as “responsible for the atrocities and serious human rights violations committed … These include unlawful killings, sexual violence and systematic burning of Rohingya houses and buildings.” The Myanmar government did not refer to the sanctions in its statement and said the general was fired due to weakness in his response to the attacks on police outposts by the Rohingya militant group Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). These attacks, in 2016 and August 2017, are seen as the catalyst for the Myanmar military coming down on the Rohingya community in Rakhine with such brute force. The EU also imposed sanctions on Lt Gen Aung Kyaw Zaw, whose Bureau of Special Operations No 3 oversaw the western command. He had already been given “permission to resign” in May, while Thant Zin Oo, the commander of the 8th Security Police Battalion, was also named and sanctioned.
The EU and wider international community removed sanctions against Myanmar in 2015 when it seemed the country was opening up and moving towards democracy, with Aung San Suu Kyi appointed de facto leader. However, the violence in Rakhine demonstrated the control the military still had over the Myanmar government and some sanctions were reimposed by the EU and the US. The decision to fire Maung Maung Soe is an indicator that the government now wants to demonstrate to the international community that it is making the military accountable for the violence in Rakhine, which has been described as ethnic cleansing by the UN. Previously the Myanmar military has denied culpability for the violence against the Rohingya.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/myanmar-fires-general-who-led-violence-against-rohingya,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/myanmar-fires-general-who-led-violence-against-rohingya
2018-06-26T11:13:52Z,world,World news,Hoax 'devil coins' found in Bath Abbey,"Two “devil coins” that were hidden in Scandinavian churches as part of an elaborate hoax in the 1970s have been discovered in the unlikely setting of Bath Abbey. Dusty odds and ends, including an order of service from 1902, were found in the abbey when stalls were removed for restoration work. The most intriguing discovery, however, was two coins bearing a picture of Satan and the legend Civitas Diaboli on one side and 13 Maj Anholt 1973 on the other. Experts figured out the coins were linked to the story of a Danish eccentric who perpetrated an elaborate 40-year hoax that was only discovered almost a decade after his death. The date on the coins refers to an episode that took place on the island of Anholt, between Denmark and Sweden, in May 1973. Thirteen “ritual sites” were discovered by residents that prompted an investigation by police from the Danish mainland. Police puzzled over the meaning of the sites, where items included strange masks, weird stone formations, bones wrapped in string, black candles and a (fake) shrunken head on a stake. The story was picked up by the Danish national media and salacious stories of satanic cults on Anholt abounded. Coins like those found at Bath Abbey began to be discovered in churches and museums across Denmark. Some were accompanied by letters claiming to be from a satanic high priestess named Alice Mandragora. In 2013, the Danish newspaper Politiken ran a six-part investigation into the coin phenomenon, revealing that the Anholt mystery was a hoax perpetrated by Knud Langkow, an office clerk at the National Gallery of Denmark who died in 2004, aged 73. His niece Lene Langkow Saaek told the newspaper he was not a satanist and the hoax was just his sense of humour. “I think normality annoyed him,” she said. ‘He did not like ordinary.” Some coins may have been minted by Langkow but others are thought to have been created by independent experts who were in on the joke. Bath’s Anholt coins are in the care of Wessex Archaeology and will be included in the final site archive, alongside artefacts dating from the Roman through to the modern period. Bruce Eaton, the project manager, said historians and archeologists were used to written artefacts telling an untrue story, but not physical ones. “As archaeologists we set great store by the integrity of the physical objects we recover. To discover finds that are a fabrication, designed to mislead, is both fascinating and a timely reminder that we should always view any discovery with a critical eye.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/hoax-devil-coins-found-in-bath-abbey,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/hoax-devil-coins-found-in-bath-abbey
2018-06-26T10:22:34Z,world,World news,Goa brings in 'no-selfie zones' on coast after spate of deaths,"The Indian state of Goa has identified 24 “no-selfie zones” along its coastline after a spate of deaths and injuries. Signs warning against taking selfies have sprung up in recent days on cliffs, popular beaches and swimming holes in the state, which attracts about 6 million tourists each year. The safety push comes after two tourists from Tamil Nadu state died in separate incidents on 17 June after climbing on to rocky outcrops in the ocean to take selfies. Both were swept away by large waves and drowned, police said. Warning signs are already posted in many areas considered to be dangerous but are routinely ignored.
“People are not taking responsibility for their safety,” said the head of the private lifesaving company that monitors beaches in the state, Ravi Shanker. “People don’t realise a dry surface now could be washed away in 20 seconds. And because people are looking at their mobiles their alertness levels are low.”There are more selfie deaths in India than any other country in the world, according to a 2016 study. The survey found there were more than 127 reported deaths worldwide from selfies in 2014 and 2015 – most related to heights, vehicles or water. Of those, 76 deaths occurred in India, including a 2014 incident in which 10 young people tried to take a selfie while on a lake in Maharashtra. They tipped the craft and seven died. In another incident in January a man from Hyderabad was filming himself standing beside tracks as a train was passing. He misjudged the distance and was hit by the train and left with severe injuries. Domestic tourism in India has surged as incomes have grown. “Many have never seen ocean before landing up in Goa,” Shanker said. “And that comes up with its own set of problems.

2018-06-26T10:00:29Z,world,World news,"Amid Canada’s housing crisis, to live in a coffee shop isn't all that unusual","A middle-aged man in gold chains and Adidas shorts is yelling loudly into a phone about “politically correct maggots” and making racist slurs. Another man, wearing black dress shoes with a leather jacket, sleeps facedown on a table, raising his head periodically in his sleep and puckering his lips. Neither arouses any obvious interest from the other customers. It is not surprising that a permanently homeless man would feel as though he could blend into this Vancouver branch of Tim Hortons, a 24-hour donut and coffee shop, at all hours. This is where Ted came every day for 10 years. Staff members and regulars alike knew his rolling suitcase, his handlebar mustache and his scowling disposition. It was not unusual to find him sleeping in the restaurant.
But when another homeless friend found Ted slumped over a table at 3am on the last day of May this year, he thought the way Ted’s head rested askew on the edge of the table did not look right. The friend noticed a bad smell, saw black bile pooling on the table and touched Ted’s hands: they were cold. Still, staff were so used to Ted that they needed to be convinced to call 911. An ambulance took Ted to Vancouver General Hospital, where he was officially declared dead. His friend said he overheard a paramedic speculating that Ted might have been dead for 12 hours. As the story made headlines in Canada and internationally – that a man living in a coffee shop for 10 years had died in it, too – more details emerged about Ted’s life. He was in 70s, had terminal cancer, and although he had been homeless for a decade he had also worked most of his life in low-wage jobs. Since retiring he received a government pension, but it was not enough for him to afford housing – so he lived at the Tim Hortons, a place where he could eat, sleep and wash up while passing himself off as a working-class guy on a coffee break.
Ted’s living situation was shocking, but it is mirrored across Vancouver, a city that is in the grips of an unprecedented housing crisis. A dwelling here now costs $1.4m (£800,000) on average, making it the least affordable city in North America. Most observers point the finger at some combination of foreign capital coupled with a shortage of homes: the vacancy rate is less than 1% and nearly half of the renters in the city, where a one-bedroom apartment averages $2,060 per month, are paying more than they can afford. One of the results has been a sharp rise in the city’s homeless population – a 25% increase since 2015 – of which Ted’s death was a very public reminder. “[It’s] symbolic of the inequality of Vancouver,” says urban planner Andy Yan of Ted’s story. “This is supposed to be Canada. Shouldn’t we be held to a higher standard in these issues of homelessness?” Sacrifice a fixed address – or leave Canada, however, isn’t alone. The housing crisis has hit major metropolitan centres across the world. According to a 2017 report by the World Resources Institute, 330m urban families do not have housing that is “adequate, secure and affordable”. The number is set to grow to 440 million households by 2025. But the steep ascent in Vancouver has been particularly remarkable. Real estate prices began to rise sharply in 2003; they have nearly quadrupled since. In 2015, the average price of a detached home went up $193,000, nearly triple Vancouver’s average household income of $72,662.
This has put unprecedented pressure on young renters such as Danielle Eastveld. Last year, Eastveld took what would once have been an unusual step for someone with a law degree: she gave notice on her apartment and moved into a motorhome that she bought for $4,000 off Craigslist. A thirtysomething bartender, she said she found herself crushed by what she calls the “trickle-down effect”: as dual-income families who could once afford to buy a house are forced to rent, it becomes harder for everyone else to find affordable housing – including the working class and seniors like Ted, as well as younger millennials like herself. She lived for a time on an industrial road that is popular with other Vancouverites living in cars. They are predominantly male, and tend to have fewer options than Eastveld, who considers her living situation a choice. After getting tickets from the city, she now rents a parking spot in an alley. By sacrificing a fixed address, she saves about $1,000 a month.
“I need a nest egg,” she says. “I’m getting to an age where the paycheque-to-paycheque life is getting old.” Other friends, she says, have decided to pack up and leave Vancouver; those who remain say they are struggling to adjust – to the rising costs of living, to “renovictions” (a term coined for when a landlord evicts a tenant in order to sell or raise the rent) and to displacement. “Quite a few friends were skeptical,” she says about her rent-free life. “Now they’re jealous.” Stability comes first The poorest in the city, for whom market-rate rents are unfathomable, must turn to government assistance. There, they say they find a shortage of units and long wait times. Like Ted, Jacques Lacroix worked almost all his life. Four years ago, while working at a demolition job, he fell and broke his back. He says his boss lied about the accident, preventing him from collecting compensation. Soon afterwards, he joined the quarter of Vancouver’s homeless who sleep outside rather than in shelters. Neatly attired in a black baseball cap and crisp black jeans, Lacroix, 59, is waiting for lunch in the Union Gospel Mission (UGM), which serves 800 meals daily. Last night, it turned away 17 people from its 72 shelter beds. Lacroix’s application for social housing is considered low-priority because “guys like me” – physically and mentally sound – “can take care of ourselves. If you’re a drug addict, they’re going to pick you up”. The neighbourhood where UGM is located, the Downtown Eastside, has high rates of mental illness, HIV infection, poverty and addiction. Nonnie, 39, a member of Squamish First Nation, has struggled with the latter. She lives in a shelter for women while she waits for a government-subsidized home. “I can’t pursue anything else until I have housing,” Nonnie says. “You have to be stable in order to do anything else.”
Many advocates agree with her: that stable housing is a necessary first step to addressing the opioid epidemic that has ravaged many neighbourhoods in North America. Local and provincial governments in Canada have committed to a series of measures, including $66m to build 600 units of temporary modular housing throughout Vancouver. These prefabricated, three-story buildings take only a few months to raise, and have individual 250 sq ft suites with private kitchens. The first of these developments, in the Marpole neighbourhood, were set aside for residents with disabilities or those older than 45. “We’ve had some great stories about people’s lives being changed for the better,” says Abi Bond, the city’s director of affordable housing projects. Ted’s death was a shock, she says. “He is exactly the kind of person we’re trying to house” – a non-violent senior. Indeed, more seniors live in poverty (8.8%) in British Columbia than anywhere in Canada]; the rate has doubled since 2000. According to Stanley Woodvine, the blogger who broke the news of Ted’s death, the physical limitations of being senior (not to mention having cancer, as Ted did) compound the challenges of homelessness. Woodvine, 56, was a graphic designer and illustrator but had been living on the street for 14 years when he wrote a short post about Ted’s death on his blog; the story was subsequently republished by a local free weekly before getting picked up by global media. He writes his blog on a laptop in a McDonald’s near the Tim Hortons where Ted died, as a portal for non-homeless readers to understand life on the streets. Another recent post, inspired by Ted, offered etiquette for checking in on homeless people who appear to be sleeping.
“I don’t think he was never not scared,” he says, explaining that even if Ted had been offered a bed in a shelter, as a senior he would have found himself vulnerable living among younger, sometimes violent drug users. Woodvine wants to see a facility dedicated to homeless seniors, just as there are for women and children. The housing crisis is even more fraught for seniors who have accessibility or language issues, including immigrants. Yulanda Lui works at the Yarrow Society, a group that connects youth to about 200 elderly Chinese a year. “Gentrification and housing are big topics,” she says. Upscale boutiques and coffee shops are pushing out greengrocers and other long-standing businesses in Chinatown. “Seniors have felt like their food sources have been disappearing nearby. They’re struggling to find affordable services.”
The stigma of homelessness is another problem for seniors, says Woodvine. Though he never knew Ted, he recognized him in their neighbourhood, Fairview Slopes, and suspects that he knows why he chose to live in the Tim Hortons rather than move from shelter to shelter. “His whole thing was he didn’t want people to know he was homeless,” he says. “There’s a mentality that you skulk, you hide.” ‘The city of the lottery’ After slashing spending on social housing in the 1990s, the federal government has begun to act. Last November, it announced a $40bn, 10-year national strategy that treats housing as a human right. Vancouver has also launched a three-year action plan that includes offering housing for renters who are priced-out renters; the goal is to pay for it by doing deals with developers in exchange for “density bonuses” (taller condo towers). “It’s not just homeless people who need housing,” Bond says. “There are many people struggling to find a way to stay and make a life here.”
Sometimes, that means not waiting for government help. Last November, a series of community-led protests successfully blocked a proposed nine-storey condo tower in Chinatown. “This community was built in an act of resistance,” observes Lenée Son, the coordinator of the Carnegie Community Action Project, noting the concentrations of Chinese, Japanese and black populations who settled in the area to survive systemic racism.
Without such resistance and intervention, however, the housing crisis could radically remake the face of the city – and our notions of home. Andy Yan, adjunct professor at Simon Fraser University, fears a return to the shanty towns formed in the city during the Great Depression. For Yan, Vancouver has become “the city of the lottery” – viable only to those who are born into money, bought their home early enough, or have government-subsidized housing. “The ovarian lottery, the real estate lottery, or the social housing lottery,” as he puts it. “That’s not the Vancouver I knew.” There is another danger, namely that lives – and deaths – like Ted’s become commonplace and cease to shock. Yan believes bold measures are needed. He quotes Maya Angelou: “‘Without courage we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency.’ Well, we’re going to need a hell of a lot of courage.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/vancouver-tim-hortons-homeless-man-dies-housing-crisis,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/vancouver-tim-hortons-homeless-man-dies-housing-crisis
2018-06-26T08:53:27Z,world,World news,'This name will bind us': town enjoys link to Jacinda Ardern's baby,"Jacinda Ardern has put a tiny farming community in rural New Zealand on the map by naming her baby after the town. The community of Te Aroha welcomed the prime minister’s choice with open arms, declaring they would “paint the town pink” in her honour and praising her work to improve relations with Māori people.
On Sunday, Ardern and her partner, Clarke Gayford, emerged from Auckland hospital to announce their baby girl would be called Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford. The second name is taken from the mountain and town, which means “love” in the Te Reo Māori language. Across the country, New Zealanders described the choice as “romantic”, “beautiful” and “culturally significant” but it carried a more particular meaning for the town that is home to just over 3,900 people and lies 13 miles (21km) from Ardern’s birthplace of Morrinsville in the dairy-rich Waikato district. Te Ao Marama Maaka, a spokeswoman for Ngati-Haua, of the Tainui federation of tribes in the Te Aroha area, said she had been very close to Ardern since meeting her at Morrinsville high school, and that the prime minister’s empathy with and interest in the indigenous people of New Zealand was improving relations between Pakeha [European] and Māori faster than at any other point in history. Maaka said: “Te Aroha means a lot of love, because this baby has the love of the people throughout the country. I was really, really happy. When Jacinda visited our tribe, that was our moment with her. But this name will now bind us forever.
“They are a Pakeha couple but Jacinda has visited my marae [meeting grounds]. We have welcomed her here as the prime minister and she has always acknowledged my people. In her young years she has done a lot of homework on the history of Māori.” The depth of goodwill has led to locals inviting Ardern to take part in the traditional Māori practice of burying the afterbirth in the earth of Te Aroha, a ceremony that signifies the new child’s ancestral roots and connection to the land.
Maaka said: “We always take it back to our ancestral home. So I am hoping that she will bring the afterbirth back to Te Aroha because that’s where the name of the baby has come from.” Ardern has not yet responded to the offer. Ardern has previously said she and Gayford settled on their child’s name quite early. “Te Aroha was our way of reflecting the amount of love that this baby has been shown before she even arrived,” she said. “I thought, how do we reflect all of the generosity, particularly of all the Iwi [Māori tribes] who gifted us names? And Te Aroha seemed to be a way to show that love and generosity.
“It is also the place where all my family is from, and I grew up under that mountain.” Jan Barnes, the mayor of Matamata-Piako district council said the rural town was “ecstatic” about the prime minister’s choice, and hoped to see Ardern walking the streets with Neve in a pram soon. The council is holding a meeting on Wednesday to discuss how to celebrate the baby’s name, with draft plans including repainting much of the town pink, (including freshening up the already pink Coulter Bridge), commissioning a statue of Te Aroha mountain – known as “the mountain of love” – engraved with her full name and birthday, and tying a gigantic pink bow around Te Aroha’s clock tower. “The community looks out for each other here – it does take a village to raise a child, and we are so proud little Neve has Te Aroha in her name and to look after her,” said Barnes. “Iwi [Māori tribes] feel particularly honoured] by the prime minister’s choice.” • This article was amended on 29 June 2018 to correct the translation of the word “marae” from meeting house to meeting grounds.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/this-name-will-bind-us-town-enjoys-link-to-jacinda-ardern-baby-te-aroha,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/this-name-will-bind-us-town-enjoys-link-to-jacinda-ardern-baby-te-aroha
2018-06-26T08:00:27Z,world,World news,Why are so many of San Francisco's black mothers and babies dying?,"Jasmine Ball was barely five months pregnant with twins when the labor pains jolted through her lower body. Rushed to the hospital, the doctors told her that her cervix had dilated completely. There was nothing they could do to stop the babies from coming. “I didn’t know what was going on,” said Ball, a San Francisco native. “I was in shock.” Weighing 1lb each, Da’Mya was born first and survived for one hour. Ja’Mya was a stillborn. “Da’Mya was just waiting for her little sister to come out before she died,” said Ball, who was 20 at the time. Her nightmare didn’t stop there. As she held her daughters’ bodies in her arms, a white man entered the delivery room. He could have been a pediatrician or a grief counselor – Ball isn’t sure because he never introduced himself.
“He said to me ‘But you’re really young, you can have more kids,’” said Ball. “Like I had just lost an object that can be easily replaced. Who says that to someone?” Stunned, Ball tried to forget his flip comment. She baptized her girls and buried them. She couldn’t find burial clothes that properly fit so she draped the smallest of white dresses on their tiny bodies after they were laid in their caskets. “I told myself that I was going to be fine – it wasn’t going to be a big deal, that I would be able to deal with it,” she said. “But that wasn’t the case,” said Ball, who is now 33. Instead she self-medicated herself by smoking marijuana and barricaded herself in her mother’s home in San Francisco. “It took me 10 years to not be depressed about it.” Among the city’s African American residents, already grappling with a declining population, high unemployment and housing costs, there is another unrelenting crisis: black babies and mothers are dying at a disproportionate rate. Nationally, African American babies are more than twice as likely to die as whites. And their mothers are three to four times as likely to die from childbirth complications as white women, according to 2016 data from the US Centers for Disease Control.
But in San Francisco, one of the wealthiest cities in the nation that boasts some of the most innovative approaches in healthcare, the rates of bad birth outcomes stand out even from the national figures. Between 2012 and 2014, the San Francisco department of public health noted that black infants here died at a rate of 9.6 per 1,000 births, a stark difference from the caucasian rate of 2.1 deaths. Although blacks make up only 5% of all births in the city, 23% of all infant deaths were African American infants, according to the most recent city data. In addition, of the 10 documented maternal deaths in recent years, five were black mothers. Yet African Americans make up about only 6% of the city’s population. “When you first hear the numbers, you become shocked and incredibly disheartened,” said Dr Andrea Jackson, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco, who will start a new group prenatal care program solely for black women in the fall. “Why isn’t this sounding a bigger alarm?” ‘Toxic stress impacts birth’ For years, researchers have asked that very same question. Health experts cannot fully explain why African American women and babies are dying more than any other group. Having pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure can cause some of these bad birth outcomes. But research shows that even healthy, and highly educated, black women have shared the same fate. Serena Williams highlighted the issue this year, when she revealed that she almost died after giving birth to her daughter. The tennis great wrote in a CNN opinion piece and described in an interview to Vogue about how she had to advocate for herself when hospital staff were slow to respond to her concerns that she was experiencing a pulmonary embolism – blood clots in her lungs. A nurse thought her pain medication was making her confused, but Williams, who has a history of blood clots, repeatedly insisted on a CT scan, which confirmed several blood clots forming in her chest. “Doctors aren’t listening to us, quite frankly,” Williams, who lives part of the time in San Francisco, told the BBC, adding: “I think there’s a lot of prejudging, absolutely, that definitely goes on. And it needs to be spoken about, it needs to be addressed.” Experts now agree that racial discrimination is the main culprit for these bad birth outcomes. In addition to prejudices – unconscious and not – in the delivery rooms, long-term stress brought on by America’s ugly racial history, they say, is killing babies and mothers. In other words, the legacy of segregated neighborhoods, inadequate schools, mass incarceration, police brutality, to name a few, are weathering the bodies of black women.
“Lifelong experiences of racial discrimination and the policies that created inequitable neighborhoods and socioeconomic conditions are causing the toxic stress that impacts birth and infant health,” said Dr Curtis Chan, who is the medical director of maternal, child and adolescent health at the city’s health department. Constant stress on the body weakens the immune system, causing what doctors describe as an allostatic load that makes the body ripe for a number of health problems – from high blood pressure to heart disease. In San Francisco, the scars left behind by racism are remarkable. In the 1964 documentary, Take This Hammer, the renowned author and activist James Baldwin says: “There is no distance between the facts of life in San Francisco and the facts of life in Birmingham [Alabama].” The only difference, he adds, is that segregation never was acknowledged here, just swept under the rug. Once a hub for African American culture in the west, San Francisco’s black community has since been gutted of its people. In 1970, there were more than 96,000 black residents. By 2016, the population had shrunk to 43,000 with most living in public housing. Now, because of segregation, the majority of blacks reside in two pockets in the city, one of which houses a former naval shipyard cum toxic waste site. The black student achievement gap remains the largest in the state. And as booming tech companies like Facebook, Twitter and Salesforce employ thousands in the city, the median income for black residents is $27,000, while whites make $89,000. The disparity is double the national average.
“San Francisco is like ‘Nicety’ – nice outwardly but inwardly nasty,” explained Joi Jackson-Morgan, the executive director of the 3rd Street Youth Center and Clinic in Bayview-Hunters Point, the city’s predominantly black neighborhood. “We’re over-policed, we don’t have access to proper nutrition, we’re stressed out because of displacement, and a lack of opportunities.” Linda Jones, an Oakland-based doula and co-founder of Black Women Birthing Justice, sees where this leads in the delivery room. In December, Jones’s group published Battling Over Birth: Black Women and the Maternal Health Care Crisis, a book based on 100 interviews with black women on their childbirth experiences. Many of the women’s stories, Jones said, were traumatic and dehumanizing. Women described being ignored or disrespected by hospital staff. One mother, named Zanthia, said she was hit by a nurse after she refused to stop pushing while nurses fetched a doctor. “It doesn’t matter what your strata in life is, as long as you’re black you’re treated the same way,” she said. Jones said there had been little urgency to the issue of black maternal and infant mortality in the city – unlike the battle against the Aids epidemic in the 1980s when affluent white men were dying. “The Black Lives Matter campaign came about because young black men are getting killed by the police,” Jones said. “But we feel the same thing is happening to black women and their children during childbirth.” Tackling unconscious bias In recent years, officials in the city have been rolling out a number of initiatives to tackle the problem. Dr Malini Nijagal, an OB-GYN at Zuckerberg San Francisco general hospital, who is spearheading an effort to redesign prenatal care for publicly-insured women in San Francisco, said that in the last year she and her counterparts have been forced to reckon with their own unexamined biases. “The classic that we often face is on the labor and delivery unit, this question about whether we should do drug testing [on a patient] or not,” she said. “It is very likely that in the past, I have kind of used my own biases to decide who I think may need drug testing.” At UCSF, researchers are studying how stress can increase pregnancy risks, including the development of a new blood test that can detect who is at risk for pre-term birth, the main cause of infant death, and adjust a woman’s prenatal care for early clinical intervention. Also, a collective of agencies and community members are pushing to provide black women access to doula care and stable housing, both of which come at a premium cost. “We have all bought into this mythology around our progressive values so completely that it’s surprising to us that these bad birth outcomes could happen under our watch,” said Dr Zea Malawa, a city health department pediatrician, who is spearheading the new San Francisco pre-term birth collective impact initiative.
The city’s push to combat these bad birth outcomes could not come soon enough, say participants at the Black Infant Health center, a city-funded support group for pregnant black women. Every week, about a dozen moms meet in a room filled with photos of black mothers and their babies to commiserate about navigating life in San Francisco. During the 10-week sessions, they are offered a vegetable and fruit-heavy meal and are led in breathing meditations to visualize a better life for themselves and for their unborn babies. They learn about what to expect at the hospital and how to advocate for themselves.
“Personal power really begins with care of the self,” reads a bell hooks quote hanging on the wall. “We show them that we appreciate them because they may not get that anywhere else they go,” said Felicha Bell, a public health nurse who recruits and counsels the mothers. During a recent spring session, there were women like Aukemi Hare, 20, a part-time administrative assistant to a hand surgeon, and Jasmine Ball, who works as a soul food caterer. Hare, who is expecting a boy on 17 July, has been on her own since the age of 16 and has lived in a myriad of foster homes and shelters. She was abandoned by her abusive mother and has worked a patchwork of jobs since finishing high school. “Basically, I should be graduating from college this year,” Hare said. “But I need money. I need to work now.” Currently living in transitional housing in the Mission neighborhood, she has been applying for subsidized apartments throughout the city. With an annual salary of $15,000, she also is scrambling to secure childcare. She will need to return to work six weeks after her son, Percy, is born. After the loss of her twins more than a decade ago, Ball gave birth to a baby girl, Laila, on 20 May. Ball was raised by her mother, while her father, who suffered from a drug addiction, was in prison for most of her youth. She and her four siblings shared their two-bedroom house with three cousins because her mother’s sister also had a drug addiction. “San Francisco was built on the backs of people who didn’t have much,” Ball said. “But now they don’t want those type of people here any more.” Jackson, the UCSF OB-GYN, who is black, knows these stories all too well. When she gave birth to her first child in February, she was so worried about encountering unconscious biases from nurses and doctors that she allowed only her trusted colleagues to deliver her baby girl, Laura. After the pregnancy, she developed pre-eclampsia, a potentially dangerous complication of elevated high blood pressure and was treated promptly by her colleagues. “I felt that I was going to be safe at UCSF because I work there,” said Jackson, 38. “I knew that at the very least I would not be ignored, like Serena Williams.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/black-maternal-mortality-babies-san-francisco-crisis,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/black-maternal-mortality-babies-san-francisco-crisis
2018-06-26T07:28:56Z,world,World news,Man held over deaths of retired British couple in Jamaica,"A man has been taken into custody as part of an investigation into the deaths of a retired British couple in Jamaica. Charlie and Gayle Anderson, 74 and 71 respectively, were found dead in their home in Portland, on the north-east coast of the island, on Saturday. In a statement released on Twitter, the Jamaica constabulary force said: “One man has been taken into custody as the detectives from the Criminal Investigation Branch Headquarters (CIB HQ) and the Maj Invest Division intensify the investigation into the death of the retired couple.“The man, who is considered a person of interest in the matter, was picked up on Saturday afternoon at a business establishment in Kingston.” The couple, who were also known as Halford and Florence and had been married for 55 years, were found by neighbours in their home in a rural community in Hope Bay. They had moved from Manchester a year ago to live in Jamaica, where Charlie Anderson, a builder, was born. The couple sold their house and used savings to fund their retirement, friends said. A statement from their sons released by the Foreign Office said: “Our parents … were hardworking people, building a business with integrity and making sure we were always provided for. “Charlie and Gayle were pillars of the community in Manchester and Jamaica, and were hugely popular and loved by many.” A Manchester former neighbour, Kishore Singh, 51, said “they were two of the most beautiful people in the world.

2018-06-26T07:00:27Z,world,World news,'More dead than alive': Rio's closure of legendary club reflects cultural crisis,"It was Rio’s equivalent of the Blue Note or Ronnie Scott’s, a legendary downtown samba club famed for its caipirinha-fuelled jam sessions and for spawning some of the best young musicians in town. Today, though, Bar Semente lies abandoned, a graffiti-covered symbol of the city’s post-mega-event slump. An epitaph has been sprayed on its facade: “The Olympics, for who?” “It was the most difficult decision – … so difficult and so lonely,” Aline Brufato, Semente’s owner for most of its 20-year existence, said of her decision to close late last year: “But it couldn’t go on.” The Rio-based producer blamed a cocktail of economic, political and social factors for the demise of a club whose patrons had included Sting, Dave Matthews and Norah Jones, as well as giants of Brazilian music, such as Chico Buarque, Ney Matogrosso, João Bosco and Yamandu Costa.
Part of the problem was government neglect, which had condemned Lapa, the crumbling bohemian district where Semente was located, to spiralling levels of violence and homelessness. “Lapa could be like Montmartre, or Le Marais, or New York’s [Greenwich] Village or Alfama in Portugal. But [for authorities] Lapa isn’t interesting, Lapa’s a problem,” Brufato said during an interview in the office of her hilltop home overlooking its iconic 19th century viaduct. Brazil’s recession, which hit Rio state particularly hard, also helped seal Semente’s fate. “Some people want to just blame violence but it wasn’t just the violence. It was the economic crisis,” said Zé Paulo Becker, a celebrated Brazilian guitarist who had hosted a Monday night instrumental jam session since 2004.
“People didn’t have the money to go out … Here in Rio state we have lots of civil servants, and they weren’t paying the civil servants. So how is someone going to go out to consume culture? “It’s sad. The other day I was passing through Lapa … and I couldn’t believe it … It was empty: five years ago it would never have been like that.” In a recent interview with the Rio paper O Globo, the owner of another storied local bar, Nova Capela, admitted he was struggling to stay afloat. “Lapa,” he lamented, “is more dead than alive.”
Semente’s closure is part of a wider crisis affecting Rio’s music community – not to mention the city itself, shaken by the still unsolved murder of the councillor Marielle Franco and a controversial military intervention purportedly aimed at combating heavily armed violence.
The scale of Rio’s security shambles was highlighted earlier this month when a fierce and highly unusual gunfight broke out beside Sugarloaf mountain and six bullet-riddled corpses washed up on a nearby beach. Last week a 14-year-old schoolboy was killed when a police helicopter opened fire on a densely-populated favela. A generation of young virtuoso musicians cut their teeth on Semente’s minuscule stage, going on to record albums and – in the case of one singer, Teresa Cristina – pack concert halls around the country. Many of those players, however, are now packing their bags and looking for opportunities overseas.
“You’ve had a real disbanding of people,” said Brufato, 41, reeling off the names of nearly a dozen musicians and singers who have fled to cities including Lisbon, New York and Montreal in recent months. Becker, 49, said he had lost two members of his group. “The country is going through a moment of crisis. When you freeze 20 years of investment in education and culture, there’s a price to be paid … I don’t want to give a pessimistic account of things. But we are seeing the reality.” For those who have stayed, Semente’s closure has left a void.
“Semente was somewhere you could compose, where you could take risks, where you could improvise,” Becker recalled. “It was like a second home … and as time goes by the penny starts to drop and we start to realise how much we miss this space.” “Lots of artists were kind of orphaned,” said Alessandro Brandão, one half of a drag queen samba duo called Sara and Nina who got their first break at the club. “Semente built an audience for a certain type of music and suddenly it was gone. It was really dispiriting.” Gabriel Sanches, the duo’s other half, said Semente’s closure had been a wake-up call to the wider challenges facing Brazilian society and the need to fight back against the country’s swing to the right. “It made me think: ‘Caramba! Things really are bad!’ This crisis, the difficulties – and in a broader sense – the censorship, the repression, the growing conservatism.” Brufato insisted Rio’s musicians would bounce back; some displaced performers have found a new home on the stage of a local branch of the Blue Note, which opened in the chic Lagoa neighbourhood last year and will next month start hosting its own Semente-themed nights. “The Semente generation is out there, alive and kicking,” she said.
“Brazil is such a musical country,” agreed Becker. “I have the feeling that at any moment [Semente] could come back. I believe this,” he added with a laugh. “We have to believe.” On a recent evening, the lights were out over Semente’s once buzzing stage but painted on a decaying wall across the street, next to a homeless encampment, was a quote from the late Brazilian poet Ferreira Gullar, echoing like a message of resistance: “Art exists because life is not enough.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/more-dead-than-alive-rios-closure-of-legendary-club-reflects-cultural-crisis,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/more-dead-than-alive-rios-closure-of-legendary-club-reflects-cultural-crisis
2018-06-26T06:08:38Z,world,World news,Indian foreign minister the latest victim of social media attacks on women,"India’s top diplomat has become the latest high-profile woman to be targeted by trolls on social media, an endemic problem for Indian women that has attracted United Nations scrutiny. External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj has been highlighting a selection of the abuse she has received in recent days after her office intervened in a passport case that has angered Hindu nationalists. Swaraj, who has 11.8m followers on Twitter, has been pioneering in her use of the platform to respond to complaints and distress calls by Indians overseas.
Last week her ministry said it would take “appropriate action” against an official in a passport office in Uttar Pradesh state who was accused of verbally abusing a Hindu woman married to a Muslim man and refusing to issue the couple passports. The official, Vikas Mishra, denied the incident, saying he had only asked the woman to make sure her legal name reflected the one on her marriage certificate. The ministry promised to investigate the allegations and issued the couple their passports, triggering a wave of abuse against Swaraj for allegedly appeasing India’s Muslim minority. Swaraj highlighted tweets calling her a traitor, demanding her resignation and one speculating she had received a kidney transplant from a Muslim after suffering renal failure in 2016 and now had one “Islamic kidney”. The online abuse faced by prominent Indian women is driving some off social media and many to censor themselves. Journalist Rana Ayyub recently had her face superimposed on pornography clips and received phone calls and messages threatening rape and murder after fake quotes attributed to her stirred up anger on social media.
The abuse prompted calls from press freedom groups and the office of the United Nations commissioner for human rights for the Indian government to urgently protect the journalist. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist and the second most-followed political leader on Twitter after US president Donald Trump, is frequently accused of not doing enough to tame the online conduct of his most abusive supporters. Among the few accounts Modi follows on Twitter are those that have been accused of trolling opponents and stoking religious hatred. In July 2015 Modi drew criticism for inviting 150 social media supporters to his residence for an event, among them Twitter users who had used sexual slurs and levelled other online abuse at women.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/indian-foreign-minister-sushma-swaraj-trolls-social-media,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/indian-foreign-minister-sushma-swaraj-trolls-social-media
2018-06-26T06:00:26Z,world,World news,'I've been sick in the chest': Tobacco fields take toll on Indonesian children,"As a young girl, Julaeping Putri loved to play, even take naps, among the fresh mounds of tobacco leaves piled around her home on the Indonesian island of Lombok. Her mother, Nurul Huda, thought nothing of it at the time. She liked having the stacks of leaves there too – a reminder it had been a plentiful, lucrative harvest.
From as young as three, Julaeping, or Eping for short, said she would help her parents out in the field, planting the small Virginia tobacco saplings, mixing the fertiliser, watering the plants. In harvest season, Eping and her friends would spend hours after school tying the tobacco leaves on to large poles, getting them ready for the “ovens”, village smokehouses where the leaves are smoked dry for almost a week. Sometimes they would play a game, racing each other to see who could do it the fastest. But it wasn’t always fun. A few times during the harvest Eping felt so ill she collapsed. Her mother, too busy with the yield to take her to hospital, called in the local nurse to give her an injection.
In the decade since, her health problems have never really gone away. “Since second grade, I have been sick in the chest, and then sometimes it is hard to breathe,” says Eping, now 14. It’s always worse in tobacco harvest season, she says, especially when they unfurl the leaves from the ovens, when the smell of tobacco is most pungent.
“I have felt like throwing up before because the tobacco smell is so strong. It happens often, that you want to keep throwing up,” she says, “After opening up the leaves, I feel sick in the chest and my heart starts to beat very fast.” According to a 2016 report by Human Right Watch entitled The Harvest Is in My Blood, thousands of children work in Indonesia’s tobacco industry, where they are exposed to serious health risks. Based on interviews with more than 130 children, the report notes that symptoms described, such as vomiting and nausea, are consistent with acute nicotine poisoning, caused by contact with tobacco plants and leaves.
Last year Eping’s parents took her to the doctor to find out if her repeated complaint, a tightness in her chest and shortness of breath, was connected to her exposure to tobacco. Her elder brother Jovi, 28, laughs scathingly when asked about the diagnosis. “The doctors here aren’t brave enough to be honest. They don’t say it is related to tobacco but we know,” he says, as he draws on a cigarette himself. “Maybe brave is not the right word. Maybe they are afraid there might be a demonstration.” Tobacco has long been big business in Indonesia. According to research by Euromonitor International, Indonesia produced 269.2bn cigarettes in 2015, while the market was valued at 231.3tn rupiah (£12.4bn, $16.6bn at current exchange rates).
Across the country tobacco advertising and smoking is widespread – for Indonesian men, lighting up is considered the uncontroversial norm. Rules are so lax and cigarettes so cheap – one packet is less than £2 – that many start from an early age. Indonesia is the world’s fifth-largest tobacco producer, with the world’s second-largest tobacco market after China and more than 65 million smokers as of 2013. With such a large presence, the industry is a powerful lobby in Indonesia and campaigners say it is quick to push back against pressure. In Beleke, residents talk of the financial benefits of tobacco to the village. Next to rice and corn, tobacco is the most lucrative crop but it can only be grown in the dry season, from about May to September.
Home to about 3,000 families, the village is spread across fields of brilliant green rice paddies that become replaced entirely with tobacco plants in the growing season. About 80% of Beleke residents are farmers, and during tobacco season the village is a hub of activity. There are about 20 “ovens” in the village and during the harvest they smoke continually, day and night. “No one stays home in harvesting season. You find people young and old around the ovens and in the fields. Everyone is collecting money and everyone is happy about that,” says Anggi, 42, a farmer. Almost all the children above the age of four work – some begrudgingly because their parents ask them to, others because they want to earn money. “My daughter helps me in the field, putting the fertiliser on the trees and also carrying the water,” said Anggi. “That is the picture of all the mothers and farmers who have children in the village.” For almost two months during the harvest, carts of tobacco leaves are hauled into the village and the children are called in to help prepare them for the smokehouses, knitting them on to large sticks and getting paid by the stick. Some of the children the Guardian meets talk about what they can get with the money from tobacco work, but they also describe long hours. “I like doing it because I get money,” says Aning, age 12, who first started working six years ago. “I can buy snacks at school, or toys, like a doll. I start after school, from midday until about 5pm. I can earn about Rp 15,000 (£0.81, $1.08) and I do that every day in the season.”
Aning’s best friend is only six years old, but last year he worked so hard during the tobacco season that he saved 1m rupiah (£52, $70). “If I keep working in the night, I can get Rp 50,000 (£2.69, $3.60). After praying time at 7.30pm, I work until about midnight,” he says. “School starts at 8 in the morning. So we are often late in the season.” While Indonesian labour laws prohibit anyone under the age of 18 from performing hazardous work, in practice, especially in small-scale farming in Indonesia’s under-developed eastern regions, the laws are often poorly enforced and understood. After it is roasted, the tobacco grown by Beleke’s small-scale farmers is sold to middlemen, who transport it by the ton to one of several warehouses on the island. Mostly it is sold to a warehouse controlled by the Indonesian tobacco company Djarum. One middleman, speaking anonymously, tells the Guardian the company is unaware children are involved in production, but admits that no one asks questions about the issue. Djarum declined to respond to questions about child labour. The five big transnational tobacco companies say child labour was unacceptable and that they were working hard to stop it happening in their supply chain. They said they were encouraging farmers to grow other crops, but added that tobacco gave farms a better income. No one interviewed in Beleke sees it as problematic that children work in the tobacco industry. One teenage boy, Restu, 13, illustrates just how lax attitudes around tobacco in the village are. “All my teachers smoke,” he replies, when asked what he learns about smoking at school. “Even my headmaster smokes around us at school.” With her repeated ill health but no definitive diagnosis, Eping’s parents aren’t entirely sure what to think. They say they have asked her to stop working during harvest. “Sometimes I ask her to stop working, but she is so fast at it and I’m happy with that,” says her mother, Nurul Huda. “And sometimes she just disappears,” she adds, with a shrug. “Every time she comes back carrying money.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/tobacco-indonesia-child-labour-harvest,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/tobacco-indonesia-child-labour-harvest
2018-06-26T05:26:15Z,world,World news,"Tuesday briefing: Democracy under threat, says election watchdog","Top story: System must be ‘fit for purpose in digital age’ Good morning briefers. I’m Martin Farrer and this is what you need to know this fine summer morning. Britain’s election laws need to be reformed urgently after a series of online political campaign scandals threatened to damage democracy, the Electoral Commission has warned. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the electoral watchdog says parliament and the devolved governments must make changes to combat misinformation, misuse of personal data and overseas interference in elections. John Holmes, chair of the commission, says action is needed “to ensure that the tools used to regulate political campaigning online continue to be fit for purpose in a digital age”. His recommendations include a requirement that all digital political campaign material states who paid for it, a law to clarify the ban on overseas campaign funding and bigger fines for anyone who breaks the rules. Sir John’s comments come after the Observer and Guardian reporter who exposed the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Carole Cadwalladr, won the Orwell journalism prize for her investigation. Receiving the award in London, she said there was “a systemic failure ... Our laws do not work and our regulators are unable to regulate”. * * * ‘Where’s Boris?’ – Boris Johnson has come under attack from fellow Tories after he missed the Commons vote that saw MPs overwhelmingly support plans to build a third runway at Heathrow airport. The foreign secretary is a longstanding opponent of the plans, leveraging his opposition to help his London mayoral campaigns and to win the safe west London seat of Uxbridge. But he managed to be in Afghanistan when the vote came last night, drawing derision from many. There were even suggestions that his failure to stand up and be counted on the touchstone issue could end his ambitions to become party leader. Our columnist Rafael Behr says it is final proof that Johnson totally lacks principle. * * * Get shorty – Rafael’s column might equally apply to Johnson’s fellow Brexiter, Nigel Farage, who has been forced to deny reports that he bet against the pound on the night of the referendum. According to Bloomberg, Farage was privy to private polling data that showed that the Leave campaign had won but said on Sky News that he believed the Remain camp had edged it. The “concession” by Farage, himself a City trader, was big news and pushed the pound to the $1.50 mark. When the true outcome emerged, sterling plummeted in value. Traders who bet correctly on the fall are thought to have made millions. Last night a spokesman for Farage said he “had no financial interest in currency movements” on the night. * * * Off road – BMW fears it will be forced to close its factories in the UK, putting 8,000 jobs at risk, if components for Mini and Rolls-Royce cars are snagged up in customs delays after Brexit. The German manufacturer says its logistics would not be able to cope with obstructions to its supply chain. At the same time, the UK car lobby group SMMT says today that investment in the industry is declining because of lack of clarity over the Brexit negotiations. * * * Health failure – The NHS may lead the world in equal access, but a new study has found that it underperforms compared with the health systems of other developed countries in preventing common causes of death. The report, which will fuel further debate about the current state of the NHS, also found that the UK has fewer doctors, nurses, hospital beds and CT and MRI scanners than 18 other comparable countries. * * *
Director’s cut – In a moment of surrealism worthy of one of his films, David Lynch’s recent interview with the Guardian has become the unlikely centrepiece of a Donald Trump rally. The president seized on comments by the Sanders-supporting director that he could be a great president because he had shaken up the establishment. Trump joked that the favourable remarks meant the maverick’s career in Hollywood would be over. World Cup Gareth Southgate is facing a dilemma over Harry Kane and has hinted he may rest his captain to give others playing tine in England’s final Group G game against Belgium. Southgate’s opposite number, Roberto Martínez, meanwhile, has refused to rule out making as many as 10 changes in Kaliningrad. An angry Carlos Queiroz lashed out at Fifa and the VAR system after his Iran team’s 1-1 draw with Portugal and elimination from the World Cup while Spain progressed as Group B winners thanks to a last-gasp Iago Aspas goal that salvaged a 2-2 draw with Morocco. In Group A, Uruguay sailed past Russia with an efficient, unfussy display, while Saudi Arabia snatched a 2-1 win over Egypt, after which their coach Héctor Cúper dismissed suggestions Mohamed Salah is set to quit international football. Switzerland’s Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri have escaped a ban following their controversial celebrations in the 2-1 World Cup win over Serbia last Friday. It’s the turn of Groups C and D today with Australia and Argentina needing wins against Peru and Nigeria respectively. Follow the buildup with our live blog now.

The life of a barrister can appear glamorous and romantic, with clever people using clever words to fight points of law in ancient, august settings. But Sarah Langford, a criminal barrister, writes today about how the reality can be very different – endless train journeys to courts around the country, interminable waiting and the need to be not just the client’s brief but also their psychiatrist, counsellor, social worker and mother combined. Most of all there is a sense of futility at the way the system treats young offenders. Using the case of one client, Dominic, a serial-but-charming teenage offender turned serial-but-embittered adult offender, she describes the “pointless and predictable lurch between prison and court, court and prison” as he was failed by justice. Sport Trevor Bayliss has tipped his assistant, Paul Farbrace, to succeed him as the England head coach when he stands down at the end of the 2019 home summer. Set the primary target of winning next summer’s World Cup, Bayliss is not winding down though and has told his one-day batsmen to learn from Jos Buttler’s icy display of escapology at Old Trafford on Sunday. Not even a convincing two-set win over Stan Wawrinka was enough to persuade Andy Murray he is ready for Wimbledon next week – but it will be a major surprise if he is not there and raging to play. And Sir Michael Stoute, who last week became the all-time leading Royal Ascot trainer, may attempt to extend his latest sequence of big-race wins by running Eqtidaar in the July Cup. Business Donald Trump’s trade policy might be starting to backfire after Harley-Davidson said it would be moving production to other countries to avoid tariffs on US goods. The president accused the motorbike maker of “waving the white flag” but anxiety about his belligerent policy has spread to international stock markets with Asian shares down again overnight. The FTSE100 is set to open up 0.25%, however, while the pound is up at $1.329 and €1.135. The papers

2018-06-26T05:15:33Z,world,World news,Thailand's junta renews corruption crackdown on Buddhist monks,"Thailand’s Buddhist temples have long been tainted with allegations of greed, corruption, sex, murder and child abuse, while monks, sworn to lives of abstinence, have often been caught living compromisingly flashy lifestyles. But while there were previously seen as untouchable, over the past month the Thai military government have suddenly moved to crack down on corruption in the temples, arresting six of the country’s most high-profile monks. A seventh fled to Frankfurt to seek asylum, with the Thai authorities following him to Europe in hot pursuit.
It is the military junta’s boldest move towards cleaning up the Sangha, the name of the Thai Buddhist order, and among the six arrested are several elderly monks on the Sanghka supreme council, the country’s Buddhist governing body. Two senior abbots at Bangkok’s famous Golden Mount temple were also among those arrested but most surprising was the arrest of Phra Buddha Issara, a rightwing firebrand monk known both for his political activism and his alleged ties to the Thai prime minister Prayut Chan-ocha. Both serve in the Queen’s guard military unit, though Prayut now denies any connection to Issara. “The arrest of these monks is clearly designed to place the state in control over any monks who might stray from loyalty to the junta, especially as we are approaching elections,” said Paul Chambers, a lecturer at Naresuan university who specialises in Thai politics. “This is their way of demonstrating that the state is really above the Buddhist sangha.” While the military junta, who took over Thailand in a bloodless coup in 2014, have long pledged to stamp out corruption, the timing of the four temple raids has been seen as significant and politically motivated. Prayut’s government are under greater pressure than ever to follow through on their promise to call elections in February 2019, and cleaning up corruption in the temples is percieved as a canny move that would play well to the electorate when they run as a political party. Buddhism is one of the three pillars of Thailand, alongside the monarchy and the nation (90% of the country is Buddhist), and there is a widespread sense of disgust at the level of corruption and illegal activity that goes on in the temples orchestrated by the monks. Some of the temples generate millions in donations ever year, with donations actively encouraged as a way to bring worshippers good karma, and yet are subject to no external regulation on how the money is spent. The junta’s past attempts to exert their authority over the temples have not proved successful. In February last year the junta raided the popular Dhammakaya Temple, looking for its spiritual leader Phra Dhammachayo on allegations he had embezzled £28m of temple donations. The temple’s well-known allegiances to former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who is despised by the military and was toppled in a military coup in 2006, was also perceived as a motive of the raid. However, Dhammachayo eluded arrest and there was a backlash against the military government for being too heavy handed in the raid, which saw 4,000 officers descend on the temple for three weeks. “After the seige of the Dhammakaya temple, people really started to look askance at what the military was doing to the monks and question their motives, and it really did damage to Prayut’s reputation” said Chambers. “So these new arrests might be designed to give the military a more popular image and make people forget about the failed mission last year. And the monks they have arrested – with Buddha Issara as the exception – they already had a really corrupt reputation so are an easy target.” After the failure of the Dhammakaya Temple siege, the junta announced last March it was was drafting a law which would significantly weaken the Sangha council. It has not presented it to parliament yet but these new arrests could be laying the groundwork for the legislation. Perhaps the most surprising of all the recent arrests was Buddha Issara, who was formally stripped of his position as a monk and sent to Bangkok remand prison to await trial on charges of robbery, forgery, and illegal detention of officials during the protests in 2013 and 2014, prior to the coup.
Issara had in fact been a long advocate for reform in Buddhism and last August condemned the military junta for not acting on their promise to clean up the temples. “Are they still serious about tackling corruption or are they only moving against certain people and groups?” he said, adding that when it came to monks: “No one can touch them.” The arrest of Issara has been perceived as a sign that either the junta fear he is too much of a loose canon politically or is that the junta are attempting to prove themselves as ethical, and deserving of political longevity, to the new Thai monarch, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who inherited the throne last year. Thailand has recently seen a rare upsurge in protests and demonstrations, and the arrests have also been seen as the junta giving the monks a strong signal of what will happen if they don’t toe the line politically, especially the large number who still have loyalty to the pro-Thaksin red-shirt movement. Investigations are still ongoing and it is thought there will be more arrests going forward.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/thailands-junta-renews-corruption-crackdown-on-buddhist-monks,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/thailands-junta-renews-corruption-crackdown-on-buddhist-monks
2018-06-26T03:07:42Z,world,World news,'Toxic garbage will be sold here': Outcry as Brazil moves to loosen pesticide laws,"A Brazilian Congress commission has approved a controversial bill to lift restrictions on pesticides despite fierce opposition from environmentalists, prosecutors, health and environment ministry bodies, and even United Nations special rapporteurs. Driven by a powerful agribusiness lobby, the bill now needs to be voted on in both houses of Congress and sanctioned by President Michel Temer before becoming law. Its proponents say it will free up bureaucracy and modernise dated legislation. But the bill has generated fierce opposition in Brazil, one of the world’s biggest food producers and biggest consumers of pesticides, even those banned in other countries.
Opponents dubbed it the “poison package” and said it would lead to the indiscriminate use of dangerous pesticides, while 250,000 signed an online petition against it. “The law will make us more permissive than we already are,” said Larissa Bombardi, a professor of geography and pesticides specialist at the University of São Paulo. “The economic interest will prevail over human and environmental health.” Of 121 pesticides permitted in Brazil for coffee production, 30 are already banned in the European Union, including the toxic herbicide paraquat, Bombardi reported in an extensive 2017 study. The bill overhauls existing legislation, allowing for pesticides to be given temporary register if the approval process has taken over two years and three countries in the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) have already approved it. It puts the Ministry of Agriculture in charge of approving new products, removing the Health and Environment Ministries from decision-making and making their roles advisory and it stops towns and states from introducing their own restrictions on pesticides. “It is clear there is opposition, there is passion. There are people who think you do agriculture organically. People use pesticides like medicine,” said the Congress committee president Tereza Cristina Dias, a lawmaker who also presides over the parliamentary farming front. Dias said the controversial ‘temporary register’ of products was only in the case of a new threat to crops from pests and that product approval would become more organised. “The Ministry of Agriculture will do the coordinating, the governance and the transparency,” she said.
A long list of organisations and specialist bodies disagreed. The project will bring “serious losses to the protection of human health,” wrote Ronald dos Santos, president of the National Health Council, part of the Ministry of Health. Federal Prosecutors said much of it was unconstitutional and popular TV chef Bela Gil turned up to a commission session to protest, waving a “poison package” placard. In a letter to Brazil’s Foreign Minister Aloysio Nunes, United Nations Special Rapporteurs John H. Knox, Hilal Elver, Baskut Tuncak, Dainius Puras and Léo Heller described Brazil as “reportedly the largest consumer and importer of pesticides in the world”. The country already lets foreign companies exploit its lower standards of protection, they said, “exporting hazardous pesticides prohibited from use in their domestic markets to be used in Brazil.” Under Brazil’s current legislation, pesticides with elements considered teratogenic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, endocrine disruptive, or posing risks to the reproductive system can’t be registered, they said. But under the bill, hazardous pesticides will only be prohibited when there is a “scientifically established unacceptable risk” – a definition too vague to be effective. Greenpeace attacked lawmakers for approving the bill in the face of such wide opposition. “They want a toxic product to look less threatening,” said Marcio Astrini, Greenpeace Brazil’s public policy coordinator. “The toxic garbage being banned in the rest of the planet will be sold here.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/toxic-garbage-will-be-sold-here-outcry-as-brazil-moves-to-loosen-pesticide-laws,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/toxic-garbage-will-be-sold-here-outcry-as-brazil-moves-to-loosen-pesticide-laws
2018-06-26T02:52:29Z,world,World news,North Korea scraps 'anti-US imperialism' rally as ties appear to warm,"North Korea will cancel its annual “anti-US imperialism” rally, part of a growing detente with its longstanding enemy as the two countries negotiate over the fate of the North’s nuclear weapons program. The rally, which typically marks the start of a month of events commemorating the 1950-53 Korean war and denouncing the US, has been held for years and last year attracted 100,000 people in the capital, Pyongyang. North Korean officials did not give a reason for skipping the rally, according to the Associated Press, which first reported the cancellation.
The event usually features slogans and propaganda cartoons attacking the US, participants raising their fists in defiance and even commemorative postage stamps showing the destruction of the US. Last year one official said all members of the ruling Workers’ party and residents of Pyongyang were “aflame with the will to completely remove the US imperialists, the sworn enemy, from the globe”. In the past the rally has allowed North Korea to communicate its political message to the world, which has centred on grievances over US policy in the region. Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who focused on North Korea policy, said the cancellation was significant: “It tells us that North Korea has enough confidence in the staying power of engagement with the United States – for now – that they want to create a more positive atmosphere at home and send more constructive signals abroad. “Its ultimate goal remains to either make progress with the United States on its terms, or ensure Washington bears most of the blame if tensions rise again.” The decision comes after the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, met Donald Trump in Singapore this month in a historic summit. In the wake of their meeting the US pledged to suspend military drills with ally South Korea, exercises that have infuriated the North for years.
But while both work to achieve the vague language of Kim’s promise to “completely denuclearise the Korean peninsula”, America’s top US diplomat refused to put a timeline on negotiations with North Korea contradicting a senior defence official who said Washington would soon present a timeline to North Korea with “specific asks”. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said he wanted to see continued progress towards North Korean denuclearisation and that the administration would regularly assess Pyongyang’s seriousness about abandoning its nuclear program. “I am not going to put a timeline on it, whether that’s two months, six months, we are committed to moving forward in an expeditious moment to see if we can achieve what both leaders set out to do,” Pompeo told CNN, referring to the 12 June summit between Trump and Kim. Pompeo, who has been charged with leading negotiations aimed at persuading North Korea to give up a nuclear weapons program that threatens the US, said he would “constantly reassess” whether enough progress was being made to continue talks. “We hope that we will have an ongoing process of making progress,” CNN quoted him as saying. The day after the Singapore summit Pompeo said Washington hoped to achieve “major disarmament” by North Korea within Trump’s current term, which ends on 20 January 2021. Trump said last week the “No 1 statement” in the document he and Kim signed in Singapore was “we will immediately begin total denuclearisation of North Korea”, although there was no such statement in the text. In the joint statement, Kim “reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, but made no reference to a timeline, and going into the summit, Pyongyang repeatedly rejected unilateral nuclear disarmament. Referring to Trump’s decision to suspend joint military exercises with South Korea, Pompeo told CNN this move would last “only so long as there is a good faith negotiation progress, productive results being achieved”. Pompeo said a week ago he was likely to travel back to North Korea “before too terribly long” to try to flesh out commitments made at the summit. The state department has since said it has no travel plans to announce. CNN said Pompeo suggested it was too soon to expect a detailed roadmap after 40 years of tensions but insisted that Kim had been “unequivocal” about his willingness to denuclearise.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/north-korea-cancels-anti-us-imperialism-rally-pompeo-denuclearisation,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/north-korea-cancels-anti-us-imperialism-rally-pompeo-denuclearisation

Among the usual hawks, herons, and sparrows familiar to European readers are four sketches of a bird from further afield – an Australasian cockatoo. The images are believed to be the oldest European depiction of the bird, trumping a similar discovery in a 15th-century artwork, and have sparked a reassessment of trading routes that existed more than 700 years ago.
The drawings are likely to be of a sulphur-crested cockatoo, a yellow-crested cockatoo or a Triton cockatoo, from the northern tip of Australia, New Guinea, or the islands around New Guinea, and show how trade in the waters around Australia’s north was flourishing in medieval times. The sketches were discovered by Finnish researchers in the manuscript De Arte Venandi cum Avibus (The Art of Hunting with Birds), which was written in Latin by Frederick II, between 1241 and 1248, and is held in the Vatican library.
They are likely to be of a single bird, a cockatoo given to Frederick II, who was known for his large menagerie of animals, including lions, panthers and elephants. It was presented to him by al-Kamil, the sultan of Egypt, meaning the bird was probably traded first from Australasia to Egypt before it was brought to Europe. The images are believed to pre-date Andrea Mantegna’s 1496 altarpiece Madonna della Vittoria, which was previously believed to be the oldest European depiction. Dr Heather Dalton, a historian at the University of Melbourne, published research about the cockatoo in the Mantegna artwork in 2014 and, after news coverage of the discovery, was contacted by Finnish biologists who said they had seen images of a cockatoo in Frederick II’s manuscript, which pre-dates the altarpiece by 250 years.
“I was just thrilled to bits of course,” said Dalton, who collaborated with the Finnish researchers for an article published in Parergon Journal. “I just couldn’t believe that nobody had really talked about them, this is a high-profile document.” “The main significance about it is we tend to think of our region, not just Australia, but the islands around it, as the very last things to be discovered; the European view is it’s almost this dead continent and nothing was happening until Europeans discovered it. “The fact that a cockatoo either from the northern tip of Australia, or from New Guinea or the islands around it, was traded to Cairo and on to Sicily is significant. It’s a window in on what I think was quite a vibrant trading network.” By examining the manuscript, Dalton and her collaborators, were able to conclude the images are of a female cockatoo, because red paint was used for the eyes and females have red or reddish-brown eyes, whereas male cockatoos have black eyes. The researchers also noted that the crest of the cockatoo was not raised – something the birds do when aggressive, fearful, surprised or as part of a courtship display - and concluded this probably meant Frederick’s bird “felt safe and calm” while being sketched. Dalton said that since publication of her discovery of the cockatoo in the Mantegna work in 2014, colleagues had been sending her joke emails with various Australian animals Photoshopped onto famous artworks; a joke that might resurface in light of this new cockatoo discovery. “I’m looking for the wombat in the altarpiece now,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/images-of-cockatoo-on-13-century-vatican-manuscript-inspire-trade-route-rethink,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/images-of-cockatoo-on-13-century-vatican-manuscript-inspire-trade-route-rethink
2018-06-26T01:27:14Z,world,World news,Papua New Guinea suffers first polio outbreak in 18 years,"The first case of polio in Papua New Guinea in 18 years has been detected, with a six-year-old boy from the Morobe province the first confirmed case of the virus. The boy presented to health authorities on the 28 April with weakness in his lower limbs and the virus – a vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 – was confirmed on 21 May. Last week, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the virus was also present in the stool samples of two children in the boy’s community; prompting health authorities to declare an official outbreak.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the impoverished island nation polio-free in 2000, along with the rest of the western Pacific region. Only three other countries in the world continue to battle the virus; Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan. So far the three cases are isolated to the Morobe province, where polio vaccine coverage is low, and only 61% of children have received the recommended three doses. WHO has assessed the risk of polio spreading to other countries as low, because travel in and out of the region is relatively limited. In the weeks after the first case was confirmed, WHO deployed health workers for a “mop up” immunisation campaign, targeting children under the age of 15. To date, 845 children from the Lufa mountain settlement have been vaccinated. Water, sanitation and hygiene are serious challenges in the region, adding to the crisis of controlling the highly infectious virus which mainly affects young children. Pascoe Kase, secretary of the National Department of Health (NDOH), said: “We are deeply concerned about this polio case in Papua New Guinea, and the fact that the virus is circulating. “Our immediate priority is to respond and prevent more children from being infected.”
The Papua New Guinean government is now working closely with the WHO and other organisations to begin a large-scale immunisation campaign, as well as stepping up monitoring of vulnerable children. The virus spreads through faecal-oral contamination, multiplies in the intestines, from where it spreads to the nervous system, causing paralysis. Dr Luo Dapeng, WHO Representative in Papua New Guinea, said: “Since the detection of poliovirus in April, WHO has been working with the government on the investigation, laboratory confirmation, enhanced surveillance and response activities. We will continue to support the government to ensure children are protected.” Worldwide, cases of polio have decreased by over 99% in 30 years, largely the result of a co-ordinated global health campaign to eradicate it. There is no cure for polio once contracted; it can be prevented only by a series of vaccinations during childhood.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/papua-new-guinea-suffers-first-polio-outbreak-in-18-years,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/papua-new-guinea-suffers-first-polio-outbreak-in-18-years
2018-06-25T16:43:16Z,world,World news,MEPs vote to activate sanction process against Hungary,"British Conservatives are under fire in Brussels after voting against triggering an EU sanction process against Hungary over violations of the rule of law under the prime minister, Viktor Orbán. MEPs on the civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee voted to launch the EU’s disciplinary procedure against the country, a lengthy legal process that could lead to Hungary being stripped of EU voting rights. But the Tories stood accused of trampling over their own legacy, after their MEP on the committee voted against the process, a decision described as “an exit from European values” by a leading politician from a rival party. Hungary is very unlikely to lose its voting rights, but the unprecedented vote on Monday is a symbolic move against Orbán, who was re-elected for a third term in April, after a campaign that international observers said had clearly favoured the ruling coalition and was characterised by intimidating and xenophobic rhetoric.
“This is a damning indictment of the state of British European policy and completely destroys any credibility the Tories might have left,” said Sophie in ’t Veld of the Dutch Democrats 66 party, who is on the committee. “Even Conservative governments of the recent past were always promotors of democracy and the rule of law in central and eastern Europe, but in providing cover for Orbán’s descent into authoritarianism, they have trampled on this legacy.” “Voting with Orbán is the true Tory Brexit: the exit from European values,” she said, adding that it was a sad day. Conservative MEPs also voted against taking similar action against Poland, fuelling concerns about whether a Brexit-bound government would sideline democratic values to curry favour with autocratic governments. Conservative home affairs spokesman Daniel Dalton said: “The extremely one-sided report I voted against today was an inappropriate attempt by the European parliament to insert itself into domestic political battles. Recent attempts to raise domestic controversies to a European level are both wrong and counterproductive, alienating many citizens who feel their countries are being unfairly targeted by the European institutions.” The decision by MEPs throws down a gauntlet to Europe’s most powerful political alliance, the European People’s party (EPP), the group Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker are a part of, which has been accused of legitimatising Orbán by keeping his Fidesz party in its ranks. Josef Weidenholzer, an Austrian Social Democrat MEP, said the EU had to act. “Hungary is now in a situation – [where] we would call it it a facade democracy.” The vote is only a first step; a final decision to launch the procedure requires a two-thirds majority in the European parliament. If a majority of MEPs vote in September, ministers will be obliged to consider whether there is a serious and persistent breach of the EU’s basic democratic values in Hungary. The Dutch Green MEP Judith Sargentini had spent 13 months drafting a report to prepare for the unprecedented procedure. It is based on the work of many international organisations and raises 12 key concerns about the erosion of democracy in Hungary. The draft report highlights fears about the functioning of Hungary’s constitution, which has been amended six times since 2012. It also itemises concerns about the centralisation of justice, declining transparency over state funds and threats to freedom of expression and the right to equal treatment. The report was completed before the Hungarian parliament passed widely criticised anti-immigrant laws last week that made it a criminal offence punishable by a jail term to help people lodge asylum claims. The European commission is “now going to review the Hungarian legislation on migration to determine whether it is compatible with European rules”, a spokeswoman said last week. Hungary’s response was made plain in a radio interview during which Orbán lashed out at the commission for “pestering, pressuring and attacking Poland” and “attacking Hungary”. In a statement to Hungarian media, Orbán said the vote was a way of “apply[ing] pressure to Hungary so that it changes its standpoint with relation to migration. But in view of the fact that Hungarian voters have already decided on this issue, there is nothing more to talk about.” He described Sargentini, as “one of George Soros’s people”, in a now familiar attack against the billionaire philanthropist, the EU and civil society groups. Orbán has long demonised the Hungarian-born Soros in a relentless campaign widely seen to have antisemitic overtones. Orbán has long accused the EU of overreaching its powers, a charge he has stepped up in recent years with a “Stop Brussels” campaign. He said the anti-immigration legislation had been flagged up in the electoral campaign. “The people wanted this and the people voted for this,” Orbán told state radio last week. “Who would dare to criticise or condemn the 80 or 90% decision of a country’s legislature?” The EU triggered the rule of law process for the first time in 2017, when it took action against Poland for changes to the judiciary that international experts say threaten the rule of law. Poland’s EU affairs minister will appear before his 27 counterparts from the other member states at a hearing on Tuesday, where he will seek to counter the charge of a “systemic threat” to Polish democracy.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/mep-european-parliament-vote-eu-sanction-hungary-viktor-orban,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/mep-european-parliament-vote-eu-sanction-hungary-viktor-orban
2018-06-25T15:36:51Z,world,World news,Italian minister calls for migrant reception centres south of Libya,"The populist Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini has called for migrant reception centres to be set up on the external borders of southern Libya after a meeting with the African nation’s leaders in Tripoli. He said the proposal, one of many in a Italian package designed to crack down on migration, will be put to EU heads of governments at a meeting on Thursday. It was the first visit to Libya by a member of the new Italian government, which was elected on a wave of public unrest about the arrival of more than 500,000 mainly African migrants trafficked across the Mediterranean by Libyan smuggling gangs over the past four years. Italy’s rightwing coalition, led by Salvini’s anti-immigration League, surged to several victories in local elections at the weekend, wresting control of three large cities traditionally held by the left. It was also Salvini’s first official overseas visit since he was appointed to the interior ministry, and underlines how much the fate of the populist government is dependent on what happens to migration within Africa.
Salvini has already caused fury among European politicians by unilaterally closing Italian ports to NGO ships that have picked up migrants in distress in international waters. His visit came as the Associated Press reported that Algeria has abandoned more than 13,000 migrants in the desert in the past 14 months, including pregnant women and children, stranding them without food or water and forcing them to walk, sometimes at gunpoint, under temperatures of up to 48C (118.4F). The news agency said that while some made it to Niger countless others had died in the desert. According to the AP, Algeria’s mass expulsions have picked up since October 2017 as the EU renewed pressure on north African countries to head off migrants going to Europe. Speaking at a press conference in Tripoli, Salvini said: “On Thursday in Brussels, we will jointly support with Libyan authorities the setting up of reception and identification centres south of Libya, on the external border of Libya, to help Libya as well as Italy, block migration”. “Neither Italy or Libya can be alone in protecting their borders,” he added. The UN-backed Libyan government based in Tripoli said it will not allow migrant camps in Libya if they are run by foreign personnel, a condition that suggests that Salvini’s proposed camps would have to be placed on the borders of Libya with neighbouring countries such as Chad and Niger. Still, it is not clear whether governments there would be willing to host the migrant centres. Ahmed Maiteeq, the deputy premier of Libya’s government of national accord, explained his country “categorically refuses” to set up foreign-run camps on its own territory, saying this would break Libyan law. He said Libya would invite European countries bordering the Mediterranean to a summit on migration in Tripoli at the beginning of September. At present, UN staff from the International Organisation for Migration and the UN High Commission for Refugees are allowed to visit Libyan reception centres, but the visits are sporadic, and the UN agencies have little formal power to demand changes to the often brutal regime. The European parliament has called for the EU to withdraw cooperation from the camps. Salvini said he wanted to do more to help train the Libyan coastguard, but he did not call for European border guards to be placed on the shores of Libya, an idea proposed by the Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz. Italian navy personnel are on shore in Libya but do not directly participate in patrols. Figures show since last summer the coastguard has been responsible for more than 40% of the migrants that are now rescued or intercepted. But the Libyan navy are seeking extra boats and equipment to beat back both the traffickers and the NGOs waiting to pick up boats in distress outside Libyan sovereign waters. Libya would also like the UN arms embargo lifted.
There have been growing complaints that the Libyan coastguard has been using increasingly aggressive methods to push rafts packed with migrants back to the coast land. It has also been alleged some of its members are in league with the traffickers. Irregular sea arrivals to Italy are down by 78% year on year, with NGOs carrying out over 40% of search and rescue operations in 2017 and 2018. Yet more than 51% of Italians believe flows are as high or higher than last year’s. In other trends, the numbers of dead or missing trying to cross the Mediterranean has started to rise with more than 1,000 estimated deaths this year.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/matteo-salvini-calls-for-migrant-reception-centres-in-southern-libya,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/matteo-salvini-calls-for-migrant-reception-centres-in-southern-libya
2018-06-25T14:31:17Z,world,World news,'Organised crime doesn't have elections': no end to killings as Mexico votes,"When Arnoldo Cuéllar kicked off his reporting career in Guanajuato in the mid-1980s, mass graves, decapitations and political assassinations were not part of his patch. “It was a calm place back then,” reminisced the 57-year-old Mexican journalist. These days, not a day goes by without grotesque chronicles of Mexico’s intensifying drug war clogging up the homepage and Twitter feed of the news website he runs, Zona Franca. “I read the news that comes in and I say to myself: ‘This is not possible’,” said Cuéllar. “It feels like the government doesn’t care … there’s a total abandonment of leadership … like we are lost at sea.”
As Mexico prepares to choose its next president on 1 July, it is a sentiment shared by millions of voters up and down this violence-stricken nation. Having last year endured the deadliest year in its modern history with nearly 30,000 murders, Mexico is already on track for an even bloodier year with nearly 8,000 murders in the first three months of 2018 alone.
With the bloodletting showing no sign of abating – and a wave of deadly and brazen attacks on politicians adding to the sense of insecurity – those running for the presidency have paid at least lip service to making peace a priority. Frontrunner Andrés Manuel López Obrador has proposed giving some criminals an amnesty and promised to personally chair security meetings at 6am each morning. In a recent interview Jorge Castañeda, the campaign chief of second-placed Ricardo Anaya, suggested his candidate would ditch Mexico’s “totally useless” 12-year war on drugs and reprioritise the fight against organised crime so it was less focused on drug trafficking. “Homicides are a direct product of the war on drugs – they are not a product of people killing each other just for the hell of it,” he said. The most drastic proposal has come from the last-placed candidate, Jaime Rodríguez, who has proposed chopping off hands as a way of checking the violence.
Yet experts say not one of the candidates has come up with a convincing, detailed strategy to pacify a country that has suffered more than 200,000 murders since 2007. “It’s almost as if they don’t think it is important or are afraid of the topic,” complained Eduardo Guerrero, a security expert who has spent the last decade tracking Mexico’s soaring murder rate. Few places need a plan more urgently than the state of Guanajuato, an agricultural and car manufacturing hub to the north-west of Mexico City.
By Guerrero’s count, the state – which until 2010 had one of the country’s lowest murder rates – became Mexico’s massacre champion in the first quarter of this year with 15 attacks in which three or more lives were lost. Last year there were nearly 2,000 execution-style killings, up from 51 in 2007. In the first four months of this year there have been more than 1,000. The task of counting those corpses has fallen to journalists like Luis García, Zona Franca’s correspondent in Celaya, a city in one of Guanajuato’s worst-hit regions. On a recent morning, the 41-year-old passed through security into Celaya’s bunker-like public prosecutor’s office for what has become a macabre daily transcription session at which officials divulge the grizzly minutiae of the latest killings. There was, as ever, no shortage of news. In the nearby town of Apaseo el Grande a missing teenager’s bullet-riddled corpse had been dumped. “She was 17,” the official said. “Her mother identified her as María del Carmen Rodríguez Mendoza … She didn’t have a job and she didn’t go to school.” In Villagrán, the caretaker of a car wash had been bludgeoned to death: “Leonardo Galván Gallardo, 57 … he didn’t have any relatives, he had multiple wounds to the head.” In Santa Teresa, a headless, limbless and as yet nameless corpse had been abandoned in a field: “What they found was a torso. No head. No arms … They found the skull about 15m away.”
But the deadliest crime had unfolded just down the road, at about 4.25pm the previous afternoon, when a cherry-coloured Volkswagen and a white Nissan pulled into a petrol station. “Five people got out and opened fire,” the official said. By the time they had unloaded at least 50 shots into a group of diners, five people lay dead and three were badly injured. “Is this a normal day? Well, yes,” said García. “It sounds terrible but for us it’s an unusual day when there isn’t any bloodshed.”
After punching details of the killings into his iPhone 5, the Zona Franca reporter set off for the crime scene – and for lunch, gulping down a plate of chili-smothered tacos at a food stand that had already reopened on the site of the previous day’s carnage. After lunch he surveyed the site of Celaya’s latest liquidation. “Bullet casings,” García said pointing to dozens of chalk markings on the concrete. “Blood,” he said, kicking his way through the gore-stained undergrowth beside the petrol station’s pockmarked wall. “You get used to it. When I started out [20 years ago], do you know what security stories were?” he asked. “Someone getting run over by a truck.” Guanajuato’s governor, Miguel Márquez, put a brave face on the butchery, casting it as part of a global trend. “Unfortunately, the world is in crisis. You turn on the television and you see violence in Asia, you see violence in Europe, in Latin America … It’s regrettable that we are all living through hard times.” Márquez said he was surprised by the spike in killings and believed Mexico’s next president needed to make the security crisis “a national priority”. But law-abiding citizens were rarely affected, he claimed, since 70% of murders in his state were linked to a struggle between organised crime cartels for control of a $1.6m market in fuel theft.
Mexican officials have often alleged that most victims of violence are involved in crime – an affirmation challenged by independent analysts. “It’s a dispute between them,” Márquez insisted, boasting of his administration’s crime-fighting investments including a high-tech $150m command centre called C5i. “Regrettably, this dispute has created a bad impression … [but] the important thing is that we will turn things around.” Yet even as the governor spoke Guanajuato’s mortuaries continued to fill as his state registered its most violent week in recent history, with 75 murders in just five days. It had been, one local broadsheet declared beside a graphic photo of a 19-year-old murder victim lying face down in a pool of blood, “a terrifying week”. Back at Zona Franca’s newsroom in the city of León, Cuéllar was downbeat. What did the future look like? “Bad,” he sighed. “We’re in a mess and everybody thinks changing the President of the Republic is going to bring about a solution … [But] whoever comes in is going to face the same problems only with less experience.” “Organised crime doesn’t have elections,” Cuéllar pointed out. “They’re always working on the same themes.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/as-mexico-election-nears-candidates-show-no-sound-plans-to-stem-violence,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/as-mexico-election-nears-candidates-show-no-sound-plans-to-stem-violence
2018-06-25T12:32:31Z,world,World news,"Give Angela Merkel more time to set up EU migrant deals, say allies","Allies of Angela Merkel have called for the German leader to be given more time to set up new bilateral migration deals with other European countries, as she returned empty-handed from an emergency mini-summit in Brussels. Sunday’s gathering of 16 European leaders had been hastily assembled to offer a lifeline to the German chancellor, as her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, is threatening to unilaterally turn away migrants already registered in another EU country at German borders unless the chancellor can come up with a European solution to the problem by 1 July. But with the unorthodox meeting failing to reach concrete conclusions, senior members of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union have rallied around their party leader and called on its sister party, the Bavarian CSU, to adjust their expectations. “I believe there will be progress by the time of the EU summit on Thursday and Friday,” said Günther Oettinger, the European commissioner for budget and human resources. “But there won’t be an agreement of the dimension that some in the CSU are expecting.”
The centre-right politician said he believed Merkel had “strong arguments for carrying out further discussions at a European level”. Armin Laschet, the CDU state premier of North-Rhine Westphalia, warned Seehofer that unilateral action on the German border could trigger a chain reaction that could damage the country’s national interest. “If we as Germany go alone now, then Italy might withdraw from the Dublin agreement and stop registering [asylum seekers], and we end up with more refugees than before,” said Laschet. “If Germany closes its borders shut and Italy doesn’t accept any returns, then the refugees would obviously in the long term end up in Italy,” said the agriculture minister, Julia Klöckner.
The EU’s Dublin regulation requires asylum seekers to make their application in the first EU country they arrive in – meaning Italy and Greece currently bear a disproportionate burden. The former finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble warned that Merkel would have no choice but to relieve Seehofer of his job should he go ahead with border closures without the chancellor’s permission. “If a minister goes against the chancellor, she has no choice. She must uphold the dignity of her office,” said Schäuble, who is currently president of the German Bundestag. Meanwhile, the architect of the 2016 migration deal between the EU and Turkey said on Monday Merkel would stand her best chances of escaping from the current dilemma by concentrating on a deal between a smaller group of European states. “Those who are seeking a solution, like the German chancellor and [France’s] President Macron, have to be clear that they are only going to find a solution with the help of countries who are genuinely interested in finding one,” said Gerald Knaus, director of the European Stability Initiative thinktank. “And there you have one country offering itself up, and that’s Greece.” Reintroducing effective border controls on Germany’s southern borders, Knaus said, “would be such a dramatic intrusion in the daily life of people who live there that it would be the first step towards the collapse of the European project”. Meanwhile, on a visit to Libya, Italy’s anti-immigration interior minister, Matteo Salvini, said he had proposed setting up migrant reception centres at Libya’s southern borders to help staunch the flow of migrants across the Mediterranean Sea to Italy. Salvini, whose far-right party the League has campaigned to bar migrants fleeing Africa and expel those already in Italy, and has been in a governing coalition since the start of June, did not say in which countries such centres could be located.

2018-06-25T11:49:56Z,world,World news,Muharrem İnce concedes defeat to Erdoğan in Turkey elections,"Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s main challenger in Sunday’s elections, Muharrem İnce, has conceded defeat, urging the re-elected Turkish president to embrace all the country’s 81 million citizens and vowing to continue the fight against one-man rule in opposition. İnce’s concession speech in Ankara came after Turkey’s supreme election board confirmed the results, with Erdoğan winning with an outright majority in the first round, on 52.6% of the vote with 99% of ballots counted. İnce came in second place with 30.64% of the vote – an impressive challenge but not enough to force a second-round runoff. “I accept the election results,” İnce said at a press conference at his party’s headquarters, adding that despite some votes being stolen, the overall result was not in question. “We will live the consequences of having one-man rule in the legislature, judiciary and government. I will keep up the fight as someone who got the approval of one person among every three in Turkey.”
Turkish voters re-elected Erdoğan to another term in office on Sunday in elections whose outcome is likely to shape the country for years or even decades to come. The president, who has already ruled Turkey unopposed for 16 years, will be sworn in to another five years in power, leading up to the centennial of the modern republic’s founding from the ashes of the Ottoman empire. Erdoğan will assume vast new powers narrowly approved in a referendum last year, including the power to appoint senior judges and unelected vice presidents, and to pass decrees with the force of law. He will face few checks on his power from a diminished parliament where the majority is a coalition that includes his ruling Justice and Development (AKP) party and the Nationalist Action Party (MHP), who performed surprisingly well, doubling their expected share of ballots.
The outcome of the vote is the culmination of years of Erdoğan’s pursuit of an executive presidency, a goal that has seen the Turkish leader ascend the highest echelons of power in the country while simultaneously crushing opponents, intimidating or co-opting dissident media outlets, and reprising a role as commander-in-chief protecting Turkey from external and internal enemies. Erdoğan struck a defiant tone in his victory speech early on Monday in Ankara, saying Turkey had set “an example” for the rest of the world, vowing to carry on military campaigns in Syria, fight terror groups and raise Turkey’s international prestige. “We have received the message that has been given to us in the ballot boxes,” he said. “We will fight even more with the strength you provided us with this election.” İnce, a former physics teacher, ran a dynamic campaign that energised an opposition movement that had struggled to find charismatic leaders to represent them. He campaigned on a platform to reverse the presidential system and return Turkey to parliamentary democracy, end the ongoing state of emergency, stop prosecutions of journalists and civil society members, restore the rule of law and send Syrian refugees back home to their country.
He had sought to appeal to Erdoğan’s conservative base by emphasising his own religious credentials and vowing that the country’s secularists, if elected, would not discriminate against religious countrymen. His rallies in the major Turkish cities drew crowds of hundreds of thousands of supporters, culminating in one attended by at least one million people in Istanbul on Saturday. But in the end, İnce’s appeals led to a performance that showed he was more popular than his own party, the CHP, but was not enough to force a second-round runoff with Erdoğan. Polls showed İnce would likely lose such a race, but the prospect was seen as representing a major setback for the incumbent. İnce now appears a powerful enough figure to wrest control of the CHP in the wake of the race. He said his party made mistakes in the elections but declined to elaborate on them or say whether he would assume a role within it. He also denied rumours that had spread on social media overnight that he had been threatened into conceding the vote, due to the fact that he was not seen publicly for hours after polls closed on Sunday. The state-run Anadolu Agency said Russian president Vladimir Putin called to offer congratulations and praised Erdoğan’s “authority.” Iranian president Hassan Rouhani also congratulated Erdoğan in a statement, saying he hoped ties with Ankara would thrive. Reaction from Turkey’s western allies was muted. Only Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s Secretary General, congratulated Erdoğan and Turkish citizens on the high turnout. Ties with the EU have been strained for years over lack of advancement on Turkey’s EU accession talks and the worsening rights situation in Turkey.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/muharrem-ince-concedes-defeat-to-erdogan-in-turkey-elections,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/muharrem-ince-concedes-defeat-to-erdogan-in-turkey-elections
2018-06-25T11:39:38Z,world,World news,Ex-Nato chief refused visa waiver to US because of Iran trips,"The former Nato secretary general Javier Solana has been refused a visa waiver to enter the US because of his past trips to Iran, one of the countries blacklisted by the US Department of Homeland Security. Solana, who helped negotiate the Iran nuclear deal during his time as the EU’s foreign policy chief, had been due to speak at an event at Washington’s Brookings Institution, but learned he would not be able to enter the US after trying to apply for an electronic visa waiver. Under the system, those who have visited any of seven blacklisted countries – Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen – on or after 1 March 2011 are barred from receiving the waiver and have to apply for a visa. The rules predate Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban on five Muslim-majority countries and North Korea. “It’s a bit of a mean decision,” Solana told Spain’s Antena 3 TV channel on Monday. “I don’t think it’s good because some people have to visit these complicated countries to keep negotiations alive.” Solana, who has also served as Spain’s foreign minister, said he had been invited to Iran in 2013 to attend President Rouhani’s inauguration. “I went there to represent all those who had been involved in the negotiations,” he said. “I’ll see what I can do to fix this. It’s a computer – an algorithm – and if you’ve been in Iran lately, they take you out of the system. It’s like you don’t exist visa-wise, because you can’t visit the country.” Solana said he hoped to resolve the situation soon as he had professional commitments to honour in the US: “I need to go because I need to work there and I’m a professor at various universities.” France’s ambassador to the US, Gérard Araud, reacted to the news on Twitter, noting that the visa policy had been introduced under the Obama administration. “Strange that our American friends are discovering only now this Obama regulation,” he wrote. “Scores of European scholars, parliamentarians and business people have already faced the same constraints.” Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last month, despite strenuous European objections. Iran has said it will decide in the next few weeks whether to pull out of the deal, signed in 2015, and start enriching uranium capable of making a nuclear bomb. Asked for comment on Solana’s case, a spokeswoman for US Customs and Border Protection said: “Without getting into specific cases, this is part of legislation that was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama.” Additional reporting by Julian Borger",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/ex-nato-chief-javier-solana-refused-visa-waiver-to-us-iran-trips,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/ex-nato-chief-javier-solana-refused-visa-waiver-to-us-iran-trips
2018-06-25T10:14:57Z,world,World news,Mumbai bans plastic bags and bottles,"Mumbai has the become the largest Indian city to ban single-use plastics, with residents caught using plastic bags, cups or bottles to face penalties of up to 25,000 rupees (£276) and three months in jail from Monday. Council inspectors in navy blue jackets have been posted across the city to catch businesses or residents still using plastic bags. Penalties have already kicked in for businesses and several, reportedly including a McDonald’s and Starbucks, have already been fined. Penalties range from 5,000 rupees for first-time offenders to 25,000 rupees and the threat of three months’ jail for those caught repeatedly using single-use plastics.
“For the pollution situation it’s fine to do this but for the people it is a big problem,” said Kamlash Mohan Chaudhary, a Mumbai resident. “People here carry everything in plastic bags.” Chaudhary, a taxi driver, said he had started carrying a cloth bag and that his local mutton vendor had begun wrapping the meat in newspaper rather than plastic sheets. Local media have reported complaints from vendors who say some inspectors are using confusion over the ban to extort money from businesses. India recently hosted World Environment Day, which this year focused on the epidemic of plastic waste. About 6.3bn tonnes of plastic globally has been discarded into the environment since 1950, most of which will not break down for at least 450 years. Half of the world’s plastic was created in the past 13 years and about half of that is thought to be for products used once and thrown away, such as bags, cups or straws. India’s use of plastic is less than half of the global average: about 11kg a year per capita compared with 109kg in the US. India has among the highest rates of mismanaging plastic waste in the world, according to a 2015 study. Strewn plastic wrappers, cups and bags are a common sight on the streets of Indian cities and beaches and make up part of the mountain-sized landfills on the outskirts of major metropolitan areas such Delhi.
Discontent about Mumbai’s ban was made worse on Monday by torrential rain, which Chaudhary said had soaked through the jute or cloth bags many people were using as an alternative to plastic. Messages were circulated on WhatsApp with stories of people who had been fined, prompting many to comply. “We are all very afraid,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/mumbai-india-bans-plastic-bags-and-bottles,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/mumbai-india-bans-plastic-bags-and-bottles
2018-06-25T08:41:07Z,world,World news,Nine EU states sign off on joint military intervention force,"Nine EU member states have agreed to establish a European military force for rapid deployment in times of crisis, an initiative which has won the backing of the UK as it seeks to maintain defence ties after Brexit. Spearheaded by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the joint enterprise will allow national armed forces across Europe to coordinate and react swiftly together. Ministers from France, Germany, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, the Netherlands, Estonia, Spain and Portugal signed a letter of intent in Luxembourg on Monday. Since the election of its new government, Italy has backtracked on its initial support, but Rome has not ruled out the country’s future involvement. Macron had outlined his vision of strategic autonomy for European defence in a keynote Sorbonne speech last September. The development has caused some anxiety within Nato, where officials are concerned about any duplication of roles and distancing by European nations from the US. However, Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who was in Luxembourg for discussions on European security and defence before a summit of the military alliance in Brussels next month, told reporters: “I welcome this initiative as I believe it can strengthen the readiness of forces. We need high readiness that is exactly what Nato is now focusing on. “I just see this new initiative as something that can complement and actually reinforce the work which is ongoing in Nato to strengthen and increase the readiness of our forces.” France’s defence minister, Florence Parly, told the newspaper Le Figaro on Sunday: “Defence Europe requires a common strategic culture … The deadlines and decisions in the EU are still much too long compared to the urgency that can arise from a critical situation in a country where Europeans would consider that there is a strong stake for their security.”
The European Intervention Initiative is outside the EU’s structures, so will allow for full UK involvement after Brexit. At a separate meeting of ministers in Luxembourg, rules for military projects within the EU’s so-called Permanent Structured Cooperation on security and defence, or Pesco, were also signed off, although it is unclear as yet whether the UK will be allowed to take part. The rapid deployment force was initially due to be part of the Pesco arrangements, which have the goal of harmonising defence spending, hardware design and strategic planning, but concerns were raised in Paris that finding agreement among 28 member states in regard to time-sensitive events could prove difficult. The UK has traditionally been wary of efforts to build a European defence cooperation that could challenge Nato structures, but has become a champion of such initiatives since the vote to leave the EU. A French government source said the UK’s involvement was key, as the two military powers shared similar cultures and analytical approaches on how to tackle a crisis. “That culture is not shared between every EU member state,” the source said. The initiative is expected to aid joint planning on events such as natural disasters, crisis intervention or the evacuation of citizens from hot spots. Since 2007, the EU has had four multinational military “battle groups” but the troops have never been deployed.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/nine-eu-states-to-sign-off-on-joint-military-intervention-force,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/nine-eu-states-to-sign-off-on-joint-military-intervention-force
2018-06-25T08:28:38Z,world,World news,Turkey elections Q&A: was the vote free and fair?,"What happened in Turkey? The country held presidential and parliamentary elections at the same time, under a new presidential system where the head of state will wield extraordinary powers and parliament’s authority will be diminished. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan won re-election with an outright majority in the first round, on 52.55% of the vote with 99% of ballots opened. His biggest challenger, Muharrem İnce, came second with 30.67% of the vote – an impressive challenge but not enough to force a second-round run-off. The imprisoned presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtaş of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic party (HDP) won 8.36% of the vote. He outperformed Meral Akşener, who broke away from the nationalists allied with Erdoğan to set up her own opposition party.
In parliament, the HDP crossed the threshold of 10% of the national vote needed to enter parliament, but Erdoğan’s ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), along with its nationalist allies, the Nationalist Movement party (MHP), retained the overall majority in parliament after an unexpectedly strong showing by the nationalists. Turnout was a record 87%. The results are a major disappointment for the opposition, which performed below expectations, setting the stage for Erdoğan’s continued dominance. So what now? Erdoğan will assume new powers approved in a referendum last year. These include the power to appoint senior judges and unelected vice-presidents, as well as the cabinet, with almost no oversight from parliament, and the power to issue decrees with the force of law. His first term will last for five years, taking him up to the centennial of the founding of the Turkish republic. He is eligible to run for a second five-year term. The AKP and its MHP allies will retain the majority in parliament, but cracks have appeared in the alliance in recent weeks. Whether it will hold or not is uncertain, in a parliament with greatly diminished influence. But the checks and balances on Erdoğan’s power are now almost non-existent. How was the campaign run? Muharrem İnce ran a dynamic campaign, the first time in years that Turkey’s opposition appeared to have found its voice and mounted an energetic challenge. A former physics teacher, Ince was the nominee of the main secularist opposition Republican People’s party (CHP) and drew crowds in the hundreds of thousands in Turkey’s largest cities, while criss-crossing almost all of the country’s provinces.
He campaigned on a platform that promised to reverse the extraordinary powers of the president under the new system, end prosecutions of journalists and civil society members and restore the rule of law, proposing a “grand bargain” that would position religious conservatives and secularists as equals after decades of distrust. While almost all polls showed a likely Erdoğan victory in the first and second rounds, many appeared to suggest that İnce and other opposition candidates would garner enough votes to force the president into a second-round contest. That would have been seen as a setback for the Turkish leader, who has ruled unopposed for 16 years. Instead, the result showed that Erdoğan retained basically the same share of the vote as he has always had. In 2014, the first time the Turkish president was directly elected by popular vote, Erdoğan won with 51.79%. In the 2017 referendum to expand presidential powers, the president’s yes campaign won with 51.4% of the vote. His popularity remained unchanged, even as his AKP lost seats in parliament over alleged corruption and mismanagement after a decade and a half in power.
In the end, it seemed that İnce’s appeal to Erdoğan’s religious conservative base – the CHP candidate regularly attends Friday prayers and in his last rally brought his mother on stage in a headscarf, vowing not to discriminate against religious people – seems to have failed. The distrust of the country’s secularists runs too deep within Erdoğan’s base. What about parliament? Voters appear to have stuck to their own camps, even if they voted for different parties within their coalitions. Instead of winning over voters from Erdoğan’s camp, the opposition parties mostly pilfered voters from each other. Erdoğan’s AKP and its MHP nationalist allies retained their majority in parliament after a surprisingly strong showing by the latter. The pro-Kurdish and liberal HDP entered parliament for a second consecutive term by getting more than 10% of the national vote, but because of the MHP’s strong performance it succeeded only in diluting the ruling party’s majority. Before the election, the MHP – a party that barely held any election rallies and a segment of which broke off to join the opposition as the İyi party – was predicted to have between 5-7% of the vote. Instead, it got just over 11%. The ruling AKP went down from 49.5% in the last election to 42.5%, while the CHP was down almost 3%. AKP voters appear to have punished it for its alleged corruption and inefficiency by voting for its nationalist allies, but did not go so far as to cross over to the other side. The CHP lost votes to the pro-Kurdish HDP, a strategic tactic designed to ensure the latter could enter parliament – the opposition’s strategy to end the AKP’s majority. But it appears that CHP voters also went over to their opposition allies, the nationalist İyi, which in turn failed to win over significant nationalist and conservative voters from Erdoğan’s camp. İnce’s performance may have also positioned him to take control of the CHP and emerge as its new leader, having outperformed his own party at the polls. What was the controversy around the results? As the early results were coming in, there was a massive difference between reports from the official state news agency Anadolu Agency and the opposition election monitoring platform Adil Seçim, with the former showing an outright first-round victory and the second showing a result that would have led to a run-off vote. That did not stop Erdoğan declaring victory based on the unofficial results. The differences went away as all the results came in. Nevertheless, Anadolu appears in every election to publish first the results favouring Erdoğan and his party, opening with a massive lead for the incumbent that goes on to shrink precipitously as other results come in. The opposition says this is a tactic to discourage election monitors from staying for the entire ballot count. Was the election free and fair? There were no large-scale allegations of fraud, but the elections took place in what Amnesty International described as a “climate of fear”. The country is still under a state of emergency in place since a coup attempt in July 2016, one of the presidential candidates is in prison and his party, the HDP, has been widely persecuted with hundreds of cadres and officials arrested in the last two years. The vast majority of the media are owned by allies of the president, transforming most news outlets into a loyalist press, and those who do criticise the government, like the oldest newspaper in the country, Cumhuriyet, are prosecuted on baseless allegations of abetting terrorism. According to figures by the Turkish TV and radio watchdog, Erdoğan was given 181 hours of coverage during the campaign by the state broadcaster TRT, while İnce was accorded 15 hours. Demirtaş was given just 32 minutes. Still, the 87% turnout puts election participation in western democracies in the shade.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/turkey-elections-result-erdogan-amnesty-was-vote-free-and-fair,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/turkey-elections-result-erdogan-amnesty-was-vote-free-and-fair
2018-06-25T07:39:00Z,world,World news,Victory propels Erdoğan into elite club of strongman leaders,"Outright victory in the first round of Turkey’s presidential elections has propelled Recep Tayyip Erdoğan into the foremost rank of global strongman leaders in the style of Russia’s Vladimir Putin, China’s Xi Jinping and Egypt’s Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. But his unchecked political dominance may mark the beginning of a new dark age for Turkish democracy. Erdoğan’s triumphantly aggressive acceptance speech from the balcony of the Ankara headquarters of his neo-Islamist Justice and Development party (AKP) set an ominous tone. He vowed to continue to “fight decisively” against Turkey’s enemies at home and abroad, as defined by him. “We never bow down in front of anyone except God,” he declared. Erdoğan had no kind words for his defeated challengers. He offered no olive branch to the roughly 47% of the electorate that did not back him or his AKP-led parliamentary alliance. Given his daunting record since 2003, vanquished rivals have cause to fear political payback once the dust settles. Retribution is something Erdoğan excels at.
Now it will be even easier as he assumes the quasi-dictatorial powers of executive president that were narrowly agreed in a referendum last year. These give him personal authority to appoint and dismiss ministers, dissolve parliament, issue decrees, appoint judges, direct the armed forces and declare war. Although Erdoğan has promised to lift the state of emergency imposed after 2016’s failed coup, it seems improbable thousands of Kurdish activists and MPs, lawyers, civil servants, judges and journalists who remain in detention will be released soon. About 160,000 people were arrested or sacked in the year after the coup. As in past elections, there were suspicions of fraud, particularly regarding the unexpectedly strong showing of Erdoğan’s ally Devlet Bahçeli’s Nationalist Movement party (MHP). The main opposition, the Republican People’s party (CHP), complained during the count that results were being declared before ballots were fully counted. In a strange twist, a pro-government television station accidentally aired election “results” showing an Erdoğan victory three days before Sunday’s polls. A report by the Oda TV news website claimed the station screened figures supposedly provided by the state news agency giving Erdoğan 53% of the vote and his CHP challenger, Muharrem İnce, 26%. In the event, Erdoğan officially won 53% on Sunday and İnce 31%. Prior to the election, unidentified Turkish security sources accused the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which sent monitors to observe the polls, of plotting to create a “shady perception” of the process. Some European monitors were banned. On Sunday, Turkey’s best-known independent newspaper, Cumhuriyet, whose journalists have been repeatedly harassed, said its website had suffered an unexplained distributed denial of service attack. But while İnce complained that the election was unfair, and state media biased, the defeated opposition’s protests seemed half-hearted. No official fraud investigation is expected – or indeed possible, unless Erdoğan orders it. Nor will he take any notice of anything the OSCE monitors may say. Instead, he warned critics not to challenge the results. One bright point for the anti-Erdoğan camp was the achievement of the pro-Kurdish HDP in passing the 10% threshold for parliamentary representation, even though its de facto leader, Selahattin Demirtaş, was forced to campaign from a jail cell. The AKP had its parliamentary wings clipped. It will rely on Bahçeli’s MHP for a majority – a marriage of convenience that will not necessarily endure over the next five years. Erdoğan’s reincarnation as a modern-day Ottoman sultan will be viewed with trepidation across the region and in Europe. But Putin, will be content. Despite bilateral strains early in the Syrian war, Moscow and Ankara have been drawing closer to one another, helped by Russian advanced missile sales and a joint nuclear power station building programme with Rosatom. Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, will not be wholly displeased, either. Although Erdoğan broke with him soon after the war began in 2011, his priority in Syria now is to curb the influence of Syrian and Iraqi Kurdish forces along the shared border, not regime change. Erdoğan can be expected to continue his alliance with Russia and Iran, in the teeth of US and Nato objections. In his acceptance speech, he also signalled a renewed military drive against Kurdish militants in south-east Turkey. This threatens to produce a repeat of the bloody events that followed the June 2015 elections. Likewise, Erdoğan will pursue his obsessive vendetta with the “terrorist organisation” of his bete noir, the exiled cleric Fethullah Gülen. His re-election is not the outcome most EU countries would have hoped for. They deplore his human rights abuses, his subversion of democratic institutions, and his perceived efforts to overturn Turkey’s secular tradition. But Europe needs Turkey’s help with its immigration and terrorism problems, so will keep mum. Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s rightwing prime minister, is an exception. He was the first foreign leader to send congratulations. People like Orbán, Putin – and Donald Trump – see in Erdoğan an unscrupulous strongman like themselves: ultra-nationalist, unilateralist, populist – and utterly ruthless.

2018-06-25T06:29:44Z,world,World news,Turkey election: Erdoğan strikes combative tone in victory speech,"Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has addressed thousands of supporters in Ankara after being declared the victor in Turkey’s presidential election, saying democracy was the winner and that Turkey was “an example for the rest of the world”. “We have received the message that has been given to us in the ballot boxes,” he said, speaking from the balcony of the AK party’s headquarters in Ankara, to a large crowd of cheering and flag-waving supporters. “We will fight even more with the strength you provided us with this election.” He began by apologising for being late to the balcony speech, saying this was due to the fact that a small child was injured in the crowd in Istanbul, where he had been speaking before, and he went to speak to the child’s family. Erdoğan spoke of his commitment to “fight terroristic organisations”, “to continue the fight to make the Syrian grounds freer” and to increase the “international prestige” of Turkey, saying: “Turkey has no moment to waste, we know that.” “Our flag will flutter more freely, the peace of every citizen will be advanced,” he said, before leading the crowd in a chant of “One nation, one flag, one country, one state.” Earlier on Sunday night, the country’s electoral board said the incumbent had won with 97.7% of votes counted. Even before this declaration, Erdoğan seemed sure of the result. “Our people have given us the job of carrying out the presidential and executive posts,” Erdoğan said on Sunday night, even while ballots were still being tallied. “I hope nobody will damage democracy by casting a shadow on this election and its results to hide their failure.” The main opposition party did not immediately concede defeat, but after initially saying Erdoğan would fall well short of a first-round victory, it later said it would continue its democratic struggle “whatever the result”.
The official Anadolu Agency reported that, with 99% of votes counted, Erdoğan had won a 52.54% share of the national vote, while the opposition CHP party’s candidate, Muharrem İnce, was on 30.68%. The pro-Kurdish party, known as the HDP, took 11.67% of the vote, passing the 10% threshold to enter parliament for a second consecutive term. This diluted the majority of Erdoğan’s ruling party, the AKP, but fell short of the numbers needed to overturn that majority after a surprise showing by the AKP’s nationalist allies. “This sets the stage for speeding up reforms,” the Turkish deputy prime minister, Mehmet Şimşek, tweeted of the results. The winner of the presidential race is set to assume extraordinary new powers narrowly approved in a referendum last year that was marred by allegations of fraud. These include complete control of the cabinet and the power to appoint senior judges and officials, including unelected vice-presidents. The president will also have the power to issue decrees with the force of law. Those powers will allow the victor to transform Turkey’s political scene for years and possibly decades to come, governing until 2028 if he wins re-election. Opposition candidates had pledged to overturn the presidential system if they had won. The results, if they stand, will be a disappointment to the opposition, which had hoped to push Erdoğan into a second-round runoff against İnce, and to wrest control of the legislature from the AKP. Erdoğan and his party have governed unopposed for 16 years. The president called early the snap elections in April hoping to preempt worsening economic trends and to catch the opposition by surprise. He looked set to win easily in a presidential race and in parliament in alliance with the nationalists, projecting an image of a commander-in-chief fighting external enemies inside Turkey and across the border in Syria, and triumphant against terror groups. But the opposition mounted a dynamic election campaign, with its presidential candidate İnce drawing crowds in the hundreds of thousands in rallies in the country’s largest cities of Istanbul, İzmir and Ankara, and criss-crossing the country on dozens of rallies. Turnout at the elections hovered around an extraordinary 87% of the electorate, exceeding that of last year’s referendum. Opposition officials cried foul as soon as results began coming in, with the state-run Anadolu Agency announcing preliminary results more than two hours earlier than expected and opening with a massive lead for Erdoğan and his party’s alliance in parliament. That lead closed over time, but it prompted accusations by the opposition that the state news agency was launching a manipulation operation to influence election monitors into leaving ballot counting stations early. For much of the count, rival vote estimates by the opposition and the state-run agency were published, the former showing Erdoğan winning with less than 50% of the vote, and the latter showing a first-round outright victory. The first result would lead to a second-round contest on 8 July, a possibility that would represent a major psychological blow for Erdoğan, even if he was tipped to win that contest as well. The main secular opposition party, İnce’s CHP, continued to contest the results well into the count, charging that less than 40% of ballot boxes had been opened, and that many of İnce’s strong electoral districts had not yet been counted. İnce urged ballot count monitors to remain at their stations until the counts had been completed to protect against election fraud. Nevertheless, Erdoğan had already been congratulated on a win in the race by Hungary’s strongman leader, Viktor Orbán. The election took place on an uneven playing field, against a backdrop of human rights abuses that Amnesty International described as a “climate of fear”. One of the presidential candidates, Selahattin Demirtaş, ran his presidential campaign from a prison cell in Edirne where he is on trial on terrorism charges. The government has either shuttered, bought or taken over newspapers and TV stations, transforming the vast majority of the nation’s media into a loyalist press. Thousands of people have been detained or dismissed since a coup attempt in 2016, a crackdown that has gone beyond the followers of Fethullah Gülen, the man accused of masterminding the coup from his exile in Pennsylvania, to dissidents of all stripes including academics, students who opposed military incursions into Syria, judges, bureaucrats and police and military officers. Nevertheless, there were few incidents of apparent electoral fraud, with the exception of the province of Urfa, where some apparent attempts to rig the vote were uncovered during the course of the day. Poll stations opened at 8am and closed at 5pm.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/erdogan-claims-victory-in-turkish-presidential-election,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/erdogan-claims-victory-in-turkish-presidential-election
2018-06-25T06:14:41Z,world,World news,Coconut-leaf plates on the table as Samoa looks beyond single-use plastics,"In a bid to protect the precious “blue Pacific” the Samoan government will ban all single-use plastic bags and straws by January next year. Styrofoam food containers and cups will also be banned once environmentally sustainable alternatives are sourced, the government said in a statement.
“A new era is in place for Samoa ... as we enhance our blue Pacific and join the global fight to restore our ocean and address damage caused by plastic,” said Ulu Bismarck Crawley, chief executive at the ministry of natural resources and environment. James Atherton of the Samoa Conservation Society told Radio NZ there was increasing research into sustainable alternatives to single-use plastic bags and food containers, including plates made from coconut leaves, which is found in abundance in the Pacific islands. Other research has identified hemp, chicken feathers and cassava as potential alternatives. A survey conducted by the ministry revealed a significant increase in waste from 26,000 tonnes a year in 2011 to 32,850 tonnes in 2017 – an increase of more than 20% in six years. It is estimated that Samoa generates about 8,869 tonnes of plastic a year, and that about 70% of the litter in urban coastal waters is made of plastic, which chokes mangrove systems, kills marine wildlife and pollutes many of the tourist island’s beaches and scenic areas. “This issue is too large for us to sit by without taking any action,” said Crawley. “By making these changes as a nation, our positive impact will be felt not only by us in Samoa, but also by our global community.” Last year prime minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi pledged at the United Nations ocean conference to crack down on plastic pollution, a key environmental threat facing numerous Pacific islands, many of whom are in the process of banning plastics or reducing plastic consumption. Mr Kosi Latu, director general of the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme, said: “We congratulate Samoa for taking bold action and working together to make changes that will benefit us all. “This will also have a positive impact as Samoa prepares for Pacific Games in 2019 in greening of the games. This could be the first plastic-free Pacific games.” In the 1950s the world made about 2m tonnes of plastic a year. That figure has now climbed to 330m tonnes a year – and is set to treble by 2050. Other countries to have banned or phased out single-use plastic bags include Kenya, Vanuatu, and some states in Australia. This article was amended on 27 June 2018. The original version referred to coconut fibres, rather than leaves, and suggested James Atherton said hemp, chicken feathers and cassava were plastic alternatives.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/samoa-ban-single-use-plastics,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/samoa-ban-single-use-plastics

The South Korean prime minister, Lee Nak-yon, said the two sides had discussed relocating 1,000 pieces of artillery North Korea has deployed close to the border. Most of those are aimed at Seoul, home to about 25m people. Despite the danger, it is a fact of life to which many in the city have become accustomed.
Military officers from the two sides met at a customs, immigration, and quarantine office in South Korea, just south of the demilitarised zone separating the countries. The meeting follows discussion held this month that focused on “eliminating the danger of war on the Korean peninsula” and were the first inter-Korea military talks in a decade. The talks were spurred by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s historic meeting with South Korean president Moon Jae-in in April, and seek to revive direct communication between the two militaries. If successful, there would be a western and eastern line of communication, using telephones and fax machines to ensure misunderstandings do not lead to violent clashes. The western line was suspended in 2016 after Seoul shut the Kaesong industrial complex, where South Korean companies hired North Korean workers. The closure was in response to a North Korean rocket launch. The eastern line was shut in 2011 in the wake of North Korea shelling an island in the South that killed two marines and two civilians. It was permanently severed by a wildfire in 2013. Both the eastern and western lines were established about 15 years ago. The inter-Korean military talks come days after the US and South Korea announced the indefinite suspension of marine training exercises, part of Donald Trump’s pledge to halt military drills after meeting Kim. The US is engaged in its own talks with North Korea over the repatriation of war dead from the 1950-53 Korean war. The US military has transported 100 wooden caskets to an area near the border with North Korea in the hope the remains can be returned as early as this week.

I’m Martin Farrer with the best news and views this Monday morning. Jeremy Corbyn faces some tough wrangling on two very thorny policy issues, starting today when MPs vote on the plans to build a third runway at Heathrow. Corbyn and his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, are firm opponents of the expansion, but their stance is being undercut by the Unite union leader, Len McCluskey, who has written to Labour MPs urging them to back the idea in today’s parliamentary vote. He says the multibillion-pound scheme will provide vital, unionised jobs for years to come. On the Tory side of the house, arch-runway critic Boris Johnson has run into flak because he will be out of the country for the vote. The Labour leader’s second headache comes in the more familiar form of Brexit as a group of party activists launch a pressure group to rally leftwing support for a “people’s vote” on a final Brexit deal. With Corbyn a conspicuous absentee on Saturday as 100,000 people marched in London calling for a second vote, the grassroots Labour for a People’s Vote group aims to force a vote on the issue at the party conference in September. * * *

What’s more, they’re top of their group and have already won more games this time (two) than they managed in the last two World Cups put together (one). Barney Ronay was in Nizhny Novgorod and he manages to find even more cause for optimism, hailing England’s “gloriously fun shellacking” of not-very-good opponents. But, as he says, England have still to play a half-decent opponent, and “could yet bomb out horribly”. Next up are Belgium on Wednesday for the right to top the group. * * * Visa review – Pressure is mounting for the Home Office to review the huge fees it charges for visa and immigration services as the fallout from the Windrush scandal continues to reverberate through Whitehall. David Bolt, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, has called for evidence as he launches an inquiry into the charges, which include a £3,250 levy for indefinite leave for an adult dependent relative and £1,330 for an adult naturalisation application. * * * Erdoğan triumphant – Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has struck a regal tone after winning Turkey’s presidential election, telling a victory rally in Istanbul that democracy was the winner and that the country was “an example for the rest of the world”. The official state news agency said that Erdoğan had won a 52.54% share of the national vote, while the opposition CHP party’s candidate, Muharrem İnce, had 30.7%. Erdoğan, who now has sweeping powers to dismiss ministers and rule by decree, said his government would continue the fight against terror, before leading the crowd in a chant of “one nation, one flag, one country, one state”. * * * Let it go – Buy-to-let landlords have forced house prices beyond the reach of at least 2 million families and must face curbs on tax breaks, a report by a Conservative thinktank recommends. It also calls for a stronger role for local councils and major reform of the planning system to allow communities rather than developers to lead the process. The report, written by Tory MP Neil O’Brien, says the balance between the rented and ownership sectors needed to change and that people needed to be discouraged from investing in buy-to-let properties. * * * “I’m a hate magnet” – Roseanne Barr has made a tearful apology for the racist tweet that prompted the end to the revival of her eponymous sitcom. In her first interview since the controversy, Barr recorded a podcast interview in which she says she “never would have wittingly called any black person a monkey”. But having admitted wrong, she complained that people had not accepted her excuse that she was under the influence of the sleep drug Ambien when she sent the tweet. “They don’t accept my apology, or explanation. And I’ve made myself a hate magnet.” World Cup England may have scored six, but perhaps none of their celebrations matched that of Panama fans when Felipe Baloy notched a consolation goal. “The whole country explodes in a shared cry,” writes Fernando Cuenco in Panama City. “Beer flies through the air ... Several thousand people jump, celebrate, kiss and hug while Felipe Baloy’s goal is repeated over and over again on a giant screen.” Elsewhere, Senegal and Japan kept alive their hopes of progressing from Group H with a 2-2 draw while a selection masterstroke from José Pékerman was rewarded with a performance in a 3-0 win over Poland. Groups A and B, including hosts Russia, Uruguay, Spain and Portugal, come to a conclusion later today, and the buildup has already begun. Lunchtime read: The deadly business of tobacco
As part of our ongoing series on the international tobacco trade, health editor Sarah Boseley and photographer David Levene have been to Malawi where children are obliged to carry out backbreaking work on the family plots. Child labour in the industry is “rampant”, according to the International Labour Organization, with an estimated 1.3 million workers under the age of 14. One of them, Tiyamike Phiri, had to give up her schooling to help out with weeding and building earth banks for the plants in the baking African heat. Tobacco companies, such as the ultra-profitable British firm BAT, say they are working to end the use of child labour. But our investigation shows that the use of child labour is actually on the rise. Sport An unbeaten and freakishly nerveless century from Jos Buttler came to the rescue for England, as he almost singlehandedly secured a nailbiting one-wicket victory over Australia and thus a first 5-0 whitewash of their historic rivals in any format. Eddie Jones has been told there is no absolute guarantee he will remain as England’s head coach until the 2019 Rugby World Cup despite his team’s victory in the third Test against South Africa. Lewis Hamilton won the French Grand Prix to retake the F1 championship lead before hitting out at title rival Sebastian Vettel’s “tap on the wrist” at Circuit Paul Ricard. And England showed the best of rugby league in a dazzling win over New Zealand in Denver that was a shot in the arm for the game. Business After the Bank of International Settlements warned that a US-China trade war could spark a global downturn, Asian shares took fright and oil also dropped more than 1.5%. The US dollar dropped as well but the pound was flat at $1.326 and €1.138. The papers
“Campaigners call for action over ‘disgraceful’ immigration fees”, is the Guardian’s main story today. The Mirror has “Britain’s plastic shame” about an investigation into bottles being sent to Bangladesh for children to sort. The Mail leads with a story on “Shocking trade in stolen UK passports”, and the Times has reports of “30,000 children in gangs”. The Telegraph splashes with “Back Heathrow expansion to boost Brexit, MPs told”, the FT has “Beijing eases capital reserve rules to soften US tariff pain” and the Express report on “Police fury at Trump’s visit”. But the most gleeful headline is the one on the front page of the Sun, which celebrates England’s 6-1 victory over Panama in the World Cup with a full-page picture of the celebrating team and the headline: “We believe in miracles ...

2018-06-25T05:00:53Z,world,World news,Tobacco: activist investors pressure £20bn companies over child labour,"The world’s biggest tobacco companies are coming under mounting pressure over child labour and working conditions in fields globally, from Zimbabwe to North Carolina. The firms are facing intense scrutiny from unions, NGOs and academics.
While all have child labour policies in place and have formed organisations such as the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing Foundation (recognised by the UN), their actions have brought little change and are largely cosmetic, claims Marty Otañez, associate professor at the University of Colorado Denver. He has been working on the subject for 20 years and has done research in Malawi, Bolivia, Argentina, Tanzania, India and Kenya. “There is a disconnect between what company representatives say they do and what they actually do,” he alleged. “In every segment during the tobacco production process, you find different magnitudes of child labour.”
Otañez said governments were often complicit because they did not want to deter overseas investors and relied on tobacco tax revenues. Tobacco companies wouldn’t be able to maintain their current rate of profits without the use of cheap labour, he added. British American Tobacco (BAT), which became the world’s biggest listed tobacco company following its $49bn (£42bn) takeover of Reynolds American last year, the Marlboro maker Philip Morris International (PMI), the Virginia-based Altria, Japan Tobacco International (JTI), and Britain’s Imperial Brands made combined profits before tax of nearly £20bn last year.
A report entitled Bitter Harvest published in April by Human Rights Watch (HRW) said there was widespread child labour in tobacco farms in Zimbabwe, where multinationals such as BAT, JTI and Imperial buy tobacco. The NGO said this was consistent with its findings in Kazakhstan, the US and Indonesia. A 2016 report by the not-for-profit organisation Swedwatch revealed widespread child labour across BAT operations in Bangladesh. BAT said its follow-up review last year found no evidence of child labour in Bangladesh, and that its main supplier in Zimbabwe, Northern Tobacco, would undergo an external review this year by AB Sustain.
The HRW report is based on interviews with 64 small-scale tobacco farmers and 61 hired workers in Zimbabwe, one of the world’s largest producers of tobacco. It reported many farmers and workers, including children as young as 11, complained of symptoms consistent with acute nicotine poisoning, such as sickness, headaches and dizziness, from absorbing nicotine through their skin while handling tobacco plants. They had not been told how to prevent and treat the condition, HRW said. Workers also handled pesticides without adequate protective equipment, the report said. All the tobacco firms say they have training policies. At BAT’s annual general meeting (AGM) in London in April, the company’s board was grilled over its record on child labour. Sunniva Guatvik from the UK responsible-investment charity ShareAction said the two studies “show a gap between BAT’s policy commitments and continued, severe impacts on children in tobacco cultivation communities”. The BAT chairman, Richard Burrows, said the board was “very sympathetic” to the issues raised. But, he added, “you will find BAT has not got any questions to answer in respect of these issues”. He insisted: “Human rights is something we take very seriously as a company and as a board.” Guatvik asked BAT to publish more detailed information on how the situation was being monitored. Burrows said the company was meeting all the objectives set out by ShareAction, but the charity told the Guardian this was not the case.
Hazel Cheeseman, director of the anti-smoking charity Ash, also weighed in at the AGM, asking the company to clarify its position on child labour. BAT said its policy explicitly prohibited anyone under the age of 18 from undertaking tasks that involve direct contact with green tobacco, but it allowed those under 18 to carry out “non-hazardous tasks associated with tobacco growing”. Jacqueline Baroncini of the International Union of Food and Allied Workers asked how the company could be sure that no children under 18 were working on farms supplying tobacco to BAT. Burrows reiterated that the programmes in place and the audits carried out assured him the policy was adhered to. Otañez proposes an action plan that calls for tobacco companies and leaf buyers to allow better monitoring of their supply chains; fairer labour arrangements on farms, including collective bargaining rights; and help for farmers to switch away from tobacco to growing food crops.
In its report, HRW said most of the tobacco companies it had contacted now had policies banning children from activities involving direct contact with green tobacco. However, none of the companies prohibited children from handling dried tobacco, which has been linked to respiratory symptoms, such as coughing, difficulty breathing or tightness in the chest. BAT told the Guardian that it does not allow under 18s to handle dried tobacco when there is a risk to their health. Baldemar Velasquez, who in 1967 set up the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (Floc), which represents 10,000 migrant workers across several US states such as Kentucky and North Carolina, said the union had been talking to BAT for the last four years about improving pay and working conditions for those working in tobacco fields. “We as farm workers do the most arduous jobs in this industry,” he told shareholders at the AGM.
Floc is pushing for collective bargaining, higher tobacco pricing, better accommodation and better shower facilities for farm workers. Some farms have showers, but not enough, Velasquez told the Guardian after the AGM. “There are three to four showers for 30 to 40 workers, and the heating unit runs out after two to three showers and it takes a couple of hours to heat up again. So workers wait or don’t shower at all.” Velasquez, 71, started working on farms at the age of six, picking fruit and later tobacco – one of hundreds of thousands of children who joined their migrant parents working long hours in the fields in the US. He stressed the “need for proper bathing facilities to wash nicotine off in order not to get the green tobacco sickness”. A BAT spokesperson said Reynolds American took farm worker welfare “extremely seriously” and was committed to ensuring its supply chain was fully compliant with relevant laws. “All farm workers have access to washing facilities, and Reynolds American also ensures that workers receive the required training and personal protective equipment to protect them from green tobacco sickness.”
Farm labourers have no collective bargaining rights in the US, and child labour is legal on farms. Children as young as 12 can start working unlimited hours outside of school, and children of any age can work on small or family-owned tobacco farms. Velasquez said the stagnant tobacco price was a major problem, arguing that if farms were paid a fair price for their tobacco, they could invest in better facilities. The five big tobacco companies said child labour was unacceptable and that they were working hard to stop it happening in their supply chain. They said they were encouraging farmers to grow other crops, but added that tobacco gave farms a better income.
A BAT spokesperson said: “We agree contracts with farmers at the beginning of each growing season – this not only guarantees that we buy their tobacco crop at a fair price, but also ensures farmers have a regular and secure income throughout the season, protecting them from market fluctuations.” He added: “Growing tobacco for BAT is something the farmers we work with choose to do, and 90% of our farmers also grow other crops such as fruit, wheat and cotton.” JTI said a contracted farmer in Malawi would earn three times more harvesting one hectare of tobacco compared with one hectare of groundnuts. Altria, which sources 70% of its leaf in the US, told the Guardian it was committed to addressing concerns about child labour and had taken “significant steps”. It said last year it had distributed 75,000 isolation gowns to tackle risks of green tobacco sickness and that its contracts required growers to comply with laws and regulations that protect workers. PMI said it had been “making progress” in tackling complex issues on farms supplying to the company and had been working with partners to make improvements for workers. Contractors in the US must meet labour requirements, it added. International labour standards state that children under 18 should be prohibited from hazardous work. According to the latest International Labour Organization estimates, 152 million children are still involved in child labour around the world. The vast majority, 108 million children (71%), are working in the agricultural sector, including tobacco growing.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/tobacco-companies-child-labour-pressure,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/tobacco-companies-child-labour-pressure
2018-06-25T05:00:52Z,world,World news,Child labour rampant in tobacco industry,"Child labour in tobacco is rampant and on the increase in poorer countries, a major Guardian investigation can reveal, despite claims by multibillion-dollar companies that they are tackling the issue.
Evidence from three continents shows how children aged 14 and under are kept out of school and employed in hard and sometimes harmful physical labour to produce the tobacco leaf that fills cigarettes sold internationally, including in the UK, US and mainland Europe. Families are trapped in generational poverty while salaries at the top of the industry run to millions of dollars a year. The companies say they monitor child labour and remove children from the fields to go to school, but experts have told the Guardian that the numbers are going up, not down, as tobacco growing increases in Africa and Asia.
The consequences for children are lifelong. “I wanted to be a nurse,” said one 14-year-old girl in Malawi, who spends her days weeding under a hot sun with a heavy hoe. Families see no option but to use their children in the fields as unpaid labour. Many are in debt to landowners and landlords and have to stay on from one season to the next, unable to break the cycle of deprivation.
“No effective actions have been taken to reverse this scenario,” said Vera Da Costa e Silva, head of the secretariat of the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, a key body tackling an industry that kills more than 7 million people a year. “What happens is that tobacco farming gives its profits to the industry but gives very low incomes to the tobacco growers themselves.” The tobacco firms say they are doing everything they can to end exploitative child labour. But it is a scandal for which the multinational companies have a direct responsibility, she said. “There is a double burden – the burden of child labour itself and the burden of working on a deadly product that ultimately affects the children themselves.” Silva said about 1.3 million children a year were working in tobacco fields in 2011 and, according to the UN’s International Labour Organization (ILO), the numbers are rising with a shift in tobacco growing from some of the better-off countries to some of the poorer. It declined between 2000 and 2013 in Turkey, Brazil and the United States, said the report to the organisation’s governing body in February 2017, but increased in others, such as Argentina, India and Zimbabwe.
Given that child labour in agriculture occurs more often in low-income countries, the ILO report said, “this shift in production may have resulted in increased child labour and other decent work deficits in tobacco production. Although there are no estimates of the number of child labourers in tobacco globally, surveys indicate that in impoverished tobacco growing communities, child labour is rampant.”
The Guardian’s investigation found: In Malawi: Children being taken out of school to weed the tobacco fields and harvest the leaves by parents who live in dire poverty. Some families in straw huts are paid nothing for 10 months until the tobacco crop is sold after the harvest. They live on a pail of maize a week provided by their landlords and must raise money to mill it by extra piecework in the fields, often also done by the children. In Mexico: The Guardian saw children working in seven of 10 plantations visited in March in the Nayarit region, despite progress being made by industry and government to tackle the problem and keep children in school. In Indonesia: The Guardian visited tobacco farming communities in Lombok and talked to child workers, including a 14-year-old who told of chest health problems her family linked to working in the fields. The US Department of Labor lists 16 countries where children are suspected to work in tobacco. Human rights organisations including Human Rights Watch have documented child labor in the tobacco fields in Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Brazil and most recently Zimbabwe.
Experts say the very low prices paid to farmers in countries like Malawi make child labour inevitable. BAT and JTI tobacco firms say light work in the fields that does not affect health or education is acceptable for 13-15 year olds. Campaigners say they should not be anywhere near tobacco before they are 18. The average income of a tenant farmer in Kasunga, one of the biggest tobacco-growing areas of Malawi, for 10 months of work was 223,710 kwacha (roughly $380 or £286 at current rates) according to a study in 2017 by the Centre for Social Concern, a Malawian NGO.
Each kilo of tobacco is estimated to provide enough for 1,200 cigarettes; tenant farmers in Kasungu last year earned 200 kawacha (30 cents or 23p) per kilo when the crop was sold. Tenant farmers are at the bottom of the tobacco food chain. They agree to work for a year for a contract farmer who has land, which he may own or have leased. That farmer’s contract is with one of the big leaf-buying companies – Alliance One, Universal (in Malawi known as Limbe Leaf) or Japan Tobacco International (JTI). The leaf-buying companies agree to purchase tobacco from their contract farmers and supply seed, fertiliser, pesticide and tools. The leaf buyers say they tell them not to employ children. Alliance One said the elimination of child labour is a “top priority”; Universal said it is committed to fighting child labour. The leaf-buyers are fulfilling orders from cigarette manufacturers – British American Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco.
The tobacco giants have their own corporate social responsibility schemes. They say they monitor child labour and build wells or schools. But Professor Marty Otañez, of the University of Colorado in Denver, an anthropologist who has studied tobacco farming in Malawi for many years, said the welfare projects were “pushing out goodwill on behalf of tobacco companies to address some of the problems but avoid the harder issues of leaf prices and living and earnings”.
All of the four major companies say they are doing what they can. “BAT takes the issue of child labour extremely seriously and agrees that children must never be exploited, exposed to danger or denied an education,” said a spokesperson. “We do not employ children in any of our operations worldwide and make it clear to all of our contracted farmers and suppliers that exploitative child labour will not be tolerated.” Imperial Tobacco said: “Child labour is unacceptable and we make every effort to stop it happening in our supply chain.” PMI called child labour an unacceptable reality. “We are committed to eliminating child labor and other labor abuses wherever we source tobacco,” said Miguel Coleta, the company’s sustainability officer. “We have been working to tackle the root causes of child labor head-on and have achieved a global reduction of child labor incidents on contracted farms over time. We welcome continued systematic scrutiny of our efforts and recognize we cannot succeed alone. This requires serious and lasting efforts by all stakeholders, including government and civil society.” JTI also said child labour was endemic to agriculture but had been decreasing in areas where it directly contracted farmers. “The reality is that child labor stems from a combination of social, economic and regulatory causes. At JTI, we don’t pretend to be able to solve the problem of child labor on our own, but we are doing our utmost to play our part in solving the problem, working with others,” the company said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/revealed-child-labor-rampant-in-tobacco-industry,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/revealed-child-labor-rampant-in-tobacco-industry

2018-06-25T04:23:30Z,world,World news,China blocks HBO after John Oliver parody of Xi Jinping,"HBO’s website has been blocked in China after censors on Chinese social media platform Weibo banned mentions of John Oliver following the British comedian’s parody of Chinese president Xi Jinping.
According to the anti-censorship and monitoring group Greatfire.org, HBO’s website was completely blocked within China as of Saturday, days after media reports emerged that Weibo had censored new posts mentioning Oliver or his HBO show Last Week Tonight. After a wide-ranging 20-minute segment 17 June in which Oliver called Xi the “creepy uncle who imprisons 800,000 people in his basement”, the Twitter-like service blocked new posts related to Oliver as well as searches for the show’s Chinese name, Shangzhou jinye xiu. Attempts to access HBO’s website from within China were unsuccessful on Monday. The website for HBO Asia, a Singapore-based broadcast network that airs HBO content in China through Dingjijuchang, a Tencent TV subscription service, also appeared to be blocked. The subscription does not include all HBO shows. HBO did not respond to requests for comment on the censorship of Oliver on Weibo. Tencent was not immediately available. His segment on Xi could not be found on Chinese streaming sites where other episodes of Last Week Tonight have been uploaded by individual users. Youtube, which hosts clips of the show, has long been blocked in China. Any blocking of HBO’s website in China is not likely to have a huge impact. Access to HBO’s often salacious content has always been spotty in China, with Chinese broadcasters heavily censoring shows like Game of Thrones. Most Chinese users watch HBO through virtual private networks, or VPNs. In the show, Oliver made fun of the Chinese president’s apparent sensitivity over comparisons of his figure with that of Winnie the Pooh. Images of the AA Milne character, used to mock Xi, have been censored in China.
“If your face even remotely resembles that of a beloved cartoon character, the smart move here is to lean in,” Oliver said, showing an image of his own face next to that of The Lion King’s Zazu, a red-billed hornbill. Oliver also took a serious tone in the show, criticising Xi for the removal of term limits from the Chinese constitution, the use of political re-education camps in the Muslim province of Xinjiang, and a crackdown on civil society. Oliver noted the continued house arrest of Liu Xia, wife of Chinese dissident and nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo who died last year while serving an 11-year prison sentence. “While China has never been known as a haven for free expression, [Xi] has clamped down noticeably on any form of dissent whatsoever,” Oliver said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/china-blocks-hbo-after-john-oliver-parody-of-xi-jinping,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/china-blocks-hbo-after-john-oliver-parody-of-xi-jinping
2018-06-25T04:00:50Z,world,World news,"Trial of doctor, 85, puts Spain in dock over ‘stolen babies’","An 85-year-old doctor accused of abducting a newborn girl from her mother almost half a century ago will appear in court in Madrid this week, becoming the first person to stand trial over Spain’s long and infamous “stolen babies” scandal. Thousands of families are thought to have been caught up in the illegal practice, which began shortly after the end of the Spanish civil war and continued until well after the death of the dictator, Francisco Franco, in 1975. Some estimates suggested that as many as 300,000 babies may have been taken from their birth mothers and placed with other families who supported the Franco regime. Among those women targeted were single mothers, those with “degenerate” political views or those from poor backgrounds. Eduardo Vela, who worked as a gynaecologist at the San Ramón clinic in the Spanish capital, is alleged to have separated Inés Madrigal from her biological mother in the spring of 1969 and given her to the 46-year-old woman who was falsely certified as her birth mother and who would raise her. Vela faces an 11-year sentence if convicted of unlawful detention, falsifying official documents and certifying a non-existent birth. A nun who worked with him at the clinic had been due to face trial five years ago but died days before she was set to appear in court. Madrigal, who is now 49, says her mother told her the truth when she turned 18 and had supported her daughter’s efforts to discover more about her origins until she died two years ago aged 93. “I always say she didn’t give birth to me but I was born in her heart,” Madrigal told the Guardian. “She lived to look after me and see me happy.” Madrigal, a railway worker and president of the Murcia branch of the SOS Stolen Babies association, said that she did not expect the two-day trial to yield the answers she had spent years searching for. “Obviously I don’t think that Eduardo Vela is going to tell me the truth,” she said. “He’s not going to tell me who my mother is or about the circumstances in which I was taken from her. I’m not so naive as to believe that’s going to happen but I’d love it if we could get the records of all the women who gave birth at the San Ramón clinic. But that probably won’t happen and I have to resign myself to reality. I’m just hoping there’s a favourable sentence.” Far more important, said Madrigal, was the trial’s potential to give rise to similar actions and see thousands of shelved cases reopened: “This is a really important issue because, for 60 years, we were the baby supermarket for Europe and for South America, not just Spain.” Madrigal’s lawyer, Guillermo Peña, said that while Spanish police had known about the scandal since at least 1981, years of cover-ups had ensured that the activities at the San Ramón clinic remained opaque to this day. “We know what the East German border police and Stasi did,” he said. “But when it comes to the stolen babies, we’re talking about a more closely guarded secret than the elixir of eternal youth. There’s just no way of finding certain files and records.” Peña said Madrigal’s case offered Spain a chance to move past the sociological and psychological barriers of the past and recognise what had happened to so many families. “It’s about making sure that nobody can doubt that or or say it was made up by some mothers and fathers who couldn’t get over the death of their children,” he said. “No. This happened here. And if there’s one conviction, many more could follow.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/trial-of-doctor-85-put-spain-in-dock-over-stolen-babies,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/trial-of-doctor-85-put-spain-in-dock-over-stolen-babies
2018-06-25T02:02:04Z,world,World news,Turkey elections 2018: Erdoğan declared winner – as it happened,"We are wrapping up the live coverage of today’s presidential election in Turkey, an event the Guardian’s Kareem Shaheen called “arguably the most important election in Turkey’s modern history”. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been declared the winner of Sunday’s presidential election. Addressing thousands of supporters in Ankara, Erdoğan said that democracy was the winner of the election and that Turkey was “an example for the rest of the world”.
The official Anadolu Agency reported that, with 99% of votes counted, Erdoğan had won a 52.54% share of the national vote, while the opposition CHP party’s candidate, Muharrem İnce, was on 30.68%. Erdoğan’s victory means will now assume an office imbued with sweeping executive powers that voters narrowly approved in a constitutional referendum last year, including the power to issue decrees with the force of law, appoint the cabinet and vice-presidents as well as senior judges. İnce, a charismatic physics teacher from secularist opposition party CHP, has announced he will give a speech at noon Monday local time. He did not immediately concede defeat on Sunday night and disputed ongoing tallies throughout the day, urging supporters to stay at polling stations and continue monitoring the counts.
The pro-Kurdish party, known as the HDP, took 11.67% of the vote, passing the 10% threshold to enter parliament for a second consecutive term. This makes them the second-largest opposition party and will dilute the majority of Erdoğan’s ruling party, the AKP. But the AKP’s majority will stay in place, after a surprise showing by the AKP’s nationalist allies. We will continue to monitor the situation in Turkey and the impact of Erdoğan’s new executive powers in the coming weeks and months.

2018-06-25T01:19:53Z,world,World news,'New Zealand wants you': the problem with tech at the edge of the world,"At the end of 2017, an unusual job advertisement appeared in New Zealand. Responsibilities included planning for future workforce needs, responding to “emerging and disruptive technologies” and improving digital access. The salary was $400,000. The advert wasn’t placed by a Silicon Valley tech giant, but the government seeking the nation’s first ever “chief technology officer”. Tellingly, 60 people applied for the job, but none had the “international mana” – or power – the government was looking for. The advert was reissued and tweaked to make it more appealing to overseas candidates. The lack of international interest in New Zealand as a hub of emerging technologies is something Jacinda Ardern hopes to change. The prime minister wants to transform sleepy, agrarian New Zealand into a nation that is “leading change at the edge of the world”, a place where “pioneers push boundaries to create models for the rest of the world to follow”. The creation of the CTO role and a new “global impact visa” specifically to lure entrepreneurs, investors and tech start-ups are key parts of that push.
“If you want to make a positive global impact,” pleads a video for the government’s global impact visa. “New Zealand wants you.” Despite employing a mere 120,000 people (23% of whom are women), the tech and innovation sector is already the third-largest contributor to the country’s economy and, by 2025, the government aims to make it the second-largest earner. Despite the bold talk – including the slogan “this is the place of the possible” – investment still lags astronomically far behind the two biggest earners of agriculture and tourism. However, that might be about to change. Green MP Gareth Hughes recently told the Spinoff: “There is a limit to how many tourists we can cram into Fiordland with the infrastructure. There is a limit to how many cows we can have in our paddocks, and we are seeing that in the state of our waterways. There is no limit to the export of software, services and intellectual property in creative industries.” ‘Being odd is culturally acceptable’ But drawing talent to the South Pacific nation more than 10,000km (6,000 miles) from Silicon Valley remains difficult. When they do come, tech professionals find themselves in a very small pond, where you might bump into the highest government figures during a stroll down Wellington’s Lambton Quay. Denise Chapman Weston was lured from the US by the prospect of collaborating with Weta Workshop; the conceptual design and practical effects wing of Peter Jackson’s now famous Weta empire. One of the first recipients of the new “global impact visas”, Chapman Weston has the suitably Silicon Valley title of “director of imagination” and is a child psychologist and “playologist”.
She says she has been labelled a “brash American” more times than she can remember since arriving, but reminds herself that her job is to lend some of that brashness to Kiwis; whose national character she describes as humble to a fault. “As an inventor, or a creator you have to be pretty bold; you come in and you have sort of, a tall-poppy way of doing things. But being a tall poppy isn’t a good thing here – they get cut off,” says Chapman Weston. “But being odd is culturally acceptable in New Zealand, so how do you combine being odd with being more outspoken and assertive and sometimes aggressive about your business needs?” Two guys in a garage Three months before the 2016 US elections, New Zealanders Benjamin Markby and Tom Bellamy set up a games studio in suburban Auckland Green, hungry and with nothing to lose, Markby and Bellamy designed a mobile game tailored for the global market; Jrump, in which players have to build walls for Donald Trump to jump over and make the galaxy “great” again. The game hit the zeitgeist when Trump was elected president, and has been downloaded approximately 650,000 times.
“We went to the International Mobile Gaming Awards, which is kind of like the Oscars of our industry. Candy Crush was there, Pokemon Go was there – and two guys from a garage in New Zealand,” says Markby. Along with Jackson’s Weta empire, Auckland’s Soul Machines is another New Zealand tech success story, a company that has designed a virtual nervous system to make AI more empathic and relatable, and whose technology is now used by European banks, Sony and IBM Watson. Shona Grundy, Soul Machines’ director of consumer business development, says although the new government has taken a giant leap forward in prioritising the tech and innovation sector, investors are thin on the ground.
“It is crucial the government focus on this now because they are too late already,” says Grundy. “The government believes that 40% of jobs will go [to AI] within the next ten years. I think its going to be a lot faster than that. I think for the first time they are actually doing the right things, and making the right noises, but they need to move urgently, or New Zealand will get left behind.” In late May, Wellington hosted Tech Week and it is party time for the nerds. Jessica Manins, the CEO of interactive VR/AR studio Mixt and Tech Week collaborator, is working the crowd. Manins says she has cultivated an American persona in the tech world – a fake confidence that doesn’t come so easily to Kiwis. Her warm laugh pings around the crowded room experimenting with what comes next; the winter night closing in as they talk earnestly about how to solve the world’s problems from the edge of the world. “That is the most important thing, how do we create a better future for our people?” says Manins, when asked what differentiates tech and innovation in New Zealand. “We do think global, because we have to. We don’t plan to build something just for the community, because there’s only 4.7 million people.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/new-zealand-wants-you-the-problem-with-tech-at-the-edge-of-the-world,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/new-zealand-wants-you-the-problem-with-tech-at-the-edge-of-the-world
2018-06-24T23:01:44Z,world,World news,Birmingham and Hyndburn ranked as UK areas with worst food hygiene,"Birmingham city council and Hyndburn borough council have been ranked as the worst areas in the UK for poor standards of hygiene in their cafes and restaurants, for the second year running, a new analysis has revealed. Consumer group Which? said the enforcement regime was buckling under “huge strain”, with under-resourced local authorities struggling to cope with soaring complaints from the public – about dirty conditions and food poisoning, for example – and facing an increase in their workload because of Brexit. Using official data collected by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), Which? analysed and ranked 390 local authorities across the UK. The benchmarks it used were the percentage of food businesses deemed to be at “high and medium risk” that were compliant with food hygiene standards; the percentage of premises opened but not visited or rated for risk; and interventions needed that had actually been carried out.
Birmingham had a poor record for carrying out inspections within 28 days of a food business opening, with 16% of the city’s more than 8,000 food businesses still to be rated. In addition, 43% of Birmingham’s high and medium-risk food businesses did not meet compliance standards. The Lancashire borough of Hyndburn, where Accrington is the largest town, was the second worst area in the UK for food hygiene in 2016–17. While 98% of its businesses had been rated for risk, just two in five of its medium and high-risk food businesses met food hygiene standards, compared with 98% in Harrogate, which is about an hour away in North Yorkshire. For a second year top of the table for food hygiene was the Erewash borough council in East Derbyshire. It carried out planned interventions on all failing premises, and an 97% of its medium and high-risk establishments proved compliant with hygiene standards. “When it comes to food, British consumers expect the very best standards for themselves and their families” said Alex Neill, managing director of home products and services at Which? “But our enforcement regime is under huge strain, just as Brexit threatens to add to the responsibilities of struggling local authorities. “Effective food enforcement must be a government priority, including robust checks on imports as well as cooperation with the EU and other countries on food risks.” The Birmingham city council said it inspected the second highest number of premises and closed more than any other English local authority. Mark Croxford, the head of environmental health, said: “The quality of food businesses in Birmingham is not a measure or reflection of the council’s performance. I am surprised and disappointed to see Which? have made the same mistake as they have done in previous years, in failing to engage with local authorities to produce a meaningful report.” Hyndburn claimed that 92.5% of its food businesses were now fully complaint and it had taken “significant strides to improve food hygiene”. Responsibility for enforcing food safety falls to environmental health teams within local authorities, overseen by the FSA and Food Standards Scotland.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/birmingham-and-hyndburn-ranked-as-uk-areas-with-worst-food-hygiene,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/birmingham-and-hyndburn-ranked-as-uk-areas-with-worst-food-hygiene
2018-06-24T20:25:54Z,world,World news,New York gay pride parade marches toward 50th year with new purpose,"A detachment of “black dykes on trikes” were to the fore as the New York pride march began on Sunday, a year short of the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, the event now agreed to have created the modern gay rights movement.
The 2018 march was led by the tennis legend Billie Jean King and the transgender advocate Tyler Ford. The actor Cynthia Nixon, a contender to be governor of New York state, was present, as was her rival Andrew Cuomo, as thousands of marchers in rainbow colors celebrated LGBT identity in Greenwich Village and up the canyon of Fifth Avenue. Many marchers said that the gay movement had begun to find a new purpose, after a succession of legislative victories removed many of the most overt aspects of sexual or gender discrimination in American society. “I would argue that our coming out has never been more important than it is right now,” Nixon said in a video message. “Whether we are lesbian or gay or transgender or Muslim or Mexican or any one of a number other categories I could name, we are allies united by our otherness.” The candidate neatly captured the newfound purpose for a march that some say has come close in recent years to becoming just another commercialised “event”, akin to Halloween or Valentine’s Day. The vice-president, Mike Pence, has supported gay conversion therapy. Donald Trump has pushed for a ban on transgender people in the military. The presence of such men in the White House has given the movement new energy, said Danielle Diaz, visiting with girlfriends from Peekskill and standing outside the Stonewall Inn.
“Pence does not support gay rights at all,” Diaz said. “From the beginning, gay pride has been a protest – against police brutality, against violence, against [violence against] LGBT people, against black people, it’s always stood for what’s right. So this year it’s against Trump, and against border policy for sure … and all the craziness that’s happening.” Diaz added: “We want everybody to feel accepted and welcome no matter what they are or where they’re from or what they identify as.” Other attendees said victories such as the legalisation of same-sex marriage in 2015 did not necessarily mean parity had been secured. This month, the supreme court ruled in favor of a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, on religious grounds. “Even though we have gay marriage, we still have people who don’t want to bake wedding cakes for us,” said David Jones, from the Bronx. “So if we bat our eye, it could all go backwards and that’s not where we want to go.” Jones’s niece, Tiffany Baskerville, said she did not identify as LGBT. But the key was to speak out, she said, as an activist. “It’s not like, ‘Hey, we want a gay president.’ It’s like we want somebody who can understand and speak for everybody. We’re not just gay first, but human first.” Pamela Meyer, from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, said she had not had the good luck to be gay. She was visiting to support her gay sisters and brothers. “I think straights are incredibly stupid about a lot of stuff,” she said. “Race, gender, everything. They got it all and they want to keep it.”
Others, however, claimed a paradox: that by reducing the concept of gay pride to a march, an anthem and a rainbow flag for people from all sections of society to support, a sense of community had become undone. “I miss the days of the bars, with hundreds of our people in one location,” said Jim Cook, from Pennsylvania. “Now a gay bar is like any straight bar. Mainstream. With all the equality and all the rights it just seems like we lost a little of our identity. Sometimes it feels like we’ve become straight.” Among slightly younger gay men, like Julian Cavalier, the messages were more specific. “I love drag,” he said, “I love everything that drag stands for. It’s outlet. It’s our way to feel accepted. Drag means acceptance.” Street vendors with rainbow flags and large buttons carrying slogans said pride was good for business, bringing in at least $1,000 in the day. As Sylvester’s I Need You blared from a nearby boombox, Anna Thomas, 25, a bisexual woman from New Jersey, said gay pride in 2018 meant the culmination of everything the movement had accomplished. “There’s still work to be done,” she said, “but I like it that gay, straight, bi, trans, confused, everybody comes together here. It’s a beautiful spirit. You can get laid, but I’m more here for the party.”
As the lesbian bikers on their trikes and hogs made their way down Christopher Street, some in attendance wondered whether the location would mean as much in 10 years’ time as it did 10 or 20 years ago. “Italians no longer live in Little Italy,” said Sean Edwards. “Will gays still live in the West Village? You don’t have to live in the West Village to be safe now. So will gay pride just become symbolic like St Patrick’s Day?” It was beautiful, he said, to see the utopian vision of humanity expressed by the march, on one day a year at least: “Everybody gets to be their truest self.” The age range of attendees was wide. Tasha Georgiades, 11, said she had come along so she could “wear the rainbow colors”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/new-york-gay-pride-parade-marches-toward-50th-year-with-new-purpose,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/new-york-gay-pride-parade-marches-toward-50th-year-with-new-purpose
2018-06-24T19:02:01Z,world,World news,"Migration is threat to EU free travel area, says Italian prime minister","Italy has warned the future of the EU’s border-free travel zone is at stake as it sought to ease the pressure on Mediterranean countries arising from hosting refugees and migrants. Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, was speaking at a mini-EU summit in Brussels, where he said a plan from his government presented at the summit represented a paradigm shift in dealing with migration. But his ambitious move to change what he called obsolete EU rules that govern who is responsible for asylum claimants is likely to encounter opposition from other countries. The 10-point plan by his new populist government revives many ideas proposed by previous Italian governments, such as calling on all EU member states to share responsibility for migrants rescued at sea, and countries being docked EU funds if they refuse to take in refugees. Leaders from 16 EU countries put on a show of unity, as they left an emergency summit in Brussels on Sunday. The unorthodox meeting, boycotted by several EU countries, was called to shore up the conservative coalition government of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, which is riven by a row over migration. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the talks had been “frank and open,” although they had not resulted in “any concrete consequences or conclusions”. Sunday’s ad-hoc meeting sets the stage for a long-planned gathering of all EU leaders on Thursday, where it will be harder to mask Europe’s deep divisions on migration. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, can be expected to repeat his fierce opposition to migrant quotas, a policy opposed by other central European countries. The latest meeting was not only a lifeline for Merkel, but an attempt to save the EU’s 26-country border-free travel zone, seen as one of the EU’s crowning achievements. Before the meeting had even begun, divisions were on display, as Italy and Malta traded insults over which nation was responsible for a boat of 234 migrants adrift in international waters. In a stark reminder of the issues at stake, the NGO rescue mission Lifeline was refused permission to dock at Italy, while Malta sent it back to Italian waters. Ministers from Malta and Italy argued on Twitter over which country was acting in a humane way towards the ship. Meanwhile, a Danish ship, the Alexander Maersk, was waiting off Sicily’s coast for a port to disembark more than 100 people it had rescued. Arriving at the summit, Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, sought to defuse the row, saying it was not a time for finger-pointing as he advised against “building a wall even on the high seas”. Urging fellow leaders to take operational decisions, he said later: “There are people at sea right now. We are in a situation where we don’t take decisions in the coming days the situation will escalate.” The situation echoes the plight of the Aquarius, a rescue boat of 630 migrants that eventually docked in Spain last week, after being turned away by Italy. Diplomats from France, Spain, Italy and Malta held intense talks about each country taking in people from Lifeline. Meanwhile Sánchez, called on “comrades” in other member states to help Spain, following a recent spike in arrivals. In its 10-point plan, Rome is seeking to break the link between the country that rescues migrants and the country obliged to process asylum claims. Under current rules, an EU country is responsible for processing the asylum claims of all new arrivals, which has put enormous pressure on Mediterranean states, especially Italy and Greece. The Italian plan called on every EU country to set a quota for economic migrants and said migrant centres were needed in other countries. Italy also backs the idea of offshore migrant camps in north Africa to process asylum claims of people rescued at sea. Although the idea remains sketchy and no African countries have agreed to host the centres, the idea generates far more consensus among EU leaders than how to manage people once they reach Europe. Merkel played down expectations for a breakthrough at Thursday’s summit, adding that countries have to see “how can we help each other without always having to wait for all 28, but by thinking what’s important to whom”. Instead of difficult overall deals among all member states, she said it was “also about bi- and trilateral agreements for mutual benefit”.
Germany’s hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, has threatened to turn migrants away at the border, unless there is an EU-wide agreement by early July to better control secondary movements. Many believe that if Germany closes its border in a bid to stop the arrival of migrants from Italy, other countries would soon follow, leading to the collapse of the open-border Schengen zone. “If we don’t have a genuine solution on the migration issue, then Schengen is dead,” said a diplomatic source, who added: “I honestly think that this meeting is not the best way to tackle the divisions.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said there was a political crisis over migration and urged Europe to defend values of human rights. “Every time we have betrayed our values we have created the worst,” he said. Echoing Merkel, he also raised the prospect of some member states acting alone, if it proved impossible to find agreement between all 28. “It can be cooperation between the 28 or cooperation between some states who decide between themselves.” Reviving the core Europe idea is likely to prove controversial, especially with four central European countries that were not attending Sunday’s mini-summit. The original guest list was limited to eight countries, but the European commission later issued an open invitation, although 12 countries chose to stay away. But the symbolism of holding an EU summit in Brussels without all EU member states struck some observers as a bad idea. The European council president, Donald Tusk, refused to host the meeting, because he wants the EU to act as one bloc, leaving European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to step in reluctantly as organiser. Arrival figures for refugees and migrants are currently 51% down on last year and 81% down on 2016.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/migration-is-threat-to-eu-free-travel-area-says-italian-prime-minister,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/migration-is-threat-to-eu-free-travel-area-says-italian-prime-minister
2018-06-24T16:15:31Z,world,World news,Totalitarian tyrant or trusted leader? Turkish voters split on Erdoğan,"Yaşar Ayhan used to be Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s barber when the Turkish president was still mayor of Istanbul. A photograph of them together still hangs in Ayhan’s shop in the Kasimpaşa district where Erdoğan grew up. Ayhan, 52, last saw the president at a breakfast during Ramadan. His hair was thinner, he said, burdened as he is by Turkey’s myriad challenges. “I voted for Tayyip Erdoğan,” he said. “We are proud of him. He’s not only a leader, but a world leader.” Turkish citizens cast their ballots on Sunday in the most important elections in a generation. They voted in presidential and parliamentary polls that could shape Turkish politics for years to come.
Erdoğan’s opponents said they voted for opposition parties because they sought an end to one-man rule and wanted a more representative democracy. The winner of the presidential race will assume sweeping new powers narrowly approved in a referendum last year. His supporters and the ruling AKP party said they backed the president because they trusted him to lead Turkey through turbulent economic times, given the country’s growth over his 16 years in power and his positioning of the country on the world stage. They also point to his championing of Muslim causes. “He delivers on what he says, and is trustworthy and just,” said Ayhan. “He is gentle but tough on Turkey’s enemies.” Recep, 37, said he also voted for Erdoğan in the presidential election because the Turkish leader hailed from the same district as he did, but he cast his ballot in the parliamentary elections for the Islamist Saadet party, which has campaigned strongly on fixing the economy. “I believe AKP parliamentarians aren’t efficient because of corruption,” he said. When Erdoğan called for early elections, many observers believed he did it to preempt an economic slump in the coming months. Mismanagement of the economy, worries of overheating, a growing foreign trade deficit and a rapid fall in value of the Turkish lira were the backdrop to the election campaign. In the liberal neighbourhood of Cihangir, voters said they had turned out to cast their vote against what they described as one-man rule. They said they were happy to take part in a democratic tradition in what may be the most important election in their lifetime. Fulya, a 39-year-old who has breathing difficulties, cast her ballot while her friend carried her oxygen tank. She said she was against the extraordinary powers that Erdoğan will wield if he wins. “We want the parliamentary system back, we are against one-man rule and everyone has to be represented,” she said. “I especially wanted to vote in this election because a candidate is in prison as a political hostage.” Her friend Hakan, 45, said he was voting “against tyranny”. “For almost 10 years I was not optimistic,” he said. “This is the first time.” The most popular opposition candidate, Muharrem İnce, has inspired voters with a dynamic campaign that has drawn crowds of hundreds of thousands in Ankara, Izmir and Istanbul. More than a million attended a rally by the affable former physics teacher in the capital on Saturday. Resit, 93, visited the polling station with his daughter holding his arm to vote for İnce. “It is our duty to vote,” they said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/totalitarian-tyrant-or-trusted-leader-turkish-voters-split-on-erdogan,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/totalitarian-tyrant-or-trusted-leader-turkish-voters-split-on-erdogan
2018-06-24T13:44:44Z,world,World news,Boris Becker defends his diplomatic status in passport row,"Boris Becker has insisted he takes his duties as a diplomat for the Central African Republic seriously, despite the country’s foreign secretary saying the tennis player’s passport is fake. The German sportsman is involved in a long-running bankruptcy dispute, but last week his lawyers said that under the Vienna convention he could not be subjected to any legal proceedings without the consent of the British government and ministers in Bangui, because he is the CAR’s attaché to the European Union on sporting, cultural and humanitarian affairs. The country’s foreign minister, however, who has to authorise all such passports, has said the signature on Becker’s diplomatic document is fake. The former tennis player insists this is not the case and says he was approached by President Faustin-Archange Touadéra earlier this year to improve the CAR’s reputation. Becker said he felt an affinity with the country because his own family has experienced “some of the same issues and some of the problems” as the people of one of the the world’s poorest nations. “I am a son of a refugee, my family is all mixed-race, so I have strong feeling towards the African continent, and therefore have a lot of respect and seriousness,” Becker told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme. “I have experienced racism, I experienced these type of problems and I want to make a change. Me, as a very German-looking man, it is something very close to my heart.”
Becker, whose possessions are this week being auctioned off as a result of a claim for millions of pounds by a private bank, insisted his decision to inform the court of his alleged diplomatic status is unrelated to his money issues. “That has nothing to do with my bankruptcy proceedings. It was just informing the trustee and the courts that if they want to send me to another hearing then my official address is the [CAR] embassy in Brussels and not at Wimbledon or in Germany.” Becker admitted he had never been to the CAR but saif that “when I have a week free I’d love to visit the country”. He declined to clarify whether German politicians had been involved in arranging the diplomatic passport, following suggestions from Marr that members of the anti-immigrant AfD party had been, and insisted the document was from the country’s embassy in Brussels. “I don’t know what is going on within the politics of Central Africa but I have received this passport from the ambassador ... I believe the documents they’re giving me must be right.” He said his decision to claim diplomatic status had led to a substantial increase in discussion of the country in the media. “Being a diplomat has its ups and has its downs,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/boris-becker-defends-his-diplomatic-status-amid-passport-row,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/boris-becker-defends-his-diplomatic-status-amid-passport-row
2018-06-24T11:20:01Z,world,World news,European leaders urged to guarantee safe ports for migrants,"Charities operating search-and-rescue missions in the Mediterranean have called on European leaders to urgently guarantee safe ports for migrants and refugees, warning the political standoff is already costing lives. As EU leaders met on Sunday for an emergency summit on migration, a week after 630 people rescued by the Aquarius ship arrived in Spain having been turned away by Italy and Malta, the fate of another vessel remained in limbo. The German NGO Mission Lifeline said its ship, carrying 234 people, was adrift in international waters after Italy refused it entry and Maltese authorities told the vessel to head back to Italy. Some of the charities accused the Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, of placing political concerns before lives. A spokesman for the German NGO Sea-Watch said: “It’s absolutely unacceptable that policy is being made at the expense of people in maritime distress.” As well as the 234 people onboard the Lifeline, he said, more than 100 had been rescued off southern Italy on Saturday by the container ship Alexander Maersk. “At the same time, people are drowning in the central Mediterranean Sea,” he said. “The UN refugee agency has put out numbers, with more than 200 people drowned just in the last five days. That’s a direct effect of the policy of crackdown on sea rescue. “We expect a fast solution for the people on the Lifeline and on the Alexander Maersk, because it’s unacceptable for people to be held hostage as a political statement.” A spokesman for Mission Lifeline said it did not know what would happen to those onboard its vessel, or what Italy’s stance could mean for the future. Òscar Camps, the founder of the Spanish charity Proactiva Open Arms, whose ship was impounded by Italian authorities in March, said the number of people drowning in the Mediterranean had risen by 20% since Salvini’s decision to turn away the Aquarius. “It’s not our job to say whether these people are legal or illegal,” he said. “We’re talking about people’s lives and our job is to act. “The only thing that’s illegal at sea are Mr Salvini’s decisions. There are some red lines that shouldn’t be crossed. If they’re crossed, then this could turn into a serious diplomatic situation.” Camps said it would not be practical for ships to ferry rescued migrants and refugees to Spanish ports, even if the new government in Madrid agreed to take in more, as it had with the Aquarius. “That’s not a good idea technically,” he said. “We can’t spend days making for Spain with people onboard in terrible conditions. It uses a lot of fuel.” Rescue ships needed to be allowed into the nearest port, he said, especially if they were carrying injured people who needed medical treatment. “We can’t hang around waiting for ages for them to assign us a port,” Camps said. “We need to act to minimise the loss of life. That’s what any sensible person would do.” SOS Méditerranée, which operates the Aquarius with Médecins Sans Frontières, described the international standoff over its ship as a “wakeup call” and demanded action when EU leaders meet again on Thursday and Friday. “People rescued at sea must be brought to a port of safety where their basic needs are ensured, including specific medical needs, and where they can seek the appropriate protection they are entitled to under both international and national law,” it said in a statement. “Protection from any forms of further abuse, exploitation and trafficking must especially be guaranteed. As the EU will be looking towards new instruments during next week’s EU council, the objective of preserving and protecting lives of people in distress must be discussed, before any other policy consideration.” Last week, Elhadj As Sy, the secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said Europe’s treatment of the Aquarius constituted a betrayal of its basic values. MSF, meanwhile, said the episode showed European migration and asylum policies had failed and the EU had lost it its humanity.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/european-leaders-urged-to-guarantee-safe-ports-for-migrants,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/european-leaders-urged-to-guarantee-safe-ports-for-migrants
2018-06-24T08:57:24Z,world,World news,EU leaders' migration summit offers lifeline to embattled Merkel,"EU leaders gather for an emergency summit on migration on Sunday, with the aim of shoring up Angela Merkel’s government. The informal “mini-summit”in Brussels is seen as a lifeline for the German chancellor, whose CDU party is involved in a bitter dispute over refugee policy with its conservative sister party in Bavaria, the CSU. Following a row with Italy about the purpose of the meeting, Merkel is downplaying expectations. “The meeting on Sunday is a consultation and working meeting at which there will be no concluding statement,” she said.
Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, agreed to go to Brussels only after Merkel abandoned a set of pre-written conclusions. A pre-cooked summit communique that emerged last week angered Conte, who said it neglected the “emergency” of migrant arrivals in Italy. Migration has become a political football in Germany and Italy, despite a sharp drop in the number of arrivals. About 41,000 refugees and migrants crossed the Mediterranean in the first six months of 2018, and 960 people are confirmed or suspected to have died, according to the latest data from the International Organisation for Migration. The arrival figures are 51% down on last year and 81% down on 2016. The issue has shaken Merkel’s government after the hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, who is also the CSU leader, set a two-week deadline for her to come up with a policy to deal with asylum claimants arriving in Germany from other EU member states. Udo Bullmann, a German Social Democrat MEP, accused the CSU of provoking a crisis to bolster its chances in the state election this autumn. “The Bavarian CSU is doing what they always do when the face a crisis, they are organising a crisis with their sister party,” said Bullmann, the leader of the Socialist group in the European parliament. “They are frightened of losing their absolute majority. They see they are declining in numbers, so they think ‘where is my conflict with Berlin, where is my conflict with Brussels’. But in the real world, games can get out of control.” The summit guest list started with eight countries, but the leadersof 17 member states were expected to attend. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, announced his country and three other central European states would boycott the meeting, although none was expected or obliged to attend. Marta Foresti, the director of the Overseas Development Institute, said the EU was “in disarray on migration and the probability of reaching EU-wide consensus is at an all-time low”. “With the number of arrivals significantly decreased, but a higher proportion of those migrants dying during their journeys, taking concrete steps to address the reality of migration from Africa to Europe could not be more manageable and at the same time more urgent,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/eu-leaders-migration-summit-offers-lifeline-to-angela-merkel,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/eu-leaders-migration-summit-offers-lifeline-to-angela-merkel
2018-06-24T08:29:09Z,world,World news,Zimbabwe opposition fears crackdown after election rally bombing,"Opposition leaders in Zimbabwe fear the bombing of a ruling party election rally on Saturday will serve as a pretext for a wide-ranging crackdown by the government or the military in the southern African state. The attack at the White City stadium in Bulawayo apparently targeted the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa. At least 49 people, including both of Zimbabwe’s vice presidents, were injured by the explosion that occurred close to the VIP podium immediately after Mnangagwa finished his speech. Mnangagwa later called for peace, love and unity in Zimbabwe and pledged that the attack would not derail what has been a largely peaceful election campaign so far. The upcoming election is the latest turning point in the most tumultuous few months in almost four decades of Zimbabwe’s political history. In November, Robert Mugabe was forced out of power after 37 years, following a peaceful military takeover supported by the vast majority of the 17 million population. The poll on 30 July pits Zanu-PF, the ruling party, against the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), the longstanding opposition.
MDC officials called for an independent investigation of the attack. “This needs an urgent and independent investigation so the culprits can be brought to book. Every reasonable Zimbabwean condemns this. We have to end this cycle of violence,” said David Coltart, a senior opposition leader. Tendai Biti, another senior MDC leader, said it was important to “find out what has happened because the fingerprints are so obvious”. Many opposition activists voiced concerns that the attack would be used as a pretext to crack down on their campaigning. “We’re going to have to see who they start picking up in the next few days. There is a huge worry. Are they going to use this to justify a clampdown on opposition people,” said one official in Harare, the capital. Zanu-PF is led by Mnangagwa, a former vice-president known as “the Crocodile” who took power when Mugabe was ousted. Polls indicate a potentially close race, but one that Zanu-PF should win. Past votes have been marked by systematic intimidation of the opposition and fraud, and the US and others have said a credible vote is key to lifting international sanctions. “The campaign has so far been conducted in a free and peaceful environment, and we will not allow this cowardly act to get in our way as we move towards elections ... Let us continue to be united and address our differences peacefully. The strongest response to violence is peace. The strongest response to hate is love,” Mnangagwa said in a statement on Saturday night. Derek Matyszak, an expert in Zimbabwean politics at the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa, said the opposition’s concerns might be misplaced. “I don’t think [the authorities] will start closing down the democratic space for the MDC but we could well see a more extensive military deployment around the country,” he said. The MDC have long complained that voters, especially those in rural areas, are intimidated by the presence of soldiers and thus more likely to support the government. There is no indication of who might be responsible for Saturday’s attack. There have been frequent allegations of assassination attempts directed at Mnangagwa and other senior politicians, these have not involved bombings or firearms. Mnangagwa said on Twitter that he was awaiting further information about the blast but added, without elaborating, that those responsible must have come from “outside Bulawayo”. He added: “I can assure you these are my normal enemies.” The November crisis was the culmination of a lengthy power struggle between a faction of young politicians led by Mugabe’s wife Grace and supporters of Mnangagwa. Opinion of Mnangagwa is divided among western diplomats and analysts in Harare. Some are convinced the president wants to be seen as the statesman who has restored democracy in Zimbabwe and who would step down if defeated. Others say he “does not have a democratic bone in his body”, but has pragmatically recognised the need to win international legitimacy if his country is to access the financial assistance it so desperately needs. Zimbabwe last experienced explosions at rallies in the 1980s, when Mugabe was targeted.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/zimbabwe-opposition-fears-crackdown-election-rally-bombing-emmerson-mnangagwa,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/zimbabwe-opposition-fears-crackdown-election-rally-bombing-emmerson-mnangagwa
2018-06-24T08:00:20Z,world,World news,"Saviour and sultan, ally and foe – west in a bind over Erdoğan","It has been a momentous week for Turkey – but for reasons that have little direct bearing on today’s nationwide elections. In a ceremony thousands of miles away in Forth Worth, Texas, the Turkish air force took delivery of its first Lockheed Martin F-35A joint strike fighter, known as the Lightning II – possibly the best combat jet in the world. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s president, whose government has ordered 100 F-35s, appears well satisfied with the multibillion-dollar deal. The planes will enable Ankara to project military firepower across the Middle East and beyond. National prestige will be enhanced. It is the sort of thing Erdoğan loves. But Turkey’s enthusiasm is not entirely shared in Washington, where Congress is trying to block the sale. Its anger is focused on Turkey’s recent actions in Syria, its collaboration with Iran and human rights abuses. But what has really upset the Americans is Erdoğan’s parallel purchase of Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missiles that are designed to shoot down F-35s. It seems Erdoğan wants it both ways – and that’s a familiar problem. The row accurately reflects the ambivalence that is now widely felt among the western democracies towards Turkey under his leadership. This in turn reflects deep divisions within Turkey itself, as revealed by the election campaign. The US and Europe need Turkey for a host of strategic, political, practical and geographical reasons. But Turkey under Erdogan is proving a less than constant friend. Not so much an ally, it is increasingly seen as a threat. In an extraordinary open letter published last week, members of Congress lambasted Erdoğan’s record. “Contrary to its Nato obligations, Turkey is actively operating to undermine US interests around the world. Turkey’s repeated military actions against American interests, relentless degradation of human rights and democracy under President Erdoğan, and clear intention to build a strategic partnership with Russia have completely eroded the US-Turkey relationship,” it said. Russian missiles aside, Erdoğan’s confrontational behaviour in northern Syria, where he has threatened US troops working with Kurdish forces to defeat Isis, has left the Pentagon asking whose side he is on. Turkey’s military incursions into northern Iraq in pursuit of Kurdish PKK militants are destabilising. Likewise, Erdoğan’s de facto alliance with Iran is another big worry. On the other hand, the US wants and needs Turkey’s help for a multitude of reasons. It has use of an important military airbase at Incirlik, south-west Turkey, which gives it region-wide reach. It knows there can be no lasting settlement in Syria without Ankara’s blessing. And Turkey is, or used to be, a vital buffer against Russian expansionism in the Black Sea region, the Caucasus and the Balkans.
European governments are in a similar bind. They value Turkey as a secular, democratic and pro-western outpost in a region where such qualities are rare. They still, in theory, see Turkey as a future member of the EU. But they are obliged to temper their deep unhappiness with Erdoğan’s domestic abuses and regular anti-European tongue-lashings in order to retain his cooperation in stemming Syrian refugee outflows and tracking Isis terrorists. Chronic ambivalence is also a fair description of how Turks view their president. Since attaining national prominence, the former Istanbul mayor has become an increasingly divisive figure. For Erdoğan supporters, predominantly rural conservatives, observant Sunni Muslims and nationalists, the man who has dominated political life since 2003 is Turkey’s saviour. His admirers put him on a par with Kemal Atatürk, Turkey’s founding father. Better still, in their view, he has overcome Atatürk’s secular legacy through his devout, neo-Islamist outlook and his implacable hostility to the old, privileged ruling elites. He is credited with transforming Turkey into a modern, urbanised, industrialised economy restored to its rightful place in the ranks of the world’s leading nations. That, in part, is what the F-35 purchase is about. Last week saw another highly symbolic step, further inflating national pride: the first ever runway landing at Istanbul’s shiny new airport. Naturally it was Erdoğan who touched down on board his personal jet. But this was no mere campaign stunt. When the airport opens in October, it will be one of the three biggest in the world, eventually handling up to 250 million passengers a year. It will also house the world’s largest duty-free shopping complex. Yet there is another, darker side to Erdoğan’s Turkey. It is a world where tens of thousands of people have been jailed without trial or dismissed from their jobs under an ongoing state of emergency. It is a shabby world of dictatorial presidential powers, an emasculated parliament, a tame judiciary, a subservient media and unchecked corruption. It is a world where prestige infrastructure projects, like the airport and the $3bn Yavuz Sultan Selim bridge over the Bosphorus, coexist bizarrely with a weakening, overheated economy and national shortages of food staples. The tensions between the opposing views of Erdoğan – friend or foe, hero or villain – will not be resolved by today’s elections. In the hall of mirrors that is Erdoğan’s Turkey, advanced fighter jets are in plentiful supply, but potatoes and onions are scarce. If he wins again, grab a crash helmet and fasten your seatbelt.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/saviour-sultan-ally-foe-west-in-bind-over-erdogan,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/saviour-sultan-ally-foe-west-in-bind-over-erdogan
2018-06-24T07:42:27Z,world,World news,Neve Te Aroha: New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern reveals name of baby daughter,"The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and her partner Clarke Gayford have announced the name of their newborn daughter: Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford. Neve, derived from the the Irish name Niamh, means “bright” or “radiant” and Te Aroha means “love” in te reo Māori.
She said she and Gayford had struggled “for months” over the name, but the right one became clear once the baby was born. “Probably like everyone, we went through that struggle where we kept this shortlist of names and we wanted to wait until the baby arrived to really see which one felt like it worked. “But we chose Neve because we just liked it, and when we met her we thought she looked like she suited the name.”
Ardern said the name Te Aroha was chosen as a reflection of the support she’d received from New Zealanders during her pregnancy, especially the Māori community. “I thought how do I reflect the generosity, particularly of all the iwi who gifted us names – and Te Aroha seemed to be a way,” she said. “Te Aroha was something we settled on quite early. It was our way of reflecting the amount of love this baby’s been shown before she even arrived. It’s also a tribute to Te Aroha mountain, on New Zealand’s North Island, near Ardern’s hometown of Hamilton. “It’s the place where all my family are from,” she said. “I grew up under that mountain.” She added that anyone who thought Neve’s name was “particularly long” should look at her own “ridiculously long name” – Jacinda Kate Laurell Ardern. “I think I counted it out – it’s the same number of letters.” Neve shares a birthday with Pakistan’s former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, who was the first female world leader to give birth during office.
The prime minister was set to leave Auckland City hospital on Sunday, after arriving early on Thursday. She also told media she hoped the “novelty” of having a prime minister give birth in office would soon wear off. “I hope for little girls and boys that there is a future where they can make choices about how they raise their family and what sort of career they have, which is based on what they want and what makes them happy.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/neve-te-aroha-new-zealand-pm-jacinda-ardern-reveals-name-of-baby-daughter,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/neve-te-aroha-new-zealand-pm-jacinda-ardern-reveals-name-of-baby-daughter
2018-06-24T07:14:21Z,world,World news,Voters rally behind Erdoğan’s rival as Turkey goes to the polls,"Hundreds of thousands of Turkish voters turned out on to the streets and squares of Istanbul on Saturday for a final day of rallies ahead of crucial presidential and parliamentary elections taking place on Sunday. In a remarkable display of his growing popularity, opposition candidate Muharrem İnce drew at least a million people to a rally in the Maltepe district of the city, where he urged voters to end 16 years of rule by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Justice and Development (AK) party. “We will embrace everyone,” he said, as supporters in festive mood sang anthems and waved red-and-white Turkish flags. “Turkey’s hopes will be revived. This is going to be a united Turkey.” İnce, the candidate of the secularist opposition party known as CHP, has emerged as the most charismatic challenger to Erdoğan, and may push the president into a second-round contest. An affable physics teacher and veteran CHP MP from the city of Yalova, he has criss-crossed the country marshalling votes and seeking a united front against the incumbent. He has pledged to roll back presidential powers, restore the rule of law in Turkey and end prosecutions of dissidents and journalists. But Erdoğan, 64, who has ruled the country since 2002, first as prime minister then as president, has persevered in his usual bombastic style, ending his campaign yesterday with no fewer than five rallies. In Istanbul’s Esenyurt district, he told tens of thousands of supporters Turkey would go on “to achieve what others cannot imagine”, if they re-elected him once again. Erdoğan called snap elections in April, a year and a half ahead of schedule, despite repeated denials by his party that such a plan was under consideration. He said regional instability made early elections imperative. But critics said Erdoğan was hoping to preempt an economic slump that had already been hinted at with the collapse of the Turkish lira against the dollar and a widening foreign trade deficit, and to limit and weaken the possible field of rivals. Whoever wins the presidential election will assume extraordinary new powers, narrowly approved in a referendum last year that was marred with allegations of fraud. Those include the ability to appoint the cabinet and unelected vice-presidents, as well as senior judges, the power to issue decrees with the force of law and with limited parliamentary oversight.
In the parliamentary race, the AK party has formed an alliance with the nationalist party, the MHP, led by the septuagenarian Devlet Bahçeli. It faces an opposition grand coalition that includes the secularists of the CHP, the nationalists of the Iyi party led by Meral Akşener, and the Saadet party’s Islamists. The pro-Kurdish HDP is running independently without being part of a coalition but has indicated it would back the opposition candidate that makes it to the second round against Erdoğan. The result of this dynamic campaign has been a far more interesting race than predicted when the snap polls were called, and has raised the distinct possibility that Erdoğan’s AK party may lose its parliamentary majority, even if the president is still the favourite to win. Public opinion polls are notoriously unreliable in Turkey. Nevertheless on average they appear to show Erdoğan securing a comfortable victory in the first round of the presidentials, but without an outright majority. A much tighter race is predicted between him and İnce in a second round on 8 July. Erdoğan faces a varied and convincing line-up of opponents, but İnce has proved the most threatening. In a month and a half he held 107 rallies in 65 cities, a whirlwind campaign that energised an opposition movement that few predicted would mount a credible challenge against Erdoğan. Last week he drew crowds of hundreds of thousands in the secular bastion of İzmir and in the capital, Ankara. He promised to end the state of emergency in place since the 2016 coup attempt, to continue “without mercy” the fight against terror groups, and to “unite Turkey”. İnce has broached many red lines for hardline secularists, visiting the imprisoned HDP leader Selahattin Demirtaş and demanding his release, as well as backing a parliamentary debate on resolving the Kurdish issue. He has also signalled his own religious piety and is a regular attendant at weekly Friday prayers, in a nod to Erdoğan’s religious base that is suspicious of secularists. At the end of his rally yesterday, he brought his headscarfed mother onto the stage, to loud cheers from supporters bearing flags of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the secular founder of the republic who abolished the Islamic caliphate. “Headscarf or not, man or woman, partisan or not, we will not discriminate against anyone,” he said. “You can wear your headscarf wherever you want.” İnce has sought to position himself as a democrat and populist, vowing to close down the opulent presidential palace in Ankara and turn it into an education centre, to end the state of emergency within two days of his victory, to restore the independence of the judiciary and to continue with determination the fight against terror groups. In a nativist nod, he pledged to restore diplomatic relations with the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, in order to pave the way for the return of Syrian refugees to their country. There are more than 3 million displaced Syrians in Turkey.Some will support Erdogan for his crushing of the separatist insurgency in the Kurdish region, and his success in pushing the militants away from the Turkish border with Syria. Others are unnerved by his alliance with nationalists and their hardline approach to the Kurdish issue, as well as his recent military foray into Syria’s Kurdish region of Afrin. Hundreds of HDP cadres, including MPs and the former chiefs of the party, mayors and activists have been detained in a wide-ranging crackdown, and many Kurdish news outlets have been shut down in the interim. Erdogan appears to be concerned over the loss of votes to the HDP. In a video recorded surreptitiously during a meeting with prospective voters, he urged them to do “special work” to limit the HDP’s performance, in what was interpreted by some as a call urging fraud or intimidation. The assault on human rights has been a backdrop for much of Turkish politics over the last two years, since a traumatic coup attempt in 2016 in which 250 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded. The government instituted a state of emergency and pursued members of the movement of Fethullah Gulen, an exiled preacher and former ally of Erdogan, whose followers are widely believed to have orchestrated the failed putsch.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/turkey-elections-muharrem-ince-threat-to-president-erdogan,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/turkey-elections-muharrem-ince-threat-to-president-erdogan
2018-06-24T06:59:19Z,world,World news,Bavarian border bridge is key to Merkel’s fight for survival,"On the A8 motorway between Salzburg and Munich, a policeman signals to a black BMW with Bulgarian number plates to pull over, and the driver parks and opens the boot. Five police officers, one armed with an assault rifle, ask him to remove its contents, and two female passengers dressed in leggings and flip-flops duly unload the bulging plastic bags inside and watch with increasing irritation as the police rifle through their contents. After about 10 minutes, having checked the Bulgarians’ documents, the police wave them on. This is the Schwarzbach crossing between Austria and Germany, which the German federal police have been controlling since the late summer of 2015 when tens of thousands of refugees poured over the border. Pictures of the town’s bridge crammed with some of the thousands who arrived each day became one of the dramatic illustrations of the refugee crisis then playing out in Europe. Set up as a temporary border point near the town of Freilassing in Bavaria, the German government now has to reapply to the European commission every six months for the special permission required for it to continue to operate. Freilassing is no longer a hub for refugees. Standing amid the bucolic surroundings of wooden farmhouses with overflowing flower boxes and solar-panelled roofs, Martin Zartner, a police spokesman, says the flow “has reduced to just a handful a day”. The town’s rather nondescript bridge is once again an unspectacular crossing over the river Saalach on which spot checks are only occasionally carried out. But it has become a potent focal point in the very public war being waged in Berlin between Angela Merkel and her interior minister Horst Seehofer, which could yet bring down the German government – ending both politicians’ careers – and drastically shake up Europe’s migration policy at the same time.
“We are fully aware of the tense political situation and the brutal eye which is being cast on the border controls,” one official who declined to be named, told the Observer. “This is after all about the future of Germany and the future of Europe.” Seehofer, until recently prime minister of Bavaria and head of its ruling party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democrats, wants to turn back from Germany’s borders any asylum seekers who have already registered in other EU countries. Merkel has firmly rejected his proposal, saying it is illegal under European law and that she fears the domino effect that turning asylum seekers back could have on the rest of the EU.
As she fights for her political survival after almost 13 years in power, Merkel is scrambling to forge bilateral agreements with nine other EU leaders she is due to meet today before a crucial EU council summit this week. Her aim is to reach a deal palatable to both her and Seehofer. But that will be no easy task. Sitting in the local headquarters of the anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland, where the windows are decorated with fairy lights in the party’s red and blue colours, Karl Halbritter is proudly dressed in traditional lederhosen shorts, an embroidered shirt and hiking boots and is rubbing his hands with glee. A candidate for the AfD in state elections in October at which he hopes to enter the district assembly, Halbritter points to a campaign poster: “The AfD makes good on what the CSU promises.” The CSU was considered the outright ruler of Bavaria for decades, until the AfD stole thousands of voters from it at the federal election last autumn, entering the Bundestag for the first time and denting both the CSU’s pride and power. It is now threatening to do more damage to the CSU power base in October’s poll. He calls the border restrictions that Seehofer is demanding, which would require thousands of extra police and a costly technical upgrade, a “placebo, pure entertainment”, which would be impossible to enforce. “Any human trafficker with half a brain is not going to use the controlled border crossings, but take the neighbouring uncontrolled B-roads instead, or tell the people he is smuggling to get out of the car in Austria and cross the bridge at a time when everyone knows it’s not being controlled, and he’ll simply meet them on the other side,” he says. If the AfD had its way, he says, it would simply close the EU’s entire outer border, instead of trying to police Germany’s 3,700km frontier.
The mayor of Freilassing for the past 19 years, Josef Flatscher of the CSU, is nostalgic about the days when Bavaria last had a border with Austria, before the introduction of Schengen and the free movement of people and goods. “I grew up with the border and remember as a 10-year-old smuggling butter from Austria in the mid-1960s,” he says. He rejoiced when the borders disappeared, but says he can’t help but see their reintroduction three years ago as a necessity. “You’ll find few sensible people who don’t share that view,” he insists. “Of course it’s annoying for local people who like to pop over to Austria to the heuriger [wine taverns] or whose businesses benefit from Austrians coming to drink their coffee or buy groceries – all of which are cheaper here – but they will gladly alter their behaviour if it means they feel safer and don’t have the impression that Germany is a cash cow that has to feed the world.” At the time of the refugee crisis Flatscher wrote to Merkel accusing her of having little regard for the impact her insistence on keeping Germany’s borders open had on the 17,000 citizens of Freilassing, many of whom took on the burden of coping with the 160,000 refugees who arrived in the town over six months. His anger is by no means gone. “Merkel never once came here or got in touch to explain how she expected us to manage – we felt very much left in the lurch, and we still do,” he says. There is also bitterness at how Freilassing is being used to fuel the far-right cause. “We’ve seen anti-immigrant demonstrations organised here where all the participants came from outside. The people of Freilassing played no role,” says Rainer Zehentner, a reporter at the local paper, the Südostbayerische Rundschau. He resents the fear that he says has been fomented by both the AfD and CSU as well as newspapers like the tabloid Bild, which recently got a new, hardline editor. “Hardly a day goes by when it doesn’t have a headline like “I’m a murderer and I want asylum in Germany”, so from the first feelings of humanity we had towards the refugees, people have been re-educated if you like, to believe they are all terrorists, murderers and rapists.” Back at the border, two Macedonian-Germans who have been stopped by the police on their way back to Stuttgart show their irritation. “The police were friendly enough and tried to be as speedy as possible, even if they annoyed me by telling me to put out my cigarette,” says the driver, Alexander, a security guard, sipping from a can of Red Bull close to the end of an 18-hour trip. “But if this is what it takes to protect Germany, then so be it.” Tina and Matthias Gabert, a medical receptionist and heating engineer from nearby Arzberg who have just pulled into a motorway service station just beyond the border crossing, say they switched to voting AfD at the last election “out of revenge” towards the CSU for its failure to control the borders. They would like to show their allegiance to the party once again “but the fact is we don’t feel safe,” they say. “Our girls are being grabbed from behind by refugees at the local swimming pool. It’s not surprising we like the border controls really. We can deal with the inconvenience.” Additional reporting by Janek Schmidt Angela Merkel has sought to downplay expectations for today’s emergency meeting on migration. The informal “mini-summit” for EU leaders in Brussels is being seen as a lifeline for the chancellor, amid a bitter dispute over refugee policy between her CDU party and its conservative sister party in Bavaria, the CSU. But after a row with Italy about the point of the meeting, Merkel said it was a “consultation” and would yield “no concluding statement”. Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, agreed to go to Brussels only after Merkel abandoned a set of pre-written conclusions. A pre-cooked summit communique that emerged last week angered Rome: Conte said it neglected the “emergency” of migrant arrivals in Italy. Around 41,000 migrants travelled across the Mediterranean in the first six months of 2018. The arrival figures are 51% down on last year and 81% down on 2016. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán said he and leaders of three other central European states would boycott the meeting, although none had been expected to attend.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/bavarian-border-briodge-angela-merkel-fight-for-survival-freilassing,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/bavarian-border-briodge-angela-merkel-fight-for-survival-freilassing
2018-06-24T06:00:18Z,world,World news,Proud Panama prepares for huge football party as England match awaits,"The importance that Panama attaches to qualifying for the World Cup finals cannot be overstated. Until this year, the country’s impact on the world’s sporting consciousness was limited to long jumper Irving Saladino winning its one and only gold medal at the Olympics in 2008. So, upon qualifying for the finals for the first time, Panama’s president, Juan Carlos Varela, declared a national holiday. Now tens of thousands of Panamanians have made significant financial sacrifices to follow their team to Russia, as their government dispatches a crack team of officials to promote the nation to the world. One person attending Sunday’s match at the Nizhny Novgorod Stadium is the country’s former ambassador to Britain, Ana Irene Delgado, who, having represented Panama at fencing, knows how important sport can be to a country’s image. Like other Latin Americans, she was dismayed when Peru, whose supporters have been one of the tournaments’ star attractions so far, were knocked out. “Peru haven’t been in a World Cup for 30 years but for us it’s our first time,” said Delgado, a lawyer who remained in London after her posting. “It’s a success for us just to be here.” So far, things have not gone well for Panama – they lost to Belgium in their opening match – nor for their close neighbours. Costa Rica have been knocked out and Colombia lost their first match, too. Panamanian expats in the UK are hoping for solidarity from their South American neighbours as, with even mighty Argentina looking vulnerable, the continent’s representation at the tournament starts to shrink. “We are really tiny,” Delgado said. “But we Latins tend to get together. I found that being a Panamanian here among big Spanish-speaking Latin American communities like Colombia and Mexico, it’s more comfortable if we stick together and share traditions and festivities.” She added that the Panama Papers scandal was not very good for the country’s image – “but at least people started knowing more about us”. Dr Michaela Benson, a reader in sociology at Goldsmiths who has studied Panamanian expat communities, said the World Cup offered the country the chance to promote its image abroad. “They have a very vibrant tourist industry. Economically, it’s a very interesting country. They have one of the strongest economies in Central and South America and very stable politics – which is unusual.” The embassy in London has being using social media to encourage expats to gather at a sports bar in central London today to cheer on the team. Anyone wanting to get into the spirit and soak up a bit of Panamanian culture through its food and drink might try to secure some fried plantain, Delgado suggested. This could be accompanied by tamales – parcels of pork or other meat wrapped in corn dough – washed down with a glass of seco, a very strong sugar cane-based drink similar to tequila. “A lot of people are saying England will be under so much pressure that maybe that makes them more nervous and Panama will have a chance but I don’t know,” Delgado said. “Just to watch Panama v England at the World Cup is a once in a lifetime opportunity.” Whatever the result, Panama’s profile will have been substantially raised. “You’d be surprised how many people didn’t know where Panama was,” Delgado said. “Now because the World Cup is one of the world’s most watched events, people who didn’t know about Panama will learn about it through sport.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/panama-glad-of-attention-before-england-world-cup,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/panama-glad-of-attention-before-england-world-cup
2018-06-24T06:00:18Z,world,World news,"From El Salvador to the US: handcuffed at the border, separated for months","Luis was 13 when he and his mother waded across the Rio Grande in October 2017 and turned themselves over to border patrol near El Paso, Texas.
They were fleeing murderous gang violence in El Salvador in hope of reuniting with Luis’s older brother, William, who was already in the United States. Luis thought their odyssey had ended. Instead, another began, a journey through a bureaucratic labyrinth which cleaved mother from son in a five-month ordeal of isolation and loneliness, locked rooms and shelters, handcuffs and fingerprints, cross-country flights and crushing, draining uncertainty. “I remembered God existed when I left the shelter to reunite with my brother,” Luis, now 14, told the Guardian in a phone interview this week. His experience underscores the fact that many families have been broken up and marooned in legal limbo even before the Trump administration announced a “zero tolerance” policy for illegal border crossings. The fate of some 2,300 separated children remains unclear in the wake of the president’s executive action to end separations. The family’s decision to leave home and make the trek north came from the moment a gang murdered Luis’s father, an army sergeant, in 2012, another casualty of one of the world’s highest homicide rates. When gang members threatened William in 2016 he fled, eventually settling in New Orleans. When they started threatening Luis in 2017, on his way to and from school, his mother, Blanca Vásquez, decided to seek safety in the US. They made it to Ciudad Juarez on the US-Mexican border before being abandoned by their coyote on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, said Luis. They crossed without him. “The water came up to my waist, about three feet.” The plan was to seek asylum so they flagged down a border patrol agent, who ordered them to put their hands up. “He kept me outside the patrol car and he put my mother in the patrol car. He handcuffed me. I don’t know why he had to handcuff me. I’m a child and they aren’t meant to do that.” At the station in Ysleta agents unshackled Luis, fingerprinted his mother and separated them. They would not see each other again until March 2018. “I was in the hielera (“ice box”) for three days. The first thing I did was ask to call my brother,” said Luis. An agent extracted the phone number from a piece of paper in his mother’s Bible and let him make a five-minute call. “I wasn’t in contact with my brother again for the three days they had me in that other office. I was there alone. There was a clock. I was locked in. I could not open the door. On the first day they showed me films but for the next two days they didn’t show me anything. They did not ask me anything. I felt alone. I felt bad. I did not know what to do. I did not know anything about my mother.” Authorities took Luis to the airport in El Paso and gave him fresh clothes but, tall for his age, they did not fit. “I had to wear the clothes I had when they apprehended us at the border because the pants they gave me stopped around my knees.” He joined 12 other boys who were flown to Houston, then on to a shelter in New York. “I liked how they treated us there. They gave us clothing. They took our details, where we were from, our birth dates, and our documents to help identify us.” After a week of medical exams the boys started classes in mathematics, English and US history. Luis’s stay ended abruptly in mid-December. “One night they arrived and told me I was leaving the next day at six in the morning. They gave me a bag and told me to pack it. I didn’t have enough time to get the papers they gave me in school about American history.” That was when Luis learned he would see William, and remembered God’s existence. “I prayed because I was about to leave that place. I liked the shelter but I thanked God I was about to be with my brother.” A shelter worker took Luis to the airport and handed him to a Delta employee. He flew to New Orleans to an emotional reunion with William. For the first time in almost two months he also got to speak to his mother by phone. He learned she had been prosecuted for the misdemeanor offense of unlawful entry. Prosecutors had also threatened to charge her with child trafficking. After being convicted of the misdemeanor and sentenced to time served Luis’s mother was placed in immigration detention in El Paso and Sierra Blanca, Texas. She remained in custody until an immigration judge accepted her credible fear claim that she would be murdered if deported to El Salvador. She was released in March and joined her sons in New Orleans. “If I could tell you more things I would but I have decided to forget them,” said Luis. “I have decided to forget this moment of my life.

2018-06-24T05:05:17Z,world,World news,England’s cathedrals hark back to the middle ages to pull in crowds,"For centuries they have been places of quiet reflection, highbrow music and greyish stone. But now cathedrals are transforming their genteel image with bright colour, noisy processions and drama, reviving long-abandoned practices from the middle ages and drawing in the crowds. Leading the pack in this medieval comeback is St Albans Cathedral in Hertfordshire which on Saturday attracted thousands to its pilgrimage to mark the feast day of Saint Alban, the first Christian martyred in Britain. And on Wednesday the Chester Mystery Plays will be performed in the nave of Chester Cathedral, the original cycle of 24 plays condensed into one by old soap-opera hands for an 18-day run. Jeffrey John, the dean of St Albans who created the modern-day pilgrimage, said: “We have returned to a very visual culture today and medieval practices suit that. And if you have strong medieval roots as so many cathedrals do, you are bound to probe them and revive that heritage.”
Medieval pilgrims flocked to St Albans Cathedral (the site of a Benedictine monastery founded by King Offa of Mercia in AD793) because it housed the bones of Saint Alban until the shrine was dismantled after the Reformation. Now the cathedral has revived the pilgrimage, which winds its way through the town to tell the 1,700-year-old story of the martyr using 12-foot-high puppets, made by a company that creates floats for the Notting Hill Carnival. The puppets include not only Saint Alban himself but also Roman soldiers, lions and charioteers. As well as hundreds of local people taking part, the pilgrimage of drama and prayers attracts thousands from across Britain.
The revival of practices abandoned because of the Reformation and Puritan influence is highly appealing to many Anglican cathedral deans facing huge costs to keep their ancient buildings in good order. At next month’s General Synod, the Church of England will discuss a report from the Cathedrals Working Group about financial management of cathedrals and to urge the government to establish a cathedral fabric fund to support conservation and restoration programmes. The acting dean of Chester Cathedral, Jane Brooke, agrees with John that medieval practices work in the 21st century because of the dominance of visual culture. Created for a mostly illiterate population, the Mystery Plays were first revived for the Festival of Britain and have been performed at intervals since – but have only just been welcomed into the cathedral. “During the middle ages very few people, apart from the priests, knew the Bible story so it was a mystery, hence Mystery Plays,” said Brooke. “Now they are a way in for people who do not know the Christian story so well today. It is a very big thing for us to have the plays in the cathedral and we are moving times of services to accommodate them.” The Chester Mystery Plays is being brought to the public by director Peter Leslie Wild, who has directed episodes of The Archers, and playwright Deborah McAndrew, who was a regular in Coronation Street for eight years. “We have to assume no prior knowledge of Christianity,” said Wild. “This is an interpretation for a modern audience, rooted in contemporary life and performed by local people, just as they would have been in the middle ages”. One new twist in this year’s plays is the focus on the destruction of God’s creation by humanity, with the stage awash with plastic following the flood, when Noah saves animals in his ark.
Other cathedrals and their cities are also seeking inspiration from the medieval era. At Lincoln Cathedral, which is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Catholic practices have been revived that were abandoned during the Reformation, with processions to Mary’s statue on her feast days. In Canterbury, a medieval pageant is planned for 7 July to commemorate the penitential pilgrimage of Henry II in 1174 when he made reparation for inciting the murder of Thomas Becket, the archbishop of Canterbury. Chocolate medallions are given to young pilgrims if they visit five sites in the city – sugary replicas of the badges awarded to weary medieval travellers when they reached Canterbury.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/england-cathedrals-back-to-middle-ages-mystery-plays-pageants-chester-st-albans,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/england-cathedrals-back-to-middle-ages-mystery-plays-pageants-chester-st-albans
2018-06-24T05:00:23Z,world,World news,Malaysia’s top cartoonist says he’ll miss PM who tried to jail him for 43 years,"Few celebrated the fall of the Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak in last month’s election quite like Zulkiflee Anwar Ulhaque. The country’s most controversial political cartoonist, known as Zunar, had spent the past nine years subject to endless arrests and raids, had nine books banned, was charged under six different laws and still faces nine charges of sedition – carrying a sentence of 43 years in jail – simply for using his pen to critique Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor. Even so, one month after the election victory for the opposition, Zunar admits he has a twinge of nostalgia. Sure, he is free to travel abroad for the first time in two years and the police are no longer haunting his doorstep, but for a political cartoonist, Najib, mired in corruption scandals and murder allegations, and Rosmah, despised for her ostentatious shopping habits, had been “a total gift”. “Rosmah in particular was a godsend. I miss her, I really do,” says Zunar. “Now they have changed the government it is a challenge for me. What am I going to draw?” For decades, defying a system of repressive sedition laws and state-controlled newspapers, Zunar has used his hard-hitting cartoons to draw attention to the hypocrisy, financial scandals and cover-ups in Malaysian politics that mainstream media kept under wraps. In turn, since 2009, the Najib government used every tool of the state to go after him, also targeting those who printed and bought his work.
“I always refused to back down,” says Zunar. “In one interrogation by the police I told them, ‘You can ban my books, you can ban my cartoons but you can’t ban my mind. I will keep drawing until the last drop of my ink runs out, you can’t stop me.’ So they tried different strategies after that.” The police raided his publishers and three different printers – threatening to take away their licences if they continued – confiscated thousands of his books, banned all of his cartoons from being sold in shops, shut down his exhibitions and when, in 2013, he took to selling his works online instead, they arrested his website manager, demanding details of everyone who had bought the works. In 2015, after a cartoon criticising the judiciary, Zunar was arrested again before being charged with sedition. Now with a new government, led by 92-year-old Mahathir Mohamad, pledging a new era of freedom of expression, Zunar is cautiously optimistic. But while his travel ban was dropped the day after the opposition won the election, he is still waiting to hear whether the new attorney general will continue with the August case for his sedition charges. “Until they announce the abolition of the printing and press act, the fake news act and the sedition act, then there is no guarantee the new government won’t use those laws again in the future,” he says. “I will still be pushing for reform. It’s not enough to chop some heads, they need to change the entire system.” Zunar’s troubles began when Najib was made deputy prime minister in 2004. He used cartoons to take on Najib’s alleged corruption and whispered role in the murder of a Mongolian translator, Altantuya Shaariibuu. Najib denied having met the translator, saying he “had nothing to do with the case” and learned of her death only several days afterwards. In response, Zunar depicted Altantuya carrying out her own death – shooting herself twice in the head then blowing up her own body with explosives.
After the cartoons were published, officials raided Zunar’s office and confiscated 500 cartoons. They took him in for questioning under the notorious printing and press act – long used to suppress criticism of the government – and banned his book. It was the start of a tango between Zunar and the authorities. Over the nine years of Najib’s tenure as prime minister, Zunar had nine of his books banned, and a letter from the chief of Malaysian police to the immigration authorities in 2015 saw him put on the travel-ban list for two years. Zunar admits he was scared by the threats of decades in prison but “if cartoonists don’t use their talents to wake up the people and open minds about what’s happening, then they are not fulfilling their duty”. He was only 18 when he had his first work banned, a cartoon for his school magazine that critiqued a teacher, but the person Zunar loved to draw most was Najib’s wife, Rosmah. His caustic depiction of her, with huge hair and laden down with luxury goods, became a source of national glee for Malaysians who had grown angry at her for flaunting her expensive lifestyle when many people were struggling to make ends meet. “I couldn’t have survived as a political cartoonist if I depended on Najib alone. Rosmah gave so much material. Forget Najib, she was the most powerful person in Malaysia,” he says. He often depicted her as Malaysia’s answer to Imelda Marcos – the shoe-loving wife of the former Philippines president, Ferdinand Marcos – seeing her as the puppetmaster of Najib, who did her bidding as she sat concealed behind his office chair. Zunar thinks she was behind the instructions to come down hard on him. After he started drawing Rosmah, cartoonists at state-controlled newspapers were given explicit instructions that they were not allowed to depict her in their work. “I always said that in Malaysia there are two individuals you cannot draw in cartoons: one is Rosmah and the other is the Prophet Muhammad,” says Zunar. He now has plans for a new book of works devoted entirely to Rosmah and is contemplating Rosmah, I Miss You as the title.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/malaysia-top-political-cartoonist-zunar-will-miss-pm-najib-razak,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/malaysia-top-political-cartoonist-zunar-will-miss-pm-najib-razak
2018-06-24T05:00:23Z,world,World news,Fraudsters ‘turning Dubai into the new Costa del Crime’,"Fraudsters involved in scams costing the Treasury almost £100m have bought a string of luxury apartments in Dubai – now considered to have replaced Spain’s Costa Del Crime as the place to launder money – a major leak of a secret Dubai property database has revealed. The list of purchasers will be studied closely by British investigators, who have been chasing the missing millions the fraudsters owe the UK and other European countries. All the men are accused of being involved in so-called carousel fraud, which is estimated to have cost the UK £16.5bn in tax revenues between 2005 and 2016. Rod Stone, former assistant director of the HM Revenue and Customs organised crime national coordination unit, said fraudsters began consigning goods via Dubai in 2005 in an attempt to undermine the tax authorities’ ability to identify the tell-tale circular movements that indicate carousel fraud. “Fraudsters used Dubai banks to avoid both the stringent anti-money laundering reporting requirements in the UK, and the authorities’ ability to freeze their ill-gotten gains,” Stone said. “Many law enforcement professionals now believe that Dubai has replaced the Costa del Crime in Spain as the place criminals conceal and invest the proceeds.” The Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, an international investigative organisation, obtained a huge leak of Dubai property ownership records dating from 2014 to 2016, which Finance Uncovered, another investigative journalism body, searched for businessmen of interest to UK authorities. One is London-educated Mustafa Al Hassani, whose mobile phone wholesale business, Abyss International, operated out of Dubai and London. The 47-year-old, who has a passion for expensive cars and whose company – part of a chain that owes huge sums to HMRC – is being wound up by court order, bought eight previously unknown Dubai properties worth more than £2.5m. It is unclear whether he still owns them. The properties identified are in the highly sought after Jumeirah Beach development overlooking the Gulf coast, and in the Greens and Views development backing onto the Emirates Golf Club. Hassani’s younger brother, Haider, from whom HMRC has sought to secure millions of pounds in damages, also bought property in Dubai. Finance Uncovered found that one alleged fraudster who was accused of using companies in the UK and the British Virgin Islands to defraud the Treasury owned or owns at least three properties in Dubai. Another, Mohsin Salya from Preston, was imprisoned in Germany for three years and three months for tax evasion linked to the EU carbon market. The indictment from 2016 stated that Salya had been part of a carousel fraud “gang” that had attempted to defraud the German authorities of €125m in fraudulent tax reclaims via a Dubai company. According to the leaked data, Salya is or was the owner of three apartments in the “family oriented” Discovery Gardens development in Dubai. Salya, who is now out of jail and living in the emirate, said the properties were bought long before his involvement in the fraud that led to his jail term. According to their father, the Hassani brothers are living in Dubai and Iraq. He told the Observer: “It was a long time ago.”
In carousel fraud, a UK business imports high value goods VAT-free and sells them to a UK company with VAT added. The import company collects the VAT but does not pay it to HMRC. The goods are re-sold several times through a chain of “buffer” companies. In the final transaction, a company reclaims VAT from HMRC while the first and last companies in the chain disappear, having fraudulently claimed VAT that was never paid. Other fraudsters with Dubai properties exploited “carbon credits” generated by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Europol has estimated that carousel scam in carbon credits cost around €5bn between 2008 and 2009.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/fraudsters-turn-dubai-new-costa-del-crime,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/fraudsters-turn-dubai-new-costa-del-crime
2018-06-24T05:00:21Z,world,World news,"Too smart, too successful:  Mongolia’s superwomen struggle to find husbands","At the UB comedy club at the back of a bar in central Ulaanbaatar, the audience is overwhelmingly female. Groups of smartly dressed women, just out of the office, sip from bottles of beer while watching a young Mongolian man on stage. “Our women are beautiful,” he says, nodding at a few men seated at the front. “They’re great to be friends with, but they are crazy.” A few men chuckle but the room is mostly silent. “Everywhere, every lounge, pub or club is like this,” says Mandkhai Jambaldorj, a 31-year-old journalist at the show with two friends, “there’s a surplus of women.” Over the past few decades, Mongolian families have been investing in their daughters by sending them to school and university in the capital. Some parents believe daughters will take better care of them in their old age. Others think women need to learn other skills as herding livestock is work reserved for men – the boys are kept at home to tend the animals. This trend has given rise to what is known as Mongolia’s “reverse gender gap”. Now women are more educated than men. They are less likely to be unemployed. They also live longer – by a decade on average.
But by outpacing men, Mongolian women in the city, many of whom stayed on after university to work, struggle to find partners the way their parents did. The marriage rate in Ulaanbaatar has fallen to 8.9 per 1,000 people in 2016, from 22.9 in 2007, according to the country’s statistics office. Women in the city complain that there is a shortage of eligible men. In a way they are right. Home to half of the country’s three million people, the city has about 60,000 more women then men. At universities and in the workplace there are often far more women than men. These men are more likely to be taken: almost 40% of men in urban areas over the age of 15 are married, compared with only 32% of women. Mongolian women face the dual cultural pressures of establishing a career and getting married before the age of 29, preferably earlier. For women who are older, the calculation changes. Zola [not her real name], 39, a former economist, has been looking for a long-term partner for several years now, since returning from doing a master’s degree abroad. She has tried dating events and having friends set her up. She once visited a shaman. Recently, she decided to adjust her initially high standards. “Now I’m thinking he should just care and accept me. I’m not looking for money, or for very good education. He doesn’t have to be successful … as long as he is kind, listens and takes care of me. That’s all.” It’s not just the numbers. Many say the issue is a mismash of attitudes and expectations. “Young girls are taught they should succeed, then you succeed and there’s no equal partner for you. The social pressure is for you to get married but finding an equal partner is very hard,” says Alimaa Altangerel, a columnist who writes about social issues. Manduhai Tsogtbal, 32, an entrepreneur who runs an online translation services company, has been starting businesses since she was a student. While getting an MBA degree in the US, she bought the Thai restaurant where she had worked as a waitress and turned it into a more profitable sushi bar. She can tell men don’t appreciate it when she challenges their business ideas. “I can sense it,” she says. “A lot of my girl friends and guy friends suggest I shut up, be dumb and ask more questions.”
A survey released in March by the World Bank found Mongolian men in their 20s often described women as more ambitious than men, a trait they found unattractive. Some wondered why women invested so much in their education, given that it increased their risk of not being able to find a husband. Bulganchimeg Gantulga, 19, a university student studying political science, says men her age always catcall women who wear short skirts. She says these men, even her classmates, are often behind when it comes to gender and LGBT rights. She is considering never marrying at all. “When men don’t respect women, it’s obvious what kind of husband they will be,” Bulganchimeg says. Mongolia’s reverse gender gap, and the difficulties women and men have relating to one another, illustrate how little attention is paid to the poor state of the country’s men, according to Boldbaatar Tumur, head of the Men’s Association in Govisümber province. Thousands of men lost their jobs in the privatisation of state-owned companies in the 1990s, as Mongolia transitioned from a communist system, and they still have not recovered. NGOs and the government focus more on women than on men, who face rising rates of alcoholism, as well as unemployment, he says. “Women have started to look down on Mongolian men because they have fallen far behind. No woman wants to live with an under-educated, impolite man. On the other side, men feel women are looking for men who are wealthier and more educated,” Tumur says. At Caffe Bene, a trendy Korean coffee chain in central Ulaanbaatar, almost all the tables are occupied by young women on their own. One sits with her shopping bags on a chair, typing on her phone. Another reads a comic, while the woman across from her peers at a laptop. Single women in Mongolia face a certain stigma, which makes dating even harder. The Lunar New Year holiday, a time for family reunions, is especially hard: women inevitably face questions about their marital status. “You feel like you’re being blamed for being single,” says Solongo Bold, a single mother of two who works at a mining company. They also face a relatively conservative dating culture. Rather than meet in bars or clubs, single Mongolians often find each other on Facebook or Instagram, chatting over private message, away from the public eye. “For flirting Instagram is effective, but for talking Facebook is better,” says Tsogtbal. Clubs and bars in Ulaanbaatar have begun holding speed-dating events, but people are sometimes embarrassed to attend, says Bat-Ulzii Altantsetseg, head of an events group called UB Nights. Now, instead of singles nights, they hold partner parties where men and women are assigned random pairs of numbers. He says usually 60% of attendees are women. For Anna Battulga, 25, a recent graduate working in human resources, dating seems different from how it was for her parents, who met in the 1980s in Ulaanbaatar when Mongolia was still under a communist system.
Her mother was a shop assistant and her father a police officer who, after meeting Battulga’s mother, came to inspect the shop every week, scaring the owner. Eventually they started going to the cinema where her father would translate the films, available only in Russian, into Mongolian for her mother. After a few months he nervously asked if his parents could come to her house to ask for her hand in marriage, a Mongolian tradition. Battulga is more likely to meet someone on Facebook, Instagram or Tinder which she has just started using. She flicks through several pages of profiles, skipping anyone who has posted a landscape photo, as well as any foreigners. The number of people on the app is much higher now than it was a few years ago, she says. When asked about a popular Mongolian phrase that translates roughly as “your soulmate will be waiting for you on your path,” she pauses. “I think that’s unrealistic.” Additional reporting by Munkhchimeg Davaasharav",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/mongolia-reverse-gender-gap-marriage-rate-decline-career-women,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/mongolia-reverse-gender-gap-marriage-rate-decline-career-women
2018-06-24T04:59:17Z,world,World news,‘Our country is not a safe place’: why Salvadorans will still head for the US,"Outside the migrants’ attention centre in San Salvador, 19-year-old Berenice Cruz’s eyes dart around nervously before she whispers that she had fled El Salvador “because of the crime”. Nearly all her family in the east of the country belong to a gang, she says, but she refuses to get involved. The gang threatened to kill her, so she attempted the perilous journey to Reno, Nevada, in the US, where an aunt lives and where sanctuary lies. She failed. “If I go back to where I live, they’ll kill me,” she says, shortly after arriving back in her home country from a detention centre in McAllen, Texas, where she was held after crossing the border. She is one of 11,748 Salvadorans deported from the US and Mexico since the start of 2018. Migrants have been under relentless attack since Donald Trump began his run for office. The US authorities’ policy of separating children from their families in the name of a “zero tolerance” immigration strategy sparked outrage last week from Washington DC to San Salvador, and Trump was eventually forced to back down with an executive order which critics say still does not go far enough. But his policy continues to ignore the difficult realities of thousands of migrants fleeing violence and misery in the so-called Northern Triangle, the Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras plagued by corruption, gang crime and impunity. “They declare [El Salvador] the most violent country in the world, but then say they won’t give us refuge, asylum, or any kind of protection for reasons of violence,” said Aquiles Magaña, secretary of the National Council for the Protection and Development of Migrant People, known as Conmigrantes, criticising Trump’s “drastic change” in asylum policies as hostile, racist and contradictory. El Salvador’s murder rate fell last year compared with 2015 and 2016, but it was still soaring at more than 10 homicides a day on average in 2017 in a country of six million. It remains one of the deadliest countries in the world outside war zones. Turf wars between rival gangs drive violence and perpetuate inequality and insecurity. These gangs were born in Los Angeles and transported to the streets of El Salvador amid mass deportations in the mid-1990s of migrants who fled the country’s 12-year civil war. Unsurprisingly, nine out of 10 families with children in El Salvador hope to migrate in the future. Iris Martinez, 40, left El Salvador two weeks ago, intending to escape gang intimidation after witnessing a murder two years ago. “I always received threats,” she says after getting off a bus of 35 deportees held in Mexico. She plans to make the trek again, this time with documents to request asylum, to be reunited with one of her three children who is already in the US. Cases like Martinez’s face even greater uncertainty after the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges earlier this month to deny asylum in most instances of gang and domestic violence. On a recent Friday afternoon, 93 deportees arrived in El Salvador from the US. Some had lived there for years or decades. Others were caught immediately on crossing the border. Once in El Salvador, the deportees were greeted with a smile from government workers, an orange juice and a sandwich before being interviewed by officials and heading off with all their belongings in a small red drawstring bag.
But returning to their home districts is not so easy. The near unanimous consensus among deportees at the centre is that Trump’s policies will not stop migrants from heading north. “Prosecuting asylum seekers for crossing the border, detaining families seeking protection and limiting the standards to win asylum are cruel and inhumane and ignore the conditions that are leading many central American women, children and families to flee their communities in search of safety,” said Adriana Beltrán, of the Washington Office on Latin America. According to 2016 government statistics, nearly three-quarters of deported adults cited economic factors as their reason for leaving the country, where more than a third of the population lives in poverty. Reasons for deported children were split almost evenly between economic motives, insecurity and family reunification. Tessie Borden, spokeswoman for a Los Angeles-based organisation, Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice, challenged rigid distinctions that cast economic reasons for migration as less valid than security concerns. “These factors are all connected,” she said. “The kind of lives these people live are not lives in which they have many options to begin with.” Josué, 18, another returnee to El Salvador, went to the US with his mother when he was seven, seeking “a better future”. He says he plans to try to cross the border again as soon as possible, hoping to make it in time for the birth of his second child in July. He is more worried about being in El Salvador than about Trump’s immigration policies. “This is not a safe place,” he says, switching from Spanish to English. “Being young here is a crime.” Youth are particularly vulnerable to gang threats and violence, which are the driving forces of their displacement in El Salvador, according to a report from the human rights organisation Cristosal. Beltran said: “Many victims of violence find no protection from the authorities,” she said. “In fact, many fear the police as much as the criminals.” Another young man, Enrique Valle, 29, recently returned to El Salvador from Los Angeles. He calls his country “beautiful” but says “there are some places where you can’t go, especially as a young man.” Valle’s father was murdered by gang members six years ago when he missed the extortion payment for his bakery. Extortion is widespread in El Salvador, affecting nine out of 10 small businesses, according to the National Council of Small Business of El Salvador. Facing gang threats, Valle fled. In El Salvador, he says, there’s no future for him – or the two-year-old son he left in Los Angeles. Spending more than a few days with his only brother in their home district plagued by warring gangs is too dangerous, so Valle will head north again shortly. “I don’t know if I’ll be able to cross again,” he said. “But I’m going to try again for my son and my mother. You can’t live here with the way the situation is.” Reporting for this article was funded in part by a fellowship from the International Women’s Media Foundation",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/salvadorans-deported-from-us-facing-violence-fleeing-poverty,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/salvadorans-deported-from-us-facing-violence-fleeing-poverty
2018-06-23T23:36:58Z,world,World news,Rosario Dawson on getting weird for ugly animals: 'I’m not afraid to get my jazz hands on',"There’s nothing like an endangered species listing to engender a sense of urgency. That was the case for US actor Rosario Dawson and a host of Australian celebrities who have lent their talents to the Wilderness Society’s #saveugly campaign to draw attention to Australia’s less charismatic animals under threat. “Our star turtle, our Mary river turtle, was on the brink of becoming endangered and she became endangered while we were shooting,” says Dawson, speaking from Los Angeles as the campaign launched last week.
The #saveugly video is charming and funny, with Dawson dancing around dressed as the Ethmia clytodoxa moth. The turtle is voiced by Cate Blanchett and the ghost shark by Joel Edgerton. But the campaign message is important: all wildlife has a role to play in a balanced ecosystem. “We can just focus on the things that are comfortable or the things that are easy or the things that get the most attention,” says Dawson. “The ugly truth is that if we ignore any of the different parts of this whole system, it’s all going to collapse.” The actor is known for her activism as much as her roles in films such as Sin City, Seven Pounds and Men in Black II, and TV shows such as Luke Cage and Jane the Virgin. She has been involved in conservation, LGBTQ and domestic violence campaigns, and in 2016 she was arrested for taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations in Washington DC. Activism has been part of her life since she was young. She grew up on New York’s lower east side in the 80s, at a time when AIDS, the crack and heroin epidemic and the homelessness crisis were all hitting hard. “It’s the intersectionality between all of these issues that has always been really apparent to me.”
And she doesn’t hold back on the child detentions happening on the US/Mexican border. “It’s horrifying,” she says. “I think that we’re seeing a strategy to really divide people and keep people in a consistent space of despair and reaction mode.” Yet despite the countless issues demanding attention, Dawson is hopeful that campaigns like this can have a wider impact thanks to technology. “Something like this going viral can really spread this message to a lot of people who might not be interested in the [Wilderness Society] especially because there is so much going on.”
She has always tried to blend creativity with her activism. “I’m not afraid to get my jazz hands on and be like, hey, look at this, this is important, just as much as the next film I have coming out. They all need to be amplified, all these different parts. They are all stories that are important to me as a storyteller.” And it helps to keep it light. “So many of the organisers and activists that I grew up with, they really suffered so much by martyring themselves for these different causes and not putting in any breaks, not having enough access to healing and humour and the life vitality that you need to do this work.”
Younger actor activists like Yara Shahidi, who campaigns on US voter turnout program Eighteen x 18, have the right idea, says Dawson. “It’s really refreshing to see this new young generation that’s coming up that’s really active and very serious about making an impact.” Dawson demurs when asked about her on-screen future with Luke Cage, the Netflix Marvel TV franchise that she has been part of in various incarnations for the past few years. Earlier this year she hinted that she might be finishing up, causing a ripple of concern among fans. “I don’t know,” she says now. “I’ve been on five different shows so you never know what will happen down the road.” For now, she hopes to encourage more people to get engaged. She was disheartened by the low turnout at the recent Californian primary elections, with only 35% turning out to vote: “People are marching and tweeting and posting and they are doing all this different stuff but they also really need to vote.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/rosario-dawson-on-getting-weird-for-ugly-animals-im-not-afraid-to-get-my-jazz-hands-on,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/rosario-dawson-on-getting-weird-for-ugly-animals-im-not-afraid-to-get-my-jazz-hands-on
2018-06-23T14:47:35Z,world,World news,UK ‘hides extent of arms sales to Saudi Arabia’,"Hundreds of millions of pounds worth of British-made missiles and bombs have been sold to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen under an opaque licensing system that makes tracking arms sales more difficult. The disclosure has prompted accusations that the government is trying to mask the true extent of British-made arms exports to Saudi, a claim denied by the Department for International Trade. Britain’s role in selling weapons to the Saudis is attracting controversy amid the kingdom’s operations in Yemen, where thousands of people have died and millions have been displaced in a proxy war. Human rights groups allege that the Saudi-led coalition backing the country’s government has been targeting civilian infrastructure and buildings, something that would constitute a war crime. Iran-backed Houthi rebels fighting the Saudi-led coalition have also been accused of committing war crimes against civilians in the key port city of Hodeidah, now the scene of heavy fighting and where there are fears of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Britain has consistently said that it keeps all arms exports under close scrutiny and that licensing is made on a case-by-case basis. But now a freedom of information request reveals that for the last five years, Britain has been selling Storm Shadow and Brimstone air-to-surface missiles and Paveway IV bombs to the Saudis under what are known as Open Individual Export Licences (OIELs), which the government says are for the export of “less sensitive goods”. Unlike specific licences, OIELs allow an unlimited number of consignments over a fixed period, typically between three and five years. There is no obligation to publish the total value of the licence after it expires. “Open licences remove the need for the seller to obtain prior approval for each export,” said Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade, which submitted the FOI. “It’s an opaque system which has been used to shift extremely sensitive weaponry to the Saudi regime.” The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which uses open sources to measure the quantities of arms exported each year, estimates that, since 2013, around 100 British-made Storm Shadow missiles worth £80m, 2,400 Paveway IV bombs worth £150m, and 1,000 Brimstone missiles worth £100m have been sold to Saudi Arabia.
“Open licences issued in the years before Saudi Arabia intervened in Yemen’s civil war are still being used for the export of hundreds of millions of pounds of bombs today. If it were not for this Observer report neither parliament nor the committee tasked with scrutinising arms exports, on which I sit, would have any idea that these weapons are being sent,” said Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who sits on the Commons committee on arms export controls. In 2015, the process for issuing OIELs was updated, with a view to encouraging their greater use. The committee strongly criticised the move, claiming it would “inescapably reduce the transparency” of Britain’s arms exports. But the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which at the time was responsible for the Export Control Organisation, the agency that oversees the sale of military exports,insisted that the policy applied to the export of “less sensitive goods to less sensitive destinations.” The government has confirmed that all three weapon systems have been used in Yemen, where Human Rights Watch has linked British-licensed Paveway IV bombs to attacks on civilian targets. In December 2016, Sky News examined an attack site where part of a Storm Shadow missile with UK markings was found. The government insists that it operates one of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world with all export licence applications assessed on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. But this claim was challenged by the arms trade campaigner, Smith. “By the government’s own admission it is trying to encourage more companies to use this type of licence,” he said. “If permission is not needed before a specific export of missiles or bombs takes place, then how can it claim to operate a case-by-case system?” A Department for International Trade spokesperson said claims that OIELs allowed Britain to export arms without close scrutiny were “completely untrue”. “The export of Paveway IV bombs, Storm Shadow missiles and Brimstone air to surface missiles are made under a longstanding government-to-government defence cooperation programme between the UK and Saudi Arabia,” the spokesman explained. “OIELs are not a simple or quick option for exporters and the application process can take several months. Terms and conditions for use will vary depending on the goods and export destinations. Holders of OIELs are subject to audit by DIT compliance inspectors.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/23/uk-hides-arms-trade-saudi-arabia--yemen,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/23/uk-hides-arms-trade-saudi-arabia--yemen
2018-06-23T13:40:48Z,world,World news,'A crack in the edifice': privacy advocates hail supreme court cellphone data ruling,"If you live in the US and carry a cellphone, you might as well be wearing an ankle monitor that logs your location every 15 minutes and maintains an archive of that information dating back as much as five years. That may sound like the scaremongering of a privacy advocate, but the analogy comes from Chief Justice John Roberts who, on Friday, authored a majority opinion ruling in the supreme court that the government could no longer access an individual’s cellphone location data without a warrant.
“A cellphone faithfully follows its owner beyond public thoroughfares and into private residences, doctor’s offices, political headquarters, and other potentially revealing locales,” Roberts wrote, noting that 12% of people even take their phones in the shower. “Accordingly, when the government tracks the location of a cell phone it achieves near perfect surveillance, as if it had attached an ankle monitor to the phone’s user.” The case, Carpenter v United States, is being hailed as a “groundbreaking victory for Americans’ privacy rights in the digital age” by Nathan Freed Wessler, the ACLU attorney who argued the case before the supreme court in November. That is because, as Andrew Crocker of the Electronic Frontier Foundation explains, the ruling is “a crack in the edifice” of the “third-party doctrine” – a long-established legal theory that holds that if an individual shares information with a third party, they no longer enjoy constitutional privacy rights. In practical purposes, this means that the government needs only a subpoena or court order to obtain bank records or phone call history, rather than a search warrant – which is harder to get. “The government has been close to running the table on those kind of cases,” Crocker said. “They’ve had almost free rein.” The Carpenter case, for example, stems from an investigation into a string of robberies in Michigan in 2011. Armed with the cellphone numbers of 16 potential suspects, the FBI was able to get a court order for those numbers’ cell-site location information (CSLI). In the case of one of the suspects, Timothy Carpenter, the government received 12,898 time-stamped logs of every time the phone connected to a cellular network over 127 days, which averages out to a log of his location every 14 minutes for more than 4 months. Under the third-party doctrine, Carpenter (or any other cellphone user) could not claim that this data was private because he had “shared” it with his mobile service provider. And Carpenter’s case is by no means unusual. In an amicus brief he filed for the EFF, Crocker noted that AT&T received 70,528 requests for CSLI in 2016, while Verizon received 53,532. About 75% of the requests to Verizon in 2016 were made without a warrant. And while the law has remained in the pre-smartphone age, the amount of data that we generate and share with third parties – not just phone companies, but also internet service providers and web service providers – has rapidly expanded. “It’s impossible to go five minutes without creating sensitive data that is then held by someone else,” said Crocker. “The amount of data being compiled about all of us just continues to grow and grow.” Plus, the fact that those third parties usually retain all that sensitive data for some length of time has meant that the government has access to “a surveillance time machine”, said Alex Abdo, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute. Normally, when the government puts a suspect under surveillance (by, for example, tapping their phone or following them), the surveillance begins when the investigator gets authorization and then goes forward in time, Abdo explained. But with digital records like CSLI, the government can achieve retrospective surveillance of extraordinary detail. In the Carpenter ruling, Roberts made clear that he is not comfortable writing off an individual’s right to privacy for this kind of incredibly detailed and practically unavoidable data just because it involves a third party. “He tries to craft a narrow opinion, but you can see that he’s concerned with how to conceive of privacy in a world where we are all constantly tracked and monitored,” Abdo said. “Time will tell how far the courts will go in recognizing privacy in the digital age, but I think his opinion is a good omen.” In a dissenting opinion, Justice Samuel Alito worried that the ruling “guarantees a blizzard of litigation while threatening many legitimate and valuable investigative practices upon which law enforcement has rightfully come to rely.” Crocker concurred, saying, “You can be sure that EFF and the ACLU and our fellow travelers will be using these kinds of arguments for other forms of information that companies have access to.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/23/us-supreme-court-cellphona-data-ruling-privacy,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/23/us-supreme-court-cellphona-data-ruling-privacy
2018-06-23T13:20:59Z,world,World news,MP aims to ban homophobic chants at football matches,"Homophobic chanting at football matches could be made illegal under a proposal from a Conservative MP. Damian Collins will join forces with the former Wales rugby union captain Gareth Thomas on Monday to launch a draft amendment to the Football Offences Act 1991 that would outlaw indecent and homophobic chanting. Chanting of an “indecent or racialist” nature is banned at football games, but due to confusion over its interpretation the draft bill aims to explicitly ban chants and gestures that make indecent references to “sexual orientation and gender identity”. The MP for Folkestone and Hythe said: “The time has come to move from acknowledgement to action. That is why Gareth and I are seeking to amend the Football Offences Act 1991 to make chanting or gesturing of an indecent nature with reference to sexual orientation or gender identity against the law. “When the Football Offences Act came into force, it made racialist abuse within football stadia illegal. The proposed amendment, which I will present to the House of Commons on Monday, seeks to extend that legal protection to LGBT+ players and fans.”
Collins cited the 10,000 Swiss francs (£7,615) fine handed to the Mexico football federation over chants by some fans last weekend and called for sport governing bodies to take stern action against similar instances. He said: “Whilst, if enacted, the bill would protect LGBT+ fans and players in the UK, recent events, including at the World Cup, have once again demonstrated that homophobic abuse takes place at football matches the world over. “Fifa and other sports governing bodies should take the necessary steps to ensure that homophobic abuse will never be tolerated and that action will be taken against people that engage in activities like these, no matter where the game is played. “We hope that the bill will soon become law and will contribute to making football a sport that is truly open to everyone.” Thomas, who made 100 appearances for Wales, scoring 41 tries, came out as gay in 2009, shortly after he and his wife divorced. He moved to rugby league in March 2010, making four appearances for Wales, and retired from all forms of rugby in October 2011.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/23/mp-ban-homophobic-chants-football-matches-damian-collins,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/23/mp-ban-homophobic-chants-football-matches-damian-collins
2018-06-23T08:00:06Z,world,World news,DRC set for turmoil as Jean-Pierre Bemba expected home within weeks,"Jean-Pierre Bemba, the Congolese opposition leader whose war crimes convictions at the international criminal court (ICC) were quashed, is expected to return to the Democratic Republic of the Congo within weeks, risking an intense new phase of political manoeuvring and instability in the vast and impoverished central African state. Bemba, a former rebel leader and vice president, left the country in 2007 and spent the last 10 years in prison in The Hague before his surprise acquittal on appeal. The 55-year-old is free in Belgium pending a hearing on a separate conviction for attempting to influence witnesses, but will travel to his homeland to attend a party congress to select a candidate for a presidential election due in December, a party spokesman said on Friday. Joseph Kabila, whose second term expired in 2016, has repeatedly postponed the poll. He is barred from a third term by the constitution and his close associates have repeatedly denied that he hopes to find a way to stand again. Bemba has a powerful support base in the DRC and experts describe his return as “a huge wildcard”. “On his own, as an opposition leader, he could do extremely well,” said Stephanie Wolters, an analyst based in South Africa. “He is seen as a victim of Joseph Kabila’s politics and of international politics. If the opposition unite it would be very hard to see a Kabila victory that was anything but stolen.” The opposition in the DRC is fragmented, with neither of the two current main leaders – Félix Tshisekedi and Moïse Katumbi – committing to a formal coalition backing a single candidate. Bemba unsuccessfully opposed Kabila in elections in 2006. After his militia clashed violently with government forces in 2007, he was forced out of the DRC and arrested in Belgium. Judges at the ICC initially found Bemba guilty on five counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by his private army during a five-month rampage in the neighbouring Central African Republic in 2002. Bemba had sent his militia, the MLC – a rebel force that he later transformed into a political organisation – into the Congo’s northern neighbour to quash a coup against the then president, Ange-Félix Patassé. The 18-year sentence was the longest ever to be handed down by the court. “Many people in the DRC have always seen his indictment for crimes in the CAR as politicised. He is the only politician of national stature to be sent to The Hague and is a lot more credible as an opposition leader than Katumbi or Tshisekedi,” said Wolters. The attitude of regional powers will be key in coming months, with western powers seemingly without significant influence on Kabila, who succeeded his assassinated father, Laurent, in 2001. The US said on Thursday it had imposed visa bans on several unidentified senior officials in the DRC for corruption tied to the country’s electoral process to send a “strong signal” about the need for a peaceful transfer of power. The move comes after the US Treasury sanctioned the Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler on15 June, saying he had amassed a fortune through corrupt mining and oil deals in the DRC using his close friendship with Kabila. Sasha Lezhnev, deputy policy director at the nonprofit rights group Enough Project, called Thursday’s visa ban an important step “to dissuade Kabila from putting his name on the ballot and help ensure a credible election”. “Several senior Congolese officials involved in corruption travel frequently to the US, so the visa ban is an important step,” said Lezhnev. “They or the businesses they partner with also use US banks to process corrupt commercial deals, so the US and EU should enact stronger sanctions on their corporate networks to target their assets.” Corruption costs the DRC at least $15bn each year, or about three times its annual budget, according to Kabila’s anti-graft adviser. “It’s an open secret that corruption exists and it is seriously eating away at institutions,” Emmanuel Luzolo Bambi told the UN’s news website Okapi. The DRC, which Kabila has run since 2001, has the reputation of being one of the world’s poorest, most volatile and graft-riddled countries. In Transparency International’s 2017 Corruption Perceptions Index, the DRC ranked 161 out of 180 countries. The World Bank estimates GDP per capita annual income at $450, or 225th out of 237 economies surveyed.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/23/drc-jean-pierre-bemba-expected-home-within-weeks-kabila,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/23/drc-jean-pierre-bemba-expected-home-within-weeks-kabila
2018-06-23T07:16:35Z,world,World news,Cambodia: 33 pregnant women found in raid on child surrogacy ring,"Thirty-three pregnant Cambodian women who were carrying babies on behalf of Chinese clients have been discovered during a raid on an illegal commercial surrogacy operation, police said on Saturday. Police arrested the group of pregnant surrogates and five alleged ringleaders in the Phnom Penh raid two days ago in the latest police crackdown on illegal child surrogacy. Phnom Penh anti-trafficking police chief Keo Thea said one of the five, a Chinese national, appeared to be the mastermind behind the “rent a womb” operation run out of a villa in the capital’s Russey Keo district.
He said police seized passports and other documents and the five would be sent to court on Sunday to be charged under Cambodia’s anti-trafficking laws. “They are carrying babies for Chinese nationals,” he said, adding that each woman was promised $10,000 for the service. The case is the second of its kind in Cambodia and the first series of arrests since Australian nurse Tammy Davis-Charles was sentenced to 18 months behind bars, along with two Cambodian colleagues. One anti-trafficking official, who asked not to be named , confirmed local reports that the Chinese national was named Liu Quang.
The 33 women were housed at the villa and were at various stages of pregnancy, he said. They had been connected to the business through brokers and were sourced from villages in Kandal, Prey Veng and Kampot provinces. Practitioners of commercial surrogacy flooded into Cambodia after it was banned in places like India, Nepal and Thailand, in the wake of the infamous Baby Gammy case. Individuals and couples desperate for a child of their own often face prohibitive costs or laws in their own countries, prompting them to turn to cheaper options in Asia, where the price for a child costs roughly $50,000. Between US$8,000 and US$10,000 of that is paid to Cambodian surrogates.
Surrogacy flourished in Cambodia until a snap edict from the Health Ministry outlawed the practice in October 2016. Davis-Charles and her associates were jailed the following month. While some foreign fertility agencies pulled out of Cambodia, commercial surrogacy continued to thrive in the shadows, often with pregnant surrogates flown to Thailand for the birth of the child to circumvent Cambodian courts. Rodrigo Montero, gender adviser at the United Nations Development Programme, said the new case showed authorities were enforcing the law. “The bad news is that it proves that a hidden international surrogacy industry is still operating in Cambodia,” he said. After their initial arrest the 33 surrogates were sent to the Ministry of Social Affairs, which will coordinate with NGOs to support the women, said Mom Chandany from Phnom Penh’s Social Affairs Department. Chou Bun Eng, permanent vice chair of the National Committee for Counter Trafficking, said in the absence of a law on surrogacy, perpetrators could be prosecuted under anti-trafficking laws, although advocates of commercial surrogacy have dismissed the false comparison.
“We try to protect the baby in the womb,” Bun Eng said. The anti-trafficking law says a person can be sentenced to between two and 20 years in prison if a child is sold for the purposes of adoption. Cambodia’s surrogacy law has faced repeated delays, but officials say an altruistic alternative is being considered in the legislation.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/23/cambodia-33-pregnant-women-found-in-raid-on-child-surrogacy-ring,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/23/cambodia-33-pregnant-women-found-in-raid-on-child-surrogacy-ring
2018-06-23T07:00:07Z,world,World news,How alleged Toronto serial killer Bruce McArthur went unnoticed,"When the biggest forensic investigation in Toronto history began, it was still possible to be blind to the full extent of the horror. On 18 January 2018, in the mid-morning, Bruce McArthur, a 66-year-old freelance landscaper, entered his Thorncliffe Park apartment building in Toronto, accompanied by a young man.
McArthur had been placed under 24-hour police watch the previous day. The surveillance officers had instructions to arrest him if they saw him alone with someone else. They ascended to McArthur’s 19th-floor apartment and broke down the door. Inside, they found his companion already tied to the bed. McArthur was charged with the murder of Andrew Kinsman, 49, who had gone missing shortly after Pride Day on 26 June 2017, and Selim Esen, 44, who was reported missing about two months earlier. As a particularly cold winter dragged on into February, the city was horrified as police began to unearth the remains of corpses buried inside more than a dozen decorative planters. The planters were located outside a modest home, on Mallory Crescent in the Leaside area of the city, where McArthur had been employed as a gardener. Police issued a plea to anyone who might have used McArthur’s services, and deployed cadaver dogs to multiple locations across Toronto. They erected tents and used heaters to thaw the frozen ground. Forensic investigators combed over McArthur’s two-bedroom apartment for months, removing 1,800 pieces of evidence and photographing every square inch. The number of murder charges grew to five (Majeed Kayhan, 58; Dean Lisowick, 47; and Soroush Mahmudi, 50), then eight (Skandaraj Navaratnam, 40; Abdulbasir Faizi, 44; and Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam, 37). Six of the men were south Asian or Middle Eastern. All of them were gay.
The LGBT community in Toronto was shocked, bereaved – and furious. From 2010 to 2017, gay men had been disappearing in alarming numbers from Toronto’s lively gay village. Many locals had long suspected a serial killer. Long-simmering tensions with the Toronto police boiled over. Organisers demanded to know why the force hadn’t taken their fears more seriously. Some argued that police were too slow to warn the community of a possible serial killer, saying lives could have been saved. To make matters worse, Toronto police appeared to put some blame on the gay community for the killings when chief Mark Saunders told reporters that they might have caught McArthur sooner had residents of the gay village been more forthcoming. “We knew that people were missing and we knew we didn’t have the right answers,” Saunders said. “But nobody was coming to us with anything.” Toronto police had already been banned in 2017 from the Gay Pride parade, following lobbying from Toronto’s chapter of Black Lives Matter. Their request to participate in 2018 was refused. Then, in April, in a move that some have interpreted as an acknowledgment of their neglect of the gay community, police announced that they were reopening 25 cold cases – all murders associated with Toronto’s gay village. They date from 1997 all the way back to 1975. And no one is suggesting it is over. From Santa to serial killer While investigators are still developing a profile of the alleged serial killer, they are certain of one thing. The jolly-looking McArthur, who is divorced and has two grown children, did not have the menacing countenance of a serial murderer. In fact, he was so convincingly harmless looking that he was able to play Santa in at least one suburban shopping mall. His age, as well as his unthreatening appearance – round features and a broad, cheery smile – made him seem approachable to children shopping with their parents, as well as to gay men seeking a dark sexual encounter with someone they could trust.
After divorcing his wife, McArthur, who had been active on his church board in Oshawa, east of Toronto, became a regular in the city’s gay village. He trolled hook-up sites like Manjam and Recon, where the “silver fox” made his taste for submissive men clear – especially those who wanted to test the limits of their curiosity for dangerous sex. McArthur had been brought to the attention of local police in 2002, when he was arrested for attacking a gay prostitute with a metal bar. He was sentenced in 2003 to two years probation and told to stay away from the gay village. In 2010, reports started to come through of men going missing from the village. The first, Skandaraj Navaratnam, rests particularly heavily on the mind of Haran Vijayanathan, executive director of the Alliance for South Asian Aids Prevention (ASAAP). Both men are Sri Lankan, Tamil and gay. “I saw myself in Skanda,” says Vijayanathan. “He represents my greatest fear.” That fear – one faced by immigrant and refugee men in an unfamiliar gay community – is nothing new. Just as gay men from North Bay and Moose Jaw flocked to Toronto in the 1970s to live free and open lives, a new generation of gay men from south Asia and the Middle East have been drawn to Canada in the last 20 years for the same reasons. The new arrivals may revel in Canada’s acceptance, but they are still vulnerable – still suspicious of authority, reluctant to attract attention, perhaps too eager to fit in. And perhaps too trusting of a gentle-looking older man who appears harmless. Predators thrive on marginalized groups, says University of Toronto associate professor of sociology Jooyoung Lee, an expert in violent crime and serial homicide. Gay men – particularly gay refugees or other relatively new Canadians – fit into a population that includes prostitutes, aboriginal women and immigrants. And then there is what Lee refers to as “missing white woman syndrome”: the idea that police, media and the public are less inclined to pay attention to crimes that are perpetrated on marginalized communities. Vijayanathan, who is one of the most outspoken critics of how Toronto let its gay community down, insists that police only took the investigations seriously when Andrew Kinsman, one of two white victims, was reported missing. But he also points to racism within the gay community – comparing the massive local search mounted after the reported disappearance of the other white victim, Andrew Kinsman, with the slower and less cohesive response to the disappearances of the brown-skinned victims. Vijayanathan also believes the families of some of the missing immigrant men failed to report their disappearance.
In some cases, he says, the disappearances were the first time family members learned their relative was gay (or MSM, men who have sex with men but don’t identify as gay). Others worried about interfering in a family member’s claim for refugee status. Still others worked under the table and didn’t want to attract the attention of authorities. For example, Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam was a Tamil refugee who came to Canada in 2016 and was never reported missing, and after Navaratnam’s refugee claim was denied he rarely left the confines of the gay village. “Throughout our history, people have come to the city as a refuge and a place to explore their sexuality – often without the knowledge of their family and friends,” says Tom Hooper, a York University historian who has devoted much of his studies to the gay experience in Toronto in the 1970s. But Hooper also points the finger at police. “For both gay men in the 1970s and queer people of colour today, the police have been enforcers but not protectors. Isolation, combined with a fear of police, has marginalized members of our community and made them more vulnerable to violence.” Homophobic atmosphere The difficult relationship between Toronto’s gay community and police force coincides with reports of missing gay men going back decades. As long as 40 years ago, 14 gay men were murdered in Toronto in just a few years. Seven of those cases remain unsolved. The brutal stabbing death of William Duncan Robinson at his home in November 1978 came shortly after the popular 1970s gay magazine the Body Politic to question the sluggish police response to the string of murders, and the official stance that they were unrelated: “Could they have been committed by one man?” asked an October 1978 headline. “The police aren’t saying. But the crimes do show a certain similarity …” It has been suggested that McArthur, who has not yet entered a plea in the eight charges nor been charged for any of the cold cases, could be responsible for some of those murders. Serial killers rarely begin their murder sprees late in life, and McArthur would have been in his 20s and early 30s back then. Critics dispute that theory by pointing to a very different manner of execution and body disposal: the 1970s murders were mostly stabbings, and the victims were left where they were killed. What is indisputable is that police never caught the killer, or killers – and it’s hardly a stretch to imagine that they didn’t feel much pressure to do so in the homophobic atmosphere of the era.
It was a holiday tradition each Halloween during the 1960s and 70s for Toronto residents to taunt gay men, especially drag queens, as they entered bars on Yonge Street like the St Charles Tavern and the Parkside. They pelted eggs, which turned into rocks, which turned into beatings on darkened side streets. Police mostly looked the other way, recalls the Rev Brent Hawkes, a longtime leader of the city’s gay rights movement who was once himself restrained on a sidewalk by two officers as a third punched him. “Stories of men being arrested and taken to Cherry Beach for a beating were common,” he says. Officers would lurk beside the urinals in bars, waiting for men to engage in a sexual act. Entrapment was widespread at department stores, universities and hotels such as Hudson’s Bay, the Royal York and the University of Toronto. “Sex had to be quick and anonymous,” says Hooper. “There was no courtship that led to sex. If you were married and lived in the suburbs – and you were gay – you had to hook up on your lunch break.”
The constant harassment by police reach the boiling point in 1981, when 200 police officers descended on four gay bathhouses. They marched through the corridors, swinging crowbars and sledgehammers, breaking down doors and corralling groups of men into showers and lounge areas. One officer reportedly commented that he wished the showers were hooked up to gas, Hooper said. Men were arrested and charged according to the city’s antiquated bawdy house laws. A few of the officers were apologetic, but another boisterous contingent “seemed to enjoy it – like jocks in a frat house”, says Hooper. By morning, 250 men had been charged. The humiliation caused some to contemplate suicide. Others were fired from their jobs after police officers called their employers. Many lost the support of family and friends. The raids were a tipping point for Toronto’s gay community. Like the Stonewall riots in New York, the bathhouse raids ignited a fury that led to the city’s modern gay pride movement. Though there had been small events held in previous years, the first official Pride parade was held that spring. Now it’s one of the largest in the world: when the 38th annual Toronto Pride parade takes place this coming Sunday, it will attract close to one million spectators. Sponsors include Home Depot and New Balance, and regular attendees include the prime minster, Justin Trudeau, and the mayor of Toronto, John Tory.
But even as Toronto’s more established gay community gains strength, new arrivals continue to lead marginal, vulnerable lives. DS Hank Idsinga, 50, the lead investigator on the most high-profile of murder cases, is keenly aware of media criticism that police did not take the missing persons reports or speculation of a serial killer seriously because the men were gay and mostly brown-skinned. Idsinga, who joined police services in 1989, acknowledges it will take time to regain the trust of the gay community. He says he is disheartened by the accounts of the bathhouse raids and the history of police hostility. “I’m open to criticism,” he says. “It’s a byproduct of the job. You can block it out or you can listen.” He points out that he was recently scolded by a reporter for using the expression “gay lifestyle”, and promises: “I will avoid the term from now on.” The decision to open the cold cases – Idsinga estimates the number of unresolved cases of murdered gay men at 20 or more – is a belated attempt to make something very wrong at least a bit more right. “I’m not that police officer from 30 years ago,” he says of his attitude to the past. “What can I do to help now?” A community at risk There has always been a small community of gay men who thrill at risky sex, bondage, humiliation and even torture. Assured that they are engaging in role playing, such men submit to their putative captors, who methodically and ritualistically push them to – and perhaps beyond – their “edge”. Sean Cribbin, 50, was one man who had experimented in this fashion. Last summer, he says accepted an online invitation to meet McArthur early one afternoon. Almost a year later, he marvels that he is alive. A former Mr Leatherman in Toronto, Cribbin told Global TV in a wide-ranging interview that he felt comfortable submitting to McArthur’s wishes because he looked so unthreatening. He even brought up the rumour of a serial killer attacking gay men in Toronto, but says McArthur didn’t respond. Unlike McArthur, Cribbin has a tough appearance: sleeve tattoos, a black beard and a thick nose ring. But his voice is soft and his comments thoughtful. “I was the lucky one,” he said. “It could happen to anyone.” First, Cribbin says he accepted the GHB cocktail prepared by McArthur, having asked him to limit the dose to 5ml – the right amount to put him at ease, cause euphoria and “heighten the sexual encounter”.
But after Cribbins says he accepted the restraints McArthur suggested, and with McArthur’s penis in Cribbin’s mouth, his hands tight around his neck and his considerable weight on his chest, Cribbin claims he began sweating heavily – a signal that he had been “over-drugged” – and was overcome with dread. Just then, Cribbin says he heard McArthur’s roommate enter the apartment – an excuse for Cribbin to end the date, dress and return home. Six months later, police reportedly approached Cribbin with a photograph of him taken from McArthur’s home, showing him restrained in what investigators called “the kill position” – moments from certain death. Cribbin, who is in an open relationship, says he is ashamed that he didn’t tell his partner where he was going that sunny afternoon, that he survived while others died. For the first time in his life, he’s afraid of the dark, and he worries the experience may turn him off sex completely. “What if the roommate hadn’t arrived home when he did?” Cribbin said. “I would have simply disappeared.” ‘One foot in the department and one foot in the gay community’ Police may never unearth the full extent of McArthur’s alleged carnage, but if it is proven in court it could be compared to the atrocities of Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed 17 boys in Milwaukee between 1978 and 1991, or John Wayne Gacy, who murdered 33 young men and boys between 1972 and 1978 in Cook County, Illinois. As the investigation deepens, police are under tremendous pressure to solve the crimes – which means trying to understand the man that investigators think is behind them. “[McArthur] probably got a kick out of tricking men into believing he was harmless,” says Lee, who knows that investigators are struggling to get inside McArthur’s head, investigating his social circles and his online activities. Investigators will also want to understand the rituals associated with the killings and the complicated procedures involved in the disposal of his victims’ remains – not least how to fit the corpses into the planters. (Many have speculated that McArthur’s job as a landscaper could involve the use of equipment such as chainsaws and wood chippers.) Lee believes McArthur was probably in a perpetual search “for the next kill that would top the last one. [Serial killers] become overwhelmed by the fantasy, constantly studying the craft of killing, the details of the murder and the memory of his actions afterward … He would get a small rush every time he revisited the remains of the people he killed.” How McArthur may have slipped up, or why police decided to place him under surveillance, Idsinga won’t say. But, according to Lee, one thing is certain. “Killing requires practice,” he says. “They are seldom perfect in the beginning. Serial killers are caught when they get sloppy.”
But as well as getting into the head of McArthur, it means trying to heal a rift with the gay community that stretches back decades. This Sunday’s otherwise jubiliant Pride parade will end with a contingent of organizers dressed in black, to pay respect to the victims of the killer and to all LGBTQ people who don’t feel safe in their own community. While some in the gay community argue that this is a time for healing – and that police participation is crucial if the gay community is going to move forward – Black Lives Matter is not so eager to forgive, insisting that banning uniformed officers is a needed protest against broader police neglect and abuse.
Shortly after McArthur’s arrest, the mayor acknowledged that police had failed to react appropriately to the multiple disappearances, and called for an independent investigation into the department’s response. Vijayanathan, who is the Honoured Grand Marshall of the Pride Parade and was the chief advocate of a third-party inquest into the investigation of the killings, is torn. He’s still angry over what he calls “a gross mishandling of missing person reports”. But he is pleased at the mayor’s response, and acknowledges that to heal, the community will have to work with police. He also expresses sympathy for the many LGBTQ members on Toronto’s police force who usually enjoy marching in uniform in the Parade. Hawkes says he has witnessed the growing maturity of the department over the decades – with an emphasis placed on sensitivity training and recruiting gay officers, including an openly lesbian deputy chief. “I don’t want to sound like a defender of the police but I am cautiously optimistic things will get better,” he says, “because I’ve seen that progress in possible.” He also knows that gay and lesbian police officers are devastated that they’ve been rejected by the Pride committee. “They’ve got one foot in the police department and one foot in the gay community,” he says. Idsinga says: “I’d rather see police services participate. And because of the McArthur case, I’d like to participate myself.” In the meantime, there are now dozens of cold cases to investigate. “This community has been victimized for years,” Idsinga says. “It’s our job to stop that.” • This article was amended on 25 June 2018.

2018-06-23T06:00:03Z,world,World news,Kashmir on edge after local government falls amid militant clashes,"The disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir is on edge after clashes between militants and security forces, and the collapse of the local government over disagreements that include how to tackle the resurgent fighting in the state.
A month-long unilateral ceasefire declared by the Indian government for Ramadan expired a week ago. Recent events, including the first official acknowledgement that Islamic State-inspired fighters may be operating in Kashmir, have raised fears of another violent summer ahead for the troubled region. In the latest incident on Friday, security forces fought a nearly seven-hour gun battle with militants in the southern district of Anantnag. Four rebels, a police officer and a civilian were killed in the shooting, police said. It is the third clash between Indian authorities and militants since the end of Ramadan, during which security forces had suspended their operations as part of a new push to initiate dialogue with separatists, whose goals include independence or merger with Pakistan. Police chief Shesh Paul Vaid identified the slain fighters as members of a local unit that claims to be affiliated with Isis. This is the first time the police have acknowledged the presence of Isis-inspired or affiliated fighters in Kashmir.
The Isis-affiliated “news service” Amaq issued a statement on Friday claiming the fighters were members of its group, but analysts have raised doubts about what contact, if any, the terrorist group has with the militant group, which calls itself Islamic State Jammu and Kashmir (ISJK). The restarting of security operations after Ramadan and the decision of authorities to acknowledge the existence of ISJK come during a period of political instability in Kashmir after the collapse of the state government this week. The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), which is part of the national government, announced on Tuesday that it was pulling out of a governing coalition with the local Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic party, known by the initials PDP.
Ram Madhav, the BJP official who brokered the alliance in 2015, said it was no longer tenable “keeping in mind the largest interest of India’s integrity and to bring the deteriorating situation in the state under control”. The intensity of fighting in Kashmir has steadily grown in the past three years with the emergence of a new generation of anti-India militants.
The BJP has traditionally favoured taking a hard line against Kashmiri separatism, a stance that put pressure on its alliance with the PDP, which is considered more sympathetic to the cause. How to tackle the militancy was thought to be a deep fault line in the relationship. “We have always said muscular [security] policy will not work in Jammu and Kashmir,” the PDP leader, Mehbooba Mufti, said on Tuesday after the collapse of the government. “We cannot treat Jammu and Kashmir as an enemy territory.” Additional checkpoints have sprung up in restive parts of Kashmir since the collapse of the government. Control of the state has temporarily passed to its governor, NN Vohra, until a new government can be formed. Vaid said he expected security operations would “intensify” in coming days and that the job of police would become “much easier” under Vohra’s rule.
Kashmir, a former princely state (semi-sovereign territory) under the Raj, has been divided since 1947 between sections controlled by Pakistan, India and China. Pakistan and India both claim the entire region as their own. A United Nations resolution issued in 1948 demands that India allow Kashmiris a plebiscite to decide whether they remain part of the Indian union or become independent, but no such vote has ever been organised by Delhi. An armed rebellion broke out in 1989 against Indian rule and has raged at varying levels of intensity in the years since. The fighting is thought to have killed at least 40,000 people in the past three decades, according to Indian government estimates.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/23/kashmir-on-edge-after-local-government-falls-amid-militant-clashes,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/23/kashmir-on-edge-after-local-government-falls-amid-militant-clashes
2018-06-23T06:00:03Z,world,World news,'It's momentous': Saudi women excited to finally hit the road,"Hamsa al-Sonosi’s new red Range Rover has been sitting in her driveway for two months, its engine only started for brief, furtive trips around the block. Just after midnight on Saturday, both Sonosi and her car will no longer have to hide. A goal she had aspired to for most of her life – to drive herself wherever she pleased – will become a reality for Sonosi, as well as for a selected minority of other women in Saudi Arabia, who for the first time will legally be able to take to the roads. “I didn’t think I’d see this day in my lifetime,” said Sonosi, in her home office, surrounded by equally enthusiastic friends. “People have come back from abroad for this day alone. It’s momentous.” The much-heralded move is the centrepiece of a reform programme that has reached previously forbidden corners of the rigid kingdom, stripping away decades of repression that severely limited women’s role in society and left Saudi Arabia as the last country in the world where women were banned from driving. The overturning of the ban has been used by the country’s leaders as a marker of a new era, with repressive social conservatism ostensibly replaced by newly bestowed rights. Not long ago, images of women behind the wheel caused conniptions in the kingdom. Now, photos of beaming women holding driving licences are being used to herald lasting change.
Sonosi is one of 30 women in Jeddah, the kingdom’s second city, to have been granted a licence. Many thousands more have applied. Those allowed to drive have been carefully selected. The politics of women driving, and who gets to claim credit for it, has become increasingly loaded. Up to 17 Saudi women at the forefront of the campaign have been detained in the past two months. Nine remain in prison, among them prominent activists accused of undermining the kingdom and aiding its enemies. Several have been accused of “treason” by state-run newspapers. Those released have been told not to talk to foreigners, prompting a belief among many Saudis that their detention was more about who gets to claim credit for the move. “This has to be seen to come from the top,” said one prominent activist. “It must be a gift from the rulers, not the result of grassroots pressure. They don’t want to look like they bowed to a specific demand.” Human Rights Watch claimed this week that two more women, Nouf Abdelaziz and Mayaa al-Zahrani, had been arrested Before apparently being detained, Abdelaziz had written: “I am not a provoker, not a vandaliser, not a terrorist, a criminal or a traitor. I have never been [anything] but a good citizen who loves her country and wishes for it nothing but the best.” In Sonosi’s home, she and her friends were sceptical. “They did not go to jail because they were females who were active on social media, the government released a statement that they were dealing with foreign powers,” she said. “The Saudi government would not take a risk like this at a time when they are trying to change their image.” Kholood al-Ghamdi, 30, had returned to Saudi Arabia for the first time in four years from her studies in California to witness the day. “I like macho cars, and motorbikes,” she said. “I get a lot of speeding tickets. When I saw the changes taking place here, it made me cry.”
In a Jeddah coffee shop, two other Saudi women said they too were excited at the change, but reluctant to embrace it themselves. “I haven’t taken my driving lessons yet nor have I applied for a licence, said Rua, 26. “Of course I’m excited that women are now able to drive but I’m a bit wary. I’m not psychologically ready for something like this. My parents are supportive but I’m still in the process of preparing myself.” Wafaa, 28, was also enthusiastic. “It’s been a long time coming,” she said. “We are all excited and so are my parents but I’m not very keen on being the first one to drive on Sunday. I’d rather wait and see how it’s all going to go. Let’s see how the society is going to take it. When I feel safe enough I’ll get behind the wheel.” Back in Sonosi’s well-to-do district, the merits of being allowed to drive were overriding societal concerns. “It is more than having a key to your own car,” she said. “Women can finally be independent from their own families. Mothers can enjoy simple things, like taking her kids to school. Salaries for drivers can be expensive. This is empowering for women. It gives comfort and independence.” Driving schools around Saudi Arabia are reporting increased interest, and car dealers a spike in sales – mostly to men, who have passed on their purchases to wives or daughters. The rollout of licences has so far been methodical; even in more open times, state control remains tight. In government offices, there remains widespread wariness about the lifting of the ban. Some clerics have expressed beliefs that women are not psychologically competent to drive. Private conversations with some men can quickly turn to muttered resentment about the changes afoot. At Jeddah airport, a passport control officer said: “Our women are excited. We’re scared. God knows the accidents that will happen but let them. They’ve been nagging us for ages and now they got what they wanted. It’s time for them to take care and spoil us now.” Additional reporting by Nadia al-Faour",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/23/its-momentous-saudi-women-excited-finally-hit-road-driving-ban,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/23/its-momentous-saudi-women-excited-finally-hit-road-driving-ban
2018-06-23T04:00:46Z,world,World news,"Just election in Turkey not possible, says imprisoned Kurdish candidate","Dressed in a suit and burgundy tie, Selahattin Demirtaş addressed his supporters through Turkey’s state-run TV. He urged citizens to vote against one-man rule by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his ruling party, the AKP, whom he described as bullies. But there was one difference between all the other presidential candidates and Demirtaş, once dubbed the Kurdish Obama and leader of a persecuted leftwing party focused on Kurdish and minority rights. He was addressing his supporters from his cell at a maximum-security prison in Edirne, where he is standing trial over alleged terrorism offences.
“I am answering your interview questions from prison; how can it be fair?” said Demirtaş in an interview with the Guardian, conducted through his lawyers. “Because of the state of emergency, fear has taken over the population. Erdoğan conducts a campaign with the whole power of the state, media almost fully under his order. A just election race is not possible.” Turkish citizens vote on Sunday in arguably the most crucial presidential and parliamentary elections in the republic’s modern history. Kurdish voters, who make up 15-20% of the population, have emerged as kingmakers once again and could end the AKP’s 16-year parliamentary majority and bruise Erdoğan, Turkey’s most powerful politician. The winner of the presidency will assume sweeping new powers narrowly approved in a referendum last year. Reliable polls are rare in Turkey, but on average they appear to predict that Erdoğan will win the vote in a second-round contest against Muharrem İnce, the opposition candidate from the secular Republican People’s party (CHP). The parliamentary elections are more complicated, with two main coalitions facing off against each other. Erdoğan’s AKP is allied with the nationalist party, the MHP. The opposition has united in a grand coalition, which includes secularists, Islamists and breakaway nationalists, to improve its chances of picking up parliamentary seats. Demirtaş’s Peoples’ Democratic party (HDP) is not in any alliance, and therefore needs to get at least 10% of the national vote to enter parliament. “There is an immense will for change in Turkey,” he said. “People are fed up with the tyranny of the AKP government and see the elections as an opportunity to express it.” Few can accurately predict who the Kurdish-majority areas will turn out for in the election, where votes are generally divided between Demirtaş and Erdoğan’s parties.
Many are angered by Erdogan’s alliance with hardline nationalists who want a military and security response to Turkey’s Kurdish rights movement or its separatist insurgency. They are also unnerved by Erdogan’s military forays into neighbouring Syria, where earlier this year he ordered a campaign into the majority-Kurdish enclave of Afrin. The offensive was publicly aimed at dislodging Kurdish militias in the area, but opponents of the government say it has a darker purpose of engineering demographic change in the region. Others say Kurdish voters are likely to reward Erdoğan for the calm that has prevailed in the country’s south-eastern region. There was renewed violence in the area between 2013 and 2015 after the collapse of the peace process but this dwindled over the last two years amid a security-oriented response by the government. Erdoğan’s rhetoric, that Kurds and Turks are united by faith and under one nation, has remained unchanged, but he has pursued a second track of vilifying the HDP as terrorist sympathisers, and the government has arrested hundreds of party cadres, mayors and MPs, including the two chairs of the party. “The security policies in the cities, the arrests of the MPs Kurdish people vote for, the mayors put in jail, the newspapers and TVs were shut down,” said Ayhan Bilgen, an HDP MP and spokesman. “Therefore the Kurdish people will give a veto [against Erdoğan] as their answer in this election. Policies to date do not comprise any positive expectation or hope for the coming period.” Fahrettin Altun, an expert at SETA, a thinktank with ties to the government, said Kurdish voters would back Erdoğan. “The main issue for them is peace in the region, not in the narrative,” he said. “The PKK is not in the south-eastern region of Turkey at the moment and that’s a very important issue which is sometimes not being able to understand by outsider analysts. But the people living in the south-eastern region are very happy with this process.” There are signs Erdoğan is increasingly fearful of losing votes to the HDP. He was surreptitiously filmed at a party meeting in Istanbul urging supporters to do “special work” to defeat the HDP, in what was interpreted by some observers as urging election fraud and voter intimidation.
The opposition candidates for the presidency have courted Kurdish voters, saying they would put Kurdish rights issues in parliament for a vote and would support previously lightning rod issues such as Kurdish-language instruction in schools. All of them called for Demirtaş’s release from jail during the race for the presidency. For Demirtaş, in his prison cell in Edirne, the evidence of oppression is all too clear in the arrests of him and his colleagues. He has used his 10 minutes of phone calls a week with his wife to conduct virtual rallies, and his image at his desk in prison, cup of tea nearby, smiling alongside a pile of books, has energised supporters. “It symbolises the anti-democratic practices and the oppression on all fronts including the judiciary by the Erdoğan and the AKP government,” he said of his presidential run. “It is also [the] Erdoğan government that manages the process that leads to the arrests of me and thousands of my friends unjustly and lawlessly for political reasons.” He added: “Turkish society is strong and determinedly walking towards democracy. Turkey does not consist of Erdoğan.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/23/just-election-turkey-not-possible-imprisoned-candidate-demirtas-erdogan,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/23/just-election-turkey-not-possible-imprisoned-candidate-demirtas-erdogan
2018-06-22T23:30:41Z,world,World news,Gang raped and set on fire: ICC pushes to investigate Myanmar Rohingya atrocities,"Harrowing accounts of Rohingya women tied to trees and raped for days by Myanmar’s military and men being pushed into mass graves, doused with petrol and set alight have been sent to the international criminal court. The evidence has been sent by a coalition of Bangladesh organisations to ICC prosecutors who are pushing to investigate allegations of forced deportation from a country where it has no jurisdiction. ICC judges met behind closed doors at the Hague this week to begin their discussions and documents seen exclusively by the Guardian will form part of the case for an investigation. The legal argument for an ICC investigation is being led by prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, and it is the first time such a case has been considered by the court. While Bangladesh is a member state, which gives the ICC power to investigate crimes committed there, Myanmar is not, and denies any ethnic cleansing was carried out against the Rohingya. Bensouda argues the cross-border nature of the forced deportation of the Rohingya into Bangladesh means it could legally fall within the ICC’s remit.
Myanmar has until 27 July to respond to the allegations and demonstrate that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over the Rohingya case. The request is unlikely to be welcomed by the Myanmar government. On Wednesday, a social media account run by the office of Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi quoted her berating “hate narratives from outside the country” which have fuelled tensions between Muslim Rohingya and Buddhist Rakhine communities. More than 700,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar since August 2017 following a campaign of violence carried out by the military, which saw villages razed, women and children raped and abused and tens of thousands killed. The mass killings have been described as both ethnic cleansing and as “having all the hallmarks of genocide” by the UN. Gang raped, then left for dead A document submitted to the ICC by the Asian Legal Resource Centre (ALRC) and its partner Odhikar, seen by the Guardian, included the story of Marwa, 10, whose family were shot dead before she, along with a group of other young girls from her village, were taken to a nearby school where they were repeatedly gang raped. Also in the submission was the account of Khurshida, 20, who described how she was held captive with several other Rohingya women, before being stripped, tied to trees and raped for days. Khurshida eventually lost consciousness and was dumped outside the camp by soldiers who assumed she was dead.
They also document the case of Sakila, 25, who hid as her family were locked inside a house that was set alight by soldiers, and Nur Jahan, 31, was raped violently and repeatedly in front of her seven-year-old daughter. Other Bangladesh organisations have argued that the sexual and gender-based nature of much of the violence committed against the Rohingya is fundamental to the case and that ICC action should be taken to put the perpetrators on trial. Human rights lawyer Wayne Jordash QC believed that the ICC’s request for Myanmar to submit their own supporting documents was an indicator that the court would be pushing for an investigation. “If I were Myanmar, I’d start preparing for an ICC examination on the crime of deportation at the very least,” said Jordash. “Its continued lack of cooperation may prove not to be an obstacle in this case, with so many of the witnesses now in Bangladesh and the mounting evidence against it.” The ICC has been accused of racism in the past for focusing most of its efforts on African nations, and many believe the court is looking to create more balance by turning its attention to atrocities in Asia.
Sir Geoffrey Nice, who led the prosecution of Serbian president Slobodan Milošević at the Hague, believes the prosecutor’s application will inevitably succeed. “The ICC must be brave and accept it has jurisdiction and ensure these crimes are properly investigated” he said. “Anything otherwise would be a huge setback for justice and undermine the court’s very authority. This is the only clear route available for the Rohingya. We all have a collective responsibility to ensure the perpetrators are held to account.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/23/myanmar-icc-pushes-to-investigate-rohingya-atrocities-rape-fire,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/23/myanmar-icc-pushes-to-investigate-rohingya-atrocities-rape-fire
2018-06-22T20:24:26Z,world,World news,Greece 'turning a page' as eurozone agrees deal to end financial crisis,"Greece’s government has said the country is “turning a page” after eurozone member states reached an agreement on the final elements of a plan to make its massive debt pile more manageable, ending an eight-year bailout programme. “I have to say the Greek government is happy with this deal,” the finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, said on Friday. “But at the same time, this government will not forget what the Greek people went through in the past eight years.” The government spokesman, Dimitris Tzanakopoulos, hailed “a historic decision” that meant “the Greek people can smile again”. Financial markets rallied, with the country’s benchmark 10-year bond easing 0.2 points and the main stock index up 1.6%. The plan allows Greece to extend and defer repayments on part of its debt for another 10 years and gives Athens another €15bn (£13.2bn) in new credit. Tsakalotos said it marked “the end of the Greek crisis … I think Greece is turning a page.” He added that the government “has to make sure the Greek people quickly see concrete results ... They need to feel the change in their own pockets.” The prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, told a meeting of MPs: “Greece is once again becoming a normal country, regaining its political and financial independence.” For the first time since he took office in January 2015, Tsipras donned a tie – fulfilling a promise made soon after he was election that he would only wear one when Greece had settled its debt problems. But the main opposition party New Democracy reacted to the deal with scepticism, saying it left much to be desired. Asked whether he thought the €22bn (£19bn) buffer Greece had been given would suffice, the party’s Kostis Hatzidakis said it reflected the lack of faith international creditors had in Athens’ ability to successfully return to capital markets. With Greece subject to enhanced surveillance for the next decade, reaction on the ground was similarly muted, with most saying they did not think the deal would make any noticeable difference to their lives.
The finance ministers of the 19 eurozone countries need to finalise a deal between Greece and its international creditors that would allow it to safely emerge from its third and final bailout on 20 August and face the markets again. Greece had received €275bn in financial support from its international creditors over the past eight years and twice came perilously close to being kicked out of the eurozone group, the EU commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, said, adding: “There have been enormous sacrifices. But at last Greece will be capable of moving on its own two feet.” But it means the left-led government in Athens will have to stick to austerity measures and reforms, including high budget surpluses, for more than 40 years. Adherence will be monitored quarterly.
Greece has been surviving primarily on loans from the eurozone since 2010, when it lost market access to funds because of a ballooning budget deficit, huge public debt and an underperforming economy, matched with an expansive welfare system. As fears mounted that it would crash out of the euro, the country was plunged into an unprecedented recession from which it is only now starting to recover, posting economic growth of 1.9% this year after its economy shrank by more than 26% since 2010. The crisis toppled four governments, obliging the current prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, to force through tough changes to balance the books. Wages have fallen by nearly 20% since 2010, with pensions and other welfare payments cut by 70% in the same period. The size of the public sector has been reduced by 26%. Unemployment has dropped slightly but remains very high at 20%, with youth unemployment at an alarming 43%, sending thousands of young Greeks abroad. At almost 180% of GDP, Greece is burdened with the highest debt load in Europe. The €320bn debt mountain is widely recognised as the single biggest obstacle to economic recovery. The International Monetary Fund had resolutely refused to sign up to the country’s latest bailout unless eurozone creditors agreed to a restructuring that would ultimately make the debt sustainable. Investors have been encouraged by the government’s austerity measures, however, with Greece’s borrowing costs standing at about 4%, compared with 24% at the peak of the crisis.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/eurozone-greece-financial-crisis-deal,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/eurozone-greece-financial-crisis-deal
2018-06-22T19:18:21Z,world,World news,Jogger accidentally crosses US border from Canada and is held for two weeks,"It started as a leisurely jog along a Canadian beach on a cool spring evening. But it turned into a two-week nightmare after Cedella Roman accidentally veered across the US border and was seized by US border patrol agents. The French citizen was visiting her mother and studying English, when the family headed to White Rock, about an hour’s drive from Vancouver in May. As dusk approached, the 19-year-old went for a jog along the beach. She swerved on to a dirt path as the tide came in, stopping briefly to snap a photo of the stunning scenery before turning around to retrace her steps.
It was then that she was confronted by two officers from the US border patrol. “An officer stopped me and started telling me I had crossed the border illegally,” Roman told Radio-Canada. “I told him I hadn’t done it on purpose, and that I didn’t understand what was happening.” She hadn’t seen any signs marking the border, she said. “I said to myself, well I may have crossed the border but they’ll probably only give me a fine, or they’ll tell me to go back to Canada or they’ll give me a warning.” Complicating matters was the fact that she didn’t have any government-issued ID or travel permits on her at the time. Noting that her steps had been captured on security cameras monitoring the area, the officers detained the teenager and accused her of crossing illegally into Blaine, Washington. She was transferred to the Tacoma Northwest Detention Centre, run by the Department of Homeland Security, more than 200km (125 miles) south of where she had been apprehended.
“They put me in the caged vehicles and brought me into their facility,” said Roman. “They asked me to remove all my personal belongings with my jewelry. They searched me everywhere.” The gravity of the situation began to sink in. “I understood it was getting very serious and I started to cry a bit.”
Roman was able to contact her mother from the centre. Christiane Ferne rushed to the facility in a panic, bringing with her Roman’s passport and study permits. It wasn’t enough; staff at the centre said the documents would have to be validated by immigration authorities in Canada before they could release Roman, according to Ferne. Two weeks passed before immigration officials in Canada and the US were able to confirm that Roman was eligible to return to Canada. Throughout it all, Ferne visited her daughter regularly at the centre. “It was just unfair that there was nothing, no sign at the border,” said Ferne. “It’s like a trap … anybody can be caught at the border like this.”
Documents issued by the US government and shared with Radio-Canada confirmed that Roman was discharged on 6 June. The family said they were not sure if Roman will be allowed back in the US. Immigration officials on both sides of the nearly 9,000km border refused to comment on Roman’s case, pointing to concerns over privacy. In a statement, US Customs and Border Protection noted that anyone who enters the US outside an official port of entry is considered to have crossed the border illegally. “This applies regardless of whether or not the individual claims to have inadvertently crossed the border,” the department added.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/jogger-detained-us-border-cedella-roman-immigration-ordeal,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/jogger-detained-us-border-cedella-roman-immigration-ordeal
2018-06-22T18:54:53Z,world,World news,Mexico: 15 fake transgender candidates disqualified from election,"Mexico’s electoral tribunal has disqualified 15 male candidates who pretended to be transgender to get around gender parity rules in the southern state of Oaxaca. The indigenous Zapotec community of the isthmus of Tehuantepec has long recognized a third gender of transgender people known as muxes – who are born with male bodies, but identify as neither male or female. Electoral rules in Oaxaca allow muxes to occupy candidacies designated for women. On Friday, the tribunal – the final referee in political and electoral matters – ruled that the disqualified candidates were not known to be muxes before the candidate registration period. Two others candidates who had been disqualified by state electoral officials on similar grounds were ruled eligible, however, as they had consistently identified as transgender. The tribunal ordered the candidacies vacated by the disqualified candidates be filled by women.
The ruling proved thorny for the tribunal, which said in a statement: “The manifestation of belonging to a gender is sufficient to justify the self-registration of a person.” But the tribunal added: “Electoral authorities must take care with the possible misuse of self-registration, to not permit … the transgender identity be utilized in a deceptive way to comply with the constitutional principle of equity.” Mexico holds elections on 1 July, when the country elects a new president, renews both houses of Congress and elects hundreds of state and municipal officials. “Not a single spot designated for men was filled by a transgender person. However, 19 places designated for women … were filled by men who say they’re transgender,” said Anabel López Sánchez, director of the Women’s Citizenship Collective in Oaxaca, which denounced the phoney candidates in May. Mexico has gradually introduced gender parity rules over the past two decades.

2018-06-22T17:00:33Z,world,World news,Travellers 'assumed by police to be criminals rather than victims',"Police forces routinely presume Traveller communities are more likely to be the perpetrators of crime than its victims, a report by a community campaign group has found. In a new report based on freedom of information requests and a survey of 43 police forces, the Traveller Movement says police forces may be in breach of the law by employing traveller community liaison officers whose job descriptions focus on enforcement and detection of crime rather than being points of contact for Gypsy, Romany and Irish Traveller people needing the police’s help. The group called for an investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission after finding what it said was evidence that the police role of Gypsy, Traveller Liaison Officer (GTLOs) may contravene equality laws. Out of 20 job descriptions for the roles at various forces, 12 mentioned enforcement against unauthorised encampments or place Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities alongside thematic issues such as anti-social behaviour, gangs and youth violence.
Among the job descriptions, which were collected via FoI requests, one for Kent Police stated the liaison officer was: “To act as the single point of contact within the Gypsy Liaison Team ensuring effective liaison with Serious Crime Directorate (SCD) for the policing of organised criminal gangs … collating data, keeping packages up to date and building intelligence profiles on individuals until dissemination as required, in order to support the SCD in building central records on gang criminality.” The findings, contained in a report titled ‘Policing by consent: understanding and improving relations between Gypsies, Roma and Irish Travellers’, are being presented on Friday by the Traveller Movement at a joint event with the National Police Chiefs Council. Drawing on interviews with 17 police officers and 13 members of the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller community, it asserts the police are failing to have due regard for their public sector equality duty. Three-quarters of the police officers surveyed identified unconscious bias and/or racist behaviour towards Gypsies, Roma and Travellers (GRT) within their forces.
It quoted one constable as saying: “Somebody made a comment very quietly … ‘dead Gypsy, good Gypsy’… I complained to the sergeant and he [said] … ‘they are not racist, they are just very frustrated’.” A GTLO was quoted as saying: “That’s something you find a lot of, people using words and phrases which are highly offensive to Travellers … You get that from police officers as well, they’ll use derogatory comments.” Lord Ouseley, a council member of the Institute for Race Relations, said in the report’s foreword: “Based on the lived experiences presented in this report it is not difficult to see why there is a lack of trust. “Police officers have reported derogatory and racist language used by colleagues against GRT people being insufficiently dealt with by internal police procedures … It is not right that some people have a more negative experience of public institutions such as the police simply because they belong to a particular ethnic group – this has to change.” Yvonne MacNamara, the CEO of the Traveller Movement, said the report identified concerning police practice across Britain’s 45 police forces. “For example, it appears that increased numbers of police officers are deployed to incidents involving Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller people compared to other communities,” she said. “This suggests a bias based purely on ethnicity and a differential policing practice. As the primary agents of community cohesion the police have a responsibility to ensure an equitable police service for all.” Jim Davies, the co-founder of the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller Police Association (GRTPA), said: “Historically, the relationship between the police and Britain’s Gypsy and Traveller population has been one of enforcer versus criminal with little recognition of Gypsy Traveller ethnicity and little thought given to Gypsies and Travellers as service users. Whilst things are improving, this is still the case in many situations; it’s no surprise that mistrust runs deeply. For everyone’s benefit, this has to change.” Chief superintendent Claire Nix of Kent police said: “Kent police actively engage with Gypsy and Traveller communities through the work of the Gypsy Liaison Team. Their role is to develop an improved knowledge and understanding of the cultural differences and needs of different communities, to treat people with fairness, dignity and respect, and protect the public from harm.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/travellers-assumed-by-police-to-be-criminals-rather-than-victims,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/travellers-assumed-by-police-to-be-criminals-rather-than-victims
2018-06-22T16:01:33Z,world,World news,UN condemns Trump administration for exacerbating US poverty levels,"The Trump administration has been castigated at the United Nations in Geneva for consciously exacerbating levels of inequality in America that are already the most extreme in the western world. The excoriating report on the state of the US nation was delivered to a packed hearing of the human rights council on Friday by the UN’s monitor on extreme poverty, Philip Alston. In what is now turning into a battle of words between the US government and international observers, Alston hit back at criticisms that had been leveled at him the previous day by Nikki Haley, US ambassador to the UN.
Haley complained that it was “patently ridiculous for the United Nations to examine poverty in America”. She accused the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights of political bias and wasting UN money by carrying out a six-month investigation into poverty and inequality in America, saying he should have focused instead on countries like Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Addressing delegations from 46 countries gathered in the chamber of the human rights council, Alston fired back that “when one of the world’s wealthiest countries does very little about the fact that 40 million of its citizens live in poverty, it is entirely appropriate for the reasons to be scrutinized”. He said that the “massive tax cuts” promoted by Trump would “overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy” while other policies pursued by the US government would stigmatize and punish millions of low-income Americans. In his most caustic comment, Alston threw back at Haley a term that she herself had used to deride the UN human rights council as a “cesspool of political bias”. Alston said that same council that he had seen with his own eyes real cesspools – in Alabama, during his tour of poverty hotspots in America. “I witnessed raw sewage poured into the gardens of people who could never afford to pay $30,000 for their own septic systems.” He added poignantly: “Cesspools need to be cleaned up, and governments need to act.” Such criticism of the world’s most powerful nation was all the more striking given the absence in the room. That morning, the chair normally occupied by the US delegation to the human rights council in Geneva was removed from the chamber following the decision of the Trump administration on Tuesday to withdraw from membership. The departure of the US makes it the only country to have pulled out of the world entity since the council was founded in 2006. Haley said the decision to depart was motivated by anger over the council’s perceived anti-Israeli bias, and about the continued membership within the body of human rights abusers such as Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo. But there was also growing speculation over whether the timing of the withdrawal had anything to do with Alston’s deeply critical report on poverty in America.
Ken Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, asked in a tweet: “Is it just a coincidence that the US withdraws from the UN Human Rights Council two days before it examines the Trump administration’s neglect of poverty in the United States?” Had the US delegation been present in the council for the hearing, they might have been forgiven for wincing at Alston’s presentation. He accused Haley of wanting to exempt the US from precisely the kind of international accountability over human rights that the Trump administration demanded for other countries. Turning to the findings of his tour of the US, he noted that maternal mortality rates among African Americans were now almost double those in Thailand. He cited new World Health Organisation data that shows that babies born in China today will live longer healthy lives than babies born in America. While accepting that the US economy was enjoying a period of growth, Alston said: “But the question is, who is benefiting. The benefits of economic growth are going overwhelmingly to the wealthy.”
Since 1980, he said, the average national income before tax for the bottom half of US income distribution had stagnated at just $16,000, while earnings of the top 1% had soared. “In other words, the American dream of mobility is turning into the American illusion, in which the rich get ever richer and the middle classes don’t move.” Most ominously, the UN monitor warned that the persistence of extreme poverty in the US would have a knock-on on the health of its democracy. He said such enduring problems “create ideal conditions for small elites to trample on the human rights of minorities, and sometimes even of majorities”. The warning was echoed by the ACLU, which told the human rights council that under Trump the US was suffering “the erosion of political participation. People living in poverty in the United States are being systematically deprived of their right to vote.” The ACLU’s Jennifer Turner referred to the more than 6 million Americans who have been disenfranchised as a result of felony convictions. One out of four African Americans in Kentucky, for instance, have been stripped of their votes as a result of felony disenfranchisement.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/united-nations-poverty-report-philip-alston,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/united-nations-poverty-report-philip-alston
2018-06-22T16:00:35Z,world,World news,Are Church of England’s dabbing deacons and jumping bishops a leap too far?,"Their souls are pure, their hearts are turned towards heaven and their future lies in a life of solemn devotion to God. But to the consternation of some of their more senior colleagues, a growing number of freshly ordained ministers of the Church of England are marking their new status by dabbing. As Petertide approaches – the run-up to St Peter’s Day on 29 June, and traditionally the time for Church of England ordinations – the Church Times and social media circles of the devout are braced for the usual avalanche of celebratory photographs of new members of the clergy. But the stern, decorous images that used to mark these occasions are being replaced by a trend for more frivolous action shots – with dabbing deacons showing up alongside priests leaping, baring their knees and even wearing L-plates. Their defenders see the new informality as a sign of holy joy. But hardcore traditionalists, along with casual curmudgeons, are less than elated.
Their ire was recently roused by a shot of six readers being licensed at St Alban’s Cathedral, showing clear air under the heels of a jumping bishop of Hertford, the Rt Rev Michael Beasley. “What’s all this jumping for? It seems to have become a paraliturgical act and, as far as I can see, it is just nonsense that makes people look silly,” tweeted the Rev Patrick Gilday, rector of Benson with Ewelme in Oxfordshire. Arun Kataria, the communications officer at the diocese of St Albans, and proud taker of the photograph, disagreed. “Licensings and ordinations are serious occasions, but they are very joyful ones,” he told the Guardian. “So, there is a serious moment in the cathedral, where people are making the very big commitment of serving God and serving people, then there is also a tremendous release of joy, and a sense you are launched into a new life”. Capturing this launching, though, can be tricky. “You say: ‘Go!’ and they all jump at different speeds.” Pleased though he is is with his effort, he acknowledged: “I don’t think we are leading the field”. But Gilday, twice ordained “and never asked to jump up and down, of which I’m glad”, said it had become too widespread, an unofficial expectation and almost a ritual, without proper thought about what such images communicated. “I think it’s intended to communicate that we’re not all terribly boring, which we’re not,” he said. But he feared they looked artificial: “It connects with my general fear about the Church of England’s attempts to look really relevant in the modern world.” It was always the “fun, jumping photographs that people were keen to print”, so one narrative dominated. But ordination, though joyful, was also serious, and life changing, he said. “There’s nothing wrong with [jumping] per se, but for a lot of people, that’s not where they are.” The Church Times editor, Paul Handley, expects a good crop this year. Last year’s Petertide ordinations yielded 10 “lightning bolt” deacons in Leicester, two hugging deacons in Sheffield and two knee-baring Durham ordinands, Simon Grundy and Danny Driver, leaping in front of the Angel of the North.
“We probably encouraged the trend a bit, because in the old days we used to just publish lists of names and we asked the dioceses to send us photographs,” he said. Handley strives for a balance between the formal and the frivolous: “I think there is a bit of a competition to see who gets the cover photo. And the one that goes down best – or worst – is a group of ordinands jumping in the air. They have all been on an ordination retreat. So, it’s a bit like a cork out of the bottle”.
A blog on the subject raised the issue that such photographs – and others such as the newly installed bishop of Oxford, Stephen Croft, wearing “L-plates” inside his cope – tended to downplay the solemnity of such occasions. While none of the images are “terrible” , collectively they served to give “an impression that we are uncomfortable with the more serious side of what we are doing”, wrote the author, an ordinand. In Leicester, where the deacons so enthusiastically dabbed, the diocesan mission and communications enabler, the Rev Jon Barrett, insists that there was no such dichotomy. “We always take our faith seriously, but try not to take ourselves too seriously,” he said. But Father Matthew Cashmore, assistant curate at West Hereford, who joined in the Twitter debate, said such images were “all a bit passe”. “Jumping ordinands. It’s probably good exercise, if nothing else,” he said. “Here we have this life-changing moment and you get this twee photographs of people jumping in the air and fists in the air. It’s become as staid and expected and as deeply uncreative as the images of the A-level results.”
He agreed that collectively such images tended to downplay the solemnity of the occasion, and certainly did not appeal to the youth. “It’s all: ‘Yay!’ Smiley-facey.” Of dabbing deacons, he said: “I don’t think that connects with young people. As a millennial, I find that I walk round with my cassock, and I talk about mass, and I introduce myself as Father, and that’s far more impactful with millennials than standing there trying to be cool and with the kids. That ‘down with the kids’ stuff is kind of from the 80s anyway. “My generation would far rather somebody stand in front of them with some sort of honesty and integrity about what it is they believe than to be ‘Hey! Buddy Jesus. Big thumbs up.’” He prefered pictures showing the church’s beauty and emotional connection, he said. “So, happy, smiling faces that hold together the beauty of the buildings that these ordinations happen in, the stunning vestments, the incense. All of that stuff is beautiful and grabs people’s attention.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/church-england-dabbing-deacons-jumping-bishops-ordination-petertide,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/church-england-dabbing-deacons-jumping-bishops-ordination-petertide
2018-06-22T15:38:33Z,world,World news,Billy Elliot musical axes dates in Hungary amid claims it could 'turn children gay’,"The Hungarian State Opera House has cancelled 15 performances of the musical Billy Elliot after ticket sales were hit by a media campaign in outlets close to Viktor Orbán’s “illiberal” government that called the show a propaganda tool for homosexuality. “As you know, the negative campaign in recent weeks against the Billy Elliot production led to a big drop in ticket sales, and for this reason we are cancelling 15 performances in line with the decision of our management,” the director-general of the opera house, Szilveszter Ókovács, told the independent Hungarian website 444.hu.
The musical is based on the 2000 film of the same name, which tells the eponymous story of a boy growing up in a depressed northern English mining town in the 1980s who eschews boxing to pursue his passion for ballet. An op-ed in Magyar Idők newspaper on 1 June says the story “could turn children gay”. The article also suggests the musical promotes a “deviant way of life” that goes against the demographics needs of the country. “The propagation of homosexuality cannot be a national goal when the population is getting older and smaller and our country is threatened by invasion.” The article suggests that if Ókovács could not remove certain scenes from the production, it should be pulled altogether. Writing in Magyar Idők, Ókovács argued that “showing something which is an indisputable fact of life does not mean you are propagating it. One can be gay and conservative at the same time.” He also noted that the only gay character from the original script was not included in the Hungarian production. The Hungarian State Opera House has performed Billy Elliot 90 times to more than 100,000 people since 2016, but ticket prices for the remaining performances have since been halved. Emboldened by his third consecutive election victory in April, Orbán has doubled down on his plan to make Hungary an “illiberal state” by moving against judicial independence and non-governmental organisations. He has also increased pressure on independent institutions including the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Central European University. Another rightwing paper with close links to Orbán, the Figyelő, published a list of researchers at the 200-year-old academy this week, accusing them of working on “gay rights and gender science”. Hungary’s parliament passed a series of laws this week that criminalise any individual or group that offers to help an illegal immigrant claim asylum. The legislation restricts the ability of NGOs to act in asylum cases and was passed in defiance of the EU and human rights groups. Under the Stop Soros law, individuals or groups that help illegal migrants gain status to stay in Hungary will be liable to prison terms. The Fidesz party’s re-election landslide followed a campaign attacking the US billionaire George Soros and the liberal NGOs he supports. Orbán believes Soros has encouraged mass immigration in order to undermine Europe. The author of the Magyar Idők article, Zsófia N Horváth, declined to respond to the Guardian’s questions about the piece.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/billy-elliot-musical-cuts-dates-hungary-claims-turn-children-gay,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/billy-elliot-musical-cuts-dates-hungary-claims-turn-children-gay
2018-06-22T14:55:04Z,world,World news,Poverty and inequality under Trump: ​​human ​​rights under ​​threat,"On Tuesday, 26 June the Guardian will moderate a discussion at the Graduate Institute in Geneva to discuss a burning issue for America: how the country’s vast inequality and the Trump administration’s apparent determination to exacerbate it are posing a direct threat to human rights.
Donald Trump inherited an economy with the highest rate of income inequality among any richer nation. Some 40 million people in the US – one-third of them children – live in poverty, and one person in eight depends on food stamps. Five million Americans live in the kind of abject deprivation normally associated with developing countries. Since entering the White House, Trump has promoted policies that will aggravate the inequality, slash welfare protections for millions of already struggling Americans, while handing massive tax cuts to the wealthy. The UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, has been investigating the situation in the US as part of his official role as world monitor on the subject. His research, and his report, provide an important snapshot on the state of America today. His conclusions are shocking warnings of the direction being pursued by the world’s most powerful nation: December: tour of the US For two weeks in December, Alston toured many sites of the most visceral poverty in America. The Guardian followed him at every stop. The tour took in rural poverty experienced by largely African American people in Alabama, the hurricane-racked travails of Puerto Rico and the joblessness of coal country in West Virginia. At the end of the tour, Alston produced a preliminary report in which he warned that Trump was turning the US into the “world champion of extreme inequality”. Earlier this month Alston completed and released his final report on his investigation into US poverty, saying Trump’s approach was “cruel” and would leave millions of Americans deprived of food and healthcare. Last week, Alston presented his report formally to the UN human rights council in Geneva. On Tuesday 26 June the Guardian is sponsoring a panel debate on extreme poverty in Trump’s America:
Philip Alston, UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights and law professor at New York University.
Rev Dr Liz Theoharis, co-chair along with the Rev William Barber of the Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival, which has just completed a 40-day nationwide sweep of America calling for economic and environmental justice. She is also co-director of the Kairos Center for Religions, Rights and Social Justice.
Kenneth Roth, executive director, Human Rights Watch. The global human rights watchdog exposes abuses around the world. It operates in 49 countries, but its largest single country team covers the US.
Catherine Flowers, rural development manager, the Equal Justice Initiative and director and founder, Alabama Center for Rural Enterprise. Flowers has done groundbreaking work on rural poverty in the deep south, including the return of endemic diseases of poverty usually found in the developing world such as the parasite hookworm.

2018-06-22T14:42:05Z,world,World news,Why China has banned videos of people whispering,"It might not seem immediately obvious why someone would want to watch a video of young women eating ice cubes. But once you hear the sound of the crunching fissure in your headphones, whether it makes you wince or tingle, the sensory effect is undeniable. In China, ice-eating videos have become something of a phenomenon, their stars racking up thousands of views. Along with whispering, tapping, the gentle scratching of a microphone, the unique sound of hair being brushed or skin being stroked – the sound of ice cubes crunching against teeth is a common trigger for ASMR, and the millions of people worldwide who experience the sensation. Short for “autonomous sensory meridian response”, ASMR was first used online in 2010, and describes the tingling, relaxing or sleep-inducing feeling that some people get when the watching videos.
Suspicious of ASMR and its effects, the Chinese government has decided to ban the phenomenon, ordering the removal of ASMR videos from their biggest video streaming sites, including Youku, Bilibili, and Douyu. The ruling came via China’s anti-pornography office, which issued a statement explaining that porn was being released under the guise of ASMR, emphasising that this could be a threat to minors, who apparently make up a large part of ASMR’s viewership. In a statement officials said: “All internet companies must genuinely fulfil their duties, and increase efforts to clean up websites, implement content review processes, and protect minors from harmful content.” TingTing57 is a Chinese ASMR star based in Los Angeles who started doing it because she watched it herself and wanted to “give something back to the community”. Her videos are on YouTube, which is blocked in China, but they have been re-uploaded to Chinese streaming sites without her permission. To her, the ban does not come as a surprise, since adult content is illegal in China. However, she hopes that the government’s ban on ASMR is only temporary to “weed out the adult content”. She explains: “People will always try to abuse what’s trending no matter the subject and a lot of people think an easy way to get views is to be overly sexual. ASMR is just a nice relaxing sensation some people get, there’s nothing sexual about it.” TingTing describes seeing Chinese videos that are categorised as ASMR featuring girls wearing little clothing and using two cameras, “one to focus on their chest and the other to focus on their bare legs in a miniskirt”. She says: “Is that ASMR? Maybe, but it’s also pretty risky and vulgar and in the long run hurts the ASMR community by giving people the wrong idea.”
A study conducted in 2015 by researchers at Swansea University in the UK found that 85% of consumers of ASMR use it to help them get to sleep, while just 5% reported sexual arousal. The results back up TingTing’s assertion that arousal is not the primary function of ASMR, no matter how much it might resemble a fetish. Similarly, a new study released this week by the University of Sheffield’s department of psychology,found those who reported experiencing ASMR showed significant reductions in heart rate and positive emotional responses like relaxation or feelings of social connectivity. Although the study was the first of its kind in looking at physiological responses to ASMR, its leader, Dr Giulia Poerio, believes the tingly sensation it induces is by no means a new phenomenon. Rather, she says, the videos have given people “the language to describe a feeling that they may have experienced for most of their lives”. Poerio is concerned about the ban in China but says there are workarounds: “Banning the videos could mean that ASMR experiencers are no longer able to harness the benefits of ASMR but there will probably be other video content that induces ASMR unintentionally.” Such as? “A commonly cited example is Bob Ross videos.”
So if people in China are struggling for their fix, let the scratchy paintbrush of America’s most bearded artist soothe you.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/china-asmr-videos-ban-censorship-why-reasons-explained,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/china-asmr-videos-ban-censorship-why-reasons-explained
2018-06-22T12:26:45Z,world,World news,"Lord Nelson's watch expected to fetch up to £450,000 at Sotheby's","The watch that kept time for Admiral Lord Nelson during the Battle of Trafalgar, and was then taken from his pocket on his flagship Victory after a French sniper’s bullet pierced his shoulder and shattered his spine, is coming up for auction after centuries of being kept in private collections.
The watch is a valuable object in its own right, made by Josiah Emery, one of the most renowned watchmakers of Georgian England. With the Nelson connection and family provenance, it is estimated to fetch up to £450,000 when it is sold by Sotheby’s on 4 July. Nelson knew the importance of time. He once told his officers: “Time is everything: five minutes makes the difference between victory and defeat.” On the morning of the battle, on 21 October 1805, he ordered them to make sure their watches were synchronised. He once boasted that he had been a quarter of an hour early for engagements all his life, “and it has made a man of me”. The watch was among his most intimate possessions, taken for safekeeping when his bloodstained uniform was stripped off below deck as the ship surgeons attempted in vain to save his life. Nelson knew the wounds would be fatal. While his body, preserved in a cask of brandy, was shipped back to England for a huge state funeral, the watch was sent separately with his purse, medals, and the miniature worn around his neck of his girlfriend, Emma Hamilton.
His brother William inherited it and gave it to his daughter, Charlotte. She had the watch mounted as a travelling clock inscribed: “The chronometer of Horatio Viscount Nelson. Worn by him at the Battle of Trafalgar, placed in this case by his niece Charlotte Mary, Lady Bridport, to be preserved for any one of her descendants who may enter the navy.” The watch, originally in a gold case, may have been a gift to Nelson from an admirer after his victory at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. Daryn Schnipper, head of the international watch department of the auction house, said it would probably have been too expensive for Nelson to pay for it himself as a younger officer, when it would have cost at least £100.
He is said to have offered the watch he wore at the Nile as a gift to the composer Joseph Haydn, suggesting that by then he owned a better watch. Emery spent years making increasingly sophisticated watches in an attempt to win the navy prize for a watch accurate enough to allow sailors to establish longitude, a contest eventually won by his rival John Harrison. The clock historian Jonathan Betts said the survival of most of the watches made by Emery was testimony to how much they were valued. The watch, which at one point was on loan to the Maritime Museum in Greenwich, stayed with Charlotte’s descendants until it was bought by a private collector of Nelson material in the US. It is now being auctioned for the first time after the collector’s death last year.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/lord-nelson-watch-battle-of-trafalgar-auction-sothebys,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/lord-nelson-watch-battle-of-trafalgar-auction-sothebys

The fear of young people is everywhere, with headlines and pundits stirring up anxiety that civilised society is going to hell in a handbasket thanks to a generation of emotionally stunted, smartphone addicted, narcissistic snowflakes. And yet everywhere there are stories that restore faith, not least the eloquent and fearless students taking on the US gun lobby. So this week we present tales of teens turning the tide, and what we all can learn from them. Report after report reveals that some of the happiest young people among OECD nations are in the Netherlands, amid an uptick in depression and anxiety among teenagers in the US and UK. In Amsterdam, Senay Boztas uncovered what the Dutch are getting right.
France is planning to ban mobile phones from schools from September, in response to fears that teenagers have become addicted to their screens. With similar bans being proposed around the world, Angelique Chrisafis visited a school in rural Brittany that banned the devices four years ago to see what difference the policy made – and what pupils made of it. When two successful music industry professionals set up an internship scheme at their company, only middle-class kids applied. So Nick Stillwell and David Court decided to try something different. The music school they created, Supajam, has had remarkable success with young people left behind by the education system, as Emma John discovered.
Finally, Gary Younge reflected on an extraordinary year reporting on knife crime in the UK and set out how policymakers could tackle the issue - if they really want to. What we liked: This Washington Post report on the growing work opportunities for people with disabilities in the US. What we heard: Thanks for your story on Dutch teenagers. As a teacher at a Dutch secondary school, I felt you summed up nicely the reasons why Dutch kids seem so content. Personally, I’m always amazed that when they are asked during English oral exams: ‘What do you enjoy about the place where you live compared to other places?’, my students invariably talk about the sense of freedom they get from being able to go everywhere by bike and not depending on their parents to take them.

2018-06-22T11:56:02Z,world,World news,Rise of xenophobia is fanning immigration flames in EU and US | Simon Tisdall,"Like a timebomb waiting to go off, Europe’s smouldering immigration problem exploded into a full-blown crisis last week. The US experienced a similar delayed upheaval, after the human consequences of Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” border policy became too painful to ignore. The two events are closely linked, the product of systemic international failings. The longstanding inability of governments to cope with challenges posed by the increased flows of refugees, asylum seekers and economic migrants is common to both sides of the Atlantic. The ensuing vacuum has been filled by opportunists such as Trump, maverick fringe parties, andrightwing zealots such as Italy’s new interior minister, Matteo Salvini, and the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions. Chaos in Congress, where Republicans and Democrats have argued over conflicting plans to end incarceration of immigrant children on the Mexican border, enabled Trump to claim he was addressing Americans’ concerns. The US president has backed off for now, but his tough approach remains popular. Likewise, Salvini’s approval rating has soared after he banned a ship carrying migrants from Libya.
In Germany, Angela Merkel’s domestic public standing has never wholly recovered from her decision to admit 1.1 million refugees in 2015. Although the total annual influx into Europe has plunged to under 40,000 people so far this year, polls suggest about two-thirds of German voters agree with Horst Seehofer, the interior minister and the chancellor’s rebellious ministerial rival, that tougher border controls are necessary. Merkel is scrambling to agree a Europe-wide policy at next week’s EU summit. She and other national leaders will first hold an emergency meeting in Brussels on Sunday. But Poland, Hungary and other central and east European opponents of her “burden-sharing” approach will not alter their stance. Attitudes among the “frontline states” – Greece, Italy and Spain – are hardening. As in Washington, there is no European consensus. The latest proposed sticking plaster – creating processing centres along the north African littoral – sounds a lot like replicating the Libyan holding camps that have become notorious for abuses. Another problem: nobody seems to have asked Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria or Morocco whether they are willing to be re-colonised as dumping grounds for Europe’s problems. Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s rightwing chancellor, goes further, talking about military “secure zones” in north Africa. His ministerial colleague, Herbert Kickl, wants to “concentrate” migrants in one far-off place. Like Salvini’s ideas about rounding up and expelling Roma people, such talk carries disturbing echoes of the 1930s. Austria will hold the EU council of ministers chair from next month, from where it can push its agenda.
The recent pan-European surge in nationalist, populist and xenophobic political forces forms the intractable backdrop to the immigration crisis. Similarly, Trump won in 2016 on a wave of demagoguery that exploited Middle America’s fears. Phobias about foreigners, mixed with old-fashioned racism and concerns over terrorism, were the genesis of his Mexican border wall and his ban on citizens from Muslim countries. Yet, like many European politicians, Trump ignored the root causes of problematic migration – and, in many instances, the west’s culpability. American wars in the Middle East, notably in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya; the collective failure to halt the Syrian, Yemeni, South Sudanese and Somali conflicts; and the tolerance shown to repressive, undemocratic regimes in Eritrea and Egypt have all stoked the crisis. Add the ever-widening north-south wealth gap, western indifference to the economic plight of sub-Saharan African and west Asian countries, the disproportionate impact of climate change and environmental pollution, and the chronic insecurity of lives lived in impoverished, unstable societies, and it is not hard to see why large numbers of people would prefer to move to Michigan or Magdeburg.
In the specific case of the US southern border, much of the migration from Mexico and Central America is an attempt to escape murderous narco-wars involving gangs feeding off massive US demand for illegal drugs, something Trump has done little to curb. Unusually among top politicians, Merkel grasps the connections and has urged a more holistic approach. She was instrumental in creating the EU’s €4.3bn emergency trust fund for Africa, dedicated to fighting “the root causes of irregular migration” (and thereby curbing it) through investing in jobs, education, training and good governance in countries of origin. But recent research shows three states that together are the biggest source of asylum seekers – Nigeria, Somalia and Eritrea – received less EU money than more stable, better-off countries such as Ethiopia. The trust has also been criticised for spending too much on preventing migration and tighter border controls, rather than improving lives. More time bombs are ticking. In the absence of agreed, joined-up solutions, the overall problem is expanding exponentially. According to the UN, wars, violence and persecution uprooted 68.5 million people last year – an all-time record.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/as-immigration-crisis-explodes-xenophobes-gain-ground-in-eu,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/as-immigration-crisis-explodes-xenophobes-gain-ground-in-eu
2018-06-22T11:22:37Z,world,World news,High court backs UK’s refusal to issue gender-neutral passports,"The equality campaigner Christie Elan-Cane has lost a high court challenge against the UK government’s refusal to issue gender-neutral, or X, passports. Mr Justice Jeremy Baker upheld Home Office policy after the court was told it would affect other legislation, cost too much to change computer records and increase the need for consular support abroad for gender-neutral British citizens. Elan-Cane, who has pursued the issue for more than 25 years, has claimed that non-gendered people suffer discrimination and are being deprived of their “legitimate identity”. UK passports restrict sex designations to male or female. Ten countries permit their citizens to opt for a third category, X, or unknown. Canada was the most recent to offer its citizens gender-neutral passports. Other country that allow a third option are Australia, Denmark, Germany, Malta, New Zealand, Pakistan, India, Ireland and Nepal. X passports are approved by the ICAO, the UN agency that regulates international air travel. During the hearing, Kate Gallafent QC, for Elan-Cane, argued that HM Passport Office policy breaches the right to respect for private life, and the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of gender or sex, under the European convention on human rights (ECHR). She said: “For the claimant, obtaining and using a passport currently involves making a false declaration as to the nature of the claimant’s gender identity, which causes the claimant considerable distress.” Sir James Eadie QC, on behalf of the home secretary, submitted that the policy did not interfere with rights under the ECHR. He argued that if the policy constituted an interference with article 8 – the right to respect for private life – it was justified by the need to “maintain an administratively coherent system for the recognition of gender”, to maintain security and to combat identity theft and fraud, and “to ensure security at national borders”. In his decision, Baker said: “The government is currently collecting and collating research material with a view to undertaking a comprehensive review of the issues both surrounding and those raised directly by the claimant in this case … [Elan-Cane] will be entitled to scrutinise with care the results of the government’s current review, which will be required to be undertaken without any undue delay.” Elan-Cane said: “I am bitterly disappointed that my case for the judicial review of the UK government’s discriminatory passport policy was not upheld. Not just for myself but for everyone who is compromised by this policy. “The UK’s passport application process requires applicants to declare whether they are male or female. It is inappropriate and wrong that someone who defines as neither should be forced to make that declaration.” Elan-Cane, who was represented pro-bono by the law firm Clifford Chance, is considering whether or not to appeal. Narind Singh, a partner at the firm, said: “Gender identity is a fundamental part of an individual’s intimate, personal identity and X passports are a crucial step in the protection of the human rights of this group of individuals, who otherwise face an unacceptable choice between forgoing a passport, and making a false declaration, and using a passport which misrepresents their identity. “We are considering with Christie the possibility of seeking leave to appeal today’s judgment. We will continue to assist Christie in this fight. We welcome the court’s ruling that Christie will be entitled to scrutinise the outcome of the review that the government is undertaking, and we will continue to assist Christie to hold the government to account.”Tom Mountford, a barrister who also represented Elan-Cane, said: “In this decision, the UK courts have, for the first time, recognised that the right to respect for an individual’s private life, guaranteed by article 8 of the European convention on human rights, includes the right to respect for the fundamental identity of non-gendered, intersex, trans and non-binary people identifying as neither, or not exclusively, male or female.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/high-court-backs-uk-refusal-to-issue-gender-neutral-passports,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/high-court-backs-uk-refusal-to-issue-gender-neutral-passports
2018-06-22T11:14:26Z,world,World news,Matteo Salvini: a political chameleon thriving on fears,"In the early years, when he was still a secessionist who believed northern Italy should break off and become an independent state called Padania, Matteo Salvini held his fellow countrymen in such contempt that he even supported Germany over Italy in the 2006 World Cup. “Italy ... is the worst of the worst,” he said at the time. “My support goes to anyone who is more serious.” Today, the 45-year-old has adopted “Italians first” as a political ideology and is in many ways the European leader who most resembles Donald Trump, from his embrace of impulsive and often racist rhetoric, to his rejection of democratic norms. He has served as Italy’s interior minister and deputy prime minister for less than a month, but has already upended policies on migration and asylum.
Salvini’s responsibilities are technically limited to oversight of immigration, elections and domestic security. But the head of the League – or Lega Nord as it was known in Italy – has deftly used his political skills, including stoking fear of immigrants, to overshadow the country’s weak new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and outshine his 31-year-old coalition partner, Luigi Di Maio of the Five Star Movement, who has seemed to fumble through his first weeks in government. On Friday, Salvini unofficially took on the role of health minister, saying in an interview that he considered 10 vaccines to not only be useless, but potentially dangerous. It was a much harder line – taken without any scientific proof – than the government’s agreed position, which is that vaccines ought not to be mandatory for children to attend school. The question now is how far Salvini – the political chameleon – will go, and how high his popularity will grow. The answer could shape the future of Europe, and Italy’s role in the eurozone. Will the man who was once seen a fringe candidate who could not possibly win more than 12-13% approval rating – but whose popularity has soared by more than 10 percentage points to 30% since Italy’s election in March – bring together centre-right and populist voters? Or will he follow the path set by former prime minister Matteo Renzi, who soared and then collapsed under the weight of his own hubris?
Salvini’s political story began in the 1990s on the far left, when anti-globalisation protests formed the basis of his populism and he headed a small communist faction within the Northern League. The party was neither left or right but instead unified by its militant belief in secession and often infused its campaigns with blind hatred for southern Italians. Salvini was once recorded chanting a derogatory song mocking Neapolitans, saying they “smell so bad, even the dogs run away”. He had been born into a middle-class family in Milan and did not – according to his biographer Alessandro Franzi – have an especially promising future in a party commanded by strong leaders. But Salvini’s first major break came as a talk radio host at Radio Padania. He developed a quickfire style he still uses today, in contrast to the stereotypically measured, cautious, and long-winded Italian political establishment. “I think his first ability is to be a good communicator. He was the voice of the Northern League in the late 90s, and there he learned the ability to talk, to speak in public, to listen to people, and to give voice to people’s problems. He tried to give dignity to the voice of people,” said Franzi. “Salvini could have been the leader of a trade union. He studied but he didn’t finish university, and does not have a degree. In a sense he epitomises the populist figure,” said Sergio Fabbrini, a political scientist at Luiss University. The common enemy was southerners, who were blamed for dragging down the country, much as migrants are today. Then, in 2012, a disastrous turn for the Northern League led to its near-collapse, and a golden opportunity. Umberto Bossi, who ruled the party for three decades, was forced out by a party funding scandal. A year later, when the League had hit a low of about 4% approval, Salvini took over, and decided to abandon the secessionist Padania fantasy. He turned the party around. “He understood that independence was not people’s main problem. He understood that people were fighting against globalisation, inequality, migration, unemployment, and he understood that if he wanted to get more votes, he had to speak to all the Italians, not just the northern Italian citizens,” said Franzi. Eventually, he would travel to Naples and apologise for the Northern League’s diatribes against southern Italians. Under his watch, the League also flirted with the neo-fascist fringes, like the CasaPound movement in Rome. In street rallies in 2014 and 2015, the League and CasaPound would often appear together, and Salvini began to adopt neo-fascist slogans, such as “Italians first” and “Italy for the Italians”. “But he understood that those links with the extreme right were dangerous for him. He stopped their dialogue, and said he did not want to make an [official] alliance. But he did not change the slogans,” said Franzi, the biographer. Even today, there are loose links with such groups at a local level, analysts say. As he sought to gain acceptance, mostly by launching fierce attacks against “invading” migrants and by threatening to raze Roma camps, Salvini was usually outmanoeuvred by Silvio Berlusconi, the polished former prime minister with whom he had a bitter rivalry. Although they worked together in a coalition, Berlusconi seemed to see his young partner as little more than an errand boy.
But it was Salvini who had the last laugh. Berlusconi – a billionaire who had been dogged by legal troubles for more than a decade – suffered a collapse in his support in the 4 March election and the League emerged as the biggest party within the centre-right coalition, with about 17% of the vote. It was far behind the Five Star Movement’s 33% but strong enough to enter government as a coalition partner. In the weeks that followed, Salvini refused to let Di Maio become prime minister, and the pair ultimately agreed to name Conte, an unknown lawyer, as premier. It created a power vacuum. Salvini started dominating headlines, first by his decision to block an NGO ship carrying more than 600 migrants from landing in Italy, and then by announcing a new – unconstitutional – plan to create a census of the Roma community. Noemi Di Segni, the president of Italy’s union of Jewish communities, said the proposal recalled the fascist race laws of the late 1920s and 1930s. Di Maio briefly voiced objections, but then seemed to backtrack, saying it was the constitution – not him personally – who disagreed with the plan. Salvini has denied being racist or holding fascist views. But his most important allies are espousing a far-right ideology: Steve Bannon, the former Trump strategist, Nigel Farage in the UK, Marine Le Pen in France, and Hungary’s rightwing prime minister, Viktor Orbán. Salvini has also expressed admiration for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Last year, he travelled to Moscow where he agreed a “collaboration” with the deputy speaker of the Russian parliament, Sergei Zheleznyak, who was put under sanctions by the EU in 2014 for his role in Russia’s war over Crimea. Giovanni Orsina, a political historian, said those who knew Salvini believed he was a true ideologue, and not using his war against migrants as a political instrument. “If you see the performance of the League, it matches the growth of migrants in Italy. There is a very strong connection. Once he started getting the votes, it all went very fast,” Orsina said. Born 9 March 1973 Career: Director of Radio Padania. Member of the European parliament.

2018-06-22T11:06:07Z,world,World news,Litvinenko widow threatens to sue RT over 'libellous' claims,"The widow of Alexander Litvinenko is threatening to sue RT and another pro-Kremlin TV channel after they screened “libellous” claims that the Russian dissident was murdered by his close friend Alex Goldfarb. Marina Litvinenko and Goldfarb have demanded retractions from RT and the state-run Channel One after they made a series of “reckless and defamatory allegations” in March and April, in the aftermath of the poisonings of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, they say. The British government blamed Moscow for the attack on the Russian former double agent and his daughter in Salisbury. The Kremlin responded with a media counter-offensive, featuring press conferences by Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, and a domestic campaign aimed at persuading Russians the claim was a smear. Litvinenko’s father, Walter, played a starring role in this campaign. Litvinenko was murdered in 2006 with a radioactive cup of tea and his father initially blamed Vladimir Putin. But after an unhappy period of exile in Italy, he returned to Russia in 2012 and begged the president for “forgiveness”. In April, RT screened a 30-minute interview with Walter Litvinenko, in which he claimed Goldfarb was a CIA agent. He said Goldfarb murdered Litvinenko in his hospital bed, citing a “confession” by Goldfarb’s late wife. Goldfarb then murdered his wife to cover up the crime, he alleged. RT translated the interview into English and aired it on the Worlds Apartshow, hosted by Oksana Boyko. RT this week acknowledged the legal complaint but has so far not commented. Walter Litvinenko’s claims have no basis in fact. In 2016 a public inquiry into Litvinenko’s death ruled that his polonium killers were Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun and that they were sent by Russia’s FSB spy agency. Putin and the FSB’s then boss, Nikolai Patrushev, “probably approved” the killing on British soil, the inquiry found. Speaking to the Guardian, Goldfarb said he initially took the RT claims “impersonally”, seeing them “as just another shot in the propaganda war”. “But then when everybody started teasing me as ‘Alex the murderer’ and I imagined millions had watched these programmes I realised that somehow it sticks. A creepy feeling,” he said. Goldfarb’s wife, Svetlana, died of cancer in 2010, four years after Litvinenko’s murder. Goldfarb and Marina Litvinenko have written to RT’s editor-in-chief, Margarita Simonyan, and the Channel One chief, Konstantin Ernst, demanding retractions. They have also launched a crowdfunding page to help pay the legal costs, estimated at more than $300,000 (£225,000). The case will be lodged before a federal court in Manhattan.
Marina Litvinenko said she had put up with “huge pressure and propaganda” from Moscow for more than a decade, and she had done her best to protect her husband’s reputation from “lies and fake stories”. Her father-in-law’s recent public support for Putin saddened her, she said. The Kremlin’s TV campaign was politically motivated, and an attempt to deflect blame from her husband’s real murderers, she said. Russia’s modern spy agencies were using “old-school KGB methods” and cynically exploiting Litvinenko’s family members. She added: “I believe in justice”. Channel One screened libellous material in four separate broadcasts, including the popular primetime show Person and Law, she alleges. During one broadcast Walter Litvinenko shared a sofa with an uncomfortable-looking Lugovoi, whom British authorities have charged with Litvinenko’s murder. Lugovoi is a deputy in Russia’s parliament and the recipient of an honour from Putin. The state-run network also claimed Marina Litvinenko lied to the public inquiry, which heard evidence of how the two killers left a polonium trail across London. Walter Litvinenko told RT, in contrast, that Russia’s president was a “decent person”, and incapable of doing “nasty things”.
On Tuesday, the New York-based lawyer Bertrand Sellier wrote to Simonyan: “Your actions constitute intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress on our clients, particularly Mrs Litvinenko. She struggled for 10 years to have her husband’s murderers named in a court of law. “Undermining the court’s finding with a fake narrative before tens of millions of viewers adds insult to injury. We hereby demand that you issue a full and immediate retraction and apology with equal reach and prominence as the broadcast itself.” Channel One did not respond to a request for comment. RT faces multiple investigations by the UK broadcast regulator, including in connection with the Skripals’ novichok poisoning. Ofcom said it was examining a number of instances in which the channel potentially breached laws on impartiality. “Since the events in Salisbury, we have observed a significant increase in the number of programmes broadcast that we consider warrant investigation as potential breaches of the broadcasting code,” the regulator said. “Ultimately, we may decide that the licence should be revoked because the licensee is not fit and proper, on broadcasting compliance grounds.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/litvinenko-widow-threatens-sue-rt-libellous-claims,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/litvinenko-widow-threatens-sue-rt-libellous-claims
2018-06-22T10:55:26Z,world,World news,‘We don’t really need phones’: the French school that banned mobiles,"It’s breaktime at a middle school in rural Brittany, and huddles of teenagers are chatting in the playground. Two 15-year-olds sit reading novels, while others kick footballs or play chase. One boy does some press-ups. The hum of conversation and flurry of movement contrasts with most other French secondary schools, where playgrounds can be eerily silent as pupils stare at their mobile phones. In La Gautrais, no one looks at Instagram, Snapchat or YouTube. Here mobile phones have been banned. Few seem to miss them. “I do have a phone, but I leave it at home and don’t really think about it much,” shrugged one 14-year-old girl in a denim jacket. “I don’t rush to check it after school. When I get home, first I’ll have a snack, I’ll chat to my mum, do some homework, then I might look at my phone. But only if I’m waiting for an important message.” Two of her friends don’t have mobile phones at all. “We don’t really need phones because we’re always chatting to each other in person, we chat the whole time – too much probably – and we’re really good friends,” one said.
La Gautrais middle school in the village of Plouasne banned the use of mobile phone on its grounds four years ago, long before the French president, Emmanuel Macron, made an election promise to outlaw children’s phones in schools in an attempt to “detox” teenagers increasingly addicted to screens. From September, all nursery, primary and middle schools will ban mobile phone use. More than 90% of 12- to 17-year-olds are believed to own a mobile phone in France, and children were already banned from unauthorised use in class. But , as in the UK, it was left to headteachers to decide whether to limit phones in breaktime.
La Gautrais’s 290 pupils between the ages of 12 and 16 come from surrounding villages in this farming area. Since the ban, staff have noticed more social interaction between children, more empathy and a readiness to learn at the start of lessons. There is less “switching-off anger” at having to move from breaktime gaming on smartphones to focusing in class. “No phone use at school gives pupils a moment’s peace from social networks and some children tell us they appreciate that,” said the headteacher, Yves Koziel. “On social networks there’s an acceleration and extreme simplification of group relationships which can create conflict, even bullying. We’re freeing them from that – at least during the day. We’re cutting the umbilical cord and offering some respite from it.” Koziel said he was pleased to see children returning to “ordinary things”, such as chatting, games and breaktime clubs and activities including dance and knitting. “I think children are more available for social interaction when they’re obliged to really speak to each other,” he said.
Policing the ban has not been difficult. Pupils switch off phones and leave them in schoolbags and there are fewer than 10 confiscations a year. “At my previous schools, sometimes phones were in pencil cases and pupils were checking them or writing messages on phones on their laps,” Laura Floch, an English teacher, said. “Here, phones aren’t an issue.” In March, Floch took a group of 15-year-old pupils to London for a five-day trip, visiting sights including the British Museum and the Museum of London. The teenagers were not allowed to use their phones during the day or during excursions, except when asking to take photographs of sights, but they could use them in evening free time. She said: “They knew it was fair and they accepted it. But I could see other groups of children from France on similar trips at the same museums just sitting on benches and staring at their phones during the whole museum visit instead of taking part.” Sitting with his friends at breaktime, Anatole Desriac, who recently got his first mobile phone at the age of 15, said he approved of the ban. “When I’m with my friends I prefer a proper conversation,” he said. “If you’re all standing around with phones, you talk about what’s on the screen rather than really listening to each other.” He and his friends use their phones to listen to French rap on the long bus journey. At home, playing Fortnite on PlayStation was just as enticing as a phone, but all their parents limited screen use. “Knowing how to use phones in moderation is just part of life for us,” Christian-Steven Kitoko, 16, said. Desriac’s mother, Nicole Lefeuvre, a librarian, said: “Children and parents tend to agree that it’s a good thing not using phones at school. Parents of teenagers find it hard enough to be constantly negotiating screen time at home.” Her rules include no phones before the age of 15, no phones in bedrooms, no screens at all on Thursdays and school-holiday reading time for novels, comics or magazines. In the playground, many under-14s said their biggest worry was breaking their phones, smashing them or dropping them in water so they were happy to leave them at home for safety’s sake.
One 16-year-old girl said she did not mind keeping her phone switched off on though she felt attached to it. “I have to know it’s there and I keep it in my jacket pocket, touching it regularly. I feel a bit lost without it.” In Bourges in central France, Jean-Claude Chevalier, the headteacher at Littré middle school, which has 600 pupils, introduced a ban on phone use at breaktimes this year because of what the playground had become. “Staff were surprised to see hundreds of children simultaneously glued to their phones during break – all sitting down staring at a screen and not talking,” he said. “It brought a loss of empathy, because children can use much stronger language on a screen than they would use face to face.” None of the fears about banning phones had materialised. “We thought there might be more playground violence and rowdiness but that wasn’t the case. Pupils talk more, the playground is livelier,” Chevalier said. “We thought we’d have to confiscate dozens of phones a day, in fact the number of confiscations has gone down. We thought the toilets would be monopolised by children sneaking a look at their phones, but that hasn’t happened at all. “What we have seen is that pupils seem less addicted to phones.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

2018-06-22T09:32:17Z,world,World news,UN envoy confident of Yemen deal to prevent Hodeidah port violence,"The UN’s special envoy to Yemen has expressed confidence that a deal can be struck between Houthi forces and the Saudi-backed Yemeni government to prevent an escalation of violence around the strategic port of Hodeidah. The rebel-held Red Sea port – the distribution point for more than 70% of the aid reaching Yemen – is under assault from an array of forces, including those of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Martin Griffiths is negotiating a ceasefire in which Hodeidah port would be handed over to full UN control and its revenues channelled to the Yemeni state bank. He held talks with the Houthi leadership in the Yemeni capital, Sana’a, and said he was “encouraged by the constructive engagement”. In a statement he said he expected to meet shortly with President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, the leader of the UN-recognised Yemeni government. Hadi has been in exile and heavily dependent on Saudi sponsorship.
The Houthi terms for handing the port to UN control have not yet met the conditions set by the Saudi-led coalition, and Griffiths warned “further military escalation would have severe political and humanitarian consequences”. The UAE’s foreign minister, Anwar Gargash, has demanded an unconditional withdrawal of all Houthi forces from Hodeidah and claimed Houthi forces were seeking to “manufacture a humanitarian crisis” by blocking aid from being unloaded at the port and destroying supplies of water in the city’s residential areas. But Amnesty International has accused coalition forces of deliberately delaying unloading of aid from the port over months, adding that its actions amounted to collective punishment and a war crime. Amnesty said in a new 22-page report, entitled Stranglehold, that since 2015 the coalition had repeatedly tightened its blockade of the two Houthi-controlled ports of Saleef and Hodeidah, seriously impeding Yemenis’ access to food. Using the cover of enforcing a UN arms embargo, the Saudis were slowing the docking of ships by carrying out inspections that delayed vessels by an average of 120 hours in March and 74 hours in April this year, the report said. The inspections were duplicating UN inspections of ships that had been introduced in 2015 after Saudi protests that Houthis were using aid convoys to smuggle Iranian arms. The Saudis, under a deal brokered with the UN, are permitted additional inspections to those carried out by the UN, and if necessary can divert boats to a different port for full inspection. Amnesty had tracked one shipment that was delayed for 50 days after it was cleared for unloading by the UN. A second was delayed for 46 days and a third for 24 days. Only one of the delays had been notified to the UN security council by the Saudi coalition as required under the UN agreement, Amnesty said. Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty’s Middle East director, said: “The time that these inspections are taking is effectively obstructing the flow of humanitarian aid and essential goods, and that is why we have found that this could amount to collective punishment blockades that cause substantial, disproportionate harm to civilians are prohibited under international law.” Amnesty also criticised Houthi distribution of aid, including the delays it imposed on aid workers seeking to distribute food out of Sana’a warehouses. Houthis were also seeking to direct the groups to which aid was distributed and demanding bribes to release food from warehouses. In a sign that the crisis could escalate, despite the UN envoy’s optimism, Gargash said: “The UN, international aid groups and the media report Houthi militia are purposefully and deliberately seeking to manufacture a humanitarian crisis and exacerbate conditions in the port and city. “The Houthis are blocking offloading of aid at Hodeida port; destroying water and sewage supplies.” He claimed Houthis were planting improvised explosive devices and other explosives in the city. He said it was increasingly urgent that the Houthis leave the city unconditionally. Reporters in Hodeidah said the Houthis were digging defences while civilians were largely staying in their homes. A collapse in water supplies in Yemen’s hot summer would be a disaster, aid groups said. The UAE is largely overseeing the offensive on Hodeidah with a 20,000-strong force consisting mostly of Yemenis gathered from southern separatists, Red Sea coastal plain fighters and followers of a nephew of the late president Ali Abdullah Saleh. These forces have captured western coastal towns to form a narrow strip of control from the UAE’s southern bases to the port. The coalition has captured the airport, but will need to enter more densely inhabited areas either to take the port or to cut off the main road out of Hodeidah.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/un-envoy-confident-of-yemen-deal-to-prevent-hodeidah-port-violence,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/un-envoy-confident-of-yemen-deal-to-prevent-hodeidah-port-violence

2018-06-22T08:00:56Z,world,World news,China: new rules to prevent sex-selective abortions raise fears,"New rules restricting abortions in a Chinese province have prompted concern from citizens and activists over state control of women’s bodies. Jiangxi province issued guidelines last week stipulating that women more than 14 weeks pregnant must have signed approval from three medical professionals confirming an abortion is medically necessary before any procedure. The measures are meant to help prevent sex-selective abortions, which are illegal in China. The sex of a child is often discernible after 14 weeks. “Your womb is being monitored,” said one comment on the Weibo microblogging website. “What is the purpose and basis of this policy? The reproductive rights of women in this country seem to be a joke,” said another. One user wrote simply, “The Handmaid’s Tale,” referring to the TV series set in a dystopian future where women’s reproductive functions are tightly controlled by the state. Jiangxi’s guidelines come as Chinese officials look for ways to deal with the country’s ageing population and low fertility rates, the result of decades of restricting family size, known as the one-child policy. Loosened restrictions over recent years to allow all parents to have two children has so far failed to resolve China’s demographic problems, which threatens economic growth. The government is considering scrapping limits altogether. Some worry China’s family planning apparatus will turn its heavy-handed approach to restricting women’s choices. “People are worried that the government will go from lifting restrictions, to encouraging reproduction, to imposing restrictions on abortion and restricting people’s own decisions,” said Lu Pin, founder of Feminist Voices, a blog on gender issues. Lu added that many Chinese women, who had chosen not to have a second child despite the new policies, were fearful that strict social policies will be introduced. “There are plenty of signs that show their worries are not unfounded,” she said. China’s family planning policies have long encouraged the use of abortions, along with contraceptives and sterilisation, as a way to restrict population growth. Since 1971, when the country first introduced limits, doctors have performed 336m abortions, according to government data released in 2013. In the past, other provinces have implemented similar rules to crack down on aborting female foetuses, a practice that has left China with a massive gender imbalance of 30 million more men than women. In 2004, Guizhou was the first province to enact such a ban. Other Chinese provinces such as Jiangsu, Hunan, Qinghai, Anhui, Henan, and the city of Shanghai have followed suit with varying restrictions on abortions after 14 weeks. More provinces are likely to follow Jiangxi’s lead, according to Cai Yong, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. “In a top-down system, and at a time of tight central control, it is hard for me to imagine this act is a spontaneous one... It definitely signals a major policy change. Still, Yong doubted whether China would go as far as barring abortions to encourage women to have more children. “Certainly China is capable and has a history of doing that kind of thing but whether it will go all the way to ban abortion … I think that’s a little too far.” Additional reporting by Wang Xueying",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/china-new-rules-jiangxi-province-prevent-sex-selective-abortions,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/china-new-rules-jiangxi-province-prevent-sex-selective-abortions
2018-06-22T05:32:25Z,world,World news,'That's 4.2 million godparents': New Zealand basks in 'first baby' glow,"New Zealand is basking in a nationwide new baby glow after prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced the birth of her first child on Thursday. The arrival of the as-yet-unnamed baby girl, dubbed the “first pēpi”, made it onto every major newspaper front page on Friday. The Press in Christchurch went with a pink banner. The New Zealand Herald had a special celebratory wrap-around. The Bay of Plenty Times splashed with “It’s a girl!”.
The “very fine and wonderful occasion” was also marked with a specially-commissioned poem by the poet laureate titled Jacinda and Clarke and Baby and Us. “The baby’s here, the baby’s here! Aotearoa, New Zealand, what a year!” it began. On Friday, Ardern posted a picture from Auckland Hospital of herself, the baby and her midwife. “One of the many special people we have been so grateful for over these past few months, our wonderful midwife Libby,” she wrote. “Not only is she incredible at what she does, this morning she made me macaroni and cheese because she heard me mention a wee craving yesterday. Thank you so much for everything Libby!” The prime minister is expected to spend a second night in hospital with her baby, who was reportedly described by nurses as “alert and very hungry”.
Meanwhile, columnist Michelle Duff suggested that all New Zealanders were now the child’s godparents. “Let’s just take a moment to appreciate that we, as a nation, have pushed the boundaries and created an environment where this can happen. That’s 4.2 million godparents for you, little pēpi.” Commentator Morgan Godfrey lauded the baby’s understated arrival. “Jacinda Ardern arrived at hospital in her own car, with Clarke driving,” he wrote on Twitter. “No Crown limo or special ambulance. Her baby was delivered in a public hospital alongside everyone else’s. No private hospital. No extra special attention. New Zealand, remain your understated self.”
Ardern’s father Ross told Radio New Zealand that the grandparents were “very proud”. “We’re a family that are fairly well grounded and to see this on the international media is absolutely different - I can say that without a shadow of a doubt.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/thats-42-million-godparents-new-zealand-basks-in-first-baby-glow,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/thats-42-million-godparents-new-zealand-basks-in-first-baby-glow
2018-06-22T05:24:41Z,world,World news,Friday briefing: Brexit – Airbus braces for crash landing,"Top story: ‘Direct threat’ to thousands of UK jobs Good morning – I’m Warren Murray. Let’s get to the bottom of Friday’s news. Brussels is preparing for a no-deal Brexit, Jean-Claude Juncker has declared, while the planemaker Airbus says Britain crashing out would force it to cut thousands of jobs in the UK and move production to other countries. Juncker, the European commission president, told a joint session of the Irish parliament that Brexit negotiations are in a dangerous state, with the two sides still far apart on the “hardest issues” just days from a crunch leaders’ summit in Brussels. The EU was even drafting plans aimed at keeping the peace in Northern Ireland. “Ireland comes first,” Juncker said, warning that Brussels would not allow the UK to manipulate the border issue in order to maintain single-market access, without freedom of movement and other EU requirements. Airbus is poised to abandon plans to build aircraft wings in British factories. The company directly employs 14,000 people in Britain, supports more than 110,000 jobs in the supply chain and generates £1.7bn in tax revenue. It has issued a damning risk assessment of a no-deal Brexit. Tom Williams, the chief operating officer of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, said: “Far from ‘Project Fear’, this is a dawning reality for Airbus. Put simply, a no-deal scenario directly threatens Airbus’s future in the UK.” * * * Windrush Day – It is 70 years since the arrival of the Empire Windrush and the disembarkation of a wave of Caribbean people who would help shape postwar Britain. Alford Gardner made a beeline for Leeds where he had trained as an RAF engineer during the war. Today he is still there – with eight children, 16 grandchildren and 21 (he thinks) great-grandchildren all living nearby. “If I could start over, I would do everything the same.”
There was another, hidden Windrush generation: Polish families who ended up as wartime refugees in Mexico came on the ship to reunite with their freedom fighter husbands, fathers and brothers who had been given the right to settle in Britain. “The story of the Poles sits bizarrely alongside the official narrative for Windrush Day,” writes Jane Raca, whose mother-in-law was one of them. The legacy of Windrush has been soured for some by the scandalous treatment of migrants under the “hostile environment policy”, exposed in the award-winning reporting of the Guardian’s Amelia Gentleman. British citizen Pauline Pennant, 70, retired to Jamaica and fears returning to the UK after the NHS billed her £4,000 for cancer tests. “They have traumatised our lives,” she says. * * * Compassion, after a fashion – Melania Trump’s jarring choice of a jacket that said “I really don’t care, do U?” has marred her visit to a Mexican border shelter that is housing immigrant children separated from their parents. The first lady, who has criticised the separation policy, said at the New Hope shelter in McAllen, Texas, that she wanted to “help reunite these children with their families as quickly as possible”. It remains unclear how Donald Trump’s executive order to end the separations is being put into practice. Guardian reporters at the border in Texas saw no evidence of parents separated from their children being released from jails, or children being let out and reunited. * * * ‘We too have lost a son’ – The parents of the Quebec City mosque shooter have appealed for the court not to impose a “death penalty in disguise”. Alexandre Bissonnette, 28, could face 150 years of back-to-back life sentences without parole after pleading guilty to six counts of murder. As sentencing arguments wrapped up on Thursday, Raymond Bissonnette said his son had been subjected to relentless bullying at school that they had tried for years to address. “Unfortunately, Alexandre’s mental condition caused by the years of intimidation was not identified by us nor by the doctors he consulted,” he said. “Alexandre is not a monster.” Sentencing is not expected to take place until October. * * * Shock at Ladies’ Day – A horse-drawn carriage has crashed into a shop window during Royal Ascot, leaving one of the horses badly cut and bleeding. Witnesses said the horses panicked and went out of control down the high street, across a roundabout and into the window. Two injured animals were taken away in a horse ambulance and one passenger was treated for minor injuries. * * * Dan back but Roseanne barred – The ABC television network in the US is putting together a spin-off from Roseanne, minus the disgraced star. The network revived Roseanne Barr’s 1990s sitcom but then axed it because of her racial outbursts on Twitter. The Connors is the working title for the new show, which has been conceived to save the jobs of 200 cast and crew, according to its producers. World Cup Argentina manager Jorge Sampaoli has accepted full responsibility for their humiliating 3-0 defeat against Croatia which leaves them on the brink of elimination from the World Cup and said he “begs for forgiveness” from the supporters who turned on him. Lionel Messi might not have been the cause of the defensive collapse at Nizhny Novgorod Stadium but the team’s dependence on him makes them predictable, writes Jonathan Wilson, and when they looked to their captain he wasn’t there. Messi’s culpability and the other action from day eight – including Australia’s draw with Denmark and France’s victory over Peru – are on the agenda in our daily World Cup podcast.
In the England camp Marcus Rashford is set to replace Raheem Sterling in Gareth Southgate’s starting lineup against Panama on Sunday, after photographs of England coach’s notes appeared to reveal his plans. Such a move would be a sign that Southgate’s national setup is run as a meritocracy, writes Dominic Fifield. Brazil continue their redemption mission against Costa Rica, Nigeria meet a bullish Iceland and Serbia play Switzerland under the shadow of Kosovo in today’s games. You can follow each and every one with our live blogs – the buildup to the opening kick-off has already begun. Lunchtime read: Who would be the next Tory PM? “He’s on manoeuvres, there’s no doubt. The question is how far he is really prepared to push it.” So says one government backbench MP of Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary who, after bringing the NHS out of austerity, is being tipped as a potential successor to Theresa May.
Another is Sajid Javid, the home secretary. His father, Abdul, arrived from Pakistan in 1961with a £1 note in his pocket – Sajid rose through comprehensive schooling and university to become a banker on a reputed £3m salary. Tory insiders believe he could be the first British Asian prime minister. “He’s the face of the modern Tory party,” one MP says. Alongside Hunt we have the usual suspects of Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, as well as Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary and former chief whip. Here is a look at these five Conservative leadership contenders. Sport Tim Kerrison, Chris Froome’s long-term coach, has attacked the growing criticism in the French media towards the Team Sky rider in the buildup to this year’s Tour de France following the latest attack on Froome from the retired five-times Tour winner Bernard Hinault. England’s cricketers can scent a whitewash after Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow relentlessly turned the screw on Australia in a six-wicket win in the fourth ODI. Frankie Dettori played the crowd like a conductor leading an orchestra at Royal Ascot after riding Stradivarius to Gold Cup victory. Nick Kyrgios apologised for swearing at the end of his win over Kyle Edmund at Queen’s after the Australian reached boiling point, providing further evidence that his temperament could yet strangle his genius. And Lewis Hamilton has admitted Sunday’s World Cup match between England and Panama could be a distraction to his preparations for the French Grand Prix, which has itself been delayed to avoid a clash with the football. Business Asian stocks have fallen following Wall Street losses as trade dispute fears continue to swirl. Japan and the Hang Seng both fell, while the Shanghai Composite and the Kospi in South Korea both rose but remained down on the start of the week. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was flat while Taiwan, Singapore and south-east Asian countries were lower. Sterling jumped back from a seven-month trough after the Bank of England’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, unexpectedly joined the minority of policymakers calling for rates to rise to 0.75%. The pound traded at $1.326 and €1.142 overnight. The papers “Airbus prepares to take flight” says the Times as it splashes on the many UK aerospace jobs at risk because of Brexit. But the Telegraph reports that we should “Drop the defeatism on Brexit” according to the US ambassador. The Express predicts a “£90bn summer boost for the economy” and is pulling out the stops to bring it about, cheerleading on “renewed confidence about Brexit” and “unparalleled optimism among consumers”. The Mail moans “3.8 million EU migrants allowed to stay here”, and not only that, “they can bring their families”.
The Guardian’s front-page photo celebrates the Windrush pioneers who changed Britain while the lead story is about the upcoming vote on a third runway for Heathrow. “My mum blew the whistle but was bullied out” – the Mirror’s splash about the opiate deaths at Gosport War Memorial hospital. The Sun reports on the suicide of former Love Island contestant Sophie Gradon. The FT says Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane has given a boost to sterling by backing the push for a rate rise. Sign up

2018-06-22T05:05:32Z,world,World news,Malaysia to reopen inquiry into murder of Mongolian model,"Malaysia will reopen the investigation into the murder of Mongolian translator Altantuya Shaariibuu, a case that has cast a shadow over the government of former prime minister Najib Razak for more than a decade. In June 2006, a pregnant Altantuya was taken to a forest and shot twice in the head and then her body blown up with explosives. Two bodyguards working for Najib, Azilah Hadri and Sirul Azhar Umar, were convicted of the murder and sent to jail in 2008, but a neither a motive for the crime, nor who ordered the killing, was ever investigated.
“I can confirm we are reopening investigations,” inspector-general of police Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun said on Friday. He confirmed that a new police report submitted by Altantuya’s father on Wednesday was one reason for the new investigation. Altantuya had been the lover of Abdul Razak Baginda, a known associate of Najib, and many believe that her involvement in a defence deal to purchase two French Scorpene submarines may have led to her death. Both Baginda and Najib were alleged to have taken multi-million dollar backhanders for the deal, which they both deny. Najib has always denied ever even meeting Altantuya and Baginda was cleared of all charges for abetting her murder. Asked about the Altantuya case this week, Najib said: “I’m on record to have sworn in a mosque in the name of Allah that I had nothing to do with the case. I still maintain that I only knew she died four, five days after the death … that was the first time I heard about her. There is no evidence to show I ever knew her.”
On Wednesday, Altantuya’s father, Steve Shaariibuu, submitted a police report about her death, citing new evidence. He called for investigation into why Najib’s aide, Musa Shafri, was never called as a witness in the original trial. Musa was Azilah and Sirul’s boss and it is alleged he gave them the direct order to carry out her killing. “I believe that if not for Musa, Azilah and Sirul would not have come to Razak’s house that day and taken my daughter away and she would very likely still be alive today,” said Shaariibuu in the police report. “Musa therefore is a very crucial witness as he would be able to provide information as to who instructed him to secure Azilah and Sirul’s said attendance and for what purpose.” Sirul is in detention in Australia, after he fled Malaysia while out on bail. He said recently he would comply with a new investigation into Altantuya’s death and sources told the Guardian that Australian authorities have given the green light to deport Sirul back to Malaysia if he is treated fairly. Malaysia have confirmed it is considering dropping the death penalty charges against Sirul so he can be extradited.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/malaysia-altantuya-reopen-investigation-mongolian-model-murder,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/malaysia-altantuya-reopen-investigation-mongolian-model-murder
2018-06-22T05:00:21Z,world,World news,Libya turmoil a hurdle for EU's north Africa migration centre plan,"Senior European diplomats have privately admitted that plans to stabilise Libya, on which the long-term hopes rest of an end Europe’s migration crisis, are badly off track. European leaders will meet on Sunday in a hastily arranged emergency meeting as the German coalition threatens to collapse over an asylum row and Italy’s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has refused to allow NGO rescue boats to land in the country.
The EU hopes to set up regional disembarkation centres in north Africa so that not all asylum claimants picked up by search and rescue missions heading to Europe are transferred to Italy, but the proposals also rest to a degree on political reconciliation in Libya leading to greater security and a less benign climate for people traffickers.
But diplomats say plans to stage presidential elections in Libya this year look increasingly unlikely after a weeklong battle for the control of the country’s oil terminals ended with severe damage to the country’s critical oil infrastructure. Forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar, the Libyan strongman in the east of the country, claimed to have recaptured the terminals on the so-called oil crescent on Thursday, but the damage was described by the Libyan National Oil Corporation as catastrophic and hugely expensive. It said two storage tanks at the Ras Lanuf port terminal had been destroyed following their weeklong seizure by militia led by the former Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) local commander Ibrahim Jadhran, with the spread of fire threatening other tanks. Prior to the fighting, Ras Lanuf operated five crude oil storage tanks. Its crude oil storage capacity has dropped from 950,000 barrels to 550,000. The British ambassador to Libya, Frank Baker, described the attack as a tragedy for the Libyan people.
Libya has two rival governments – one in the east controlled by Haftar and another in the west backed by the UN – while effective power in much of the country remains in the hands of local militias. Haftar’s Libyan National Army claimed the attack had been supported by the UN-backed government in Tripoli, and was designed to distract it from its long-term assault on Derna, the last coastal city in the east to elude Haftar’s control. European diplomats said the fighting showed how far Libya remains from a political settlement, and underlined there was no point holding presidential elections if they were marred by violence and the result not respected by all sides. The need to achieve reconciliation among the 6.4 million Libyans is becoming ever more urgent for European politicians as populist and far-right movements gather strength by highlighting unease about migration. But the idea of processing centres is greeted with suspicion by many European politicians due to the degrading conditions in existing Libyan detention centres.
Antonio Panzeri, the chair of the European parliament’s human rights committee, said any future cooperation must be conditional on the closure of existing detention centres. Judith Sutherland, associate director at Human Rights Watch Europe said a host of questions arose from the plan: “Who will do the processing, what safeguards are in place, will NGOs and lawyers have access, what are reception conditions, how are vulnerable groups protected, will people have genuine prospect of resettlement to EU?” One difficulty is that relatively few asylum claims in any African processing centre will be granted. The vast majority of asylum claims in Italy, once assessed, are rejected on the grounds that the claimant is an economic migrant, and the same is likely to happen in countries such as Niger. That leaves unanswered whether a rejected claimant would voluntarily return to their native country or instead seek to reach Europe by other means. The greater immediate difficulty in Italy is the speed with which claims of African migrants are being processed, and deported, not the number of new arrivals, which is slowing substantially.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/libya-turmoil-a-hurdle-for-eus-north-africa-migration-centre-plan,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/libya-turmoil-a-hurdle-for-eus-north-africa-migration-centre-plan
2018-06-22T04:00:18Z,world,World news,'People are smiling again': opposition finds its voice before Turkish elections,"There are two views of Istanbul from the office of Murat Sabuncu, the editor-in-chief of Cumhuriyet, Turkey’s oldest independent newspaper and the last still publishing. The windows on one side look on to an old cemetery. Those on the other side face the courthouse. It is an apt metaphor for the newspaper, threatened with closure for daring to criticise the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and its editor, sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for doing his job.
Turkey is the world’s biggest jailer of journalists, ahead of China and Egypt. Seventy-three were imprisoned in 2017 alone and more than 120 have been jailed since a failed coup attempt in 2016. Hundreds have lost their jobs in the aftermath of the coup, while allies of the government have bought up most of the country’s news outlets to transform the vast majority of the media into a loyalist press. “We are trying to be a newspaper that speaks the words of those who cannot speak and show the things that cannot be shown,” Sabuncu said. Cumhuriyet journalists were detained in October 2016 as part of a sweeping crackdown by the government on dissidents. Twelve were arrested in dawn raids, and the chairman of the newspaper’s board, Akın Atalay, returned from a trip to Germany to turn himself in, all accused of aiding terrorist groups. They were held for nine months without an indictment, until their trial began in July last year. The court ended up convicting 13 staff, most of whom are currently free pending appeals. An appeal hearing in Sabuncu’s case is scheduled for July. Another court case could lead to government-appointed trustees assuming control of Cumhuriyet. Turkey is days away from arguably the most important elections in its modern history. The winner of the presidential race will assume extraordinary powers that were narrowly approved in a referendum last year. Erdoğan is favoured to win. Conditions in the country hardly allow for a fair contest. The polls will take place under a state of emergency imposed almost two years ago after the failed coup. Since then tens of thousands of people have been arrested or dismissed from their jobs in the media, judiciary, police, army and bureaucracy, often with little prospect for appeal. Presidential candidates have repeatedly criticised that state media for giving much more airtime to the incumbent than his rivals. “Erdoğan didn’t buy the journalists,” said Aydın Engin, a veteran Cumhuriyet columnist who was also briefly imprisoned. “He bought out the media. The media is acting like an organ of [Erdoğan’s political party] the AKP.” A report in April by the rights watchdog Amnesty, whose Turkey chair, Taner Kılıç, has been in jail for more than a year, described a “suffocating climate of fear” in the country. It said the government had deliberately and methodically set about dismantling civil society and had nearly destroyed Turkey’s legal system in its pursuit of dissidents.
But despite the perpetual state of crisis, Turkish voters have turned out in droves to opposition rallies, energising a contest whose outcome two months ago seemed to be pre-ordained. Unexpectedly dynamic campaigns by Muharrem İnce, the main challenger, and the breakaway nationalist Meral Akşener have revitalised a moribund opposition movement that has lost election after election. Selahattin Demirtaş, the charismatic Kurdish leader of the People’s Democratic party (HDP), has run his campaign from a jail cell in Edirne, communicating to supporters through his lawyers. AKP fears that it could lose control of parliament while retaining the presidency have pushed the government into promises of compromises, such as ending the state of emergency after the polls. But for many opposition activists, whether Erdoğan and his party win or not, what matters is they have once again found their voices. “I believe the people and the journalists and democrats are going to change something rather than the politicians,” said Sabuncu. “I always thought smiling is a revolutionary act. I noticed that in the last 15 or 20 days, people started smiling again.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/people-are-smiling-again-opposition-finds-its-voice-before-turkish-elections,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/people-are-smiling-again-opposition-finds-its-voice-before-turkish-elections
2018-06-22T04:00:17Z,world,World news,Hungarian nationalist rock opera to retell 1920s grievances,"The signing of a 1920 peace treaty does not immediately sound like ideal subject matter for musical theatre. But on Friday and Saturday night, hundreds of singers, dancers, acrobats and horsemen will fill the vast concrete expanse of Budapest’s Heroes’ Square for performances of Trianon: the rock opera. The treaty of Trianon sliced up Hungary in the aftermath of the first world war and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire. It still features heavily in Hungarians’ historical imagination 98 years later, and the so-called “Trianon trauma” is one of the building blocks for the nationalism of Viktor Orbán’s government.
“Trianon – the word and the subject matter – has been stirring passions in our country for a hundred years,” Gábor Koltay, the rock opera’s director and a member of Orbán’s Fidesz party, said at a recent press conference. “We will show how the events of 1920 – the dismemberment of the country – impacted our lives.” Orbán, who recently won a third consecutive term as prime minister, has cannily taken advantage of the sense of historical victimhood and loss among many Hungarians. It has helped him deliver a hard-right agenda, which this week saw parliament pass the so-called Stop Soros law that criminalises any individual or group that offers to help an illegal immigrant. At Trianon, Hungary was deprived of more than half of its pre-war territory and population. Many of these people were not ethnic Hungarians, but the treaty left more than 3 million Hungarians outside the borders of the new Hungary. “Around 2 million of these Hungarians were living right on the borders, in majority-Hungarian areas, so any fair treaty based on self-determination would have included them,” said András Mink, a historian. When Orbán’s government came to power in 2010, one of its first acts was to establish a “day of national unity” on 4 June, the anniversary of the signing of the Trianon treaty. Orbán quickly made ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring states eligible for Hungarian citizenship. These new citizens – in Slovakia, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine – have voted overwhelmingly for Orbán’s Fidesz party, giving it an electoral boost. Orbán has painted himself as the man who has led Hungary on a path back to recovering from some of the mental and moral losses at Trianon, if not the territorial ones. “Since Trianon we have never been so close to bringing our nation back to self-confidence and vitality as we are now,” Orbán said in a speech last year. “And if Hungary has a government that will serve foreign, globalist interests then Hungarians will lose this historic opportunity, and not just for one electoral cycle but for decades to come.” Few Hungarians believe that a redrawing of borders to regain lost land is possible or even desirable, although the opinion is still occasionally aired in pro-government media. More often, government figures have called for “moral reparations” and used the painful memory of Trianon as a rallying call for modern-day nationalism, and even to back up Orbán’s virulent anti-migration philosophy.
In a letter to locals asking them to vote against EU migration quotas in a 2016 referendum organised by Orbán’s government, István Vitányi, a Fidesz MP, wrote: “At Trianon we lost the majority of our country and we cannot lose the rest of it. So vote no!” Orbán’s critics say history teaching is one of many areas where the government is attempting to exercise increasing control. “There used to be a relatively free textbook market; now there’s basically a monopoly,” said László Miklósi, chairman of Hungary’s Independent Association of History Teachers. He said textbooks now offered a simplistic take on the “Trianon dictate” and Hungary’s victimhood. “Nobody sensible can doubt that what happened to Hungary in 1920 was unfair; however, it’s better if students can form their own opinions from looking at the sources.” The approach also stretched to more recent history, Miklósi said. Two years ago the association fought a court battle to have a government-funded history textbook withdrawn that painted Orbán as a national hero and asked students to write an essay in support of an anti-migration speech by the PM. The classroom is not the only place where the lessons of history appear tailored to an official narrative that portrays Hungary purely as a victim. A 2014 monument to the Nazi occupation in a central Budapest square has been criticised for whitewashing the role of Hungarians in the Holocaust. It depicts Hungary as the archangel Gabriel under attack from the German imperial eagle. Locals have created a rival, makeshift memorial on the pavement by the monument, dedicated to “historical truth”. Mária Schmidt, an Orbán loyalist, runs the Terror House, a central Budapest museum that chronicles the horrors wrought on Hungary by both the Nazis and the Soviets. Her latest book, heavily advertised inside the museum, is a collection of rants against the alleged Islamisation of Europe and “self-assured and arrogant” migrants who are enacting a long-held plan of eastern peoples to occupy Europe. A magazine controlled by Schmidt recently ran a list of 200 “mercenaries” supposedly paid by the Hungarian-American financier George Soros to destroy Hungary – an eyebrow-raising gambit from someone who runs a museum dedicated to the memory of victims of repressive regimes that drew up similar enemy lists. Orbán’s critics say the prime minister has exploited Hungary’s difficult history to push his nationalist messages, but they also acknowledge that the trials of the 20th century, and particularly the dismemberment at Trianon, provide fertile ground for doing so. “When you want to track down the roots of anti-western and anti-liberal sentiment in Hungary, you should go back to that moment in history, when for many the lesson was that the ideas of liberty and self-determination are valid only for the western powers,” said Mink.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/hungarian-nationalist-rock-opera-to-retell-1920s-grievances,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/hungarian-nationalist-rock-opera-to-retell-1920s-grievances
2018-06-22T00:16:43Z,world,World news,'A wound that never heals': families wait for North Korea to return their war dead,"Rising expectations that the Pyongyang regime will hand over the remains of some of the American dead from the Korean war have reawakened cautious hope among surviving relatives. Reports say the bones of up to 250 soldiers, marines and airmen are due to be handed over at a South Korean airbase, in line with a pledge from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to Donald Trump at their summit in Singapore on 12 June. In a speech at a rally in Minnesota on Tuesday night, Trump claimed the bodies of 200 servicemen had already returned, saying: “We got back our great fallen heroes, the remains sent back today, already 200 got sent back.” There has been no confirmation from the White House or any government agency that this repatriation has occurred.
Trump presented Kim’s offer as an unprecedented breakthrough but repatriation of remains has been happening on and off since 1990. There are 7,700 US troops still missing from the conflict – 5,300 of them lost in North Korea – and only 459 bodies have been identified from repatriated remains so far. Relatives and descendants of the Korean war dead have learned to be patient and sceptical about promises that they will finally be able to bury the long-lost bodies. John Zimmerlee was three when his father’s plane went down over North Korea in March 1952, and he was six when he listened to US army officers swear to his mother that they were actively looking for clues. “I was the one who went to the mailbox every day to see if there was any news,” Zimerlee said. He is now 69, and still waiting. “It is a big void in my life that never goes away.”
The sense of uncertainty has only been heightened by his own research, which turned up reports that some of the crew members of his father’s plane may have been seen alive in North Korea after it crashed, raising the prospect his father, also named John, could have been taken prisoner. Rick Downes’ father, Hal, went missing in January 1952 when his B26 bomber was shot down, and the pursuit of information about his fate has also lasted a lifetime. “This is something that only those who experience it know what it’s like,” Downes said. “The lack of closure creates a wound that never heals. It’s just there, and it goes on for generations.” He is the president of a coalition of families of Korean and cold war prisoners of war (POWs) and soldiers missing in action (MIAs), but was taken by surprise by talk of an imminent handover of remains. This week, he emailed his contacts at the Defence POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA), which is tasked with recovering the remains of the war dead, but they had not been informed of what appears to have been a hastily arranged deal in Singapore. In his joint statement with Trump, Kim offered the immediate delivery of remains which the regime says it has identified as American in recent years.
Cooperative efforts to repatriate the bodies of US troops from North Korea date back to 1996, two years after the Bill Clinton administration negotiated the Agreed Framework, a denuclearisation deal with Pyongyang. Ever since, repatriation has been a hostage to fortune in bilateral relations, and exploited as a source of cash by the Korean People’s Army (KPA). The hundred billion-dollar question “Invariably they wanted to discuss price tags at the outset. Someone at one of the first meetings said the work would cost a hundred billion dollars,” said Kurt Campbell, who led the first delegation to Pyongyang to discuss repatriation in 1996. “We stayed in a guest house with security guards and this magnificent food, when the country was on the verge of the worst famine in its history,” said Campbell, who went on to become assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs. “We would meet with one or two folks from the foreign ministry and political officers from the military. They would just rail at us about the imperialist war and our negative global role.”
Then the question of money would be raised. Technically the US could not pay for the remains but could reimburse the KPA for “legitimate costs” associated with the recovery of remains. “It was like negotiating with the mafia, which they were – a worldwide criminal network,” said Wallace “Chip” Gregson, a retired marine lieutenant general who took part in the early negotiations. In the ensuing decade there were 33 joint missions across the country, and US officers and forensic scientists brought back 229 caskets of bones and personal effects, from which 153 missing Americans have so far been identified. North Korea had unilaterally handed over 208 caskets, though many of the bones inside were not US soldiers and some were not even human. From those remains a further 181 of the war dead have been accounted for. The joint field missions were stopped in 2005 and the only repatriations since then have been seven bodies handed over to the governor of New Mexico, Bill Richardson in 2007, as a goodwill gesture. The Americans paid about a million dollars for the bodies in 2007.
“They told us they had these boxes of bones from their excavations but they had collected them at tremendous cost,” said Victor Cha, a former director of Asian affairs at the national security council who was in Richardson’s delegation. “In theory we were paying for costs incurred, but basically it was a kind of pay-off.” It is unclear whether money has been a factor in the Singapore deal on repatriation. A waiting game After Barack Obama sealed a short-lived agreement with Pyongyang in 2012, there was another attempt to restart repatriation of remains, but US and South Korean military exercises led to the breakdown of both the missile deal and the repatriation effort. If the repatriation of remains agreed in Singapore goes ahead it will be the first in 11 years. But the families of the dead are not expecting it to lead to quick answers. The DPAA labs in Hawaii and in Nebraska have limited space and capacity to apply DNA identification techniques, the relatives say. There are still hundreds of bodies repatriated more than 20 years ago that have not yet been identified. “My concern is that they are not going to have the volume they will need,” said Joan Morris, whose uncle, Lieutenant Robert Schmitt was killed in the battle for Chosin Reservoir in 1950. “They have all these bones they haven’t identified and now they are going to get more bones … They need to hire some more DNA experts and get this over with.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/a-wound-that-never-heals-families-wait-for-north-korea-to-return-their-war-dead,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/a-wound-that-never-heals-families-wait-for-north-korea-to-return-their-war-dead
2018-06-21T22:44:11Z,world,World news,Quebec City mosque shooter 'not a monster' say parents,"The parents of the 28-year-old man who opened fire on worshippers in a Quebec City mosque, killing six men and injuring more than a dozen others, have blamed years of bullying and intimidation for their son’s actions, saying he is not a “monster.” After pleading guilty to six counts of first degree murder in March, Alexandre Bissonnette is facing life in prison without the possibility of parole for up to 150 years. As sentencing arguments wrapped up on Thursday, Raymond Bissonnette and Manon Marchand spoke publicly for the first time since the shooting, expressing their sympathy to the victims and lashing out at the crown prosecutor for minimising the relentless bullying Bissonnette suffered in school. “Alexandre is not a monster,” Raymond Bissonnette told reporters as his wife fought back tears beside him. “The crown said that all young people are bullied at some time in their lives and don’t commit serious crimes. I think that this opinion does not do justice to the serious damage and suffering caused by bullying and intimidation.” They had worked for years to address the bullying but failed, leaving Bissonnette battling mental health issues. “Unfortunately, Alexandre’s mental condition caused by the years of intimidation was not identified by us nor by the doctors he consulted,” he said. He noted that the crown did not order a psychiatric examination after Alexandre’s arrest. Instead it sought to “demonise” their son by seeking six back-to-back life sentences, amounting to a 150-year sentence that could rank as the longest in Canadian history. “One hundred years is actually a death sentence in disguise; we all know that,” said Raymond Bissonnette. “I fear that in my son’s case, the crown is seeking a political, not a judicial sentence.” Nearly 50 people were at the mosque in 2017 when the three-minute shooting rampage began. Video of the attack played in court showed Bissonnette pausing numerous times to reload his semi-automatic Glock handgun as worshippers scrambled to protect the handful of children in the mosque at the time. Bissonnette’s parents have attended much of the sentencing hearing, listening quietly as the victims’ families detailed how the killings shattered their lives and left many in the city’s tight-knit Muslim community fearing for their safety. “I would like to express to them, once again, in my name and my family’s name, all our compassion, our sympathy with them in this terrible, terrible, terrible ordeal,” Raymond Bissonnette said.
Earlier this year, prosecutors sought to paint Alexandre as an unrepentant killer who saw violence as a means of avenging the relentless bullying he had suffered in school. The court heard that Bissonnette had trawled the internet, obsessively following the social media feeds of Donald Trump and right-wing commentators in the US and scouring for content to feed his resentment of immigrants, Islam and feminists as well as his fascination with mass shooters. When asked if he had anything to say, a tearful Alexandre said he was ashamed of his actions. “I regret that my life has caused so much suffering and pain for so many people,” he told the judge. In February, Bissonnette’s parents issued a written statement, hinting at their anguish in the wake of the attack. “The immense pain and suffering caused to the innocent victims and their families by this inexcusable act remains for us, to this day, totally inexplicable,” they said. “Alexandre remains our son whom we love and who will always remain a part of our family. Like all parents, we had hoped to see him succeed and be happy in life. In a sense, we, too, have lost a son.” The judge is not expected to hand down a sentence until October.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/quebec-city-mosque-shooter-not-a-monster-say-parents,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/quebec-city-mosque-shooter-not-a-monster-say-parents
2018-06-21T20:55:44Z,world,World news,"Koko, famed gorilla that learned sign language, dies aged 46","Koko, the gorilla that learned sign language and formed several celebrity friendships while in captivity in the US, has died aged 46. The female western lowland gorilla, who gained fame for her mastery of “gorilla sign language”, died peacefully in her sleep at the Gorilla Foundation’s preserve in California, the foundation said.
Originally named Hanabi-ko – Japanese for “fireworks child” – after being born at San Francisco Zoo in 1971, Koko learned a rudimentary sign language through a researcher, Dr Francine Patterson. Koko reportedly understood about 2,000 words of verbal English.
The subject of numerous documentaries, Koko also appeared on the cover of National Geographic, in a picture that the primate took of herself in a mirror. Koko adopted a kitten called All Ball and when the feline was hit and killed by a car in 1984, Patterson was filmed asking Koko what had happened. Koko signed in response: “Cat, cry, have-sorry, Koko-love.” Further anguish was to come for Koko following the death in 2014 of the actor and comedian Robin Williams. Koko and Williams had struck up a firm friendship in 2001, with the two filmed laughing and cuddling together. The Gorilla Foundation said that Patterson told them Koko was “quiet and very thoughtful” when told of Williams’s passing. Koko also met Flea, the bassist in the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and the actor Betty White. The gorilla also surprised scientists in 2012 by demonstrating an ability to play the recorder. A treat for one birthday was a box of kittens to play with. “Her impact has been profound and what she has taught us about the emotional capacity of gorillas and their cognitive abilities will continue to shape the world,” the Gorilla Foundation said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/koko-gorilla-sign-language-dead-aged-46,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/koko-gorilla-sign-language-dead-aged-46
2018-06-21T20:39:03Z,world,World news,Nikki Haley attacks damning UN report on US poverty under Trump,"Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, has launched a scathing attack on the UN monitor on extreme poverty, dismissing his recent report on America that accuses Donald Trump of cruelly forcing millions of citizens into deprivation as “misleading and politically motivated”. Haley, the former Republican governor of South Carolina, said she was “deeply disappointed” that the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, had “categorically misstated the progress the United States has made in addressing poverty … in [his] biased reporting”. She added that in her view that “it is patently ridiculous for the United Nations to examine poverty in America” – which prompted puzzlement as Alston carried out his investigation at the formal invitation of the Trump administration.
Instead, Haley suggested, the UN monitor should have used his voice “to shine a light” on countries where governments were causing pain and suffering on their own people, such as Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. “The special rapporteur wasted the UN’s time and resources, deflecting attention from the world’s worst human rights abusers and focusing instead on the wealthiest and freest country in the world.” Haley’s remarks deepen the dispute between the Trump administration and the UN human rights council in Geneva that has been blazing all week. Alston will be presenting his report on US poverty to the council on Friday, laying out his key findings to its 46 members and to an empty chair where the US has traditionally sat.
On Tuesday, Haley announced that the US was pulling out of membership of the human rights council, describing it as a “cesspool of political bias”. It marked the first time that any state has withdrawn from the council since its inception in 2006. Haley made her counterpunch to the UN monitor – the first substantive comments to emerge from the Trump administration over Alston’s devastating critique of its pro-rich and anti-poor policies – in a response to Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator had led a joint plea on the back of the UN report from 20 prominent members of Congress, including the senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker and Georgia representative John Lewis, calling on Trump to work with them to tackle “massive levels of deprivation and the immense suffering this deprivation causes”. Sanders on Thursday issued a further response to Haley’s attack on the UN rapporteur. The 2016 runner-up for the Democratic presidential nomination agreed with Haley that Burundi and the Democratic Republic Congo faced far worse problems, but pointedly remarked that America’s poverty was taking place “in the richest country in the history of the world and a time when wealth and income inequality is worse than at any time since the 1920s”. Sanders said it was appropriate for the UN to focus on America, given that 40 million people in the US still live in poverty, more than 30 million have no health insurance, and 40% of Americans cannot afford $400 in an emergency. “I hope you will agree that in a nation in which the top three people own more wealth than the bottom half, we can and must do much better than that,” Sanders said. The sharpness of tone in Haley’s criticisms of the UN rapporteur raises questions about whether the timing of the Trump administration’s decision to quit the UN human rights council was motivated in part by irritation over Alston’s decision to put his spotlight on American inequality. Perceived anti-Israel bias within the council, and the ongoing inclusion among its members of states with poor human rights records such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela, were clearly the main driving factors behind the pullout, but it is also clear that Haley was also peeved by the directness of Alston’s conclusions.
The rapporteur carried out a 10-day tour in December of poverty hotspots in the US, from California, though Alabama and West Virginia, to Puerto Rico. He concluded that though levels of hardship had been high for decades within America, Trump was taking it to another level by steering the country towards a “dramatic change of direction” that was rewarding wealthy Americans while stripping vulnerable Americans of welfare protections. In a press conference on Thursday, on the eve of presenting his report on the US to the council, Alston said he had “no idea” whether his investigation had reinforced or influenced the timing of the US government’s withdrawal. But he added that the move was “highly regrettable. I think it’s significant that of the 47 members of the council, only one has chosen to leave.” He added: “There is a fear that this is part of a broader attack on human rights and multilateralism.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/nikki-haley-un-poverty-report-misleading-politically-motivated,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/nikki-haley-un-poverty-report-misleading-politically-motivated
2018-06-21T20:11:41Z,world,World news,Leader of Romania's ruling party sentenced for corruption,"The powerful leader of Romania’s ruling party has been sentenced to prison in a blow to a government that has showered praise on Donald Trump’s “drain the swamp” rhetoric, and threatened to create the EU’s latest populist headache. Liviu Dragnea, head of the Social Democratic party (PSD) and regarded as the most powerful man in the country, was convicted of abuse of power and handed a three-and-a-half-year sentence in an initial verdict after a corruption trial. Dragnea is expected to appeal. Prosecutors had said that Dragnea, at the time a government official, intervened from 2008 to 2010 to keep two women on the payroll of a family welfare agency, even though they were employed by his party. The women have admitted working for the party although they received their salaries from the welfare agency. The news was greeted with delight by flag-waving crowds in Bucharest, where pro- and anti-government demonstrations have brought tens of thousands of protestors to the streets in recent weeks.
But the conviction may lead to further political tensions in Romania, where the PSD has prepared moves to impeach opposition-backed President Klaus Iohannis and sack the head of the National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA), an official body that has convicted hundreds of politicians and officials in recent years. Iohannis has backed the DNA, and stalled on a recent constitutional court ruling that he could not overrule the government’s decision to sack its chief prosecutor. The court has also issued a ruling that would effectively increase the PSD government’s control over the judiciary. Dragnea’s conviction adds further to a complex political crisis. “I expect harsh words from both the PSD and the president following the Dragnea decision,” said Radu Delicote, a consultant at Bucharest-based communications agency Smartlink. “It’s hot out there. There’s an institutional conflict, and it’s possible that the president will be suspended.” The PSD and its allies won a landslide election victory in December 2016, and though Dragnea was barred from becoming prime minister by a previous conviction for vote-rigging, he is seen as effectively leading the government. The new administration soon launched emergency legislation designed to limit anti-corruption prosecutions, leading to Romania’s biggest street protests since the fall of communism in 1989. It also moved judicial reforms that critics say are targeted at lifting the ban on Dragnea becoming premier, and easing penalties on corruption. “The legal process shows that Romania is still a believer in European values, and that institutions around the judiciary are strong, despite the ambitions of a clique with self-interest at heart,” said Manuel Costescu, a former minister and until recently an opposition MP. “They were trying to decriminalise criminality.” The PSD argues that it is working to tackle a sinister “deep state” network of security agents, judges, and prosecutors that are undermining the work of an elected government that is still riding high in the polls. Dragnea has accused the EU and Nato of backing “this odious system”, and PSD figures have praised Trump’s efforts to “drain the swamp”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/leader-of-romanias-ruling-party-sentenced-for-corruption,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/leader-of-romanias-ruling-party-sentenced-for-corruption
2018-06-21T18:01:32Z,world,World news,Questions hang over Nato stability as summit draws closer,"Sceptism greeted the Nato secretary-general when he claimed the transatlantic bond that glues Nato together is not weakening but actually strengthening. The sentiment was expressed at Lancaster House in London where Jens Stoltenberg made the remark to an audience of mainly defence and foreign policy specialists. And the scepticism would almost certainly be shared in capitals across Europe. Doubts have been fuelled by growing nervousness about Donald Trump’s visit to the Nato summit in Brussels on 11 and 12 July.
The fear is the US president might react in a the same way he did after the G7 summit in Canada. There were his testy exchanges with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, the rows with Europe over trade and Iranian nuclear policy, and his repeated assertion that the US is fed up of bailing Europe out and it is time Europeans started paying a bigger share of their own defence. Inconceivable as it still seems to military chiefs in Europe and the US who have worked together for decades, the break-up of Nato hangs in the air: that Trump might just walk away and take the US with him. What would happen if the US was to leave Nato?
The US forms the core of Nato. With the biggest defence budget in the world, The US contributes senior officers, troops, money and equipment to Nato. The biggest Nato military engagement has been in Afghanistan and that is an indication of the disproportionate role of the US. Of the 130,000 Nato forces in Afghanistan at the height of the conflict, 100,000 were American. Even at present, US forces are having to fill gaps left by European nations, including the UK with its spending constraints. With concern, for example, about increased Russian activity in Norway, the US is sending in its marines, filling a gap left by Britain’s Royal Marines who had regularly held exercises in there. Without the US, European forces confronting Russia would look thin. If Russia was to send a large proportion of its more than 20,000 tanks across its borders into eastern Europe, a combined force made of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the other Nato remnants might struggle to stop them with conventional forces. Nato forces deployed in the Baltic states and elsewhere in Eastern Europe at present know that if they are overrun, they can confidently expect the US to come to their rescue. So a Nato without the US would leave Europe vulnerable to a Russian attack? A Russian invasion is highly unlikely because, in spite of a recent splurge on defence spending, the 2014 annexation of Crimea and various provocations such as cyber attacks, it is a declining power, in contrast with China. The crux is, even if Russia’s conventional forces were to overcome the massed ranks of European tanks, armoured vehicles, planes and missiles, it would be left confronting two nuclear powers, the UK and France. And that is deterrent enough. Is it likely that Trump will pull out?
Trump has been working his way through the various pledges he made on the White House campaign trail. A repeated mantra was criticism of Nato, describing it as obsolete and, with the US no longer as rich as it once was, no longer value for money. He pointed out the US spends 3.5% of GDP on defence while only three other countries out of the 29 that make up Nato did the same: the UK, Estonia and Greece. Trump’s rhetoric – combined with the increased activity of Russia – seems to have worked and Stoltenberg says eight countries are now expected to reach the 2% target. The Nato chief hopes this statistic plus other concrete proposals for increased military capabilities will help deflect Trump at the summit. Could the European Union have its own defence force? European countries at various points have proposed an EU defence force, arguing that a European foreign and military policy independent of the US might prove a good thing. But this has met with little enthusiasm so far. The UK has been the main opponent within the EU of such a force, saying Nato already filled that role. But, with the UK about to leave the EU, its objections will no longer matter. Turkey, a Nato member but not of the EU, would also be excluded. Could the US leaving Nato have a beneficial effect? A European force independent of the US has a lot to commend it. Nato blundered after the cold war in failing to embrace Russia and antagonised it by expanding into the former Soviet bloc countries. That is irreversible but it might make it more unlikely that remaining countries, Georgia, which Nato is to give an initial nod to at the summit, would find it harder to be embraced by a EU force. An EU force might be less likely too to engage in military operations outside of Europe.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/defence-and-security-blog/2018/jun/21/jens-stoltenberg-nato-speech-lancaster-house-donald-trump,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/defence-and-security-blog/2018/jun/21/jens-stoltenberg-nato-speech-lancaster-house-donald-trump
2018-06-21T17:58:29Z,world,World news,Brazilian teenager dies after police helicopter strafes favela,"Brazilians have reacted with outrage and revulsion after the death of a 14-year-old schoolboy, who was shot during a security operation during which a police helicopter strafed a densely-populated Rio de Janeiro favela. After Marcos Vinicius da Silva died in a hospital on Wednesday night, residents of the Maré favela blocked the highway that leads to Rio’s international airport and a bus was set on fire. Police said that six gang members were killed in the operation. The deadly security operation came a day after intense gun battles rattled other favelas near the centre of Rio and two weeks after the cable car to the city’s landmark Sugar Loaf mountain was closed during a battle between police and gang members vying for control of two favelas near Copacabana Beach.Witnesses said that the police helicopter had fired indiscriminately into a densely populated area near a school – an accusation supported by cellphone footage. Teams from the Redes da Maré non-profit group counted over 100 bullet holes in the ground. In an emotional video published on the O Globo website, the boy’s mother, Bruna da Silva, displayed his bloodstained school uniform T-shirt and rucksack. His father, José da Silva, 37, told the newspaper his son had been late for school but decided to go home when he first heard gunfire. He was almost home when he was shot in the stomach. “Why do they see a school uniform and fire? Because they are not police. They are murderers,” he said.
“I saw from the window of my house,” said Irone Santiago, 53, who works at the NGO. “They were firing and they were flying very low.” Santiago said that she knew Marcos Vinicius da Silva and his family. “Like any 14-year-boy he had a life in front of him,” she said. “What is our guilt? Because we are black, poor and live in favelas we have to die?” Santiago’s son Vitor, 32, lost the use of his legs after a friend’s car he was in was machine-gunned during a military occupation of Maré in 2015. Luke Dowdney, the British founder and director of Fight for Peace, another Maré non-profit group, also saw the helicopter from around 500 metres away. “It was coming in low and as it came in it was shooting into the favela,” he said. Students at a nearby school reacted in panic, he said: “We could hear the screaming of the kids and desperate parents running.”
El País reported that the operation’s main objective was to find suspects believed to have killed a Civil Police inspector in another favela, Acari, earlier this month. The Acari favela is controlled by the Third Pure Command drug gang, one of two that operate in Maré. Two days after inspector Ellery de Lemos was killed, prominent civil police detective Marcus Amim threatened revenge on the alleged murderers, who he named during a television interview. “You will pay for this,” Amim said. “We will hunt you wherever you are.” In a WhatsApp conversation with the Guardian, Amim said he had taken part in Wednesday’s operation but denied it had any connection with his friend’s death. He said its aim had been to carry out arrest warrants and searches related to the drug trade and cargo theft. “Many shots were fired in the direction of the helicopter, which happens frequently,” Amim said. Six drug gang members had been “neutralised”, he added. Rio’s Intervention Observatory – an independent monitoring initiative – has calculated from official data that 444 people were killed by police from February to May, a 34% increase on the previous year. Rio’s latest spate of violence has raised more doubts about the effectiveness of the “Federal Intervention” ordered in February, during which the military took over Rio state security and thousands of soldiers returned to city streets. Thousands of soldiers took part in another operation in favelas between Copacabana and the Sugar Loaf on Thursday.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/brazil-latest-death-teenager-favela-raid-police-marcus-da-silva,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/brazil-latest-death-teenager-favela-raid-police-marcus-da-silva
2018-06-21T17:22:21Z,world,World news,Pamplona court to release sexual abuse gang on bail,"The five men jailed for sexually abusing an 18-year-old woman at the running of the bulls festival in Pamplona two years ago are to be released on bail of €6,000, according to reports. The case, known as the “wolf pack” trial because of the name the men used in their WhatsApp group, caused a national outcry after the defendants were sentenced to nine years in prison for sexual abuse, but acquitted of rape. The verdict, delivered at the end of April, led to protests across Spain and prompted the then government to announce a review of sexual offences legislation to establish whether such crimes were adequately defined and categorised.
José Ángel Prenda, Alfonso Cabezuelo, Antonio Manuel Guerrero, Jesús Escudero and Ángel Boza were sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment, five years’ probation and ordered to pay €10,000 each to the woman. Guerrero, a Guardia Civil police officer, was fined €900 for stealing her phone after the attack. On Thursday the Spanish news agency Europa Press reported that the provincial court in Pamplona had ruled that the men, who have been in custody since July 2016, could be released on bail while a higher court studied the original sentence. It apparently ordered them to surrender their passports and report to court three times a week, and banned them from entering the Madrid region, where the victim lives, and from attempting to contact her. Both prosecutors and defence lawyers are protesting against the nine-year sentences. Under Spanish law, those convicted of a crime cannot usually be held for more than two years if a final sentence has not been handed down. The men were found guilty of the “continuous sexual abuse” of the woman in the lobby of a building in the early hours of 7 July 2016. Under Spanish law, sexual abuse differs from rape in that it does not involve violence or intimidation. One of the judges argued that the men should have been cleared of all charges except the phone theft. The case was widely seen as a cross-examination of the 18-year-old woman rather than the men who attacked her. The proceedings were criticised after the judges accepted into evidence a report compiled by a private detective hired by some of the defendants. The detective had followed the woman over several days and produced photographs of her smiling with friends. This was used to suggest she had not suffered any lasting trauma, prompting hundreds of women to demonstrate outside court holding signs reading: “We believe you, sister.” Defence lawyers claimed the woman had consented and had let one of the men kiss her. They also said that 96 seconds of video footage from the men’s phones – showing the woman immobile and with her eyes shut during the attack – constituted proof of consent. The prosecution said the victim had been too terrified to move. “The defendants want us to believe that on that night they met an 18-year-old girl, living a normal life, who, after 20 minutes of conversation with people she didn’t know, agreed to group sex involving every type of penetration, sometimes simultaneously, without using a condom,” the prosecutor Elena Sarasate said. The verdict was criticised by many senior politicians, including Pedro Sánchez, the leader of Spain’s socialist party who recently became the prime minister. “She said NO,” he wrote on Twitter at the time. “We believe you and we’ll keep believing you. If what the ‘wolfpack’ did wasn’t group violence against a defenceless woman, then what do we understand by rape?” News of the men’s release prompted women’s groups to call protests in cities including Pamplona, Madrid, Zaragoza, San Sebastián and Barcelona on Thursday and Friday.

Jason Kessler, who was behind the “Unite the Right” rally in August 2017 where white nationalists held a torchlight rally, clashed with protesters and caused a political furore when Donald Trump blamed “both sides” for the violence, filed an application with the National Park Service (NPS) to hold a “white civil rights rally” outside the White House.
Kessler had received initial approval from the NPS to hold the rally on Saturday 11 August and Sunday 12 August, the Washington Post reported. The weekend marks the anniversary of the Unite the the Right rally in Charlottesville, where Heather Heyer was killed when James Alex Fields Jr, a self-described Nazi, drove his car into a crowd of protesters. In Kessler’s application for a 2018 rally permit he said the purpose of the event was: “Protesting civil rights abuse in Charlottesville, VA/white civil rights rally.” He asked for permission to hold a rally at Lafayette Park, located in front of the White House, for 400 people. In a section of the form asking if the applicant believed anyone might “seek to disrupt the activity”, Kessler wrote: “Members of antifa affiliated groups will try to disrupt.” The NPS told the WUSA-9 news channel it had approved Kessler’s application, but was yet to issue a formal permit. Last year’s Unite the Right was nominally intended to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee from Charlottesville’s Emancipation Park. The event saw neo-Nazis and white supremacists march through the city holding torches and chanting “Jews will not replace us”, and the next day waving Confederate and Nazi flags and wearing far-right regalia at a demonstration in Emancipation Park.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/charlottesville-anniversary-event-unite-right-event-jason-kessler,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/charlottesville-anniversary-event-unite-right-event-jason-kessler
2018-06-21T14:49:31Z,world,World news,Mini-summit on migration unlikely to heal European rifts,"It will take more than a mini-summit to bridge the profound differences that exist both between and within EU capitals over how to handle asylum and irregular migration.
Indeed, no sooner had the European commission announced the informal meeting, to be attended by Germany, France, Italy, Greece, Spain, Malta, Bulgaria, Belgium and the Netherlands, than the recriminations began. Aimed at throwing a political lifeline to Angela Merkel in a fraught standoff between the German chancellor and her hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, that threatens the stability of her coalition, the measures the summit will discuss have infuriated Italy. And while Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will not be present in Brussels on Sunday, their refusal to accept any obligatory quota or redistribution arrangements will necessarily weigh on whatever conclusions it is able to reach. The fault lines in Europe’s latest political crisis are not just national, but ideological. The commission, Merkel, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the new Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, continue to seek EU-wide agreement and coordinated action. Rightwingers, including Seehofer, who is demanding the right to turn back refugees and migrants arriving from other EU countries, and the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, who has called for an “axis of the willing” to tackle illegal migration, want a radical bi- or trilateral approach. Far-right nationalists, such as Austria’s vice-chancellor, Heinz-Christian Strache, Italy’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who will allow no NGO-run migrant rescue ships to land, and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, who this week pushed through laws making it a criminal offence to help asylum seekers, are prepared to go their own way. With differences so deep and the immediate practical concerns of arrival and destination states so diverse, it is hard to see significant progress being made at Sunday’s meeting, which is intended to prepare the ground for a broader debate on migration between all EU leaders at their summer summit on 28 and 29 June. Unable for the past three years to reform its Dublin regulation, which requires refugees to claim asylum in the first EU country they enter, the EU is focusing on areas where a minimum of common ground could exist, such as beefing up its external borders and cooperating more closely with countries from Turkey to Niger to stop people leaving. According to a draft joint declaration, the mini-summit will agree to spend more on building the bloc’s border and coastguard into a “genuine border police force” of 10,000 officers by 2020, and setting up controversial “protection and reception capacity” outside the EU to separate refugees seeking asylum from migrants seeking work.
Participants also aim to strengthen internal controls to combat “secondary movement” of asylum seekers to other EU states, and to agree on “new joint readmission procedures” that would make it easier to send asylum seekers who cross borders back to the states where they applied. Such measures may placate the likes of Seehofer. But the German interior minister will be less enamoured of a warning that “unilateral, uncoordinated measures” – of the kind he is proposing, and Salvini has already taken – risk “severely damaging the process of European integration”. And Salvini – in principle, Seehofer’s ideological ally – has protested furiously at the very proposals most likely to find favour with the German interior minister, such as fast-track migrant returns, which he fears could turn Italy into Europe’s holding camp for irregular migrants. “If they’re thinking of sending us more migrants instead of helping us, then we shouldn’t go [to Brussels] at all,” the leader of the far-right League party said on Wednesday. Salvini continued: Macron and Sánchez “speak of goodness and generosity ... They should prove it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/mini-summit-on-migration-unlikely-to-heal-european-rifts,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/mini-summit-on-migration-unlikely-to-heal-european-rifts
2018-06-21T14:30:43Z,world,World news,From plates to piscine: now Macrons want a presidential pool,"Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, want to build a private swimming pool at the presidential summer retreat on the French Riviera. The president, whose tough economic measures and public spending cuts have led to strikes and street protests, and his wife have reportedly commissioned a study looking into the possibility of installing an above-ground pool at the Fort de Brégançon, which lies on a rocky island off the south of France. The study will examine building regulations at the site, which is classified as a historical monument, as well as technical questions. The site, yards from a private beach, is easily accessible to paparazzi long lenses and the prying eyes of holidaymakers. Previous presidents have been captured in their bathing costumes and it is alleged Jacques Chirac was snapped standing naked in front of a bedroom window at the fort. The exact cost of installing a pool has not been determined, but the Élysée has reported that the initial quotes were up to €150,000. The cost is expected to be met from public funds. The Macrons are said to be keen to have the pool ready for this summer. Fort de Brégançon has been the presidential holiday retreat since Charles de Gaulle first stayed there in the 1960s. It is known to require some updating in terms of decoration. Macron has already asked for some refurbishments and maintenance work to be carried out. The president was criticised this month for reportedly ordering 1,200 new porcelain plates for state dinners after existing tableware was said to be showing “signs of wear”. Days earlier he was filmed railing about the “crazy amount of dough” France spends on social benefits, prompting critics to nickname him the “president of the rich”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/from-plates-to-piscine-now-macrons-want-a-presidential-pool,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/from-plates-to-piscine-now-macrons-want-a-presidential-pool
2018-06-21T13:52:26Z,world,World news,Sara Netanyahu charged with fraud over catering allegations,"Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Israel’s prime minister, has been charged with fraud and breach of trust for allegedly using public funds to pay for restaurant meals to be delivered to the couple’s official residence. The long-anticipated charges were announced by Israel’s justice ministry on Thursday. Benjamin Netanyahu is also under investigation.
According to the indictment, Sara Netanyahu spent tens of thousands of dollars on meals from expensive restaurants between 2010 and 2013 in alleged violation of rules barring the residence from ordering in meals during periods when there was a cook on its staff. Prosecutors claim that Sara Netanyahu conspired with a senior official at the residence to hide the fact that the meals were not eligible for reimbursement. The indictment said she acted to “fraudulently obtain state funding for various expenses for the accused and her family that were not supposed to be financed in this manner”.She is accused of directing staff at the residence, including a former housekeeper, Meni Naftali – who later sued the Netanyahu family and the Israeli state for damages over his treatment by Sara Netanyahu – and another employee, to hide the fact that cooks were employed in the residence “so that this won’t be found out by the treasury and the office manager”.If convicted, she could face a maximum sentence of five years behind bars, though this is unlikely.
Lawyers for Sara Netanyahu’s hit back, however, denouncing the charges as “false and delusional.” “Not only is the indictment based on false claims and distorted and mistaken data, it is based entirely on an illegitimate and illegal regulation imposed specifically for Prime Minister Netanyahu,” the lawyers claimed. The charges are the culmination of years of investigation into Sara Netanyahu’s official expenses. In September 2017, Israel’s attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, announced he was minded to file an indictment subject to a pre-indictment hearing, which took place in January. According to reports in the Israeli media, the charges come after the failure of a plea bargain that could have seen Sara Netanyahu return some of the money and acknowledge responsibility in exchange for no criminal conviction. The case against Sara Netanyahu, a child psychologist, has long been used by critics of the Netanyahu family as evidence of their taste for freeloading. Benjamin Netanyahu has called the allegations against his wife absurd and unfounded. The Israeli prime minister is himself embroiled in a series of corruption investigations but has protested his innocence and vowed to remain in power, saying he is the victim of a witch-hunt. In one case, he and family members are suspected of receiving 1m shekels (£210,000) worth of luxury cigars, champagne and jewellery from wealthy people in exchange for financial or personal favours. In another, investigators suspect the premier of trying to reach an agreement with the owner of Yedioth Ahronoth, a top Israeli newspaper, for more favourable coverage. Despite his troubles, opinion polls suggest Netanyahu’s rightwing Likud party would remain the largest in parliament if elections scheduled for November 2019 were held now. Sara Netanyahu, 59, has inspired a series of negative headlines over what her family says is an undeserved reputation for imperiousness.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/sara-netanyahu-charged-misuse-public-funds-israel,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/sara-netanyahu-charged-misuse-public-funds-israel
2018-06-21T13:36:11Z,world,World news,Belgian city to turn abandoned hangar into a 'mega-brothel',"An abandoned hangar with protected architectural status is to be converted by the municipality of Ostend into a brothel to accommodate sex workers being moved out of the Belgian seaside town’s red-light district. The so-called “mega brothel” – to be known as the Hangar d’amour – will be run by a company that already manages a 51-bedroom brothel in Antwerp, known as Villa Tinto. Ostend’s red-light district, Hazegras, will be cleared under the plan. The hanger will also accommodate a bar, brewery and plaza once the conversion is complete. The plans have been described as “madness” by the non-profit group, Oostendse Oosteroever, which had been campaigning for the hangar to be turned into a museum to celebrate the town’s maritime past. Prostitution is legal in Belgium and since 1995 the renting of premises for such purposes has been permitted.
Around 26,000 women are believed to work in the sex industry in the country. The authorities estimate that 80% of them are victims of people trafficking or exploitation by organised crime gangs. Ostend’s mayor, Johan Vande Lanotte, claimed the new arrangement would offer more security. He said: “The ladies will enter into a rental contract directly with the owner, as a result of which intermediaries will be excluded. “The conditions will be better, and the sector will be purified. Abuses will be excluded or certainly limited. There will also be a health centre, an information desk and a room for the police.” The hangar’s exterior cannot be changed under Belgian law but the developers with whom the municipality is working will have the freedom to renovate the interior.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/belgian-city-to-turn-abandoned-hangar-into-a-mega-brothel,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/belgian-city-to-turn-abandoned-hangar-into-a-mega-brothel
2018-06-21T13:12:16Z,world,World news,EU admits no African country has agreed to host migration centre,"The European Union’s most senior migration official has admitted that no north African country has yet agreed to host migrant screening centres to process refugee claims. Details of an EU plan to prevent migrants drowning at sea emerged on Thursday after Italy criticised the agenda of an emergency summit for not offering enough to help it cope with arrivals. Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner for migration, said the EU wanted to “intensify cooperation” with Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Niger and Morocco, as he announced the intention to create a “regional disembarkation scheme”.
So far no African country had agreed to host screening centres, he confirmed. “It has to be discussed with these countries, he said. “An official proposal has not been put on the table.” The idea for offshore migrant processing centres remains sketchy, with numerous political, practical and legal questions unanswered. It remains unclear, for example, whether migrants on a rescue ship in European waters could be returned to a north African country. Tahar Cherif, the Tunisian ambassador to the EU said: “The proposal was put to the head of our government a few months ago during a visit to Germany, it was also asked by Italy, and the answer is clear: no! “We have neither the capacity nor the means to organise these detention centres. We are already suffering a lot from what is happening in Libya, which has been the effect of European action.” He said his country was facing enough problems with unemployment, without wishing to add to them while Niger said its existing centres taking migrants out of detention camps in Libya are already full. The idea for the centres was thrown into the mix of EU migration policy before a series of crucial summits on migration in the next week. About 10 EU leaders will meet in Brussels on Sunday in a hastily convened emergency meeting aimed at preventing the collapse of the German coalition government. But the Italian government has been angered by draft conclusions for the summit, which stress the need to counter “secondary movements” – an issue that affects Germany. Under EU rules, a member state usually has responsibility for asylum seekers who have arrived in its territory, a regulation that has put frontline states Italy and Greece under huge pressure. But claimants often move to a second EU state, seeking a faster decision or to unite with family members. So-called “secondary movements” is the issue driving a wedge between Germany’s ruling coalition. The Bavarian CSU party has set the chancellor, Angela Merkel, a deadline of two weeks to find a solution. The interior minister, Horst Seehofer, has threatened to send away migrants at the border – a breach of EU rules that threatens to unravel the common asylum system. Tensions are running high after Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said he was not ready to discuss secondary movements “without having first tackled the emergency of ‘primary movements’ that Italy has ended up dealing with alone”. Italy’s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, said: “If anyone in the EU thinks Italy should keep being a landing point and refugee camp, they have misunderstood.” The election of a populist government in Italy, combined with tensions in Germany’s ruling coalition, has created a political storm over migration despite the sharp fall in arrivals. In the first six months of this year 15,570 people crossed into Italy, a 77% drop on last year. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, reluctantly agreed to host the weekend summit to help Merkel, after her governing coalition came close to breaking point. Avramopoulos stressed that the summit would be about “consultations” to prepare the ground for decisions to be taken by all 28 EU leaders at a European council meeting next Thursday. Warning that the future of the EU’s border-free travel area was at stake, Avramopoulos said: “The European leadership of today will be held accountable in the eyes of future generations if we allow all these forces of populism to blow up what has been achieved”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/eu-admits-no-african-country-has-agreed-to-host-migration-centre,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/eu-admits-no-african-country-has-agreed-to-host-migration-centre
2018-06-21T12:38:11Z,world,World news,New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern welcomes baby girl 'to our village',"“Welcome to our village, wee one,” is how Jacinda Ardern announced the birth of her daughter to New Zealand, and the world. The prime minister posted a photograph of her and partner Clarke Gayford cuddling their first child on her Facebook page late on Thursday afternoon (NZ time). “Feeling very lucky to have a healthy baby girl that arrived at 4.45pm weighing 3.31kg (7.3lb). Thank you so much for your best wishes and your kindness. We’re all doing really well thanks to the wonderful team at Auckland City hospital.” Ardern, 37, becomes only the second world leader to give birth while in office, the first being Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto in 1990 – with whom, coincidentally, Ardern’s daughter shares a birthday. News of the birth was met with a flurry of excitement in New Zealand, the culmination of a nationwide “#babywatch” that began with the announcement of Ardern’s pregnancy in January and reached its peak on Sunday, which had been her due date.
Morgan Godfrey, a political commentator and writer, remarked on Ardern’s typically down-to-earth approach despite being under the global spotlight during the pregnancy. “Jacinda Ardern arrived at hospital in her own car, with Clarke driving. No crown limo or special ambulance. Her baby was delivered in a public hospital alongside everyone else’s. No private hospital. No extra special attention. New Zealand, remain your understated self.” He added: “Three cheers for the public health system, too.” Guy Williams, a television personality and comedian, spoke for many New Zealanders when he tweeted that it was a “proud day to be a Kiwi”. He added: “Anyone who claims this isn’t a historic moment for our country is dismissing the ingrained prejudice we all still have towards women in the workplace.”
Winston Peters, the leader of the populist New Zealand First party and deputy prime minister, is now acting prime minister. He said after Ardern was admitted to hospital: “It’s a happy day and on behalf of the coalition government we wish her and Clarke all the very best.”
A host of Ardern’s Labour party colleagues shared their congratulations, as did the leader of the opposition National party, Simon Bridges, who wished the new parents “every happiness” on Twitter. Ardern intends to take six weeks’ maternity leave before returning to work, with Gayford, a television presenter and “first bloke”, remaining at home. Gayford had himself announced that “our little girl has finally arrived” on Twitter, adding that both mother and baby were “healthy and happy”. Helen Clark, the former Labour prime minister and former head of the UN Development Programme, wrote in a Guardian article that “the new arrival in our country’s first family” was significant, not only because Ardern was prime minister, but because she was not married, and Gayford would be the stay-at-home parent. “For young women, the example Ardern is setting is an affirmation that they too can expect to have that choice. For young men, Gayford being the full-time carer of a baby sends a powerful message that they too can exercise that choice,” Clark wrote. Ardern has said there will be little disruption during her time off; she will be in regular contact with Peters and involved in major decisions. She had previously said she planned to have labour induced if her pregnancy ran far beyond the due date. Peters had already taken over some of her duties, including running cabinet meetings, before her last day in parliament earlier this week. But his refusal to repeal a controversial “three strikes” policy, and decision to sue heads of department of his own government, has sparked tension within the coalition. Bridges said on Radio New Zealand earlier this month that the issue had “underlined cracks” in the coalition. “We’ll see the power dynamics of that and who’s really in charge,” he said.
Reporters had been on high alert since Sunday, with many camped outside the hospital. The news website Stuff compiled the “perfect playlist” to welcome the infant. Titled “Waiting for Womb Fruit”, the playlist hedged its bets with the opener: Hey Boy Hey Girl by the Chemical Brothers.
The news and pop culture website the Spinoff began its own live blog – only in part a meta-commentary on the fervour – on Sunday afternoon with “There is no baby”, promising “further updates as they come to hand”. After four days of minutiae, taking in the quality of hospital canteen scones and an extended reflection on whether babies were born with political bias (concluding that they are in fact “agents of chaos”), it culminated on Thursday with: “6:15pm: A baby!” Hayden Donnell, a co-author of the blog, described it as “groundbreaking” and himself as “very tired”. He said most New Zealanders were supportive of the baby, singling out for exception one media personality who had vocally dismissed the prime minister’s pregnancy as “not a story”. “Obviously I disagree with that because I have been covering the story for four days. It’s a joyous moment for New Zealand, is the main point I want to make.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-prime-minister-birth-baby-girl,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-prime-minister-birth-baby-girl
2018-06-21T12:11:30Z,world,World news,Iran's female football supporters make history at World Cup stadium screening,"Iran’s female football supporters have made history in Tehran – for the first time in 37 years they were able to attend a sporting event in the city’s Azadi stadium. The usually strict ban on women attending sports stadiums was relaxed for a screening of Iran’s World Cup match against Spain, which was taking place in Kazan in Russia.
It had been hoped the ban would be lifted for Iran’s opening match of the tournament, but it was only for the team’s second game, which they lost 1-0, that women were able to access the ground. OpenStadiums, a group campaigning for more access to sporting events for women in Iran, reported on the day of the match: “Last night after some confirmations, fans could buy tickets to watch on the screen in the Azadi stadium. Female fans are pretty excited to pass the Azadi’s gates for first time – but some are saying we can’t believe it until we enter in stadium.” The event did not run completely smoothly – initially police were reluctant to let it go ahead and people were turned away, but the BBC Persian reporter Hadi Nili said an intervention by the interior minister, Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, confirmed it could go ahead, leading to joyous scenes of celebration within the ground.
After the match the Spanish captain, Real Madrid’s Sergio Ramos, tweeted a link to a report about the women watching the match, commenting: “They are the ones who won tonight. Hopefully the first of many.” He was less charitable about the Iranian team themselves, describing the way they played as “not football”. Ramos, a Unicef ambassador, also dedicated Spain’s victory to World Refugee Day on social media.
Perhaps wary of officialdom at home, the Iranian team were more circumspect. Following their qualification for Russia, their team captain, Masoud Shojaei, said he backed a change, saying: “They should set a course that women are also allowed to come to stadiums in the future.” But at an appearance at a World Cup press briefing in Russia on Tuesday he said: “To talk about this issue now would be disrespectful to the tournament. I prefer to solve our problems within our family and if we have the opportunity to talk about this later, we will.” The involvement of female football supporters at this World Cup had already caused considerable controversy in Iran before the tournament kicked off. A large billboard in Tehran celebrating the team’s participation with the slogan “Together we are champions; one nation, one heartbeat” was criticised for only featuring men. It was subsequently changed to one that instead featured a scene of Iran’s players alongside male and female supporters. Fans at Iran’s opening World Cup match in St Petersburg against Morocco last week also unfurled a banner that read “Let Iranian women enter their stadiums”. Regulations forbid political displays within stadiums during the World Cup, but a spokesperson for the organisers said: “The banners are considered by Fifa to express a social appeal, as opposed to a political slogan, and were therefore not prohibited.”
However, that appeared to hold true only for Iran’s first match. An Iranian women’s activist, Maryam Qashqaei Shojaei, said she was held for two hours by security officials at the Kazan stadium before Iran’s match with Spain, having planned to display the banner again. “When I was trying to get in with my banner security told me I can’t take it in,” she told a Thomson Reuters Foundation reporter by phone from Kazan. “I showed them my approval. They searched me and held me two hours, and took the banner.” A spokesman for Russia’s World Cup local organising committee said it was aware of an incident involving Shojaei, but had no further details.
Despite Wednesday’s defeat to Spain, Iran still retain a chance of progressing to the second round of the World Cup for the first time in their history. It will not be an easy task though – they face Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal in their final game on 25 June in Saransk, with only a win guaranteeing their progress. Iran’s coach, Carlos Queiroz, who is Portuguese, said: “We are not shy, we go for it, we are really determined. We know it will be tough but we don’t come here expecting easy things.” Some progress for female supporters off-the-field, however, seems a little more assured.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/21/irans-female-football-supporters-make-history-at-world-cup-stadium-screening,https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/21/irans-female-football-supporters-make-history-at-world-cup-stadium-screening
2018-06-21T12:06:07Z,world,World news,Nato chief says Trump-Putin meeting would not contradict policy,"The Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, has brushed aside fears a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin would undermine the organisation.
Speaking in London, he said such a meeting would not be contradictory to Nato policy. Nato, he said, was in favour of dialogue with Russia, and the leaders of other Nato countries had met Putin. The Nato chief’s response came after days of speculation that Trump would see Putin during his visit to Europe next month to attend a Nato summit and visit the UK. Neither the White House nor the Kremlin has confirmed such a meeting. The White House has said it is exploring whether one can be arranged.
The UK government is concerned such a meeting will send the wrong signal to Russia after the Salisbury nerve agent attack. Questioned about Trump meeting Putin, Stoltenberg said: “To meet President Putin is not in any way contradictory to Nato policies … Several Nato leaders have met Putin.” Stoltenberg said he had met the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. A Nato-Russia body suspended after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 is meeting again to try to avoid any mishaps escalating into war. “We do not want a new cold war. We do not want a new arms race. We want to talk to Russia,” Stoltenberg said. The Nato summit is a source of anxiety for European members worried Trump could create disarray as he did at the end of the G7 summit in Canada. The big concern is Trump could pull out in a fit of temper over the failure of Europeans to increase defence spending, though his generals, who value Nato, would be opposed. Stoltenberg said he could not promise there would not be rhetoric at the summit and that Trump would be direct. But he had met him at the White House and believed he remained committed to Nato. The Nato chief said Trump’s threats had crystalised the spending debate, with more European countries expected to raise spending to 2% of GDP.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/nato-trump-putin-meeting-jens-stoltenberg,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/nato-trump-putin-meeting-jens-stoltenberg
2018-06-21T11:44:01Z,world,World news,'This is how Russia could look':  World Cup fans surprised by relaxed policing,"One of the defining images of the World Cup has been delirious scenes of South American fans marching, chanting and drinking into the early hours on Russian streets. For many visitors expecting a police state, the laxity of the police and authorities in the last week has been a revelation. One video of Russian policemen fretting over a pair of passed-out Swedes has gone viral. Small regional cities such as Saransk have been flooded by armies of Colombians and Peruvians, marching unimpeded down main avenues with banners and flags. But for those with experience in protest and political opposition here, there is a kind of dark humour in the spectacle: foreigners can spontaneously gather on city streets, while Russians themselves cannot. “The World Cup is a plus for this country, and many have seen how the country could look: free, open,” said Yevgeny Roizman, a former maverick mayor from the city of Ekaterinburg who was forced out earlier this year. “But when the World Cup ends, the process of cracking down will continue. There are no illusions here.” Thousands of Peruvians have descended on this city of more than 1.3 million in the Urals mountains and are expected to march through the streets this evening before a do-or-die match with France. It is a city where Roizman has become an important figure, first gaining prominence for his anti-heroin City Without Drugs initiative that earned controversy over the severe tactics in its rehabilitation centres. He has carved out a niche as a kind of community organiser, receiving petitioners and running a charity called the Roizman Fund, which supports a local hospice. “They saw I was going to win,” he says, when asked why the city banned direct elections for the mayorship earlier this year. For Ekaterinburg, Roizman says, the World Cup was undoubtedly a positive event. It produced new infrastructure, brought in tourists, and gave the city “a push forward”. But he also believes that “the picture that the outside world is being given in these weeks does not fully represent what is happening in Russia.”. “People don’t have the right to assembly, people don’t have full freedom of speech,” he told the Guardian in an interview at his Nevyansk Icon Museum in downtown Ekaterinburg. Russia has passed tough laws since 2012 that ban unsanctioned demonstrations of more than two people and punish organizers with fines and jail time. Russian protesters have even been arrested when holding blank pieces of paper or “invisible placards” near the Kremlin, gestures meant to mock the political bias behind the enforcement of the law. It has made the scenes of Saudi flags unfurled in front of the Kremlin, Iranian women protesting in the stands at World Cup matches, or thousands of Swedish fans storming through Nizhny Novgorod especially surreal. Roizman compared it to the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students held in the Soviet Union in 1957, which attracted 30,000 students from around the world for games, stadium shows, and bonfires. “It was still the Soviet Union when it was all over,” he said. Ultimately, he says, he is both happy as a patriot that his country is hosting the World Cup and cognizant that the spectacle brings the Kremlin political benefit. “I live here. I understand how the World Cup is going to be used,” he said. That became clear last week when Russia announced it would raise the retirement age on the same day as its opening match against Saudi Arabia. It was an unpopular, and long-expected, austerity measure that used the political cover of the World Cup to push through painful reforms. Men can currently retire at 60 and women at 55. Under the new legislation, men will be eligible for pension only at 65, and women at 63. In the region around Ekaterinburg, Roizman said, 25% of people don’t live to retirement. Under the new law, that number will jump to above 50%. “People feel like they’ve had years added to their term,” said Roizman, using the Russian word for a prison sentence. “People are going to be angry and they will protest.” Russian protest leader Alexey Navalny, who was jailed for the month before the World Cup, has called for a nationwide protest on 1 July against the new law, while the World Cup is ongoing. To hold a protest in Russia, you need to request a permit, and it’s unclear whether Navalny will be given one. Roizman believes that pensioners will only turn out for a sanctioned protest and that the focus on sport would drown everything else out. “Everything you say right now will be lost in the euphoria of the Mundial,” he said. If there’s a protest, what will the police do? “They’re in a tough situation,” he said. “They’re used to reacting to every movement. Take flags away. Make arrests. And suddenly across the country there are people walking around at night, not asking permission. But they also know that the World Cup will end and the foreigners will leave. I’ll just repeat what a lot of people have said: ‘This is what a free country should look like.’”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/this-is-how-russia-could-look-free-open-world-cup-fans-surprised-by-relaxed-policing,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/this-is-how-russia-could-look-free-open-world-cup-fans-surprised-by-relaxed-policing
2018-06-21T10:42:21Z,world,World news,Matteo Salvini threatens to remove Gomorrah author's police protection,"Matteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right interior minister, has threatened to remove the police protection of one of the country’s most famous writers, Roberto Saviano, who has been under threat from organised crime since his breakthrough success about the mafia, Gomorrah, was published in 2006. Saviano is one of Salvini’s toughest critics and is a constant fixture on Italian media. He is one of hundreds of journalists and writers who are under constant guard in Italy, because of current or previous threats to their safety by the mafia. Speaking in an interview on Rai Tre on Thursday morning, Salvini suggested it was time to review spending on Saviano’s police escort as part of an evaluation of how “Italians spend their money”. He pointed to the fact that Saviano spends time abroad, and that the seriousness of the threat against him had to be considered.
“Roberto Saviano is the last of my problems. I’ll send him a kiss if he is watching now. He is a person who provokes so much tenderness and affection, but it is right to evaluate how Italians spend their money,” Salvini said. Earlier this week Saviano wrote a piece for the Guardian in which he said Italy’s war on migrants had made him fear for the future of his country. Saviano’s supporters and some leading politicians immediately criticised Salvini’s comments, saying the statement was an abuse of Salvini’s power as interior minister and threatened the country’s democratic values. Writing for the Guardian, Saviano thanked supporters for showing solidarity, but said the fight was not really about him: he was only being used as an instrument for Salvini to “destroy the rule of law”. “It would be easy for me today to fight fire with fire, but I do not want to do it. Neither do I want to turn the other cheek, I am not Christ, I am not a sacrificial lamb, I am not seeking martyrdom: forget it!,” he wrote. “But I’m not afraid of Salvini either ... he is a buffoon.” But, as with Salvini’s attack on the Roma community this week, when he called for the mass expulsion of all non-Italian Roma, some of the populist government’s supporters are likely to welcome his targeting of Saviano. Salvini’s sardonic remarks – about Saviano provoking feelings of affection – reflected the mixed feelings Italians have about the author, who is also a regular contributor to the Guardian.
Saviano was heaped with praise early in his career as a writer who exposed the inner workings of the Camorra, and the fact that he required police protection – he has described his life under armed guard as “shit” – added to his mystique as a man who was willing to risk his life to fight organised crime. His hit has been followed up by a successful film, television series, and other books taking on corruption and the global drug trade. In Italy, however, his frequent commentary on television and newspaper columns, and his frequent criticism of Italian society and political corruption, has also annoyed some. In taking on Saviano, Salvini seems to be siding with those Italians who think the writer has been too critical. Salvini’s threat to remove Saviano’s protection may be seen as going too far, however. It also reinforces the breadth of Salvini’s power as interior minister. The head of the League party – or the Lega as it is known in Italy – has focused his attention on migration and the Roma community, but he also has control of Italy’s domestic security, as well as insight into police investigations and domestic surveillance. Graziano Delrio, a centre-left politician with the Democratic party (PD), said he would be willing to sacrifice his own police escort, but that Salvini ought to leave Saviano alone, according to La Repubblica. Marco Minniti, the former interior minister, told the Italian newspaper that there were strict and transparent procedures in place dictating police protection and for whom it was offered. Such decisions, the newspaper noted, were not dependent on a politician’s personal views of the subject of protection. Ettore Rosato, another PD lawmaker, said Salvini’s remarks represented an “unacceptable threat” to a man who had shed light on the country’s dangerous criminal networks. “Saviano’s escort is not a gift but the protection that the state must guarantee to those who are threatened for fighting the mafia and the Camorra,” Rosato told La Repubblica. The broadside on Saviano came as another humanitarian crisis was unfolding on the Mediterranean, where a rescue ship operated by a German NGO carrying 250 people who were rescued after a shipwreck is expected to be blocked from landing in Italy. The NGO Mission Lifeline was told to send its ship, which was allegedly operating in Libyan waters under a Dutch flag, to Holland.”Take the long route,” Salvini said. He also alleged, in a line of attack that is increasingly being used against NGOs, that rescuers had ignored Libyan coast guard orders by intervening in the rescue.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/matteo-salvini-threatens-to-remove-gomorrah-roberto-saviano-police-protection,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/matteo-salvini-threatens-to-remove-gomorrah-roberto-saviano-police-protection
2018-06-21T10:08:31Z,world,World news,'Washing is a privilege': life on the frontline of India's water crisis,"Wash your clothes, or flush the toilet? Until last month, Ranjana Sharma had never considered the question. Then she arrived home one night to find her sister filling buckets. The hot season has occasionally caused brief water shortages in Shimla, the former summer capital of the British Raj. But for an unprecedented 15 days in May and June, most taps in the Indian Himalayan town ran completely dry.
Public toilets were padlocked; families used disposable cutlery and threw it away; water trucks rolled in offering to fill tanks – at a steep mark-up; and people queued for hours to receive two buckets from a government supply. Most schools were shut, but not the one where Sharma works as a child psychologist. It stayed open but advised students not to flush the toilets. “I tried to avoid the bathrooms as much as possible,” she says. She chose to keep flushing her own. “I haven’t washed my clothes in weeks.” India is undergoing the worst water crisis in its history, a government thinktank announced last week. About 600 million Indians face “high to extreme water stress” and about 200,000 die each year because they can’t get a clean supply.
And the situation is getting worse. By 2030, water availability will be half what India needs. The thinktank quoted predictions that up to 6% of GDP could be lost to extreme water scarcity. Put another way, millions of Indians could be too thirsty, or sickened by contaminated water, to study, work or live. Signs of crisis are already apparent. While wealthier residents of major cities such as Delhi still drink from reliable supplies cleansed by home filters, in a northern Delhi slum in March, a father and son were killed in a brawl over a water tanker – the first reported deaths in the capital from a water dispute. An estimated 21 major cities could exhaust their groundwater supplies within two years, government advisors believe. Several smaller cities have said they also are teetering on the edge. In the past month, Shimla, in the hills of Himachal Pradesh, has emerged as the frontline of the emergency. Officials in the city have blamed an 82% shortfall in winter rain and snow. “There is climate change all over India and the world,” says Jai Ram Thakur, the Himachal Pradesh chief minister. Others say Shimla is an example of how negligence can create a water crisis, one they warn will be repeated in cities and villages across India. ‘The problem is not a lack of water. It is a lack of vision’ Hours after he was sworn in as the mayor of Shimla in 2012, Sanjay Chauhan asked to visit the Giri river, one of six major sources of the city’s water supply. The Giri was supposed to be supplying the city with 20m litres of water each day. Shimla was receiving just 12m. “It looked like no council officers had visited the place in years,” he says.
Heavy vegetation had formed around the pipes, which were gushing water into the surrounding soil. “In a one kilometre stretch, almost 60% was being leaked out,” says Chauhan, who lost office last year. “Not like a fountain, like a waterfall.” On paper, Shimla should receive about 55m litres of water each day. In practice, 22m litres – enough to fill nearly 10 Olympic swimming pools – seeps out of the system each day. The loss rate across India is even worse: researchers estimate 50% of the country’s usable water leaks from pipes or is wasted, especially by farmers, nearly all of whom irrigate their fields in the most inefficient way possible, simply flooding crops with vast quantities of water. The British established Shimla on seven cedar-studded hills in 1851. They foresaw a maximum population of 16,000 people. Last year, more than 18 million tourists visited the city. Successive governments have done little to stem the flow of new residents and visitors, and looked the other way as hundreds of hotels illegally sprung up to house them. “It was a boom,” says Shimla-based environmental lawyer Deven Khanna. “Whoever had land, built a hotel. Even some who didn’t have land just cut down trees and without sanction made a building.” Officials estimated there are 25,000 illegal buildings in Himachal Pradesh, many of them in Shimla. The surge has overwhelmed the city’s stocks of rain and snowfall, and wiped out nearly 70% of its groundwater. “Himachal has enough water,” says Khanna. “We have rivers, glaciers. The problem is not a lack of water. It is a lack of vision and will from the government.” This approach is not unique to Shimla. “All over India, we have an anarchic situation in water management,” says Himanshu Thakkar, the coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, a network of advocacy groups. He compares Shimla to Cape Town, the South African city that narrowly avoided running out of water this year after officials raised warnings and citizens restricted their use. “Once they predicted that water would run out, action followed,” Thakkar says. “In India, you would never even get a prediction. The water would just go.” Officials in Shimla maintain the crisis was exaggerated. “Within four or five days, the situation was back to normal,” says Thakur, the chief minister. Yet every resident the Guardian met on the city’s main promenade disagreed. A salesman, Ritaram Sham, said the community tap he and his neighbours rely on ran dry one morning in May. “It has been off for the last month,” he says.
Naresh Kumar left Shimla for his village after the tap stopped working for nine days. “Washing clothes, taking baths, they became privileges,” he says. Chauhan, the former mayor, is not surprised by the discrepancy between the views of officials and ordinary citizens. In India, he says, water is power. “No minister was standing in the line for the water tankers,” he says. “It was only the poor, the working class, the small shopkeepers.” Without effective plans to manage dwindling supplies, future water crises will likely play out the same way. “That’s what the powerful people want,” says Thakkar, the water rights advocate. “They are in a position to pull the strings they need to. The weaker people have no strings to pull.” Additional reporting by Madan Lal",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/shimla-india-water-crisis-life-on-frontline,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/shimla-india-water-crisis-life-on-frontline
2018-06-21T10:00:08Z,world,World news,Revealed: Canada uses secretive anti-terrorist database run by US,"Canadian border guards have been screening travellers using a huge, secretive US anti-terrorism database that is almost never referred to publicly, new documents reveal. The database, called Tuscan, is provided to every Canadian border guard and immigration officer, and empowers them to detain, interrogate, arrest and deny entry to anyone found on it. Hundreds of pages of documents obtained by the Guardian through Canada’s access to information system reveal the fullest picture yet of a database that, although employed in Canada, is maintained exclusively by the US. It contains the personal information of as many as 680,000 people believed by US authorities to be linked with terrorism, and functions effectively as a second no-fly list that is cloaked in secrecy. Canada’s official no-fly list is called the Passenger Protect Program, which lists known and suspected terrorists who are forbidden from flying to or from Canada. One estimate concludes it has around 100,000 names, and the government has offered a redress so travellers can apply to have their name removed.
Tuscan, however, is much larger and is managed entirely by the US government. There is no clear process in Canada to have your name removed from the list – nor would the US be required to oblige. What’s more, while Canada’s no-fly list only applies to airports, Tuscan extends to every land and sea border in Canada, as well as visa and immigration applications. Ottawa has never formally recognised the scope of Tuscan, although it is forging ahead with a closely guarded plan to expand and update it. Originally created in 1997 as a consular aid, the list was repurposed and expanded after 9/11, and in 2016 Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama agreed to expand it still further. The list effectively means that people cleared by the Canadian government to travel in and out of the country might still be detained because of the American list. It could also explain why certain travellers are searched and questioned more frequently or extensively, or why others have visas or immigration applications denied.
In March of 2015, Abdisalam Wilwal and his family were stopped at the Minnesota border on their return from visiting relatives in Canada. On the outbound border crossing, Canadian border guards said his file “included a notation from US authorities that might result in US authorities questioning him more than usual when he sought to re-enter the United States,” according to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Wilwal was detained upon returning to the US, and later released after authorities determined he had no connection to terrorism. Although the language used by the Canadian border guard suggests Wilwal was on Tuscan, it can be difficult to confirm given that there is no way of checking who is on the database. The names come from the US Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (Tide), which is vetted by the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center and populates various US traveller databases, as well as Canada’s Tuscan and an equivalent in Australia called Tactics.
Whenever a traveller crosses a Canadian land or sea border, enters the country through airport passport control, applies for a visa, or attempts to immigrate into Canada, their name is checked against the database. If there is a match, the border official can request so-called “derogatory information”, which includes any evidence on file of the traveller’s ties to terrorist activity or groups. American anti-terrorism lists have frequently been accused of including names of people with no links to terrorism. In 2014, the Intercept obtained data showing that 40% of the 680,000 names in the FBI’s list had no known ties to any terrorist group. Internal audits have found high error rates and incomplete records that could mix up people with similar names. The ACLU has challenged the constitutionality of databases such as Tide, contending the process for being added to these lists is vague, the effects can be severe and the databases are prone to errors. “Non-citizens can even be watchlisted based on innocent associations with others who are watchlisted,” said Hugh Handeyside, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU. Databases such as Tuscan pose “signifcant civil liberties concerns,” said Lex Gill, a research fellow at the University of Toronto Citizen Lab. Legal and human rights experts, she notes, have “consistently raised the issue of false positives, as well as the risk that these databases facilitate the practice of racial and ethnic profiling, which has particularly acute impacts for those of Muslim and Arab descent”.
Canada’s own official no-fly list has come under intense scrutiny after children as young as three were listed. But whereas Ottawa has trumpeted a program to help travellers get their names removed from that no-fly list, Tuscan offers no such obvious redress. In fact, Tuscan – which stands for Tipoff US/Canada – is mentioned almost nowhere in Canadian government documents except an obscure 2005 Citizenship and Immigration Canada report [pdf], where it is described as a way for both governments to “share data in order to deny entry to foreign terrorists who may attempt to travel to Canada and/or the United States”. There is a similarly passing reference [8.6MB pdf] in a commission of inquiry from 2006 into the detention of Canadian citizen Maher Arar, who was flown to Syria and tortured. Despite this, Ottawa is forging ahead with an update to the system. The briefing notes obtained by the Guardian, prepared for Ralph Goodale, Canada’s public safety minister, reveal the Canadian government has worked for the past three years to expand its involvement in Tuscan, without public acknowledgment or public consultation. A spokesperson for Public Safety Canada confirmed that Tuscan is provided to all Canadian border and immigration officials “for the purpose of guiding decisions on admissibility to Canada”. The spokesperson said that, while an agreement was signed in June 2016 to expand and modernize the program, negotiations were ongoing between the two countries to finalize the details. When asked what Ottawa is doing to ensure that the database is accurate, and to ensure that innocent travellers aren’t caught up in the database, the spokesperson said: “Procedures have been introduced to allow for the consideration of exculpatory and clarifying information, as well as to update and correct information when errors are detected. Protocols also exist around the use and protection of information.” The spokesperson refused to confirm the number of names on Tuscan, citing “operational reasons”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/canada-us-tuscan-anti-terrorist-database-at-borders,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/canada-us-tuscan-anti-terrorist-database-at-borders
2018-06-21T07:51:06Z,world,World news,Japanese worker punished for starting lunch three minutes early,"Japan’s commitment to addressing its dismal record on work-life balance has been called into question after a civil servant was punished for “habitually” slipping away from his desk a few minutes early to buy a bento lunch. The 64-year-old, an employee of the waterworks bureau in the western city of Kobe, was fined and reprimanded after he was found to have left his desk just three minutes before the start of his designated lunch break on 26 occasions over a seven-month period. Senior officials at the bureau then called a televised news conference, where they described the man’s conduct as “deeply regrettable” and bowed in apology. A spokesman for the bureau told AFP: “The lunch break is from noon to 1pm. He left his desk before the break.” The worker had violated a public service law requiring officials to “concentrate on their jobs”, according to the bureau. Local media reported the incident soon after MPs passed a law intended to address Japan’s punishingly long working hours. Last month, the lower house passed a bill that caps overtime at 100 hours a month in response to a rise in the number of employees dying from karoshi, or death from overwork. The government was forced to act following a public outcry over the death of Matsuri Takahashi, a 24-year-old employee of the advertising giant Dentsu, who killed herself in 2015 after being forced to work more than 100 hours overtime a month, including at weekends. Takahashi’s case triggered calls to address a workplace culture that often forces employees to put in long hours to demonstrate their dedication. In its first white paper on karoshi in 2016, the government said one in five employees were at risk of death from overwork. Social media users leaped to the Kobe official’s defence, with one Twitter user pointing out that, on average, he had left his desk early just once a week. Others wondered if the rule would be applied to people who leave their desks to smoke or go to the toilet. Another said: “What about all the politicians who sleep in parliament? They ought to be fired, then.” The official’s illicit bento expeditions were uncovered after a senior colleague looked out of his office window and spotted him walking to a nearby restaurant that sells takeaway food at lunchtime. Senior management calculated how much time he had spent away from his desk and docked him half a day’s pay, according to Sora News 24. The employee, who has not been named, reportedly said that he had left the office early to buy lunch because he needed a “change of pace”. Kobe city recently suspended another official for a month for a similar misdemeanour, saying he had been absent for more than 55 hours over a six-month period.

2018-06-21T06:00:05Z,world,World news,Sonic youth: the UK school turning teenagers' lives around,"It is midday, and a teenage boy has been removed from class for causing trouble. But instead of being sent to the headteacher’s office, he is jamming on a keyboard while a teacher adds in some drums. “It calms them down,” says Nick Stillwell, the co-founder of the SupaJam school in Swanley, Kent. “They realise life’s OK, and put the knife down.” With its leopard-print wallpaper and vinyl records playing in the entrance hall, SupaJam is not your average educational institution. The Pink Floyd bassist Guy Pratt has been known to pop by to run workshops. “We try to create an environment that’s a little forgiving,” says Stillwell, a music industry professional who set up the music school four years ago with his business partner, David Court. “This whole thing has been established so it doesn’t feel like school.” Drawing on their expertise the pair created a course in the music industry for young people who who have fallen out of education – 16- to 18-year-olds not in education, training or employment, as well as those aged up to 25 with special educational needs. Some students have spent time in young offenders’ institutions, or have drug or alcohol problems. Some were gang members.
SupaJam’s success rate is remarkable – 97% of those who complete the course leave with a nationally recognised business diploma, and 85% go on to further education or employment. “That’s huge for these kids,” says Stillwell, “because everyone’s been telling them how rubbish they are. We give them things to brag about.” Stillwell and Court self-funded the school for its first two years, before winning a contract with the Department for Education. As well as traditional classrooms it has a recording studio, editing suite and enough instruments to start an orchestra. Industry professionals drop in to offer lessons and work experience; the US singer-songwriter Sonia Leigh performed here last year. This summer the students have been given their own stage to curate at the Black Deer music festival near Tunbridge Wells.
“Did you know Albert Einstein played the violin?” asks second-year student Katie, 17. “A teacher told his parents they should take him out of school, he wasn’t smart enough. And then they bought him a violin and he sailed through.” Katie has also experienced the power of music. Bullying and family problems shattered her GCSE year, and with only a scattering of Cs and Ds she felt she had nowhere to turn. At SupaJam she has become a star pupil, even creating her own blog about music and mental health. “In formal education they don’t take into account anything you might struggle with. You might be having a bad day but that isn’t the person you are,” she says. “Nick and David actually give you a chance.”
SupaJam’s co-founders can identify with their pupils. They met at 15, both kicked out of school without qualifications. “We were the naughty boys, but we were lucky because we had nice families. We weren’t abandoned by the adult world, like some of these kids,” says Stillwell. After setting up their own company they offered an internship scheme, but when it attracted only middle-class children they decided to try something different. The initial idea was to help six local teenagers – they now have 70 pupils and 31 staff, including welcomers to meet students as they arrive; safeguarding specialists in every class; and one-to-one maths and English tutors. Getting the young people into work is the primary objective. “They will often be the only person in education or employment in their family,” says Court. “Sometimes we have to battle with the parents because the kids can earn more money if they’re out on the streets dealing than in school.” While the special requirements of the students vary – from learning difficulties to physical disabilities – they are not taught separately, although all staff are trained in dealing with disabled students. “We decided to mix them all up and they naturally started to self-support each other,” says Court. “They don’t label one another, they just get along. It puts all of us to shame. These kids are inspirational.”
Ahead of the Black Deer festival, the students have been working with professionals on every aspect of production, from choosing and booking the acts to running the sound and lighting. Gill Tee, the festival’s co-founder, says she could have found herself in a similar position to the students when she was young. Growing up on a council estate, her teenage brother was murdered when she was 12. “I used to nick my mum’s tranquillisers,” says Tee. “I wanted to escape the pain at home, seeing my beautiful mum shattered.” But she stayed out of trouble, and began her music career making tea at Capital Radio. “It shows these kids that they can do the same.” Last year the first three SupaJam graduates were accepted into university, a proud moment for the school. But taking up those places proved intimidating for the students. Stillwell and Court responded by setting up a charity that will run a mentorship programme and send tutors along with the students for the first six weeks of their studies. Their dreams for SupaJam are even bigger: plans to open a second base in Ramsgate, and then to expand nationwide. “These kids are too young to abandon,” says Stillwell. “This is our society and we have to fight for them.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/musical-youth-kent-school-supajam-turning-teenagers-lives-around,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/musical-youth-kent-school-supajam-turning-teenagers-lives-around
2018-06-21T06:00:03Z,world,World news,Call for upskirting bill to include 'deepfake' pornography ban,"Producing fake pornographic images based on pictures of real people should be made a criminal offence in an amended bill to tackle upskirting, an academic expert has argued. The government has agreed to sponsor the legislation after its initial progress was halted by a Tory MP on Friday, but Clare McGlynn, a law professor at Durham University who specialises in the legal regulation of pornography and image-based sexual abuse, said there was now an opportunity to introduce broader “future-proofed” legislation. She argued that the bill should penalise those who created so-called “deepfake” images that if shared could have a devastating impact on an individual.
“The upskirting bill is a welcome first step towards a more comprehensive response to image-based sexual abuse, but when a government tries to legislate on something quickly there is a risk that an opportunity to have a proper look at the problems raised by new technology is missed,” McGlynn said. Deepfake pornography is a growing form of online abuse which began with images of celebrity’s faces being digitally manipulated into explicit stills and videos. However, it has become increasingly easy for anybody to be targeted, with a number of apps specifically designed for the purpose emerging. In May Davide Buccheri, a worker in the City of London, was jailed for 16 weeks for harassment after producing faked pornographic images in an unsuccessful attempt to discredit a female colleague. But experts like McGlynn say English law is out of step with modern developments and it would be easier to bring prosecutions by making it a specific offence. “It would be easy to extend the bill so that it covers images which have been altered too and clearly criminalise a practice that victims say they find incredibly distressing,” McGlynn added. A new law introduced in New South Wales, Australia, last year, was a model for what could be done, she added. Theresa May confirmed at prime minister’s questions that the government would introduce the bill to ban the taking of upskirt photographs on Thursday, taking on the private members bill proposed by the Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse that was blocked on Friday after Tory MP Sir Christopher Chope objected.
With government time the bill is guaranteed to become law, and it becomes possible for sympathetic MPs to amend the legislation into related areas to widen its scope. The Labour MPs Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy are understood to be considering whether it is possible to achieve cross-party support for additional changes. Ministers have already decided to amend Hobhouse’s bill banning upskirting to ensure that the most serious offenders will be placed on the sex offender register. As currently drafted, the bill proposes that offenders will be liable for up to two years in prison if found guilty of what May described as a “gross invasion of privacy”. The professor also said she thought Hobhouse’s upskirting bill also placed too high a burden of proof on prosecutors because they had to show that a picture was taken for the purposes of sexual gratification or to cause distress when “the unfortunate reality is that these things are often done ‘for a laugh’” adding: “It’s not clear to me that the current proposed legislation will cover these situations.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/call-for-upskirting-bill-to-include-deepfake-pornography-ban,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/call-for-upskirting-bill-to-include-deepfake-pornography-ban
2018-06-21T05:26:35Z,world,World news,"Thursday briefing: Rule still cruel, say Trump border policy critics","Top story: Separation policy axed after huge outcry Hello, Warren Murray here – let’s get you ahead by leaps and bounds. Donald Trump has signed an executive order abandoning his policy of separating immigrant children from their detained parents. But the instruction appears to do nothing to bring about the return of the 2,300 children already taken away. Critics say Trump’s policy remains needlessly cruel as he seeks to effectively replace family separation with indefinite family detention. Protesters are planning actions for later this month, and on Wednesday some activists occupied an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) building in Oregon, forcing it to shut down. In Mexico, some women and children hoping to cross into the US say they are choosing between death at home or brutal treatment in Texas. Overnight, Trump has held a rally in Minnesota where he attempted to deflect criticism by repeating his signature attacks on Hillary Clinton, the Democrats and immigrants. * * * A cause without its rebels – Any “meaningful vote” for parliament now hinges on Theresa May keeping her word after Dominic Grieve failed to back his own amendment to the EU withdrawal bill. Ailing MPs arrived in wheelchairs for the crucial House of Commons vote but in the end Grieve and other Tory rebels backed down and the amendment failed – averting a defeat for the PM. Six rebel Conservatives still voted with Labour to support the amendment but it was defeated by 319 votes to 303. Grieve accepted assurances from May and David Davis, the Brexit secretary, that the role of parliament would be respected. MPs can still have a vote on the final deal – or no deal – but unless it is a vote of confidence the government can ignore it. The next major row looming for May appears to be on setting up a post-Brexit single market for goods. Brussels would likely demand concessions on freedom of movement – a red flag to leavers. * * * Not getting it done – The Trump administration has admitted there are no signs of North Korea dismantling its nuclear arsenal or facilities, while no further meetings to achieve this have been arranged. After the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore last week, the US president promised a meeting would be held this week to “get this stuff done”. Yesterday the secretary of defence, James Mattis, was asked whether he could “put his finger on” any steps North Korea had taken to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme. “No, I’m not aware of that,” he replied. It adds to impressions that the North’s ruler extracted big concessions from Trump, including a halt to US-South Korea war games, while sacrificing little or nothing in return. * * * Housing blocks could collapse – Residents are being cleared from two housing blocks in London that have been deemed at risk of falling down. Haringey borough council says the buildings on the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham could collapse if there is a gas explosion or a vehicle hits the base. Households will be moved elsewhere either temporarily or permanently, and the buildings will probably be demolished and replaced. “We don’t know where they are going to rehouse us,” said one Broadwater resident. “But at least they are moving us. Who wants what happened in Grenfell to happen to their loved ones?” * * * A nation expects – New Zealand’s media is going gaga after the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, went into hospital to give birth. Winston Peters, her deputy, has taken over as acting PM: “It’s a happy day and on behalf of the coalition government we wish her and Clarke [Gayford] all the very best,” he said.
Ardern and Gayford, her partner, drove themselves to hospital at 5.50am local time. It will be the first time in 30 years that a nation’s leader has given birth while in office. Ardern is expected to take six weeks’ maternity leave. * * * Ribbiting news – People with gardens are being urged to create simple ponds or areas of long grass for frogs and toads to help reverse a decline in their numbers. In return for accommodation they will eat your slugs, snails, ants and spiders: “They should be really good gardeners’ friends amongst your vegetables if you allow them to be your pest controllers,” said Daniel Hayhow, RSPB conservation scientist. World Cup Day eight of the tournament is upon us and the build-up to the first kick-off of the day has already begun at our live blog. It’s been another eventful 24 hours in Russia. Perhaps most notably, Gareth Southgate became the first major casualty of England’s campaign after dislocating his right shoulder while running near the team’s base on the Gulf of Finland. “It is better this is me than one of the players,” Southgate said. Meanwhile, Southgate’s assistant, Steve Holland, has revealed the influences and consideration that led to a tactical shift to playing three at the back in Russia. British police are working with the Football Association to investigate a video that has surfaced online apparently showing England fans at the World Cup in Russia performing Nazi salutes.
Yesterday’s games saw three 1-0 wins and three familiar goalscorers: Cristiano Ronaldo grabbed his fourth of the tournament as Portugal put Morocco out; Diego Costa scored his third in Spain’s win over Iran; and Luis Suárez marked his 100th international cap by sending Uruguay into the last 16 and ending Saudi Arabia’s involvement.

Lunchtime read: ‘Knife crime is a public health issue’ In our year-long series Beyond the Blade, the Guardian gained access to previously unavailable data on young people and knife crime from the past 40 years, and counted all the children and teens killed by knives last year. We discovered that roughly half of all teenage knife deaths, on average, take place outside London. The overwhelming majority of those killed by knives in Britain in the last 40 years were not black. And the overwhelming majority of young people caught carrying knives today are not involved with gangs.
Yet, writes Gary Younge, tabloid headlines still steer our assumptions about knife crime. “Earlier this year, a handful of fatal stabbings (and shootings) in London launched another one of Britain’s episodic fixations with knife crime and youth violence.” Today, Younge explains the lessons we have learned over the past year and lays out the case for a radical new approach. Sport Another day produced another record as England’s women demolished South Africa by 121 runs to begin their T20 tri-series campaign in rampaging style.

2018-06-21T05:00:06Z,world,World news,Nato head calls for unity after Trump discord and Russia threat,"The Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, is to use a major speech in London on Thursday to express hope the alliance will hold together in spite of threats from Donald Trump. He will acknowledge differences and disagreements between the US and other allies are real. But he will argue that Nato has been able to overcome such problems in the past and can do so again. The Nato summit in Brussels in July is shaping up as one of the most fraught in the alliance’s history, with Trump openly at odds with Germany and Canada on trade and other issues and warning he will deal with Europeans refusing to increase their share of defence spending. In advance excerpts of his speech, Stoltenberg will argue that maintaining the transatlantic partnership is in the strategic interest of all Nato members. “The lesson of history is that we have been able to overcome our differences. Again and again, we unite around our common goal. We stand together. We protect each other.” Russia has been chipping away at Nato since it annexed Crimea in 2014. It has been blamed for cyberattacks, interventions in European elections and for the nerve agent attack in Salisbury in March this year. In spite of the splits within Nato, Stoltenberg will claim the US, Canada and Europe have grown stronger in defence.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/nato-head-jens-stoltenberg-calls-for-unity-threats-trump-and-russia,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/nato-head-jens-stoltenberg-calls-for-unity-threats-trump-and-russia
2018-06-21T04:37:26Z,world,World news,'I know what's right and wrong': Najib Razak denies responsibility for 1MDB scandal,"The former prime minister of Malaysia Najib Razak has denied any responsibility for the 1MDB scandal and claimed that the hundreds of designer handbags and millions of dollars in cash seized from his house were wedding gifts and campaign funds. In his first interview after he dramatically lost the election in May, Najib protested his innocence and claimed that the board of the troubled 1MDB government fund had kept the multi-billion dollar embezzlement of the money from him. Speaking to Reuters, Najib said: “If I knew there was going to be misappropriation of funds, if that was my knowledge, I would have acted.”
1MDB was a government fund set up by Najib in 2009 but in 2015 it was revealed that over $4bn had been embezzled out of the account and laundered around the world, funding yachts, Picasso paintings, property and films. Some $681m of the fund was deposited into Najib’s personal bank account. The total losses and theft of 1MDB money is now estimated to be $10bn. While he was in power, an investigation Najib cleared of all wrongdoing, but since the newly elected government took office, a renewed prove into 1MDB has been key priority. Najib’s alleged role in the scandal has been at the centre of the investigation. Speaking on Tuesday, new prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said they had an “almost perfect case” against Najib and his allies and expected arrests to be made within months. However, Najib maintained that his conscience was clean. “I’m not party to the yacht, the paintings ... I’ve never seen those paintings whatsoever,” he said. “I was not aware of these purchases. This was done without my knowledge. I would never authorise 1MDB funds to be used for any of these items. I’ve been in government so long, I know what’s right and what’s wrong.” He added that he had no idea the money deposited into his personal bank account came from 1MDB.
He also washed his hands of any responsibility for the actions of Jho Low, a Malaysian businessman who was brought on as a consultant for 1MDB and was allegedly responsible for the embezzlement of the money into the US, funding, among other things, the Wolf of Wall Street film, which was produced by Najib’s stepson Riza Ahmad. The Malaysian authorities recently issued a warrant for Low’s arrest in connection with 1MDB. “I didn’t give him instructions, but he volunteered to do certain things, which he thought would help 1MDB,” said Najib. “But whatever he did ultimately is the responsibility of the management and board.” As part of the 1MDB investigation, multiple raids have been carried out on Najib’s property which saw 274 designer Birkin handbags seized as well as $29m in cash. The former prime minister maintained that the handbags were gifts to his wife and weddings presents given to his daughter. The cash, he added, was “genuine donations” from the election. “As president of the party, I had to prepare for the elections, and elections are very expensive affairs,” he said. “Donations are made in cash in election times.” Another case that has reared its head since Najib was toppled from power is the murder of Altantuya Shaaribuya, a Mongolian translator who was the lover of Najib’s close associate Razak Baginda. Claims of a government cover up of her death, with allegations she was Najib’s lover and had known about corrupt government defence deals, have hung over Malaysian politics for over a decade. There are now calls for the new government to re-open the case. However Najib reiterated his denial of any involvement. “The Altantuya case has already been dealt with,” he said. “There is no evidence whatsoever that I ever met her, there are no records, no pictures or witness to say that I even knew her. It was subject to a proper trial and my name didn’t come up during the trial whatsoever.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/najib-razak-denies-1mdb-scandal-i-know-whats-right-and-wrong-,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/najib-razak-denies-1mdb-scandal-i-know-whats-right-and-wrong-
2018-06-21T04:00:00Z,world,World news,'He's a fool who says foolish things': Italy's Roma face new threat from Matteo Salvini,"In a slum on the outskirts of Rome, members of the Roma community are at odds: some are afraid, some angry and others indifferent. But some support a vitriolic pledge by Matteo Salvini, Italy’s new hardline interior minister, to conduct a census of their community and expel those who are living in the country illegally. “We heard Salvini’s words and we congratulate him,” says Stefano, whose family came to Italy from Bosnia more than 50 years ago. “There are so many delinquents within the Roma community – in this camp and across all of Italy. This camp used to be a lot better now it’s filthy – and there are bad people here. Salvini only wants to bring tranquillity to Italy, and I agree with him.” Stefano has nine children, all of whom voted for Salvini’s far-right League party in general elections in early March, and 60 grandchildren.
“Salvini said he would clean-up Italy and get rid of the illegals, my siblings and I voted for him,” says one of his children, who asks to remain anonymous. They have lived in the Salone camp, located about 15km to the east of Rome’s historic centre and home to over 600 others, for seven years. Roads strewn with rubbish and filled with muddy puddles divide the caravans and huts in which people reside. Stefano says that a rat recently crawled across one of his grandchildren’s face as she slept, biting her lip. “We don’t want to live in this dump, we wanted proper houses. It’s a miracle that nobody has become seriously ill.” Salvini’s attack on the Roma people came a week after he refused to allow a ship carrying more than 600 migrants rescued from the Mediterranean to dock in Italy, forcing it to divert to Spain. The move also recalled the racial laws against the Jewish and Roma communities that were introduced by the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in the 1930s. Salvini vowed to turn “his words into action” as he strives to appease a supporter base which has almost doubled since the elections. Some at Salone fear that Salvini will conduct a census, so much so they are afraid to have their photograph taken. But others aren’t so worried. “Who cares? He’s a fool who says foolish things,” says Silvia, who has been in the camp for six years, as she hosed down the street next to her caravan. “He is against all foreigners, yet so many of us were born here. If he ever did get rid of us – even those without documents – Italy’s economy would totally collapse.”
There are an estimated 130,000 Roma people in Italy, around half of whom are Italian citizens. Many live in camps similar to Salone. Stefano feels confident that Salvini will spare his children and grandchildren, who were born in Italy, despite the minister revealing his disdain for the entire community through the remark: “Unfortunately, you have to keep the Italian ones at home”. Stefano says Roma people earn a living by either selling discarded clothes or furniture, or by cleaning out the long-neglected basements of Italians’ homes. He dismisses the perception that children don’t go to school and are merely sent out to beg and steal. “Five buses come each day to bring the children to school,” he adds.
Salone is among the five camps that were either built or extended by Gianni Alemanno, a rightwing mayor who led Rome between 2008 and 2013. He named them “villages of solidarity”. But there is little solidarity to be found among those in Salone.
“Don’t go down to the far end, that’s where the Gypsies are,” warns Stefano. Carlo Stasolla, the president of Associazione 21 Luglio, which supports Roma rights, said it is no surprise that people in the camp support Salvini. “It’s no different from anywhere else in terms of the type of people whose vote he manages to capture,” he says. “But they also voted for him in the hope that if he got into government, he would help them instead of being harsh towards them.” But Stasolla, who lived among the Roma community for 14 years, is taking Salvini seriously. “When people talk about categorising, they do actually do it,” he says. He points to the example of Roberto Maroni, an interior minister from the League party between from 2008 to 2011, who for a year conducted a census in Rome and Naples before it was stopped by an Italian court. “Everyone in the camps, including children, were taking to the police station and made to give their fingerprints.” Like Stefano and his family, all would like to live in proper homes. “Roma are simply poor people living in squalid conditions,” adds Stasolla. “There is so much prejudice, but unless the local authorities help it’s impossible for them to get a home, as many have neither the documents or the economic resources.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/roma-census-italy-hunt-illegal-immigrants,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/roma-census-italy-hunt-illegal-immigrants
2018-06-21T03:28:29Z,world,World news,Jacinda Ardern #babywatch sends New Zealand media gaga,"The media arrived at Auckland hospital in the predawn hours. They set up their cameras, notepads at the ready. Commuters exchanged knowing looks in the streets. This was the day. Nine floors up, New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was in labour. The phenomenon that has become known as #babywatch across the country had officially begun.
Since Ardern announced her pregnancy, on 19 January, shortly after winning office, she has gained increasing recognition on the world stage. She appeared in countless interviews with international media and in the pages of Vogue. It would be the first time in 30 years that a nation’s leader had a child while in office. It was also the winter solstice, a good time to plant garlic a “great day for having a baby”, wrote one commentator on Twitter. The day began early with an announcement from the prime minister’s office that Ardern and her partner, Clarke Gayford, had driven themselves to hospital at 5.50am. Ardern then handed the official duties to the acting prime minister, Winston Peters. The live blogs fired up within moments – except one that had been going for several days already. In the absence of an actual baby, they recounted minutiae: the quality of scones available in the hospital canteen, the number of patients the hospital cares for each year, photographs of other politicians with other babies.
The Spinoff interviewed a man called Steve, who was on a “smoko break”. Steve said he had not heard about the prime minister’s baby. “It’s a bit out of the blue,” he said. Other news outlets filled the air time with coverage of Ardern’s interactions with her nieces, her previous statements on why asking a woman in job interviews about their intentions to start a family was unacceptable and why this pregnancy meant so much to a generation of New Zealanders. One blog reported the most amusing comments from the Daily Mail’s story. The nation’s most-read Chinese-language news service produced a memorable composite image of Ardern, Gayford and a baby’s dummy. Another website compiled a playlist to welcome the infant, including the Chemical Brothers song Hey Boy, Hey Girl and Europe’s The Final Countdown. The biggest actual news was that Ardern had been texting her staff from the hospital. The content of the texts was not known but apparently did not relate to the progress of her labour.
Meanwhile, the betting operator TAB had a “phantom market” of potential names inspired by famous New Zealand figures, along with some others. The country was upbeat – and the feeling seeped beyond its borders. The New York Times suggested it was a rare opportunity for New Zealanders to get excited about something. Many had taken to knitting for the incoming baby as part of a #knitforjacinda movement. Others had gifted Ardern baby clothes in preparation. At her last public outing, at an agricultural show, members of the public took to trying to rub her belly and wish her luck. Some wore their joy on their sleeve. “It felt like Christmas today on Lambton Quay,” a commentator, Morgan Godfrey, wrote on Twitter. “People were smiling at each other, the ‘you know’ kind of smile.” But beyond that some suggested this moment was worth something more than the usual celebrations of an impending child. “She’s showing that women can procreate while campaigning, negotiating coalition deals, deflecting sexist comments about babies, and just generally going about their everyday duties,” wrote a columnist, Michelle Duff. Not everyone was as enthused. The opposition National party MP Judith Collins asked for the media coverage to take a break, after learning that a security guard had moved a reporter who was filming in the wrong place.
By early afternoon the baby still had not come but as the evening came Ardern posted to her Facebook page that her daughter had been born at 4.45pm. “Welcome to our village wee one,” she wrote, next to a picture of her and partner cuddling the newborn. Ardern will take six weeks of maternity leave but will be contactable if there are any urgent or major developments. Gayford will be a stay-at-home parent, or “first bloke”, as he has referred to himself. Peters told reporters at parliament that he did not consider this a historic day and said he would just be getting on with the job. He was “unfazed” when he received the news he was now acting prime minister, he said. “When you’ve been around as long as I have, nothing’s unusual.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/jacinda-ardern-babywatch-new-zealand-media,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/jacinda-ardern-babywatch-new-zealand-media
2018-06-20T23:54:09Z,world,World news,"No sign of North Korea dismantling nuclear weapons programme, Mattis admits","The US defence secretary, James Mattis, has said he is unaware of any steps taken by North Korea towards dismantling its nuclear weapons programme since the Singapore summit and does not expect any in the immediate future. Mattis was speaking to reporters amid confusion over the diplomatic follow-up to last week’s summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un.
Immediately after the meeting Trump claimed that North Korea had begun the destruction of a missile engine testing site or would begin as soon as Kim returned from the summit. In return Trump ordered the suspension of military exercises with South Korea, a longstanding demand of the Pyongyang regime. This week the Pentagon confirmed that planning for the next scheduled exercises in August had halted. However, asked on Wednesday if he could “put his finger on” any steps North Korea had taken to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme, Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon: “No, I’m not aware of that.”
He added: “The detailed negotiations have not begun. I wouldn’t expect that at this point.” After the Singapore meeting Trump said that his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and national security adviser, John Bolton, would take part in follow-up meetings with North Korean officials this week to “go into the details” of the denuclearisation agreement the president believed he had struck with Kim. Both Trump and Pompeo predicted that follow-on talks with North Korean officials would take place in the week after the 12 June summit. “We’re getting together next week to go into the details,” Trump told a post-summit press conference in Singapore. “Next week, with John Bolton and our entire team, to go over the details and to get this stuff done.” The next day Pompeo confirmed: “I will be the person who takes the role of driving this process forward. “I don’t know exactly what the timing will be for our next conversation with North Korea,” the secretary of state said. “I would anticipate it will be fairly quickly after we return to our home countries. I don’t know exactly what form that will take but I’m very confident that by some time in the next week or so we will begin the engagement.” That engagement has not, so far, occurred. The state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Tuesday that although the US had been in touch with Pyongyang there was nothing to announce on Pompeo’s travel plans. Bolton said on Wednesday that “Pompeo and others” would be meeting North Korean counterparts, adding “we’ll find out soon enough whether they’ve made this strategic decision”. “They’ve said they want complete denuclearisation and now we’ll have to talk about how to achieve that and I think you will see diplomatic engagement proceed very quickly,” Bolton told Fox News, but gave no details on timing. “I think there is a mad scramble right now,” said Victor Cha, former director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council. He said US officials had tried and failed to persuade the North Koreans to include language in the joint statement in Singapore committing to “complete, verifiable and irreversible” disarmament with a timetable for carrying it out by 2020. “They did not get those but Trump went along with the meeting anyway, which means he cared more about the meeting than about the substance,” Cha said. “Even though there is no timeline, there is a de facto one now. Pompeo has to get something before August to justify suspending the [military] exercises.” Another element of the Singapore joint statement was a North Korean promise to hand over remains of US soldiers, marines and airmen still unaccounted for since the 1950-53 Korean war. It said that those remains that Pyongyang has already identified as US servicemen, thought be number about 200, would be repatriated at once. “They’re giving a commitment, they’re starting it immediately, to recover their remains,” Trump said. Recovery and repatriation has been happening on and off for decades. So far the remains of 334 servicemen have been identified from the bones and personal effects handed over by Pyongyang, and about 5,000 more are thought to be scattered around North Korean territory. US military officials said on Wednesday that the UN Command, the US-led coalition that fought the war, was planning to oversee the repatriation of more remains which could happen in the next few days. Mattis said the details had yet to be agreed. “Those discussions are also ongoing right now, but I don’t have any updates for you,” he told reporters. “I know that we’re engaged on it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/no-sign-of-north-korea-dismantling-nuclear-weapons-mattis-admits,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/no-sign-of-north-korea-dismantling-nuclear-weapons-mattis-admits
2018-06-20T23:26:21Z,world,World news,Canada's Trudeau says cannabis will become legal in mid-October,"Marijuana will become fully legal in Canada on 17 October, prime minister Justin Trudeau has said, ushering in a landmark change that he expects will take significant chunk out of profits flowing to organised crime.
Speaking to reporters for the first time since the senate set the stage for Canada to become the first country in the G7 to fully legalise cannabis, Trudeau said: “Obviously the current approach – the current prohibition of marijuana – has not worked to protect our kids, to keep the money out of the pockets of organised crime and that’s why we’re bringing in a new legalised framework around marijuana,” he said on Wednesday. Trudeau’s Liberal government introduced legislation last year in a bid to make Canada the second country in the world to legalise cannabis, after Uruguay. Medical marijuana is already legal in Canada. Trudeau expected that the end of 95 years of prohibition would immediately begin to curtail the estimated C$6bn ($4.5bn) in profits pouring into the black market. “And over the following months, and indeed years, we will almost completely replace the organised crime market on that,” he said. Initially the federal government had hoped to launch retail sales by July this year. Trudeau said: “One of the things that we heard very clearly from the provinces is that they need a certain amount of time to get their bricks-and-mortar stores and their online sales ready. “Producers need time to be able to actually prepare for a regimented and successful implementation of the regime ... This is something that we want to get right.”
Once legalisation goes into effect, Canadians will be able grow up to four plants in their home and carry up to 30 grams of dried cannabis for personal use. They’ll be able to prepare edibles at home for personal use and share up to 30 grams between adults. Those caught with more than this amount, or who supply marijuana to minors, will face stiff penalties. Sales of cannabis will vary widely across the country. In Alberta, recreational cannabis will be available at more than 200 private retailers while in New Brunswick, the provincial government will operate a chain of stores called Cannabis NB. Many questions remained unanswered, however, such as how police will test motorists suspected of driving under the influence, whether provinces will be able to ban home cultivation and how legalisation will interact with the roughly 400,000 people a day who cross the US-Canada border. The federal government is also under renewed pressure to pair legalisation with pardons for the hundreds of thousands of Canadians with prior marijuana convictions. On Wednesday Trudeau said it would be “illogical” to consider the issue before the new law comes into effect. “We’ve said that we will look at next steps once the coming-into-force happens but between now and then the current regime stays.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/canadas-trudeau-says-cannabis-will-become-legal-in-mid-october,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/canadas-trudeau-says-cannabis-will-become-legal-in-mid-october

A statement from the prime minister’s office said Ardern and her partner, Clarke Gayford, arrived at Auckland hospital at 5.50am on Thursday.
Winston Peters, the deputy prime minister, is now acting prime minister. The head of the populist New Zealand First party had already taken over some of Ardern’s duties, including running cabinet meetings in Wellington while she stayed close to home in Auckland. Peters said in a statement: “It’s a happy day and on behalf of the coalition government we wish her and Clarke all the very best.” Marama Davidson, co-leader of the Greens, said: “I am thinking of Jacinda with so much excitement as she approaches giving birth for the first time. Her and Clarke have my best wishes for this special experience.” Co-leader James Shaw added: “This is an exciting time for Jacinda and Clarke and an historic moment for our country.” Ardern’s due date was Sunday and the country has been gripped by a sense of excitement and anticipation in recent days. On Thursday, many major media outlets set up livefeeds on their websites with rolling coverage and local journalists camped at the hospital. Ardern has said there would be little disruption during her time off because she would stay in regular contact with Peters and be involved in major decisions. Ardern, 37, will be only the second world leader to give birth while in office – the first being Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto in 1990. Ardern has said she will have six weeks maternity leave before heading back to parliament. Gayford, a television presenter, will become “first bloke” and a stay-at-home father to the child. Ardern had her last pre-birth day in parliament at the start of the week. Her last public outing was at the national Fieldays agricultural show where many fans spent the time wishing her well while some tried to touch her stomach. Since then she and Gayford had posted a photo to social media of Ardern working at her Auckland electorate office

The medical groups’ statements follow an open letter signed by more than 2,000 doctors calling for Ali’s transfer, and a public petition to the prime minister that has garnered more than 22,000 signatures.

Last month, Guardian Australia revealed the details of 63-year-old Ali, an Afghan Hazara man suffering advanced lung cancer. Sources on Nauru and doctors familiar with his case say the palliative care he is receiving inside the Australian-run regional processing centre is “totally inadequate”. His prognosis is “dire” and he has only weeks or months to live. The Australian Border Force has told Ali he can go to Taiwan to die – an option he has rejected because he does not know anybody there, is concerned there would be no translator from his language, Hazaraghi, and that there would be no one to perform the Shia Muslim rituals and ceremonies on his body when he died. The ABF has also offered him $25,000 to return to Afghanistan, the country he fled after facing threats on his life. Ali is a member of the persecuted Hazara minority and has been formally recognised as a refugee – he faces a well-founded fear of persecution in Afghanistan and cannot be forcibly returned there. Australia is legally obliged to protect him.
Ali should be immediately brought to Australia for palliative care, the AMA said. “He has advanced lung cancer. He needs significant palliative care services that he cannot receive on the island. This is not in dispute,” AMA president Dr Tony Bartone said. Moving Ali to Taiwan was neither medically nor ethically appropriate, Bartone said. “The AMA has always held that all people who are under the protection of the Australian Government have the right to receive appropriate medical care without discrimination, regardless of citizenship or visa status. “They should be treated with compassion, respect and dignity. On any score – international obligations, conventions, respect, standards of clinical and ethical care – we must not fail to provide the requisite medical care on Australia’s watch.” The AMA has consistently called for an independent statutory body of clinical experts with the power to investigate and report to parliament on the health and welfare of asylum seekers and refugees in Australia’s care. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians said people suffering terminal illnesses should not be subjected to indefinite detention at the end of their lives. “Someone who is suffering from a terminal illness and where treatment is out of the question, should not be held in detention,” RACP president, associate professor Mark Lane, said. “This man should be brought to Australia for palliative care and be allowed dignity and respect at the end of his life.”
An open letter from Sydney GP Dr Sara Townend has now attracted more than 2,000 doctors’ signatures, including former heads of the AMA and doctors who have worked on Nauru. “If he goes to Taiwan, where there are no Hazara, he will die isolated and without community. This is no way to die,” the letter says. “If he remains on Nauru, he faces a potentially catastrophic death, without medical expertise to ease his pain and symptoms. This is no way to die. “His only chance of a good death is to come to Australia so that he can have both community and medical expertise. Our international reputation depends on it. Our humanity demands it.” Townend told Guardian Australia: “it hurt so much to read of this man’s situation because I work so hard for my own patients to make their deaths the best they can be. “I work with adults who are dying, and with children who are dying. Even here in Australia with excellent palliative care available, a good death is challenging to achieve. I could not bear to think of this man dying alone in a room without family or community or appropriate medical expertise. I could not believe this was a deliberate act of exclusion by my government.” A change.org petition, calling for Ali’s transfer to Australia, has now been signed by more than 22,000 people. “He has one incredibly simple request: to come to Australia and receive some relief from the pain and die with some dignity and comfort,” the petition says. On Nauru, several sources have told Guardian Australia that ABF staff have made repeated requests to Canberra for intervention in his case. High-profile or politically-sensitive medical cases are decided not by the ABF but by executive-level officials of the Department of Home Affairs: in some cases as high as the secretary of the department or the minister for home affairs. ABF recommendations from Nauru are often overruled at executive level inside the department. The decision to offer Taiwan as a medical transfer can only be made by senior department staff.
IHMS, the Australian government’s contracted health provider on Nauru, has refused to answer questions about when it had become aware of Ali’s critical health needs, when it first requested he be moved, or how many transfer requests it had made. The department said it would not comment on individual cases, but that medical transfer decisions “occur on a case-by-case basis according to clinical need, in consultation with the contracted health services provider and the government of Nauru … [and] with the permission of the individual”. “Australia has provided significant funding and support over a number of years to improve health infrastructure in Nauru.” Friends on Nauru say that Ali – who had previously worked in construction while being held on Nauru – has deteriorated badly in recent weeks. He is finding it increasingly difficult to speak, has lost most of the use of his right arm, and can no longer dress himself. “He [Ali] is very angry, he is very upset as well,” a friend on the island said. “He said these people do not have a human heart.” *Ali is a patronym, his full name is withheld to protect his family.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/no-way-to-die-peak-medical-bodies-call-for-dying-refugee-to-come-to-australia,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/no-way-to-die-peak-medical-bodies-call-for-dying-refugee-to-come-to-australia
2018-06-20T17:51:09Z,world,World news,Italy's treatment of Roma people rooted in centuries-old prejudice,"When Italy’s new government attacked the country’s Roma population, threatening to expel thousands from the country, they were tapping into centuries-old prejudices against the group. Persecution of the Roma in Europe dates back at least several hundred years. The Council of Europe details a history of extreme persecution including enslavement, forced sterilisation, separation from children and massacres. Roma have Indian roots, and migrated slowly westwards over hundreds of years, appearing in historical records from Europe by the 14th century. Originally nomadic, though now settled in many areas, they were first targeted by European officials over 500 years ago. “Roma were banned from the Holy Roman Empire in 1501 and, as of this date, could be caught and killed by any citizen,” the Council of Europe explains. In France less than two centuries later, Louis XIV ordered that all Gypsy men be condemned to forced labour for life without trial, women be sterilised and children be sent to poorhouses. As the Enlightenment spread across Europe in the 18th century, Roma were among the many excluded. Spain in 1749 launched an operation known as the “great Gypsy round-up”; Roma were enslaved in parts of what is now Romania until 1856. The Austro-Hungarian empire ran a fierce “assimilation” policy that involved separating children and parents, the Council of Europe explains. Roma were among the targets of Nazi laws introduced in the 1930s, and Italy’s own fascist ethnic cleansing rules of the 1920s, and during the second world war hundreds of thousands were killed in massacres and at concentration camps. The Roma even have their own word for the Holocaust of their people during the second world war, the Pharrajimos. Although the exact death toll is not known, in some countries the killing wiped out up to 90% of the Roma population. In the immediate aftermath of the war, many Roma concentration camp survivors were refused help and compensation. In the decades that followed, stigmatisation and discrimination has continued across much of Europe. As late as the 1970s, Switzerland was taking children from their parents, arguing that they couldn’t educate them to be good citizens. A recent study in Britain found a huge rise in Romany and Traveller families having their children taken away, a trend blamed on institutional prejudice. This decade alone they have been segregated in schools in Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia and databases or other surveys such as the one proposed in Italy are not unprecedented in other parts of Europe. Last year a Swedish appeals court ruled that police should pay compensation after setting up an illegal database of Roma family trees that included several thousand people, many of them children, or individuals without any criminal record.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/italys-treatment-of-roma-people-reflects-a-centuries-old-prejudice,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/italys-treatment-of-roma-people-reflects-a-centuries-old-prejudice
2018-06-20T17:34:19Z,world,World news,'If we go back they will kill us all': impossible choices at US border,"A group of weary women sort through a suitcase of used clothes in the shady yard of a migrant shelter close to the US border, while their infants breastfeed or nap on makeshift beds and older children take turns playing on a brightly painted slide. Most of the 60 or so women staying at the Madre Assunta Scalabrini nun’s shelter in Tijuana are on a rapidly expanding list waiting to be allowed to seek asylum with their children across the border in San Diego, where they remain hopeful that US authorities will take pity on them.
Ana Ramírez, 34, arrived here 12 days ago from the violent coastal city of Acapulco in southern Mexico, with three children aged 11 to 17 and her 18-month-old grandson. They fled after armed men threatened to kill the family unless the oldest boy – a 14-year-old high-school student – agreed to sell drugs for their gang. The same men took away three of his classmates, who have not been seen since. Ramírez reported the threat to authorities, who advised the family to leave. Terrified, they abandoned their house, clothes, toys, her hotel job and the children’s schooling and borrowed money to fly to Tijuana. On Tuesday, the family was 400th in the asylum queue – down from more than 1,000 12 days ago. ‘If we go back they will kill us all’ Ramírez, like most of women here, was unaware of the new curbs on victims of gang violence and domestic abuse announced last week by the US attorney general. Asylum is for people fleeing persecution because of their religion, political beliefs or membership in a social group, Jeff Sessions said, not those fleeing crime. Ramírez had come prepared with a police report, which she believed would persuade US immigration authorities to grant asylum. “I have proof, if we go back, they will take my son or kill us all, I’m trying to keep my family together … I’m seeking asylum, I wouldn’t enter illegally.
Before Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would end the practice, the number of children separated from their parents by his administration as part of its zero-tolerance tactic to deter migrants and asylum seekers was rising fast. Most of the families ripped apart are from Central America’s northern triangle – El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala – ranked the most dangerous region in the world outside an official war zone. Amnesty International has said the practice amounts to torture under international law. There is no coherent plan for reuniting the families. Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of homeland security, denied that families seeking asylum through legal entry points were being separated. But 14 of 17 asylum-seeking parents recently interviewed by Amnesty who were forcibly separated from their children had entered the US legally. Ramírez had heard rumours that Honduran children were being separated from their parents, but only those over the age of 14. Shown some of the images to emerge in recent days of children in cages, she started to cry and hugged her grandson close. “I won’t let that happen, I’ll turn back.” Some have heard nothing about the unfolding controversy. Laura Ruíz, 18, from Copan, Honduras was nursing her two-year-old son who could barely keep his eyes open. They arrived after a gruelling journey, and had not seen any news or heard anything about what has been going on a few miles across the border. They planned cross irregularly, with the baby’s father who was staying at the men’s shelter next door. “We’re so close, we have to try.” Many of the women interviewed by the Guardian remained hopeful, encouraged by stories of relatives and friends who in recent months and years were given a chance to claim asylum: exactly the “loophole”the Trump administration says it is seeking to close. ‘What would you do?’ Esther Castro, 21, was travelling with her tiny but boisterous two-year-old daughter, and could not stop crying due to a mix of exhaustion, desperation and piercing back pain that she does not have the money to treat. The single mother from Michoacán has been severely depressed since being raped when she was 17. A flurry of anonymous callers in the past few weeks threatened to rape her and her daughter. She was so scared, she packed a few things and left. “I’m going to tell them my story, just like I told you, and have faith in God that they will let us pass … If they try to take my daughter, I’ll turn back, I won’t let them.” According to experts consulted by the Guardian, it is unclear if turning back would be permitted, and would likely depend on nationality, point of entry and availability of detention facilities. In an average year, Madre Assunta hosts 1,200 women or children. But in the first five months of 2018, the number rocketed to 1,560. In a complete turnaround from last year, about 80% were Mexican, mostly from the embattled states of Guerrero and Michoacán where armed groups control everything from the drug markets to avocado farms. The others mostly come from Central America, a few from African countries including Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last year was Mexico’s most violent year on record with almost 30,000 murders. The murder rate is up 20% so far in 2018. Many at the border are willing to risk potential separation in the US over guaranteed violence at home. Mary Galvan, social worker at Madre Assunta, was horrified by the new US policy and angered by the Mexican government’s slow condemnation. “He [Trump] is the anti-Christ. But put yourself in these women’s shoes and imagine you had to choose between staying home and being killed, or crossing the border and risk your children being put into cages and treated savagely, but where there’s a tiny bit of hope. What would you do?” Names have been changed to protect the identity of people in this story",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/mexican-border-desperate-women-face-impossible-choice,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/mexican-border-desperate-women-face-impossible-choice
2018-06-20T17:26:59Z,world,World news,Italy's Salvini warns EU to 'defend its border' against migrants,"Italy’s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, is calling on the European Union to “defend its border” against migrants arriving from Africa, and suggested that Italy was ready to “renegotiate” its financial commitments to the bloc if more was not done to help Italy handle the migrant crisis. The bombastic former radio host, who has emerged as Italy’s de facto prime minister since the arrival of the new populist government, also pointed a finger of blame at “human traffickers and do-gooders” who he said were responsible for deaths on the Mediterranean. “The aim is to protect the external border, not to share the problem among European countries but to solve the problem at the source,” Salvini said. “If anyone in the EU thinks Italy should keep being a landing point and refugee camp, they have misunderstood.” The remarks came as Salvini’s hardline approach against migrants – he is also calling for the expulsion of non-Italian Roma, an ethnic minority – has won the blessing of his major coalition partner, Luigi Di Maio, the head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Di Maio said he agreed with Salvini’s stance that NGOs who save migrants ought to be denied entry into Italian ports, signalling a major and possibly permanent shift in Italian policy despite legal experts saying such blocks are a violation of humanitarian laws. “We save the migrants with our navy, with our coastguard, but the NGOs [should] go elsewhere,” Di Maio said. The populist government’s approach could mean thousands more lives lost on the Mediterranean, where migrants seeking to make their way to Europe are already facing treacherous conditions and widespread human rights abuses. But the Italian government suggested the wind was at its back and that its approach was winning favour in Europe. If the EU did not act, Salvini suggested that Italy was ready to take its own drastic measures. “The air in Europe is changing and we are optimistic,” Salvini said following a meeting with his Austrian counterpart, Herbet Kickl, and the Austria vice-chancellor, Heinz Christian Strache. “We are also extremely confident about the Austrian (EU) presidency and we trust in the good sense of our European colleagues, in part because we don’t want to have to renegotiate Italian financing to the European Union.” The issue is expected to be discussed by Salvini, Di Maio and Giuseppe Conte, the Italian prime minister, at a meeting on Wednesday. Salvini, who is traveling to Libya in the coming days, said Italy was preparing a proposal that would strengthen the EU border and curtain migration, but did not provide further details. Salvini last week decided – in what appeared to be a unilateral decision – to block the arrival of NGO ship the Aquarius, which had more than 600 migrants on board. The move forced the Aquarius to divert its route, and the migrants were sent to Valencia in Spain. “Spain has opened its ports, France did too. In Spain they celebrated, fine. But we could not celebrate every six hours,” Di Maio said. Data released by the OECD shows that Italy saw a 34% drop in the number of migrants arriving in 2017 to 119,000, due in large part to a controversial deal struck between the last Italian government and the Libyan coastguard. Under the terms of the deal, Italy has helped to train Libyans to stop migrants and return them to Libya, where they have faced detention and inhumane living conditions, including rape and torture. But despite the drop in arrivals, the populist government, which has in effect been led by Salvini since it came into power, has made the issue of migration and the expulsion of ethnic minorities a top priority. In his role as interior minister, Salvini has control over immigration, asylum and domestic security. Salvini also said 800 people had died trying to make their way to Italy so far, and that their deaths were the fault of smugglers and “do-gooders” – a possible reference to the NGOs who rescue migrants and who have been accused of encouraging migrants to make the dangerous journey across the sea.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/italys-salvini-warns-eu-to-defend-its-border-against-migrants,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/italys-salvini-warns-eu-to-defend-its-border-against-migrants
2018-06-20T17:00:46Z,world,World news,Britain's top EC commissioner lays out plan to tackle 'disinformation',"The UK’s most senior representative in the European commission has set out a Brussels plan to crack down on disinformation campaigns executed by Russia and non-state actors, which he suggests were deployed during the 2016 Brexit referendum. Sir Julian King, the commissioner for security in Brussels, warned in a speech that it has become too easy for those seeking to manipulate elections, democratic processes and institutions. The commission is proposing a series of measures to counter behavioural manipulation and fake news, including an obligation on internet platforms to demand greater transparency from those who use them to micro-target messages at individuals. Currently the social media tools, King said, “can easily be hijacked by malicious actors – both state and non-state – to subvert our democratic systems and use them as a weapon against us”. King told an audience in Brussels: “What once might have been dismissed as fantasy has rapidly entered the world of fact with everything from a referendum on an EU agreement with Ukraine, through a referendum on EU membership to a presidential election apparently being fair game.” The EU’s member states are soon to publish their plans to tackle the hacking of electoral systems and attempts to obtain voter data. However, the commission is seeking to win round member states’ efforts to tackle a “much more subtle and pernicious” attempt to undermine democracies, through the use of social media as a “weapon of mass disinformation – a WMD for the modern age”. King said: “In my view, this can take three forms: hacks and leaks designed to change public opinion by revealing damaging information at a crucial point during a campaign; the use of fake news to sway public opinion and influence results; and the misuse of targeted messaging based on psychometrics derived from mined user personality trait data – or Cambridge Analytica for short.” King said he wanted agreement “in the coming weeks” on a code of practice to ensure internet users were informed as to why certain messages or stories were being fed to them via Facebook or Twitter. The identity of those behind sponsored content should also be clearer. “Users should know who has created the content they are seeing, who might gain from it, and why it is being shown to them,” he said. The EU’s monitoring had catalogued “over 4,000 examples of disinformation, including for example 31 disinformation narratives around the chemical attack in Salisbury and 57 around the downing of flight MH17”, King added. “Thanks to this, we now have a better idea of the main tools, channels and messages of the Kremlin’s disinformation campaign,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/britains-top-eu-commissioner-lays-out-proposal-to-tackle-disinformation,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/britains-top-eu-commissioner-lays-out-proposal-to-tackle-disinformation
2018-06-20T14:34:47Z,world,World news,Dubbel-edged sword: Belgians drink less of their beer but exports rise,"Twice as much Belgian beer is being exported as consumed domestically, with drinkers increasingly turning their backs on one of Belgium’s most celebrated products. The average Belgian drinks about 240 250ml glasses of domestically produced beer a year, compared with about 440 such glasses in the mid-1980s. The volume of Belgian beer sold at home fell by 1.6% between 2016 and 2017. This came after a drop of 3.5% the year before, according to the annual report of the Belgian Brewers federation. But while Belgium experiences a 30-year decline in beer drinking, its exports are on the rise. Last year, overseas sales of Belgian beer grew by 8.7%, of which 17% was outside the EU. The US is the largest market, followed by France and the Netherlands. Exports to China grew by 8.3% year on year, while sales to South Korean consumers shot up by 66%. Belgian drinkers are increasingly demanding higher-quality drinks, turning away from pilsners, the report showed. Belgian Brewers said this “less but better” phenomenon had resulted in the number of breweries in Belgium growing from 224 to 261 in 2017, and 49,000 people being employed. Jean-Louis Van de Perre, the federation’s chairman, said: “In 2017, the consumption of beer in Belgium has fallen. This drop is due, among other things, to the difficult situation in the hotel and restaurant industry, and a shift in the consumption of pilsner beers to special beers. Beers continue to meet with great success abroad and have never been so popular.” Despite the turn away from lager, Pierre-Olivier Bergeron, the secretary-general of the Brewers of Europe, said he believed the market would soon lose its taste for the hoppier beers that have emerged from microbreweries. “My personal sense is that what I call the ‘hoppy era’ is fading away, because at some point, it’s the consumer that decides whether the product is drinkable or not. Not everything that is currently on the market is that palatable,” he said. The fall in beer consumption in Belgium is mirrored by other western countries, including the UK, where sales in 2017 were down 1.7% to their lowest point in two years, according to the British Beer and Pub Association. In the US, beer consumption dipped by 1.1%. The Belgian beer industry was rocked towards the end of last year by suggestions from the European commission that drinkers in the country had been paying over the odds for years. AB InBev, the world’s biggest brewing company, based in Leuven, was accused by Brussels of charging less for its Jupiler and Leffe beers in France and the Netherlands than in Belgium. After a year-long investigation, the commission further claimed there was evidence that AB InBev had been pursuing “a deliberate strategy” for at least eight years to prevent supermarkets and wholesalers from buying Jupiler and Leffe at lower prices in the Netherlands and France and importing them into Belgium. The company has declined to comment, beyond saying it is cooperating with the commission’s inquiry.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/belgian-beer-domestic-consumption-falls-exports-rise,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/belgian-beer-domestic-consumption-falls-exports-rise
2018-06-20T13:41:26Z,world,World news,"Briton killed in Syria after volunteering to fight Isis, inquest told","A British engineer was killed in Syria while trying to clear a house booby-trapped with bombs after volunteering to fight against Islamic State following the Manchester terrorist attack, an inquest heard. The coroner David Horsley ruled that Ollie Hall, 24, died on active service while serving with the Kurdistan People’s Protection Units (YPG) and paid tribute to his “outstanding example of courage and self-sacrifice”. An inquest in Portsmouth heard Hall was so angered by the Manchester bomb attack that he decided to join Kurdish fighters in Syria. The telecoms engineer left for Iraq via Germany on 18 August last year and met up with YPG, attending its training academy in Rojava, northern Syria, for five weeks before working to clear mines and explosives in Raqqa, where he died on 25 November. His mother, Jane Lyndon, said her son had not told her of his plans until he had arrived in the Middle East. She said that on the day he left, he gave her £20 to pay for a taxi to get home from work. “He said, ‘I love you Mum’ and I said ‘I love you’, and that was the last time I saw him,” she said. Describing him as having a strong personality, she said he was angered by terrorist attacks in the UK and Europe and his belief the government was not taking action. She said: “I knew he was mad about them but we had no idea he felt so strongly.” Lyndon, a nurse, said she had been told her son went into a house in Raqqa after an elderly man and his daughter had been concerned about booby-traps. Jonathon Duncan, a friend, said Hall had been planning to go to Syria for about six months and had given up smoking and drinking and got fit before leaving. He said recent terrorist attacks in the UK had inspired him to volunteer and added: “The one in Manchester was a bit too close to home.” Brett Lockyer, a pathologist, said Hall died of multiple trauma injuries likely to have been caused by two bombs. Horsley recorded a narrative verdict, saying Hall, who was from Portsmouth, died “on active service with Kurdish forces”, adding: “He gave his life to protect the safety of others.” The coroner continued: “He was someone who felt deeply about the world and its problems and resolved to do something about it himself to bring an end to terrorism and repression. So deep was his commitment that he gave up the secure and comfortable life in his family home. “His actions have made him a hero in the Kurdish community. He also should be an outstanding example of courage and self-sacrifice to whoever hears his story.” Outside court, his mother said she hoped others would not follow in his footsteps. She said: “We just want to say that we are so proud of Ollie. I wish he had never gone, but we are proud of what he did. We wouldn’t want other people to go out there. “From everyone I speak to out there, he was very popular and well-liked. One friend said he was not a soldier when he went out there but he became a soldier and then some.” Describing how she felt when he told her by text message that he had travelled to the Middle East, she said: “I was absolutely devastated, I just had this feeling that I am not going to see him again. “I couldn’t be mad with him, he was in Syria and I didn’t want to lose communication with him. Some days he would be messaging me from 4am to midnight. We will always be proud of him, we just wish he hadn’t gone.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/ollie-hall-briton-killed-syria-volunteering-to-fight-isis-inquest-told,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/ollie-hall-briton-killed-syria-volunteering-to-fight-isis-inquest-told
2018-06-20T12:58:13Z,world,World news,Top Catalan chef Joan Roca defends decision to host Spanish king,"The celebrated Catalan chef Joan Roca has dismissed suggestions that he is taking sides in the bitter battle over Catalonia’s independence by hiring out one of his venues for a prize-giving ceremony attended by King Felipe. Roca, whose three-Michelin starred restaurant, El Celler de Can Roca, has twice been named the best in the world, says he is being unfairly criticised for agreeing to host the Spanish monarch, who angered many Catalans by refusing to denounce the police violence that met last year’s illegal independence referendum. The Princess of Girona Foundation awards, which promote young people’s professional and personal development, were due to be given out at a ceremony held at Girona’s auditorium on 28 June. But after the city council said the venue was unavailable because of building works, the event was transferred to Roca’s Espai Mas Marroch, a 15th-century country house on the outskirts of Girona. News that one of Catalonia’s most lauded chefs was hosting the king did not go down well with some pro-independence campaigners. Lluc Salellas, a city councillor for the far-left Popular Unity Candidacy (Cup), published an open letter to Roca and his two brothers, urging them not to host the event. “Rethink allowing Felipe of Bourbon, who justified the violence against thousands of Catalans - including hundreds of people from Girona - into your house, the Mas Marroch, to preach his words in our region,” said the letter. Others have called for a boycott of El Celler de Can Roca, while a local branch of the Cup tweeted an upside-down picture of the Roca brothers next to the image of a burning photograph of the king, with a caption reading: “Don’t forget, don’t forgive!!!” Roca responded to his critics on Wednesday, telling them the decision had nothing to do with politics and had been taken only because the auditorium was not available. “We’re hurt,” he told the Catalan radio station RAC1. “What’s happening seems unfair to us. The only thing we want to say is that we do not have to do politics. We’re cooks. A restaurant is about hospitality. We do our job.” However, Salellas accused the Rocas of being disingenuous. “The Roca brothers have a standing and a public reach that means they can receive thanks and congratulations,” he told RAC1. “But it also means they can receive criticism from those who don’t agree with their decision. They’re taking sides: by accepting the king’s attendance, they’re making a decision. That’s legitimate and respectable and we’re not questioning it. But I don’t think it’s right to suggest this isn’t a political gesture.” Carles Puigdemont, who was sacked as Catalan president by the Spanish government for staging the referendum and unilaterally declaring independence last October, was born in Girona province. The deposed premier also served as mayor of Girona city. A spokesman for the city council said the auditorium and another venue were scheduled to undergo works at the time of the awards ceremony. But he said the mayor, Marta Madrenas, who is a member of Puigdemont’s Together for Catalonia party, opposed the foundation’s use of the auditorium in any case. “The mayor has suggested that the auditorium’s management should not host the foundation’s prizes in future years,” he said. “The reason is the speech the king gave on 3 October, for which Girona city council declared him persona non grata by a wide majority.” The local council in the nearby municipality of Caldes de Malavella said it would protest against the king’s visit by naming a square to commemorate the holding of the independence referendum. In a statement, it said: “The king is not welcome in Caldes de Malavella.

The prosecution has accepted the couple, named only as Joey D, 32, and Kimberley A, 33, who are also facing charges of drugs possession, distributed the cash out of generosity. However, the court in Ghent has heard from the prosecutor’s office that the money found in the house in the Flemish town of Assenede was not the couple’s to give away. The nine friends who received money are also being prosecuted.
The public prosecutor told the court: “They shared the money as well-wishers. But of course you cannot hand out money that is not yours. And the people who took the money should have known that Joey and Kimberley could not have come by such sums of money in a normal way.” A lawyer for Kimberley, Sofie Vermeir, told the court her client had hoped the money would change the course of her life. She said: “They wanted to buy a house, because they know all too well that such shelter is the start of a normal life.” The owner of the abandoned building is said to want the cash returned. Jesse van den Broeck, acting for Joey, said his client was an “honest finder” and should be allowed to keep the cash. “In the first hour procedural errors have already been made, so the investigation is void,” he said. “I ask that Joey get his money back and not be punished.” The couple’s windfall was only discovered after the property of a friend with whom they were staying was searched during a drugs raid. Officers found 1.5kg of speed (amphetamine) and more than 1,000 pills in the house, while Joey was found to have €50,000 in cash on him. The prosecutor’s office is seeking 18-month suspended prison sentences and fines of €6,000 each for the couple. The judge is expected to give his decision in two weeks.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/homeless-couple-who-shared-windfall-with-friends-on-trial-for-money-laundering,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/homeless-couple-who-shared-windfall-with-friends-on-trial-for-money-laundering
2018-06-20T12:02:00Z,world,World news,European leaders to attend emergency 'mini-summit' on migration,"The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, is convening an informal “mini-summit” on migration and asylum this Sunday that could determine the future of Germany’s coalition government.
In a tweet, Juncker said the “informal working meeting” was designed to “work with a group of heads of state or government of member states interested in finding European solutions” before next week’s European council summit. According to reports in German media, representatives of the governments of Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Austria and Bulgaria are expected attend the emergency gathering.
The meeting comes as debates around migration curbs and asylum rules are driving a wedge between the parties in Germany’s coalition government. Angela Merkel said on Wednesday that Germany stood by its obligation to protect people fleeing war and terrorism and its commitment to keeping Europe together. “However you cut it, migration is a European challenge perhaps our greatest challenge at the moment,” she said, after the UN refugee agency released figures showing that 68.5m people were forced to flee their homes in 2017, as a result of war, persecution or other violence. The German chancellor is under pressure from her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, who is threatening to turn away at the German border from 1 July any asylum seekers already registered in other EU countries, unless Merkel can find a multilateral solution to the dispute with Germany’s EU partners. “We are expecting German proposals for the solution of the refugee problem for us to comment on,” a senior Greek government official was quoted as saying in German newspaper Bild. “They will be presented at a gathering of the countries affected this weekend.” The political row in Berlin centres on how to treat people who have already registered an asylum claim in one country, but moved to Germany. This “secondary movements” issue affects Germany more than any other EU state, after 1.1m asylum seekers arrived in 2015. In a bid to tackle the issue, EU leaders will call for better implementation of existing rules to speed up returns to the EU country of arrival. The EU should “take all necessary internal legislative and administrative measures to counter such movements and to closely cooperate amongst each other to this end,” according to the draft conclusions of a summit declaration to be signed off by all EU leaders next week. Overnight, politicians of Seehofer’s Bavarian Christian Social Union, sister party to Merkel’s CDU, criticised Monday’s Franco-German pledge to create a joint eurozone budget. Markus Söder, Bavaria’s state premier, accused Merkel of trying to gain bilateral deals with EU member states in exchange for compromising Germany’s stance on financial burden-sharing in the eurozone. Merkel’s spokesperson, Steffen Seibert, on Wednesday rejected the accusation that the chancellor was using concessions on the eurozone budget to “buy” a solution to the migration conflict. Speaking at a press conference with Austria’s prime minister, Sebastian Kurz, on Wednesday afternoon, Söder called for a “turning point in our migration policy” and endorsed Kurz’s proposal for the creation of military “secure zones” for refugees in north Africa. Kurz said: “In Europe we face a choice. Either we return to internal borders, or we secure our external borders.” In another sign of the dominance of migration politics, Hungary’s parliament on Wednesday passed laws to criminalise any individual or group offering to help asylum claimants. The law would mean that anyone helping asylum seekers could face a year in prison. Known officially as the ‘Stop Soros’ law, it seeks to highlight the role of the billionaire philanthropist George Soros, who has become a target of Hungarian government anger, because he funds organisations to promote democracy and human rights in the country. The key amendment was passed by 159 to 5 votes, as the ruling Fidesz party picked up the support of the far-right Jobbik. Viktor Orbán, who was re-elected as prime minister in April after an anti-immigrant campaign, has said Soros encourages migration to Hungary. Hitting back, Soros has accused Orbán of waging an “unrelenting propaganda campaign” against him. Hungary has long taken an uncompromising stance on migration and has rejected EU proposals for taking quotas of refugees, to ease the burden on frontline states, Greece and Italy. Following this weekend’s summit, all 28 EU leaders will discuss migration at an EU summit on Thursday. A proposal to study the creation of refugee processing centres in North Africa is likely to win the backing of EU leaders, although the plan faces numerous political and legal obstacles. At the weekend summit EU leaders will pledge to “significantly intensify” work with the main transit countries for migrants, including Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Niger and Tunisia, according to draft conclusions. These countries could get more financial aid to protect their land borders and combat people smugglers. While this proposal is likely to be uncontroversial with the rest of the EU, another part will raise tensions with central European leaders, who are not expected at the weekend summit. According to the draft communique, Germany, France, Italy and other countries at the weekend summit, will make clear they are not backing down from a refugee “burden-sharing” scheme. The leaders will call for “swift completion” of a new EU asylum law, stalled for two years over the idea of compulsory refugee quotas, while reiterating the need for “an effective solidarity mechanism” - a shorthand for all member states to help deal with refugees in Europe.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/european-leaders-to-attend-emergency-mini-summit-on-migration,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/european-leaders-to-attend-emergency-mini-summit-on-migration
2018-06-20T10:00:38Z,world,World news,US migrant arrivals 'slow to a crawl' as cities feel force of Trump policy,"As attention focuses on the separation of families on the southern border, the Trump administration’s refugee policy is having a chilling effect on other parts of the US immigration system. The number of refugees admitted to the US in 2018 is likely to reach between 21,000-22,000, less than half of Donald Trump’s 45,000 stated target, largely as a result of bureaucratic inaction. “The president says he wants to bring in 45,000 refugees, but the behind the scenes the processing of those refugees has slowed to a crawl,” said Ruben Chandrasekar, executive director of International Rescue Committee in Baltimore. Federally-supported resettlement programs are now facing closure as refugee arrivals slow. The threshold to apply for federal funding is 100 refugee cases. Chandrasekar estimates the number of resettlement offices, which help people start a new life in the US, has fallen from 350 to around 250 since the travel ban.
IRC’s Baltimore office has itself seen a drop in $1m in federal assistance; despite increases in private donations, three IRC locations have been forced to close. “It’s death by a thousand paper cuts from an administration that our CEO David Miliband recently described as ‘malevolent and competent’. The resettlement system is being dismantled, and the government has already said not all nine resettlement agencies will be funded next year,” said Chandrasekar. A supreme court decision on Hawaii’s challenge to the Trump administration’s ban on travellers from predominantly Muslim nations – which could come as soon as Thursday – may not result in any significant change to the number of refugees coming to the US or the restoration of degraded US resettlement programs, whichever way the justices rule. Baltimore, which has long recognized the benefit of immigrant communities, is now faced with the knock-on effect of those reductions. “Communities like this have stopped receiving refugees and as result were being deprived of the energy they bring to cities like this that are trying to grow their populations,” Chandrasekar said. The focus on a sanctuary city like Baltimore coincides with UN World Refugee Day and the release of This is Home: A Refugee Story, a powerful, closely-observed documentary that follows Syrian refugees as they establish new lives in the city. New York-based film-maker Alexandra Shiva, who was in the city for a screening this week, said she was drawn to depict the struggle of refugees to establish themselves in a new country. “I wanted to show it through intimacy, and not do it through headlines or trying to make it overtly political.” Still, Shiva allows, the immigration debate is more emotional than other Trump administration policy efforts because “it is actually about de-humanizing people who are already in trouble”. Shiva came to the subject through the Princess Firyal of Jordan, whose country currently registers 650,000 of the 5.5 million Syrians who have fled the country since 2011. In addition, there are 3.3 million refugees in Turkey, 1 million in Lebanon ; another half a million Syrian refugees now reside in Europe. (Canada and the United States have taken in approximately 50,000 and 18,000, respectively.) Lamentably, the US accepted just 11 Syrians refugees in the first four months of 2018, compared to 15,479 in the last year of the Obama presidency and 3,024 in 2017. But that sharp reduction in number is affecting not only those still awaiting US resettlement; integration is one that benefits from force of numbers. The film is currently being screened around the country at IRC-organised or through religious outreach organisations and community centers. “We want to get it to wherever there are refugees so we can say this is happening in your neighborhood, and this what you can do to help,” says Shiva. “If this film can do that, and it provides opportunity to take action, that’s fantastic. I think people want to get involved. We were complacent in 2016 when I started the project, and now there’s more support as a result of the anti-Muslim sentiment in our political climate.” The effort to draw attention to the global plight of Syrian refugees received a boost earlier in the week when UN refugee agency special envoy Angelina Jolie visited the Domiz Camp, in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region of Iraq, which is home to 33,000 Syrian refugees. Jolie said funding received by the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) to help Syrian refugees has dropped by half since last year. “There are terrible human consequences. When there is even not the bare minimum of aid, refugee families cannot receive adequate medical treatment. Women and girls are left vulnerable to sexual violence, many children cannot go to school, and we squander the opportunity to invest in refugees,” she said. The latest UNHCR figures, published Tuesday, estimates that more than 68 million people were forced to flee their homes last year as a result of war, violence and other forms of persecution, up from 65.6 million in 2016. Last week, one of those featured in Shiva’s film, Madiha Alghothani, who dons a stare-and-stripes hijab after she became a target of racial abuse, told the Guardian that while she was happy to be in the US, she was still sad to be separated from her homeland. “I’m happy for my children, but maybe it’s more difficult for me. All my family are in Syria. But if they had the same opportunity, of course they’d come.” This is Home: A Refugee Story is released on Friday through Epix",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/us-migrant-arrivals-slow-to-a-crawl-as-cities-feel-force-of-trump-policy,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/us-migrant-arrivals-slow-to-a-crawl-as-cities-feel-force-of-trump-policy
2018-06-20T10:00:38Z,world,World news,Many of my childhood friends are dead. Is masculinity to blame?,"I grew up in Kamloops, a small blue-collar city in British Columbia about 350km north-east of Vancouver. Kamloops wasn’t the middle of nowhere, but at the time it felt pretty close. I moved there with my family when I was in grade five, and early on my fate felt sealed: I was a mediocre student, and not good enough at hockey to catch the eyes of the scouts. The city’s small-town feel was coupled with a sense of isolationism, and in high school my friends and I spent our nights crashing house parties, playing hockey, getting into fights, drinking and taking drugs. When we graduated high school, it felt like a vast open field – part economic wasteland, part basecamp at the foot of a daunting mountain. Some of us went to college, but it seemed the only way to make substantial money was to join the resource labour force. My career options seemed limited to a local mine, mill, warehouse or oilfield. But the world was also changing drastically before our eyes. The millennium came and went. Globalization and the internet transformed the economy, and the workforce. The old-fashioned lunchpail jobs that had once been available to boys like me dwindled: plants, factories, camps and rigs closed down. Many of the men I grew up with struggled mightily to adapt. In high school, I’d lost a few classmates to suicide. As time went on, more boys I grew up with starting dying – in overdoses, car accidents, workplace tragedies and more suicides. By the time I was 25, it felt like a quarter of the guys I knew were gone. Funeral notifications were commonplace on my Facebook feed.
I left Kamloops numerous times throughout my 20s, looking to reinvent myself and shed the vices I’d accumulated, and finally left the city for good in 2012 to chase a career in journalism and a new way of life in Vancouver. I abandoned many of my old friendships, as part of an effort to abandon that part of my past. But when I learned one day that my best friend from childhood had died, I found I could no longer ignore the seemingly endless tragedies of the Kamloops boys I’d grown up with who were now gone. I wanted to know what happened to these men I’d known, and why they died. So I went home to find out. *** The word Kamloops comes from the English translation of the local First Nations Shuswap saying Tk’emlúps, meaning “where the rivers meet”. The city was built as a major transportation hub in the late 1890s, with two major railways running through the heart of downtown like ventricular valves, carrying wheat, lumber and coal to the west coast. Our fathers were lunchpail baby boomers, rigid backbones of the postwar world. Nobody asked them about their feelings because they were too busy working. But by the time my generation sprouted up, there was a new cultural and societal landscape: less stable employment, more job competition – and none of the positive coping mechanisms to face the world.
This feeling of insecurity and claustrophobia had been felt by my friend Chad Ivancevich, who took his life in 2010 at the age of 27 after a vicious battle with drugs, alcohol and what appeared to be a bleak future filled with hard-labour jobs. I met with Greg Smith, 36, a classmate and friend of mine from that time, who still lives in Kamloops and now runs Pizza Pi in the downtown core. Smith played in a rock band with Chad. “I had an intervention with Chad, probably a year and a half prior to his death, with a friend from the band,” said Greg. “There was a lot of tears. He ended up smashing things. He was just so angry at that time of his life. He was just lost. But he was not going to stop: it was what he was going to do. He told us that he loved us, but he wasn’t going to change.” Greg said part of survivor’s guilt is thinking you could’ve done more for someone who constantly refuses help for mental health issues or drugs and alcohol abuse. “They’re telling you they can’t change, and they’re asking you to understand,” Greg said. “As we grow older, we realize that really is the definition of life: if you don’t change and realize your faults and address them, you’re going down a very specific road.” Chad had learned the traditional masculine characteristics of our fathers and other men in cities across rural Canada: ill-equipped to handle (let alone display) emotion, unable to properly cope with psychological stress, and prone to view any form of vulnerability as weakness. Stoicism and anger were the primary emotions: great when facing death or danger, but crippling in everyday life; excellent on the hockey rink, but useless for navigating the rest of the 21st century. A recent study published in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry titled Critical Issues in Men’s Mental Health outlines the “male depressive syndrome”. Diagnosis is tough. Men won’t report depression nearly as much as women, but they will lash out in anger, abuse drugs and alcohol, and take life-threatening risks. Most Canadian men, the study says, use “negative coping mechanisms” to deal with their problems, which invariably makes them worse and can lead to substance abuse, depression and ultimately suicide.
According to Statistics Canada, suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death for Canadian men aged 15 to 44. On average, across the country, 50 men a week take their own life, and the suicide rate is three times higher for men than women. Nor is it just suicide. In a recent mortality report, Statistics Canada summed up the death bombardment men face today. From overdoses, to workplace deaths (nine out of 10 in BC are men), to car accidents (Canadian men are almost three times more likely to die in one than women), the report concluded: “At every stage of their life cycle, males are more likely than females to die.” Greg said he has lost so many friends to suicide that he had come to expect it. “I get this thing now, when I get the phone call, where you can almost tell,” he said. “You’re ready for it, because you know it’s happened and could still happen.” **** I used to play soccer with a boy called Simon Douglass. We went to the same elementary and high school. He was a bright and talented kid, but had a lack of fear and misguided sense of invincibility. As the years went by, I watched Simon bounce from rehab to relapse, unable to break the cycle of addiction. He died of a drug overdose in 2013 at the age of 30. Over a coffee in Kamloops, Simon’s mom, Penny, said she knows now her son’s brain was hardwired for addiction, noting he also suffered from ADHD. “I remember he was staying with us one night and he was freaking out,” she recalls. “He said to me: ‘Mom, there isn’t five minutes that goes by that I don’t think about using cocaine.’” Penny helps out in the local community at the courthouse and organizes support groups for parents of kids with drug and alcohol addiction. Her eldest son, Andrew, 39, is currently living at home after getting out of jail. He is addicted to fentanyl and heroin. More than 1,420 people died of illicit drug overdoses last year in BC – a record high – and four out of every five of them were men. “You think you’re the only parent going through this, and there is an element of shame that comes in,” Penny said. “But it’s nice to know we’re not the only ones going through this.”
Jeff Conners, a Kamloops-based counsellor who focuses on men’s mental health, said men come into his office regularly with no roadmap for how to talk about their struggles. Job losses are huge triggers for depression and drug and alcohol abuse, and Jeff’s clients are weighed down with countless mental health issues and abusive dependencies. He said the important thing is to make sure the push to get guys to address their feelings isn’t cast as a war against the other sex. He noted 80% of men in Canada want to become fathers, and are at risk of passing on negative archetypes of masculinity down to their sons. “I’ve always seen this as an allied approach – we need to do this with women,” he said. “This isn’t men against women. One of the first things I did when I started focusing on men’s mental health issues is I went to the women’s resource centre and I said, ‘Look, I’m not against you. This isn’t ‘men’s rights’. I just want healthy men, and I want healthy kids and I want healthy communities.’” Connors’ suggested solution is simple: start more conversations. Force men’s mental health issues out from under the rocks and into the sunlight. Get guys talking – to each other, their spouses, friends and family, anyone. Let them know they only suffer in silence if they choose not to reach out. *** Once built on the shoulders of resource jobs, Kamloops is reinventing itself as a university town for international students and sports tourism destination as it creeps towards 95,000 residents. Culturally, it has grown immensely from the city I grew up in. An outcry recently forced the cancellation of a proposed copper-gold mine – a facility that would have created hundreds of local jobs, but would also have polluted the city’s air. One night I had beers with friends in a venue that is typical of the new Kamloops, a craft brewery downtown called Red Collar. Each of us around the table knew at least a dozen guys we’d lost over the years – to suicide, drug overdoses, workplace disasters and car accidents. The names came out like a roll call: Tim Frehlick, Darren Evans, Matt Hagan, Lance Richie, Adam Ayers, Bryn Taylor, Matt Dale. Two of the guys spoke about losing best friends in high school to suicide. Compiling the names of the deceased felt like a never-ending search, and we felt like surviving soldiers of some grim, randomized war. We agreed that leaving Kamloops, at least for a substantial portion of a guy’s life, was necessary – even life-saving. The city is now flourishing socially and economically, along with BC’s real estate boom, and a few of the boys have returned to different lives. But washing the dirt from our youth by escaping, even temporarily, felt like a crucial step. We also realised that all of us – living and deceased – had gone to the same now-defunct high school, John Peterson. The realization brought back the memory of my principal, Bob Cowden, who got to know every boy as they traversed the school’s hallways.
I tracked him down for the first time in 20 years. Cowden, who retired in 2007 after working at a number of schools across the city, said John Peterson can stand in for any high school in any rural Canadian town. “That is the real tragedy of all this,” he said. “Is that it could be anywhere here in town, or across the country.” Cowden said his son, who is the same age as me, left a high-paying first-aid job in Kamloops in his early 20s to travel the world, something he thinks is important for guys raised in small rural towns to ensure growth and reinvention. “I totally, absolutely believe in that. Because you have to step out and find your identity, you have to step out and find who you are. And you have to step out, shall we say, of your home, and begin to stand up for what you believe in.”
Still, it makes no sense in my mind that so many of my friends are gone and I’m still here. I feel lucky to be alive, to have a new career and a future. Before returning to Vancouver I said as much to Justin McMonagle, another close friend growing up, who moved to Calgary in 2003 to work as an electrician. Justin also lost another of his close friends, Matt Grybos, who died in a workplace accident in 2009 at the age of 26, and his brother Mike, who suffered from schizophrenia and was killed by a car while jogging in 2013 at the age of 35. Justin agreed that it does at times feel as if the surviving boys of Kamloops, or of many other rural Canadian cities, are just lucky. “We all went into the deep end at one point or another in our lives,” he said. “We’re just the guys who were able to swim out and build a life out of it.” In Canada, the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention has a list of crisis centre hotlines. In the US, the National SuicidePrevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

2018-06-20T05:46:03Z,world,World news,1MDB: Mahathir claims he has 'an almost perfect case' against former PM Najib,"Malaysia’s new prime minister has claimed that investigators have an “almost perfect case” against former leader Najib Razak, who will face charges of bribery, theft of government funds and embezzlement for his role in the 1MDB scandal. Mahathir Mohamad described on Wednesday how Najib’s signature was on all the 1MDB transaction documents. In an interview with Reuters, Mahathir said Najib was “totally responsible for 1MDB. Nothing can be done without his signature, and we have his signature on all the deals entered into by 1MDB. Therefore, he is responsible.”
Najib set up the 1MDB government fund in 2009 but it became entrenched in scandal in 2015 when it emerged that billions had been embezzled around the world, allegedly used by associates of Najib’s to fund spending sprees and yachts. Some $681m of the fund was alleged to have been transferred into Najib’s personal bank account and used to purchase jewellery for his wife Rosmah Mansor and pay their credit card bills. According to Tony Pua, a minister in the finance office, 1MDB’s debts and losses total $10bn.
While in office Najib fired those who tried to bring charges against him for 1MDB and then oversaw an investigation that cleared himself of all wrongdoing. During the election, the 1MDB chief executive officer Arul Kanda went on a campaign declaring that the fund was in good health. However, since the opposition won the May election, led by 92-year-old Mahathir, they made the renewed 1MDB investigation a key priority. Newly appointed finance minister Lim Guan Eng recently described 1MDB as the “worst corruption scandal ever in Malaysian history”. Responding to Mahathir’s comments, Najib told Reuters: “As far as I am concerned, I did not do anything that I thought was illegal.” Mahathir said he expected arrests in the next few months and said that a trial would “hopefully” be underway by the end of the year. There would be “no deal” for Najib. The charges Najib is likely to face in court are “embezzlement, stealing government money, losing government money and a number of other charges. Using government money to bribe. All those things,” said Mahathir, adding: “When we go to the courts, we will have clear evidence of the wrongdoing. We cannot afford to lose.” Also subject to investigation is Najib’s wife Rosmah, who was alleged to profit personally from embezzled 1MDB funds, bankrolling her expensive taste in clothes and jewellery. A recent raid on an apartment linked to Rosmah and Najib, as part of the 1MDB investigation, saw 274 Birkin handbags seized as well as 72 bags of cash, jewellery and gold bars, the value of which is still being calculated. However Mahathir acknowledged Rosmah’s alleged role was hard to prove. “Some of the money is believed to have gone to her, lots of money,” Mahathir said. “We know about this, but finding the paper trail is a bit more difficult in this case because she doesn’t sign any papers.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/1mdb-mahathir-claims-he-has-an-almost-perfect-case-against-former-pm-najib,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/1mdb-mahathir-claims-he-has-an-almost-perfect-case-against-former-pm-najib
2018-06-20T05:30:57Z,world,World news,Wednesday briefing: Trump quits UN human rights council,"Top story: Trump’s ‘disturbing’ human rights rebuff Hello – Warren Murray pointing you towards the big stories this morning. Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations has branded its human rights council a “cesspool of political bias” as she announced the US is resigning from the Geneva body. “When a so-called human rights council cannot bring itself to address the massive abuses in Venezuela and Iran, and it welcomes the Democratic Republic of Congo as a new member, the council ceases to be worthy of its name,” said Nikki Haley.
The Trump White House has criticised the council for targeting Israel while ignoring atrocities elsewhere. Haley argued the US had spent a year in pursuit of reforms while the council’s flaws deepened. Britain’s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, called the announcement “regrettable”, adding: “We’ve made no secret of the fact that the UK wants to see reform of the human rights council, but we are committed to working to strengthen the council from within.” The Democratic National Committee said: “Trump’s withdrawal is especially disturbing given his persistent praise for despots and dictators with abysmal human rights records, not to mention his administration’s cruel mistreatment of immigrant families seeking asylum.” Human Rights Watch said it typified the Trump administration’s “one-dimensional” human rights policy where “defending Israeli abuses from criticism takes precedence above all else”. * * * Quick catch-up – Does what it says on the tin … > The Brexit “meaningful vote” amendment is back in the Commons today, with both the government and its rebel MPs insisting they are not for turning. The head of GCHQ is warning that Europe’s safety depends on a security deal with the UK. > An inquiry into the deaths of hundreds of elderly people at Gosport War Memorial hospital is expected to report today that the blame lies not just with the doctor involved but also those who failed to monitor her and investigate, including the government. > The American military is reportedly preparing for North Korea to hand over the remains of soldiers missing since the Korean war. Trump said after his meeting with Kim Jong-un: “We’re getting the remains, and nobody thought that was possible.” > Canada’s parliament has legalised cannabis. The law has passed through the country’s Senate and is expected to be take effect within a few months. > Tennis star Boris Becker’s claim of diplomatic immunity against bankruptcy proceedings in London has been punctured by the Central African Republic, which says his official passport is a fake and he is not one of its envoys. * * * ‘Don’t you have kids Mr President?’ – An extraordinary bipartisan backlash continues against Donald Trump for separating immigrant children from their parents. The president has told Republicans in Congress that he is “1,000% behind” them on ending the practice but demanded they fix it by legislating immigration reforms. Emotions have run high on Capitol Hill: “Mr President, don’t you have kids? Don’t you have kids, Mr President?” the Democratic congressman Juan Vargas yelled as Trump walked past. Trump’s homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, was taunted as she ate at a Mexican restaurant, at a time when the administration is forcing families from Mexico apart. “If kids don’t eat in peace, you don’t eat in peace!” shouted one protester. * * * Alert after tube blast – An explosion at Southgate tube station in north London last night has been blamed on a battery short-circuit. Three people were treated at the scene for minor injuries and two more taken to hospital, said the ambulance service. One witness told how people fled after a “quick burst” of flames that was accompanied by a “very rapid whooshing sound”. Anti-terror police were notified but the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, later confirmed the incident was non-suspicious. * * * ‘Why do they need phones?’ – More schools across the UK should ban mobile phones, says the culture secretary, Matt Hancock. “I enthusiastically support using technology for teaching,” he writes in today’s Telegraph. “But we also need to teach children how to stay safe with technology. Why do young children need phones in schools?” Studies have shown that even having a phone on a table or in a bag affects a child’s learning, says Hancock, whose portfolio includes digital policy. Hancock told the Guardian: “I allow my children to do their homework online but I don’t let them on to social media … They don’t have phones. Why do they need phones? They’re children, they’re 11.” * * * ‘David Ricardo was talking tosh’ – This is great. Ordinary people teaching other ordinary people about “the most potent social science of them all”: economics. Aditya Chakrabortty sits in on the free class put together by the charity Economy, and delivered by volunteers, where topics normally seen as the preserve of bankers and professors are broken down in terms of people’s everyday lives. In the age of austerity and Brexit it could not be more timely. “That tearing sound you can hear,” Chakrabortty writes “is the veil that normally partitions economics from society and politics.” World Cup First up let’s get you started with our daily liveblog on the latest from Russia, followed by separate liveblogs for the day’s matches: Portugal v Morocco, Uruguay v Saudi Arabia and Iran v Spain. The first round is over and there is good news for those who subscribe to the theory that a successful tournament is one at which the host nation does well. As Russia posted their second win in two games, a 3-1 win over Mo Salah’s Egypt, the hosts effectively booked a place in the last 16. There were also wins for Senegal, 2-1 against Poland, and Japan with the same scoreline against 10-man Colombia.
So what have we learned from the first round of action? Here are 10 things we’re wiser to, including No 6: England have vim. They may, however, be without Dele Alli against Panama on Sunday – a game in which Raheem Sterling and his supporting cast must find their shooting boots – after the Tottenham player suffered a minor thigh strain in Monday’s victory over Tunisia. Get the podcast and email – Our World Cup podders are reluctant to talk about England today but not short on other topics of conversation, including the Japanese fans who cleaned up after themselves at the end of the game, prompting their Colombian counterparts to follow suit.

Lunchtime read: The migrants who died seeking a better life To mark this World Refugee Day, the Guardian is distributing the List – an accounting of the 34,361 migrants and refugees known to have died trying to find a new home within the borders of the EU. Compiled by the European anti-racism network United for Intercultural Action, the List is promulgated by the artist Banu Cennetoğlu who explains to our chief culture writer, Charlotte Higgins, why she has made it her personal mission.
The List only details reported deaths; many more go undocumented, taking place at sea, in the backs of trucks, in camps, at the hands of far-right hate groups, or when extreme despair results in suicide. We have taken a closer look at a handful of case studies, while the full list comes free with today’s print editions of the Guardian. You can also download the List as a PDF. Sport Eoin Morgan basked in his proudest day as England’s one-day captain and heralded the finest performance under his watch following an astonishing 242-run victory over Australia in which their own world record total was smashed to pieces. Andy Murray, the patron saint of lost causes, celebrated 342 days away from tennis by pushing the mercurial Nick Kyrgios all the way over three thrilling sets at Queen’s Club, but he remains cautious still about continuing his comeback at Wimbledon. England’s Mike Brown has hit back at the fan who abused him and Joe Marler following the second Test defeat in Bloemfontein. Research from Women in Sport has found 40% of women in the sports industry say they face discrimination because of their sex but 72% of their male colleagues say they see no inequality. And there were “no incidents of any significance” on the first day of Royal Ascot, where heightened security measures were in place to prevent any repeat of the drunken violence that marred a meeting at the same course in May. Business Chinese stocks have suffered another poor session amid concerns about escalating trade tension with the US. The Dow Jones industrial average went into the red for the year on Tuesday in response to the increasingly belligerent comments from both sides. And athough some Asian markets rallied overnight as investors sought bargains after recent price falls, the Shanghai Composite was down 0.6% in lunchtime trade as state media promised Beijing would “never run out of bullets” in any trade dispute. The FTSE 100 is set to rise 0.5%, according to futures trading, while the pound buys $1.315 and €1.136. The papers “GCHQ chief warns Europe of need for Brexit security deal,” says the Guardian, whereas the Times has: “Intelligence chief wades into Brexit security row”. In each case the story is about the head of GCHQ intervening in the Brexit debate.
The FT leads with “US-China trade face-off sparks global market jitters” while the Telegraph repeats a minister’s call to “Confiscate children’s phones at school gate”. The Mail has “NHS boss: Don’t go soft on cannabis”, in light of William Hague’s comments that cannabis should be legalised. The Mirror has a story about the breakdown of Ant McPartlin’s marriage, with “Ant’s wife ‘suspected months ago’”. The Sun gets two of its favourite topics on the front with: “Harry topples Meghan … Kane that is, as 3 Lions ratings thrash wedding”, about how viewing figures for the England vs Tunisia World Cup match exceeded those for the royal wedding. The Express says that due to the rising cost of living and poor returns on savings “23m face working until they drop”. Sign up

2018-06-20T05:01:31Z,world,World news,"Drowned, restrained, shot: how these migrants died for a better life","The Guardian is today publishing a list of 34,361 people who have lost their lives trying to get into Europe over the past 25 years. Many are just anonymous entries, but our reporters have investigated a few cases to put faces and stories to the victims. Rubel Ahmed Born: Bangladesh, 1988. Died: UK, 2014.
Rubel Ahmed only came to Britain out of curiosity, on a short-term working holiday visa. The oldest sibling from a poor family from Sylhet in Bangladesh, he felt keenly the responsibility on the firstborn to earn and provide for younger siblings. He started work as a chef. He was so good at his job that different restaurants asked him to work for them, promising to sponsor him. Rubel had started sending money home, to turn the family shack in Shangiray into a brick house. He decided to stay on. He applied for leave to remain in the UK. But this application was refused. He was detained under immigration powers on 21 July 2014 and taken to Morton Hall, the immigration removal centre in Lincolnshire that holds people subject to deportation orders. He was devastated when the Home Office informed him on 29 August that he would be removed to Bangladesh on 8 September. “When he was initially detained in Morton Hall he thought he would get bail and be released after a week or so,” said a cousin, Ajmal Ali. “But when the release didn’t happen I think he lost hope. He couldn’t understand why he was locked up and treated like a criminal when he had committed no crime.” Ahmed hanged himself in Morton Hall on 5 September 2014. He is one of more than 400 migrants and refugees on the List who have taken their own lives.
Both the inquest into Ahmed’s death and the investigation into it by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman were critical of procedures before his death. The coroner said that there had been inadequate communication between officials, and the inquest jury found that removal directions contributed to and caused him to hang himself. They came to an open conclusion about his death. Ahmed’s family expressed concern about the lock-in regime at the centre – detainees were locked in for most of the evening as well as overnight. Ahmed’s family said that if Ahmed had been able to speak to other detainees in the hours before he took his life his death may have been prevented. “Although his death happened a few years ago the impact on us, his family, of losing him, hasn’t really got any easier,” Ajmal Ali said. Alan Kurdi Born: Syria, 2012. Died: Turkey, 2015.
The vast majority of refugees and migrants who die in their quest to seek a new life in Europe do so in wretched anonymity. But occasionally there is a case that cuts through, shakes public opinion and even changes policy. Alan Kurdi was found on a Turkish beach three years ago. The image of the Syrian toddler lying face down in the surf sickened millions of Europeans, and prompted softer, more welcoming approaches to refugees in Germany, Britain and elsewhere. Kurdi was from Kobani, a border town in northern Syria that for months was the epicentre of fighting between Islamic State and Kurdish forces. Syria was already at war when he was born in 2012. The family lived in a single unheated room with a hole in the floor for a toilet. His father decided to move his wife and two children to Turkey, but subsequently decided to try to get to Canada, where Alan’s aunt Tima lives. The dinghy they travelled in to try to get from Bodrum to the Greek island of Kos quickly sank. It was built for eight people but there were 16 inside as it was launched for the short by dangerous passage from the Turkish coast to Kos. The lifejackets they were wearing were said to be either fake or ineffective. Alan’s brother, Galip, and mother, Rehanna, also drowned. Abdullah survived. He and Tima have since established the Galip and Alan Kurdi Foundation to help children whose lives have been ruined by war. Almost 10,000 people have died trying to get into Europe since Alan Kurdi died, according to the List. Turkish military policeman Mehmet Çıplak was the first person to find Alan’s body, and his voice still shakes when he remembers what happened next. “I checked for a signal of life, hoping he was still alive,” says Çıplak. “I was so sad. I am a father first. I have a six-year-old son. I empathised, I put him in my son’s place. There was an indefinable pain. Beyond being a military police officer, I behaved as a father.” Joy Gardner
Born: Jamaica, 1953. Died: UK, 1993. Joy Gardner was born in 1953 in Jamaica to a 15-year-old mother. She never knew her father. When she was seven, her mother moved to the UK to work. She would not follow her over until 1987, by which time she had a grown-up daughter of her own and was pregnant with her son. She had the boy, Graham, while in Britain and sought leave to remain to be with her mother, but was refused. Although her mother was British, rule changes meant her adult offspring had no right to remain. A team of police and immigration officers arrived at her north London flat without warning on 28 July 1993 with instructions to deport her and her son to Jamaica. She was bound, gagged and restrained with a body belt. She collapsed, fell into a coma and died of asphyxiation. Festus Okey
Born: Nigeria, 1982 Died: Turkey, 2007 When he left Nigeria in 2004, Festus Okey dreamed he would become a great footballer in Europe. “He was just a very cool guy,” said his brother, Tochukwu Ugo, who now lives in South Africa. “He was a very humble, cool guy. He wanted to go to London, and live a happy life.” Instead, Okey got as far as Turkey. In August 2007, Okey was arrested by police in Istanbul, and shot dead while he was being questioned inside a police station. In 2011, a Turkish policeman, Cengiz Yildiz, was sentenced to four years in jail for involuntary manslaughter, after saying that Okey’s death was an accident that occurred when the man tried to grab his gun. A murder conviction would have resulted in a life sentence. During the case, the court heard that there was an absence of security footage from the police station, and the shirt that Okey was wearing at the time of the shooting disappeared. Campaigners said that forensic analysis of the shirt would have clarified the distance between Okey and the police officer at the time of the shooting. There were also reportedly cameras in all the other interrogation rooms. Ugo, 42, says he has never understood what happened to his younger brother, who was arrested on drug charges. “A friend of Festus’s called me, and told me a little bit about what happened, but it still isn’t clear. He was shot, but I still don’t know why. They say he got into an argument with the police. “It was so painful, hearing that. At first, I didn’t believe, but they sent me photographs, and it was him. It was so sad. They said it happened in the police station, but I never understood why it would happen like that in a police station.” Ugo said that the family had faced serious challenges in Nigeria. “In Nigeria, the poor get poorer, and the rich get richer,” he said. “It was very hard for a long time.” As an asylum-seeker, Okey struggled to work in Turkey. “I know he was having problems in Istanbul,” said his brother. “But he wouldn’t tell me about it.” Alp Tekin Ocak, the family’s lawyer, said that the shooting had revealed serious problems within Turkey’s police forces. “The way the incident took place and the methods show us that those who have the authority to employ state’s monopoly of violence, have abused their authority. In this incident, there had been immense human rights violations, including violations of right to live, right to a fair trial and of prohibition of discrimination.” Ugo said that Okey had spent in time in Gabon before attempting to travel to the UK. Instead of travelling directly to London, Okey got a visa to Iran, before continuing to Turkey. “Before he set off, we spent lots of time talking, and hoping his journey went well,” said Ugo. “He had so many hopes, and I told him he was going to be great. I still can’t believe I am never going to see him again.” Semira Adamu
Born: Nigeria, 1978. Died: Belgium, 1998. Semira Adamu fled Nigeria to escape a forced marriage with a man three times her age back home. She was originally en route for Berlin, but when her plane stopped in Belgium she was forced to claim asylum there under so-called “safe third country” principles. Her asylum request was refused and a team of 11 policemen were sent to deport her on 22 September 1998. Amnesty reported at the time: “After being seated [on a Sabena aircraft] and bound hand and foot she began to sing loudly to attract the attention of fellow passengers. “When officers then pushed her face into a cushion placed on the knees of one of them and pressed down on her back, she began to struggle. Her face was pressed against the cushion for over 10 minutes and she fell into a coma as her brain became starved of oxygen.” Getu Hagos Born: Ethiopia. Died: Paris, 2003. Getu Hagos entered France in January 2003 claiming to be a Somali called Mariame. His asylum claim was denied, and five days after his arrival he was dragged back on to a plane at a Paris airport. Air crew heard screams as the 24-year-old asylum seeker was forced into his seat. By the time the screams stopped, the Ethiopian man was dying. In 2006, three police officers were charged with manslaughter over the 2003 death, with a court hearing that Hagos was forced into a “folding position” when he resisted the boarding process. Stéphane Maugendre, Hagos’s lawyer, said that the young Ethiopian’s death had been one of a series of assaults on people facing deportation at the time. “We knew that they were being forced on the planes, and we knew that there was violence, but we couldn’t prove it. These things were happening regularly, but there was nothing we could do.” The prosecutor found that two officials of the border police “were careless or clumsy,” with their actions leading to the death of Hagos. Maugendre said that he had found the hearing frustrating, but was relieved that it went ahead at all. “I wasn’t surprised when Hagos died, but I was surprised that the prosecutor let us go to court. My real regret is that we weren’t able to go for a more serious charge. But we were so relieved to be able to go to court, and at least we got that.” Maugendre said that Hagos had no family or friends in France, but that the Ethiopian community there had been very supportive of the case. “The local community really threw themselves into this battle, and that was very important,” he said. The court heard that Hagos had claimed to be ill in the waiting zone of Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport before being forced into an Air France plane to Johannesburg, South Africa. The officers said they believed Hagos was faking an illness. According to reports, Hagos was hobbled with Velcro at the knees and ankles, but continued to resist, with one police officer saying that the man preferred to “die rather than leave”. The “folding position” involved one police officer keeping Hagos bent over in his seat, with another officer keeping pressure up on Hagos’s handcuffs, which were behind his back. A third officer occasionally pushed down on his head. Hagos is believed to have been kept in this position for 20 minutes before suddenly going silent. According to medical evidence heard in court, the folded position resulted a lack of oxygenation. Hagos was in a coma for two days before dying. An autopsy found that he had suffered a “cardiorespiratory arrest”. The police officers said they had followed standard practice when someone attempted to resist deportation. They were all allowed to rejoin the border force.

2018-06-20T05:00:36Z,world,World news,"It's 34,361 and rising: how the List tallies Europe's migrant bodycount","The boat capsized in rough seas in March close to Italian territorial waters. A search and rescue operation fished bodies from the sea, dead and alive. Many of the ship’s passengers remained unaccounted for. No one knew quite how many. It’s a grimly familiar tale that sounds like one of the tragedies that occurred on Europe’s southern rim over the past couple of years. But in fact, the events described occurred in 1997. Some details of these depressing disasters have changed over the years – then, the victims were Albanians, and it was the Adriatic, not the Mediterranean, that was the death trap. But the similarities throw up a deeply uncomfortable truth: people have been dying while trying to get into Europe for more than 20 years. These stories, and thousands of others, have been collated by the Dutch NGO United for Intercultural Action (UNITED) over the years, in a document – the List – which the Guardian is publishing today, on World Refugee Day.
Faced with a lack of official data, the activist group has gathered newspaper articles, NGO records and coastguard reports to collect details of the deaths of migrants travelling to Europe since the early 1990s. The List is revealing: deaths do not just occur at sea, but in detention blocks, asylum units and town centres. Some 400 have taken their own lives; more than 600 have died violently at the hands of others.
Because the data is not comprehensive, as we don’t have records of every incident, the true death toll is certain to be much higher. “We have no way of knowing the actual number of deaths, but this does show there has been a gradual and very steady increase,” says Thomas Spijkerboer, professor of Migration Law at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. “The major significance of the List is in its signals. It shows that this has been ongoing for 25 years and the people who pretend to be shocked now should have been shocked a long time ago.”
The vast majority of migrants who have died trying to reach Europe have drowned. Volunteers have logged more than 27,000 deaths by drowning since 1993, often hundreds at a time when large ships capsize. These account for nearly 80% of all the entries. The list points up the marked increase in drownings that occurred after 2014, when the conflict in Syria accelerated, adding to numbers from south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2013, it reports more than 900 deaths by drowning. By 2017 that number had increased to around 3,500. A wave of public sympathy for the plight of refugees in Europe was quickly displaced by a backlash against the rising number of arrivals in 2015 and 2016, when almost three million people claimed asylum in Europe. The EU responded by trying to export the problem back to Africa, with a €2bn (£1.75bn) EU-Africa trust fund designed to encourage African countries to stop people making the journey to Europe. The figures show the impact of this policy shift: in 2014, there were around 1,700 deaths recorded in and off the coast of Africa ascribed to migrants trying to get to Europe; by 2017 this had almost doubled, while deaths in Europe halved over the same period. “Some would say there are fewer deaths in Europe, and the EU’s policy is working”, says Ann Singleton, an academic specialising in migration data at the University of Bristol. “But there’s so much that’s unknown. Deaths are less likely to be reported if they occur in remote areas of Africa, and the number of people are dying inland, or in Libyan detention camps, isn’t recorded. “If you look at maps, it looks as though the Mediterranean is the most dangerous area of the world for migrant journeys. But we can never say if that’s true, because we simply don’t know what’s happening elsewhere,” says Singleton. For those who get to Europe, the danger is not over. The List records more than 500 deaths in the asylum process, detention centres, prisons and camps. Among this group, the most common cause of death is suicide.
Some, such as Oumar Dansokho, killed themselves after failing to secure status in Europe. The 25-year-old from Guinea first began the process of claiming asylum in 2008, according to Belgian reports. He was finally denied in 2015, and set himself alight in the offices of the Belgian Asylum Agency. The UK is the only state in Europe that detains irregular migrants indefinitely, and there are more than 50 deaths recorded that occurred in British detention centres, prisons or privately run housing for asylum seekers. One is Manuel Bravo, who hanged himself in Yarl’s Wood detention centre, Bedfordshire, in 2005, the day before he and his son were due to be deported to Angola. He knew immigration officers could not deport his 13-year-old son, Antonio, without a parent. A note found in Mr Bravo’s room said: “I kill myself because I don’t have a life to live any more. I want my son Antonio to stay in the UK to continue his studies.” He died on his 35th birthday. Unlike other data sources tracking migrant deaths, the list also records those who died after they were deported from Europe. The three most recent entries are three Afghan men, Farhad, Aref Hassanzade, and an unnamed 16-year-old, all reportedly killed by the Taliban. Farhad and Aref are among the 700 people in the database who were violently killed. More than a hundred died after contact with European police, border guards or soldiers.
Compilers acknowledge that their data is incomplete. Bodies lie undocumented at the bottom of the Mediterranean; no one knows how many migrants have disappeared in the Sahara, which may even be as deadly as the sea for those who cross it. Tracking returnees is almost impossible, particularly if there is no will to do so. Some trials suggest big data could improve monitoring of deaths. A team of researchers at the UN Global Pulse project suggest predictive models, using historical maritime data to predict where future disasters might take place, could make search and rescue teams more effective. But this solution assumes there is the will to stop ships sinking in the first place. Singleton is sceptical about the promise of big data, and says we could better improve information by investing resources in more traditional methods.
“There are very good examples in Italy and Greece of projects using forensic data to identify bodies, collect data and trace the deceased’s family,” she said. “But forensic analysis is very expensive and time-consuming. It’s understandable that the priority among NGOs working with migrants is people who are alive, and identifying bodies may become a secondary consideration.” Singleton says the EU and its member states should do more to monitor deaths, rather than leaving the bulk of the work to NGOs and activists. “Where deaths are happening, we need the best possible coverage in order to hold authorities accountable.” Better reporting around migrant deaths is an important first step - but Singleton is clear that it’s not a solution. “Ultimately, we don’t want an industry collecting data, we want safe migration routes.” “In an ideal world, in a humane world, there’d be no data to collect at all.”
Methodology Volunteers and staff at United for Intercultural Action update the data annually, spending six months at a time verifying reports, categorising deaths and entering them into the database. They began collecting data in 1992, and the entries stretch back to 1989, but the first year with a significant number of records and the published list begins in 1993. When the project began, they received physical clippings from a network of groups around Europe. Now, the data is collected from email submissions and Google Alerts in a number of languages. “We thought that if someone read a story about one person’s death in a newspaper article, it wouldn’t seem like a big deal,” says Geert Ates, a founding member of the organisation. “But maybe if we collected them all together, we could make people care.“It was initially very difficult. In that first stage of the project, we kept pulling together clippings until we had a thousand names. We tried to go to the media, but there was little interest. Until 2010, it felt like we were working on this alone.” Ates points out the way the data is collected means it is necessarily incomplete. It relies heavily on media reports, and journalistic interest will be skewed towards a certain type of tragedy. The artist Banu Cennetoğlu has been collaborating with UNITED since 2002, working with the update that the Guardian has published. The total number of deaths should be treated with caution. There are thousands of deaths we don’t know about, and in a small number of cases there may be some double-counting in the List, where one incident is reported by multiple sources. It’s a useful starting point to begin looking at major trends, but it’s nowhere near an authoritative account. The List is being given away as part of a supplement with the 20 June print edition of the Guardian.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/the-list-europe-migrant-bodycount,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/the-list-europe-migrant-bodycount
2018-06-20T05:00:36Z,world,World news,Would you give up having children to save the planet? Meet the couples who have,"Gwynn Mackellen was 26 when she decided to get sterilised. It took the recycling consultant, who is based in California five years to find an appropriate doctor under the public health plan she was on, but she was determined. In 2012, she succeeded. “I always knew I didn’t want kids, for environmental reasons,” she says. “I work in the waste industry, and our waste is the downstream of people. It’s not people being bad; it’s just the effects of people.” Just as it’s not only bad people deforesting, she says: “The trees are being cut down on our behalf. Plastic waste is being dumped and minerals are being mined not because of bad people, but because of people. Having fewer of us, there will be less of those effects.” Mackellen identifies as an antinatalist, a philosophical movement based around the tenet that it’s cruel to bring sentient lives, doomed to suffering and to causing suffering, into the world. “Or at least I think our culture is very pro-natalist and it’s to our detriment. I would like to see us voluntarily reduce our population.” But cultural pressures, she says, drive people to have children by celebrating childbearing without acknowledging the consequences for themselves and the planet.
“My mum grew up thinking that getting married and having kids was what you did, but she raised my sister and me to not feel like those were our only options.” Her stance has posed no problems to her partner of 10 years, and many of those around her were congratulatory when she was sterilised. “I live in the liberal [San Francisco] Bay area,” she says, “and I’ve always been really vocal about this.” However, she can’t always discuss her concerns about human population with friends, which is why she is part of a community called the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, or VHEMT (pronounced vehement) for short. Despite the drastic-sounding title, the organisation welcomes those whose end goal isn’t necessarily human extinction, along with parents who have come around to the VHEMT perspective to some degree. The organisation’s literature is rational and often humorous in tone and, says Mackellen: “It’s nice to talk openly with people who have similar feelings and frustrations, like when I read the environmental news and think: wow, how could anybody produce a new human when the effects of humans are very obvious, I feel, and the situation is getting worse.” The UK-based organisation Population Matters wouldn’t call for human extinction – even in jest – but it does campaign against population growth which, it says, contributes to environmental degradation, resource depletion, poverty and inequality. To its list of influential patrons, which already includes David Attenborough, Chris Packham, Lionel Shriver and the primatologist Jane Goodall, it has recently added the racing driver and environmental activist Leilani Münter. She’s an eloquent positive-thinker. “Never underestimate a vegan hippy chick with a race car,” is how she describes herself online.
When people ask her if she has children, Münter, who is 44, has a prepared answer: “No, my husband and I are child-free by choice.” Saying child-free, she argues, doesn’t imply you are deprived, as the more standard “childless” might. And by letting them know it isn’t a sad topic to be avoided, she says, “it opens up the door for them to ask: ‘Oh, that’s interesting, why did you choose not to?’” Münter wants to move the awkward topic of overpopulation into the mainstream. “The more we talk about it, the more comfortable people will feel talking about it and then, maybe, things will change.” For too long, she feels, the issue has been swept under the rug. “We can talk about emissions and climate change, but talking about population gets such an emotional reaction.” However, Robin Maynard, the director of Population Matters, says he has noticed an upsurge in support, particularly among young people. “You can measure it in our online traffic – our Twitter followers are up by 60% from 2016 and a recent Facebook post on being child-free reached more than 4 million people. We are getting more and a wider range of people wanting to join us – and an increase in approaches from donors.” This, he says, “is underpinned by the growing body of scientists stating that humanity must address the issue of our numbers, as well as our consumption”. Münter hadn’t considered the implications of population size until she was in her early 20s. “I was studying biology at the University of California and came into a lecture that I assumed would be about biochemistry, but the professor showed us a documentary on population.” She says she was “blown away” by the numbers. “It took humans 200,000 years to get to our first billion people, then 126 years to double to 2 billion, 30 years to add another billion and 14 years for the next billion.” Each subsequent billion has only taken 12 years. “It’s pretty scary,” says Münter. We can embrace all the electric cars, renewable energy sources and plant-based foods we like, but, she believes, this can’t make up for overpopulation. Münter subscribes to one of the most conservative estimates of the Earth’s “carrying capacity” (how many humans the planet can sustainably support) by researchers at Cornell University in 1999. “Assuming that all humans are living in relative prosperity, with access to clean water and electricity, that number is 2bn, so we are already 5.6bn over that and rapidly adding people every day.”
The last thing she wants to do is make parents feel guilty, or to shut them out of the conversation. Procreation, after all, is natural. And if you have two children, you are only replacing their parents, rather than adding extras. But if you’re not yet a parent and can’t suppress your parental instincts, says Münter, “my ask is that you consider adopting one of the 153m orphan children that are already on the planet and need a home. Or, if you are dead set on having your own, my hope would be that you just have one and then if you want more, adopt.” Ultimately, she says, “your kids and your kid’s kids will be the ones who benefit from humans deciding to slow down our rate of growth. It will slow down climate change, ocean acidification, cutting down the wild places.” Writing in response to Münter’s new role with Population Matters, Jeremy Clarkson rolled out the parental platitude that his children “are the point of my existence”. This may be true in evolutionary terms – our prime biological function is to perpetuate our genes/continue the line – but whether it’s also emotionally/rationally/intellectually true for all parents is moot, and many would say it is a fallacy that life without offspring is necessarily less meaningful. Münter, an active aunt, argues that she has greater purpose and can make a bigger impact than she would if she were a mother. “I don’t feel like I’m missing out,” she says. “Through my activism, I get to talk at schools and universities, reaching thousands of kids. If I had my own children, I wouldn’t have time. I’m satisfied and fulfilled and don’t need to have a mini-me to pass on these ideas.” This view is shared by Emma Olif, a board member of Population Matters who lives off-grid in a caravan, travelling between rural England and Spain. “People have got very narrow-minded about what it means to be meaningful as a person,” she says. “We have so much opportunity these days to do important things and be pregnant with more than children. We can be pregnant with ideas and dreams and revolution.”
Having children, she says, “from a biological point of view, is probably one of the most selfish things you can do. You’re stealing resources from others in order to perpetuate your genes. I’ve got four siblings; my genes are fine. And the things I want to pass on are intellectual. I will have far more time to do that to a greater number of people if I don’t have children.” With a marine biology degree and a masters in biological diversity, Olif, 30, says she has never had a maternal drive, “because I’ve always been aware of everything that’s going on around me, economically, politically and environmentally,” she says. “The climate isn’t suitable for having kids at the moment.” The argument that many richer countries have falling birthrates doesn’t wash. “The impact of humanity on the environment in the west is significantly more, because we consume more.” She mentions a recent Swedish study that found that having one les child per family can save an average of 58.6 tonnes of carbon every year. The next biggest carbon saving you could make is by going car-free, saving a minuscule-by-comparison 2.4 tonnes.
Olif frequently gets told that she’s too young to decide not to breed, and that she’ll change her mind. But she is at the age her mother was when she had her. “And all my friends are having children. If they’re old enough to make the decision to have children, surely I’m old enough to make the decision not to.” One of the biggest hurdles for women, she acknowledges, is that they can decide they don’t want children, “but physically, their body is raging. We are biologically programmed to have kids.” Which is partly why, she says, “it’s seen as a bit weird not to have kids”. Alex Smith, a software developer in Suffolk, decided as a child not to create any new humans. His wife didn’t want children, either, but throughout their 15 years together, he says, “we’ve revisited it on a regular basis, checking we both still feel the same, and we’ve never changed our minds.” At 41, he’s in a child-free minority, as most of his friends have started families. “My impression is that having a family is just instinctive and natural and most people don’t think about the impact.” He would never tell anyone not to do it, but if the subject comes up in conversation, he’ll politely suggest considering having only one child. “We need to reverse this population [growth] and that’s certainly one way to do it.”
When Angela and Xavi Cortal, who live in the US near Portland, Oregon, met 12 years ago, Xavi didn’t want children, but Angela, a naturopathic doctor, was still undecided. “The narrative was the assumption: of course you’ll have kids, why wouldn’t you continue the family?” But after thinking long and hard, she decided instead “to be connected with family and society in other ways that are fulfilling … I think of myself as a very left-brain, analytical, logical person and when I sum up all the reasons to have, or not to have, a child, it just doesn’t make sense for me.” The pair talked about fostering and adoption, “but we decided to go with a rescue dog instead of a kid,” she says. At a summer fair in Portland seven years ago, she met the founder of VHEMT, Les Knight. She liked how he had condensed all the data about the environmental impact for each person, “acres of forest potentially preserved by each person not brought into the world … It’s very logical in a very tongue-in-cheek way and I don’t think there’s anything I disagree with.” A lot of the reasoning, she says, “might feel confrontational or unwelcome by people of other perspectives”, although the call for actual extinction, she feels is tongue-in-cheek. “I don’t necessarily hope all humans will die out – I hope we can change the use of resources and impact on the environment.” Xavi works for an accredited organic certifying agency and first decided to stay child-free in his 20s, influenced by a woman he was in a relationship with who didn’t want children. Once he considered the benefits – personal and wider – “everywhere I looked I found a new affirmation for my decision.” The social pressures for men, he says, are different but still present. “Men seem to have this machismo-based belief that their superior genes need to be carried forward … [but] I think that women have more societal pressure on them to reproduce.” He sees a “disappointing reluctance by men who say they don’t want kids to surgically make sure it doesn’t happen when a vasectomy is so much quicker and less invasive than making a woman undergo tubal ligation. Testes are not sacrosanct.” Xavi had a vasectomy at 26 and calls it “the best $500 I ever spent”. He readily admits that his motivations aren’t entirely selfless. “Child rearing is a miserable, thankless, expensive grind that I don’t see as necessary and that I don’t want to participate in. Of course, my mother loves me and I love her, but why would I want to repeat what I put my parents through? Guilt? Obligation? Duty? No thanks. I get to travel, save money, sleep in if I want to. I get to hang out with other people’s kids and then give them back when they’re rude. There’s really no downside.” While he believes the planet would fare better without humans, he says he cannot fathom human extinction. “This is the world I know. I do a lot of civic work and that has become my children. If I can better the world around me, that’s better than some snotty brat that’s going to tell me that I did a lousy job raising them.” Despite being a supporter of VHEMT, Angela wouldn’t call herself an antinatalist, because she associates it with negative feelings towards humankind. “I don’t, on a human level, resent people who have kids. That wouldn’t be constructive at all. Both my sisters have children.”
The term is also strongly associated with the writings of the philosopher David Benetar, the author of Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence. Mackellen, who does call herself an antinatalist, says her thinking leans his way. “He has thought about it a lot and has come to an acceptance that if creatures are born, they’re going to suffer, therefore let’s not make new ones. I tend to agree.” But she has mixed feelings. “I also work with people in the community and I really enjoy it. I have somewhat of a background in science and I love so many of the things we’ve accomplished. So I’m not completely anti-human, but I understand where he’s coming from.” It’s easy to wonder whether Benetar and many antinatalists are simply depressed. Mackellen disagrees: “It’s been challenging at times, but for the most part I’ve had a good life,” she says. “I’ve never been suicidal. I’d actually like to live a long time and be healthy for the rest of my life.” Her concerns for humans are mostly environmental, “what new people will experience with global warming and microplastics in our water. I think it would be unfair of me to create new people to have a worse life than mine.” She feels that the best way to reduce human suffering is to invest in the people we already have, with access to healthcare, living-wage jobs and better education, “especially for girls and women. And free and equitable access to contraception and more social pressure to not have kids or have fewer children.” Angela Cortal sees deciding whether to have children as “probably the most important decision that someone is going to make in their life, and their family, society or even religion should not be making a decision of that magnitude for them. It’s OK to think about it and come to your own decision.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/give-up-having-children-couples-save-planet-climate-crisis,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/give-up-having-children-couples-save-planet-climate-crisis
2018-06-20T05:00:35Z,world,World news,"Banu Cennetoğlu: 'As long as I have resources, I will make The List more visible'","The artist Banu Cennetoğlu can remember precisely the moment she was overwhelmed by the List, a catalogue, made by volunteers, of those who had died in their attempt to make a new life in Europe. It was 2002. She was based at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam, studying photography. Researching the architecture of border posts for a project, she stumbled across it on the website of United for Intercultural Action, a network of NGOs supporting migrants and refugees. Back then, it was a document of 15 pages and 6,000 names; now it has over 30,000. “I started to read, and that was it,” she says. It was the start of a relationship that still continues in all its original fervour. “I know,” she adds, “that as long as I have resources as an artist I will continue to make this list more visible.” Cennetoğlu, an intense, warm woman in her mid-40s, immediately realised that she wanted – needed – people to encounter the List, in all its terrible rawness and cumulative power. She printed it out and pressed it on to people she met, left copies in cafes, made stickers and stuck them on ATMs around the city. It didn’t seem enough. She liked the idea of hiring billboards – not enormous hoardings but the kind of eye-level, poster-size advertising sites that were dotted around Amsterdam. The question was where to get the money, though that seemed easy enough – the Netherlands, at the time, had plenty of money for artists. “But then there were five years of constant attempts and they all failed,” she says. The conversations with potential funders played out repetitively. “People would ask me, ‘Is it an artwork?’ I would reply that it wasn’t. And they would say, ‘Well, if it’s not art, we cannot give you the money.’”
Finally, in 2007, support came from a foundation in the US. She had already moved away from the Netherlands, back home to Istanbul, where she works as an artist and runs a non-profit organisation devoted to publishing and collecting artists’ books. There was funding enough to publish sections of the List on 150 poster sites, and to hold discussions and events at the Stedelijk Museum. The night before the posters went up, she says, she felt the world would change. She remembers hovering nonchalantly near the billboards in a park, waiting to see how people would react. “I got angry when I saw people walking by. I’d judge them. Or if a woman was going to her yoga class instead of coming to our talk. In the end I had to say to myself, ‘Banu, chill. The main thing is it’s out there in the world.’” Since then, the List has appeared in Greece, Bulgaria, the US, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Turkey and now the UK. It has been distributed in a variety of forms – poster campaigns in railway stations, printed in newspapers, emblazoned on hoardings. There is a particular power, she thinks, to the List presented as a physical object. “When you can hold it there’s a way to relate to it that’s better than an infinite scrolling experience. When there is a screen, you have somehow the power to isolate yourself.” As a printed document, there is the idea that someone might pick it up, or randomly come across it years from now. Or you might start to read it out loud, in all its appalling repetitiveness. “Because of politics, of course there are similarities in the way people die – through suicide in detention centres, or in boats.” But its power, she believes, is actually really in the way that it forces the reader to confront the fact that each of these deaths is singular. And that perhaps one’s own personal choices might be implicated in the complicated web of politics that causes these individual tragedies.
“I still think about why,” she says. “Why the List has been with me for the past 16 years and why I cannot stop, why I carry it with me.” It is even more inextricably entwined with the life of her young daughter, for whom there has never been a time before the List. There are two aspects to it, she thinks – the first is deep and instinctive and is entwined with its emotional force as a lament, an act of mourning. “The other side is very pragmatic. It’s a database, compiled by an NGO since 1993 and it’s done only by volunteer work – but it needs to be visible. Governments don’t keep these records for the public; they don’t want the public to see these records because it exposes their policies. So you have NGOs trying to put the data together, and that data is incomplete and fragile, but there again someone has to do it. And I want to contribute to that with what I have and what I do – but not by aestheticising it. You cannot represent this kind of darkness through art.” However, there is, as she acknowledges, a connection between the List and her own practice as an artist: her art has often taken the form of some kind of witness-bearing. For example, at last year’s Documenta, the major exhibition of contemporary art that takes place every five years in Kassel, Germany (and in 2017 also in Athens) she exhibited two works. One was based around a diary made by a Kurdish fighter in the 1990s. Another consisted of the words “being safe is scary” fixed to the neoclassical facade of Kassel’s Fridericianum, one of the oldest museums in Europe – a phrase she had seen graffitied on to a student-run refuge for migrants in Athens. The refugee crisis looms large, needless to say, in Istanbul . “When the Syrian war got worse and worse and millions started to come, and Europe paid [Turkish president Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan to close the doors, suddenly you started to see people and babies and families on the street. On such a level that I might have to step over a baby in the morning when I go to work – this in Taksim Square. This is a whole large situation in Turkey, not least of abuse of refugees in terms of labour and work. And in terms of everyday life, we all live together and we are melded to each other … For some, the people are guests. For some they are invaders. For some they are dirty beggars.”
The work that she has made for her new exhibition at London’s Chisenhale Gallery has an even closer connection to the List, she says. After years working to be a vehicle for marginalised voices, with all the problems and ethical questions that that involves, she found herself thinking, “‘Why do I keep trying to talk for others? Maybe it is moment for me to look inside myself.’” So the new work consists, very simply, of all the images she has collected from all her digital devices over the past dozen years. There is no editing and no selection; she has simply placed everything in chronological order. She has ended up with 128 hours’ worth of material, which will run in six-hour chunks at the Chisenhale over the course of the show – everything from intimate images of her family (her child was born and her mother died during the period) to photographs she was taking as part of her work, to PDFs, to silly pictures she was sent by friends and somehow didn’t delete. Though she calls it an “introspective”, a pun on the idea of the retrospective, it is also an act of looking outwards, rather than inwards at herself (at a literal level, there are very few selfies). You might think of it as a document of the world from a singular perspective. “The past 16 years has, I think, been quite a peculiar period, and not just for Turkey,” she points out – although major events she witnessed, such as the Gezi Park protests of 2013, are not especially prominent, simply because at certain times she preferred to experience a moment intensely rather than to document it, especially when surrounded by others with phones and cameras. She tells me that now that she has seen the work dozens of times (it was yet to be installed when I visited the gallery) she can detect not only the obvious fact of the linear passage of time – her child growing, the ageing and death of her mother, the arrival and departure of lovers – but also its circularity. Over the years she has been drawn back to similar scenes and places, and some images, or variations on them, recur time and again. She laughs, and tells me that at times it is “actually quite boring – all those school events”. Though boredom, I suspect, might be something to be grateful for. Banu Cennetoğlu is at Chisenhale Gallery, London, 29 June-26 August. The List will be presented at a public site in Liverpool for Liverpool Biennial 2018: Beautiful World, Where Are You? (14 July–28 October 2018) The List is being given away as part of a supplement with the 20 June print edition of the Guardian.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/banu-cennetoglu-interview-turkish-artist-the-list-europe-migrant-crisis,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/banu-cennetoglu-interview-turkish-artist-the-list-europe-migrant-crisis
2018-06-20T05:00:35Z,world,World news,EU rebuked for €36bn refugee pushback gambit,"The European Union is to increase its spending in Africa by more than 20% over the next seven years to a minimum of €36bn (£31bn) in an attempt to reduce the number of migrants and refugees crossing the Mediterranean. But a succession of reports funded by the EU or written by leading MEPs say European efforts to stem the flow is characterised by misdirected finances, lack of accountability and repeated breaches of basic human rights, including an inability to undermine the business model of human trafficking, an industry worth as much as £35bn a year. Special concern has been expressed that EU funds are being used to give bonuses to the Italian-trained Libyan coastguard to force boats back to Africa. The arrival of millions of refugees in Europe – and the deaths of thousands more attempting the crossing – has become the continent’s biggest policy headache, now threatening the stability of the German government and the cohesion of the EU. The biggest challenge is Libya, where deepening political chaos has led to more than 500,000 people crossing into Italy in recent years, hastening the election of a populist government in Rome that is now threatening to form an anti-migrant “axis of the willing” with like-minded central and eastern European countries. Politicians are scrambling for a new formula not just to distribute the people who have reached Europe but also to return those whose asylum claims are refused. The EU is also searching for a credible means to reduce the incentive for people to come to Europe. The fate of mainstream social democratic and centrist parties in next spring’s European elections may rest on the outcome. A detailed examination of EU efforts to tackle the issue finds a “mismatch between the grandiloquent declarations and the action actually implemented on the ground”. The study by the watchdog Eunpack, based on local interviews, reports a “troubling lack of monitoring and impact evaluation schemes across most of the EU crisis response initiatives in Libya”. It concludes: “The outsourcing of migration management to Libyan authorities and the dramatic increase in the number of people in custody in Libyan detention centres is fuelling a criminal economy of exploitation and traffic.” Similarly, a separate study of the EU’s €144m effort to build internal security in Niger and Mali, two countries bordering Libya, found little or slow progress. The report, published by the EU court of auditors this week, found a quarter of posts vacant, slow training of local security forces and no evidence of sustainability. “If you want to manage migration and if you want to prevent further security threats in particular terrorism, there is one single place where you have to invest all your political, economic and diplomatic efforts and that is the belt of the Sahel and the Horn of Africa,” said the EU’s foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, in an interview. “That is where all our challenges could be solved, or could deteriorate into something dangerous.” William Swing, the head of the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), has called for recognition that the deaths in the Mediterranean are a symptom of a profound shift. “ For three centuries Europe populated the world … and today, because of the demographics and the low birth rate, it has become a continent of destination: this is a psychological adjustment that has not been made.” Swing said the EU had to end the current chaotic migration, and in particular the trafficking model. Although the numbers reaching Europe by sea this year are likely to be the lowest since 2013, the risks being taken are just as deadly and the trafficking system is still endemic. Claude Moraes, a Labour MP for London, and one of the few parliamentarians to risk visiting Libya, inspected Tariq al-Siqqa detention centre camp near Tripoli in May and said the horror of what he saw still disturbed him. “There were women that were victims of multiple rapes. Others were just prostrate on the floor in filthy conditions, too traumatised to talk,” he said. He has called for the camps to be closed. His team’s report was critical of the Italian-trained Libyan coastguard, now tasked with stopping migrants and refugees heading out to sea. “It is objectionable that the EU continues to support the Libyan coastguard in any way. Other ways for the EU to assist in the management of the crisis in relation to migrants leaving have to be found,” it said. Moraes alleged many coastguard members operating in Libyan coastal waters were in league with or related to the traffickers. Swing said a solution was for migrants and refugees turned back by the coastguard to be processed by the UN immediately upon reaching shore, rather than being returned to camps where they may be subject to torture to extract more money from their families. The camps – even those run by the government or inspected occasionally by the IOM – just fuelled an economy built on smuggling. The EU’s inability to operate inside Libyan sovereign space what it can do to disrupt the smugglers. Few of the big gang leaders, instrumental in sending out more than 600 rubber boats in 2017 alone, venture outside Libyan waters themselves. The IOM has chalked up some successes. It claims to have taken 100,000 migrants home voluntarily from Europe, pulled 30,000 out of Libyan detention centres and 10,000 out of migratory paths towards Libya. Swing backed the idea of asylum processing centres being established in the migratory corridors bordering Libya, such as Niger and Chad. The idea was touted by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, a year ago, and Italy’s new prime minister, Guiseppe Conte, welcomed the revival of the idea when the two leaders met last week. The reality is that 90% of claimants would be rejected on the basis that they are economic migrants, and the danger is that third-country processing centres become detention centres, as in Australia. But the fact that the idea is back on the table a year after it was rejected by the previous Italian government shows how slowly the wheels of a divided EU and ill-equipped Sahel grind. Meanwhile, impatient voters turn to the populists and the lure of an instant solution. Macron knows more than anyone that striking deals concerning such a fragile state as Libya does not guarantee progress. A month after he persuaded the chief Libyan political actors at a meeting in Paris to work towards elections at the end of the year, the Libyan oil industry is once again a pawn in a political game, with Sidra and Ras Lanuf oil port terminals ablaze and seized by a set of militia excluded from the talks.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/eu-increases-africa-spending-as-studies-criticise-anti-migration-efforts,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/eu-increases-africa-spending-as-studies-criticise-anti-migration-efforts
2018-06-20T04:59:31Z,world,World news,"The List: the 34,361 men, women and children who perished trying to reach Europe","Today, on World Refugee Day, the Guardian is distributing a list of the 34,361 migrants and refugees known to have died attempting to find a new home within the borders of the European Union. It has been compiled by United for Intercultural Action, a European network of 550 anti-racist organisations in 48 countries. The List stretches back to 1993, when Kimpua Nsimba, a 24-year-old refugee from Zaire, was found hanged in a detention centre, five days after arriving in the UK. The List only details refugees whose deaths have been reported: the toll is almost certainly far higher than 34,361. As international media coverage of the refugee crisis has taught us, many more deaths go undocumented. Migrants are lost at sea, or die in the backs of trucks; they are killed in perilous conditions in camps, or by far-right hate groups; or the extreme stress of their situation leads them to take their own lives. Istanbul-based artist Banu Cennetoğlu, whose work explores the way knowledge is collated and distributed, and its subsequent effect on society, has worked with the List since 2002.
Among other places, she has put it on bus stops in Basel, Switzerland; billboards in Amsterdam; a wall in Los Angeles; advertising columns in Berlin; and a public screen on top of Istanbul’s Marmara Pera hotel. This is the first time the List has appeared as a supplement in an English-language newspaper; it is also available from today as a downloadable PDF on the Guardian’s website. The List is not an artwork in itself – the art lies in its dissemination. Cennetoğlu always ensures that the look of the list remains the same – a grid of data, showing the year, the name of the refugee, where he or she came from, the cause of the death and the source. The most recent version of the List was finished on 5 May 2018. Other material has been produced by Guardian journalists, using the List as a source, to report on how the shape of the refugee crisis has changed over the years. The List is a stark depiction of the scale of the refugee crisis and the human suffering it has caused over the past 25 years – misery that seems to have no end in sight. This edition of The List has been commissioned and produced by Chisenhale Gallery, London, and Liverpool Biennial in conjunction with Banu Cennetoğlu’s exhibition at Chisenhale Gallery (28 June-26 August) and as part of Liverpool Biennial of Contemporary Art (14 July-28 October).

2018-06-20T04:00:30Z,world,World news,Erdoğan has Turkey in his palm as key elections loom,"All along Istanbul’s boulevards, the face of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan looms large. For 16 years he has ruled over his country, victorious in election after election, vowing every time that Turkey is on the path to reclaiming its status as a great power in the Middle East and beyond. Turkey’s largest city is home to a variety of grandiose projects that channel this vision. In October, the government is scheduled to complete work on Istanbul’s third airport, which will serve 90 million passengers a year. A project to bypass the Bosphorus with new 28-mile (45km) waterway linking the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea – a project first proposed in the 16th century – will cost billions of dollars. Turkey is less than a week away from arguably its most important elections in modern history. The victor in the presidential race will assume an office with extraordinary powers, which were narrowly approved in a referendum last year, and rule until 2023 – the centennial of the republic’s founding from the ashes of the Ottoman empire.
Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development (AK) party faces the prospect of losing its majority in parliament, but the 64-year-old, who has sought to position himself as a leader of the Muslim world as well as his country, is predicted to retain the presidency. He remains Turkey’s most popular and powerful politician despite an unexpectedly dynamic opposition. “He’s a really great leader,” said Rumeysa Kadak, an AK parliamentary candidate likely to become the country’s youngest MP. “We can see that there is great pain in the world, and he is the leader to say the world is bigger than five [the permanent UN security council members], to say ‘stop’ to the world, and he’s the first person to say that.”
Independent polls suggest an easy victory in the first round, though without an outright majority, before more narrowly defeating a second-round challenger.
Muharrem İnce, a physics teacher and the main secularist opposition candidate, is most likely to make it into the final round with Erdoğan. His lively campaign has drawn thousands of people to rallies across the country. He has vowed to overturn restrictions on fundamental freedoms and restore the rule of law in Turkey.
Meral Akşener, the leader of a breakaway nationalist party, has energised young voters in her attempt to outflank Erdoğan from the right, while Selahattin Demirtaş, the charismatic Kurdish leader, is running a presidential campaign from his prison in Edirne. On Monday, he gave a groundbreaking televised speech from the jail calling on voters to reject one-person rule.
However Erdoğan, often classed by human rights campaigners as a strongman leader alongside Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orbán, is likely to be re-elected. “Great Turkey wants a powerful leader,” say his election posters. “There are two Turkeys I believe: one imagined Turkey, by western writers, and one real Turkey, here, and we are witnessing that Turkey,” said Fahrettin Altun, an expert at the Foundation for Economic, Political and Social Research, a thinktank with ties to the government. “Voters believe that a powerful Turkey can be obtained by Erdoğan’s leadership [and] they believe that Erdoğan is a symbol of mainstream Turkey. Erdoğan is the voice of Turkish society.” That last claim is arguable. In the last major vote – the referendum on presidential powers – Erdoğan won by a razor-thin margin amid allegations of fraud. Altun said, however, that opposition leaders’ attempts to imitate Erdoğan proved he offered a good representation of Turkish society. İnce has a populist veneer to his speeches and occasionally adopts crowd-pleasing, anti-western slogans, such as vowing to close the İncirlik airbase used by the US if Washington fails to extradite Fethullah Gülen, a Pennsylvania-based preacher accused of masterminding the 2016 coup attempt. Mimicking the president’s religious piety, both Akşener and İnce have emphasised that they are personally devout.
Erdoğan and the AK party’s promise to its voters has often rested on two pillars: economic growth and democratisation, which in effect has meant a greater voice for their once-beleaguered base. Supporters of the president admire his public piety, largely because it has allowed those who identify as devout Muslims to be part of mainstream society after decades of vilification by their secular countrymen and women. Under Erdoğan’s leadership, headscarves are allowed in parliament, universities and public buildings, a transformation that few of his supporters are likely to forget. “As a teenager in Ankara in the 1980s we couldn’t wear the headscarf at school,” said Ravza Kavakçi, an AK party MP. “So on the weekends or outside of school, if people didn’t insult me I would feel like I was invisible, I would worry that they could not see me. “But with the democratisation I was accepted as a human being. As a Muslim it didn’t matter what others said or did, I was accepted the way I was.” The economy, in the meantime, has suffered a few shocks. Youth unemployment remains high, and the value of the Turkish lira has plummeted against the dollar. But the strong leader image has left most voters convinced that only Erdoğan can fix what ails Turkey. Kiraz, a 55-year-old AK party voter, said she had little patience for opposition leaders claiming to be religious or wanting to save the country. She was sitting with friends in the courtyard of the Fatih mosque in Istanbul, named in honor of Mehmet the Conqueror, who wrested control of Constantinople from the Byzantines.

2018-06-20T00:11:32Z,world,World news,Canada becomes second country to legalise cannabis use,"Canada is to become the second country in the world to fully legalise marijuana, after the senate approved legislation paving the way for recreational cannabis to be legally bought and sold within the next two or three months. “We’ve just witnessed a very historic vote that ends 90 years of prohibition,” senator Tony Dean told reporters on Tuesday after the vote to pass the Cannabis Act. “It ends 90 years of needless criminalisation, it ends a prohibition model that inhibited and discouraged public health and community health in favour of just-say-no approaches that simply failed young people miserably.” The federal government has said it would give provinces and territories – which are responsible for deciding how recreational cannabis will be distributed and sold – eight to 12 weeks after the legislation is passed to get ready for sales, but the exact date that sales begin will be set by the federal government.
Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government introduced the legislation last year in a bid to make Canada the second country in the world to legalise cannabis, after Uruguay. Medical marijuana is already legal in Canada. On Tuesday, the prime minister welcomed the legislation being passed. “It’s been too easy for our kids to get marijuana - and for criminals to reap the profits,” he wrote on Twitter. “Today, we change that.” Initially, the government planned to begin retail sales by 1 July, but the timeline was delayed as the senate debated the legislation. Canada’s upper chamber voted 52 to 29 on Tuesday to make marijuana fully legal in the country. Some Conservative MPs and senators voiced their disappointment as the bill passed on Tuesday. “Sad day for Canada’s kids,” senator Linda Frum wrote on Twitter. Conservative senator Leo Housakos said: “When you normalise the use of marijuana and you’re a young person and you had certain reservations because of the simple fact that it was illegal, there’s, I believe, a propensity to have somebody be more inclined to use it.” Once legalisation goes into effect, Canadians will be able grow up to four plants in their own home and carry up to 30 grams of dried cannabis for personal use. Those caught with more than this amount, or who supply marijuana to minors will face penalties. Sales of cannabis – which analysts estimate could eventually be worth somewhere between C$5bn and C$7bn annually – will vary widely across the country. In Alberta, recreational cannabis will be available at more than 200 private retailers while in New Brunswick, the provincial government will operate a chain of stores called Cannabis NB. The minimum age of consumption will fluctuate between 18 or 19 years depending on the province. On Tuesday, supporters of the legislation stressed the cautious, prudent approach to the landmark change. “What the government’s approach has been is, yes, legalisation but also strict control,” said Peter Harder, the government’s representative in the Senate. “That does not in any way suggest that it’s now party time.”
The historic vote comes with its own set of challenges for the government; it has promised it will now explore the idea of clearing the criminal records of the hundreds of thousands of Canadians with past convictions for simple possession and will have to address the concerns of some Indigenous leaders who said they weren’t adequately consulted on the legislation. Canada’s softer approach to cannabis could also exacerbate the country’s already turbulent relationship with Donald Trump’s administration. While nine US states and the District of Columbia have legalised recreational marijuana, the White House has previously suggested that the Department of Justice will do more to enforce federal laws prohibiting recreational marijuana, raising concerns over how Canada’s approach will coexist with a potential US crackdown. Nearly 400,000 people a day cross the border between Canada and the US. Since 2016, Canada has been pushing the US to change a policy that bans Canadians who admit to having used marijuana from travelling to the United States.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/canada-legalises-cannabis-senate-vote,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/canada-legalises-cannabis-senate-vote
2018-06-19T22:39:19Z,world,World news,US quits UN human rights council – 'a cesspool of political bias',"The US is withdrawing from the United Nations human rights council, the Trump administration announced on Tuesday, calling it a “cesspool of political bias” that targets Israel in particular while ignoring atrocities in other countries.
The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said she had traveled to the council’s headquarters in Geneva a year ago to call for reforms, to no avail. “Regrettably it is now clear that our call for reform was not heeded,” Haley told reporters at the state department. “Human rights abusers continue to serve on, and be elected to, the council.” She added: “The world’s most inhumane regimes continue to escape scrutiny and the council continues politicising and scapegoating of countries with positive human rights records in an attempt to distract from the abusers in their ranks.” “For too long the human rights council has been a protector of human rights abusers and a cesspool of political bias.” The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, expressed regret about the US withdrawal. The organisation’s top human rights official, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein said in a tweet: “Given the state of human rights in today’s world, the US should be stepping up, not stepping back.” Haley argued the US had spent a year in pursuit of reforms while the council’s flaws deepened. She pointed to the election of the Democratic Republic of Congo to council membership in the past year, despite the US reform campaign, as proof that the body could not be fixed. She also noted the council had failed to hold a single session on Venezuela, which is a council member, or Iran, despite its ruthless crushing of opposition demonstrations. “When a so-called human rights council cannot bring itself to address the massive abuses in Venezuela and Iran, and it welcomes the Democratic Republic of Congo as a new member, the council ceases to be worthy of its name,” the ambassador said. Haley also pointed to the continued existence of “agenda item 7”, a permanent fixture on the schedule, exclusively devoted to the discussion of rights violations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said the US decision to leave was “regrettable”. Johnson, who had called on Monday for agenda item 7 to be reformed, said in a statement: “The United States’ decision to withdraw from the human rights council is regrettable. “We’ve made no secret of the fact that the UK wants to see reform of the human rights council, but we are committed to working to strengthen the council from within,” the foreign secretary added. However, Haley criticised countries that expressed concern about the council but remained members, suggesting those countries lacked courage. “Almost every country we met with agrees with us, in principle and behind closed doors, that the human rights council needs major dramatic, systemic changes. Yet no other country has had the courage to join our fight,” she said. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, appearing alongside Haley, said: “Too many commitments have gone unfulfilled. President Trump wants to move the ball forward. From day one he has called out institutions or countries who say one thing and do another, and that’s precisely the problem at the human rights council.” The Trump administration had been signalling its intention to leave the council for some months, but the announcement came while the US itself is under intense criticism for its own human rights, because of the administration’s policy of forcibly separating young children from their parents when apprehended on the Mexican border. “Trump’s withdrawal is especially disturbing given his persistent praise for despots and dictators with abysmal human rights records, not to mention his administration’s cruel mistreatment of immigrant families seeking asylum,” the Democratic National Committee said in a statement. Advocacy groups accused the US of withdrawing from its global obligations to protect human rights. “The Trump administration’s withdrawal is a sad reflection of its one-dimensional human rights policy: defending Israeli abuses from criticism takes precedence above all else,” Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, said. “The UN human rights council has played an important role in such countries as North Korea, Syria, Myanmar and South Sudan, but all Trump seems to care about is defending Israel. Like last time when the US government stepped away from the Council for similar reasons, other governments will have to redouble their efforts to ensure the Council addresses the world’s most serious human rights problems.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/us-quits-un-human-rights-council-cesspool-political-bias,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/us-quits-un-human-rights-council-cesspool-political-bias
2018-06-19T18:37:44Z,world,World news,Far-right Italy minister vows 'action' to expel thousands of Roma,"Matteo Salvini vowed to turn “words into action” in his drive to root out and expel thousands of nomadic Roma from Italy as he shrugged off critics who said the far-right interior minister was adopting illegal policies reminiscent of the country’s fascist past. Salvini, who has seen a jump in his approval ratings in the little under three weeks he has been in office, has called for a new census of Roma and for all non-Italian Roma to be expelled from the country.
He also praised on Twitter the demolition of an “illegal” house used by Roma in Turin - which had been ordered by a local council controlled by Salvini’s League party - even as he was condemned by rival politicians and a top Jewish leader. Salvini’s move against the Roma comes amid a hard line against migrants into Europe, which last week saw him to refuse to allow a ship carrying more than 600 people rescued from Mediterranean from docking in Italy, forcing it to divert to Spain. The EU was on Tuesday considering plans for migrant processing centres in north Africa as the continent is convulsed by a row over migration. Hungary, which has one of Europe’s most avowedly anti-migrant governments, on Tuesday announced it would levy a 25% tax on groups that support immigration. The developments in Italy have caused the first major rift between Salvini and his Five Star Movement coalition partner. Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the anti-establishment M5S, called Salvini’s order for the creation of a new Roma registry “unconstitutional”. A similar census pitched by the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was blocked by an Italian court. It was also lambasted by Noemi Di Segni, the president of Italy’s union of Jewish communities, who said the proposal recalled the fascist race laws of the late 1920s and 1930s. The former centre-left prime minister Paolo Gentiloni also tweeted his disgust, saying: “Yesterday the refugees, today the Roma, tomorrow guns for all.”
At first, Salvini seemed prepared to back down from his new policy but in a tweet on Tuesday afternoon he promised to stand by his call for mass expulsions. “I don’t quit and we’re moving forward,” he said in a tweet. He also pointed to a 2012 proposal by politicians in Milan, which included a call for a census of the Roma community in the city. That register, according to an article in Corriere della Sera, was part of a project to help families and children overcome “discrimination and the denial of dignity” and opposing “irregularity and illegality”. Salvini said such proposals were deemed good when they came from the left, but racist when they were proposed by him. “Italians and their security comes first,” he wrote.
The row is the first sign of a potentially serious split between Salvini and Di Maio, who has been overshadowed in the first weeks of government and appears eager to rein in the far-right leader. The two parties – Salvini’s League and Di Maio’s M5S – are both populist, but the League has tended to be much more outspoken about its xenophobic and racist attitudes towards migrants and non-Italians. Salvini’s intense focus on immigration and “foreigners” has collided with M5S’s priorities of economic fairness and labour policy. Even if M5S tries to wrestle the agenda from Salvini, polls show that Italians are backing the interior minister, who is now polling about equal to Di Maio, at 29%, in terms of popularity.
The Roma community has long been a target of Salvini, whose rise to prominence often involved press appearances at Roma camps, which he has frequently threatened to raze. Few minorities are treated with as much contempt in Italy as the Roma, who face prejudice and stereotypes that are deeply ingrained in the social consciousness. On Monday Salvini ordered the census and the removal of all non-Italian Roma – which he called an “answer to the Roma question” – and said he wanted to know “who, and how many” there were. “Unfortunately we will have to keep the Italian Roma because we can’t expel them,” Salvini said on Telelombardia. Salvini is on record as having praised Benito Mussolini, the Italian fascist leader, and his new policy has sparked comparisons by the centre-left Democratic party to ethnic cleansing rules introduced in the late 1920s that also targeted the Roma. “The interior minister does not seem to know that a census on the basis of ethnicity is not permitted by the law,” Carlo Stasolla, president of the Associazione 21 Luglio, which supports Roma rights, told the Ansa news agency. “We also recall that Italian Roma have been present in our country for at least half a century and sometimes they are ‘more Italian’ than many of our fellow citizens.” Francesco Palermo, a former senator in Italy and human rights expert who has defended the rights of Roma, said it would be legally impossible to pursue the creation of an ethnic-specific census and expulsions as Salvini described, because the issue had already been taken up by Italian courts in the past, where it was rejected. But he said the bigger problem was that the reaction to Salvini was generally positive, and that his popularity was growing despite the extreme nature of his positions. “It is very simple and very scary. Except for intellectuals and certain journalists, most people would say there is nothing wrong with this, and that is the tricky point. Salvini knows this. It is a just a means to get political support,” Palermo said. He added that reactions would be different if Salvini was targeting other groups of people who face discrimination, but that racist views about the Roma are “innate” among many people in Italy. Salvini’s actions were also denounced by Roberto Speranza, a lawmaker for the leftwing Freedom and Equality group, who said he had reported the interior minister for inciting racial hatred. “Enough is enough,” Speranza said. Up to 180,000 Roma live in Italy, about 43% of whom are Italian citizens. About 4,000 Roma live in state-sanctioned ghettos in Rome, according to a 2013 report by Amnesty International. These out-of-city ghettoes consist of pre-fabricated containers or mobile homes in fenced-off areas, often without adequate sanitation or clean drinking water. Inhabitants are excluded from other social housing despite many having lived in Italy for generations.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/italy-coalition-rift-roma-register-matteo-salvini,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/italy-coalition-rift-roma-register-matteo-salvini
2018-06-19T18:00:19Z,world,World news,'Pushing for civil war': fears riots could turn into widespread conflict in PNG,"Riots that erupted last week in Papua New Guinea could turn into a full-scale conflict, locals have said, as anger and chaos grip the Southern Highlands province. In the last week, protesters incensed by the failure of a court challenge relating to an election result have set fire to a commercial plane, government buildings and the home of the local governor, as well as ambushing two police cars. The protests escalated over the weekend as a group of 300 to 400 people, armed with machetes, machine guns and high-powered rifles, marched on Mendi, the capital of the Southern Highlands province, calling for the resignation of prime minister Peter O’Neill. So far there have been no deaths during the protests, but locals fear that the violence could escalate. “It’s very very tense. They are all armed, they’re even armed with military-issued weapons,” said Lucielle Paru, a local activist who was in Mendi last week. She said the protesters were so angry they seem to be “pushing for a civil war”. PNG is due to host the Apec summit in November of this year and O’Neill has been keen to reassure other world leaders of the security of the country ahead of the meeting. Justin Tkatchenko, the country’s minister for Apec, told local media last week’s unrest would not affect plans for the summit, which is due to be attended by Donald Trump and Malcolm Turnbull. The violence began on Thursday over the failure of a court challenge made by candidate Joseph Kobol over an election for governor held last year. Protesters supporting Kobol set fire to an aeroplane on the tarmac and were joined by between 100 and 200 men armed with sticks and guns who arrived from surrounding villages. They set fire to the national and district court buildings, the commerce and industry building and governor William Powi’s residence.
O’Neill, who hails from the Southern Highlands, announced a state of emergency the same day and brought in a curfew between 6pm and 6am. More than 100 soldiers have since have arrived in the province, but O’Neill is yet to visit. “It could blow up,” said Paru. “Those who are in Mendi are even suggesting to come down to the capital city, since the prime minister won’t come up to his own province.” “They’re not showing that they want to stand down. You even feel it here in the capital of Port Moresby, there are group factions now gathering to discuss this issue.” Martyn Namorong, a writer based in Port Moresby, who was in Mendi last year during the dispute over the election result, said the people in Mendi he had spoken to described the mood as “calm but tense”, though he added “there is a risk of civil war in which rival parties fight each other and against the security forces.” The United Nations evacuated their staff in the Southern Highlands to Mt Hagen on Thursday because of the violence and the International Committee of the Red Cross have suspended their operations in the area.
“It’s difficult to predict how this is going to evolve,” said Ahmad Hallak, the ICRC’s deputy head of mission for Papua New Guinea. “But what we usually see is that the situation escalates dramatically and then usually quietens down pretty quickly.” Though he warned that things could escalate if “things blow up again in the coming days and weeks ... the Highlands is quite unpredictable and it’s really impossible to know for sure.” On Tuesday morning, an armed group attacked an LNG pipeline construction site run by ExxonMobil in the neighbouring province of Hela, damaging earthmoving equipment and blocking the roads to the site. The attack on the Angore site - which is part of the country’s biggest resources project - is thought to be unrelated to the violence in Mendi, and instead to be related to land ownership complaints. In a press conference on Sunday, prime minister Peter O’Neill apologised to the country for the “distress” caused by the protests and pledged to work for “normalcy in the province”. However, Paru said this apology was “a show for the international community”, rather than a substantial action, given that many people in Mendi do not have access to television and so would not have seen it. Paru was angered that O’Neill was going ahead with a visit to Beijing this week to sign a trade deal. “He needs to go back home, he needs to get all the members of the Southern Highlands and get them to go back to their people,” she said. This article was amended on 20 June 2018. A previous version said prime minister Peter O’Neill had already flown to China. He is due to fly to Beijing later this week.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/pushing-for-civil-war-fears-riots-could-turn-into-widespread-conflict-in-png,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/pushing-for-civil-war-fears-riots-could-turn-into-widespread-conflict-in-png
2018-06-19T18:00:18Z,world,World news,Multinationals move $16bn from Australia to tax havens each year,"A landmark study has found multinational corporations are shifting roughly $16bn in profits out of Australia into tax havens every year. It has also found the steady decline in corporate tax rates globally since the 1980s has not been driven by countries competing harder for productive capital and pushing corporate tax rates down, despite what politicians say. • Sign up to receive the top stories every morning
Instead, it says corporate tax rates have been driven lower by multinational corporations shifting profits into tax havens, and governments’ failure to curb the practice. The finding undermines the argument that countries such as Australia are being forced to cut their tax rates because economic integration has made capital location more sensitive to differences in taxes. The Turnbull government has relied on such an argument when calling on the senate to support a cut in Australia’s corporate tax rate from 30% to 25%. It has said lower company taxes will encourage companies to invest in Australia which will boost productive capital and make workers more productive, helping to lift wages. But the new study shows that textbook model of tax competition doesn’t capture the behaviour of today’s largest multinational corporations. The study says countries with higher corporate tax rates give multinationals more incentive to shift profits overseas, and countries experience smaller revenue losses if they lower their tax rates. “Machines don’t move to low-tax places: paper profits do,” the paper says. “For wages to rise, productive capital needs to increase, which can happen fast if capital flows from abroad, much less so if paper profits – not productive capital – is what moves across countries. “By our estimates, close to 40% of multinational profits [were] artificially shifted to tax havens in 2015. This tax avoidance and the failure to curb it are the main reason why corporate tax rates are falling globally, not tax competition for productive capital.”
Overall, the study estimates more than $600bn in profits were shifted to low tax jurisdictions in 2015, with US multinationals being the main “shifters.” It found about half of all shifted profits accrue to US parent companies, while about 30% accrue to European parent companies. It has used new data to produce the first comprehensive map of where corporate profits are booked globally, showing the volume of profits being shifted out of OECD countries. “By our estimate, corporate tax avoidance by multinationals reduces the corporate tax revenue of the European Union by around 20%. For the world as a whole, that tax revenue loss is around 10%,” the paper says. It estimates in 2015, corporate tax avoidance by multinationals reduced the corporate tax revenue of Germany by 28%, France and Hungary by 21%, Spain and the United States by 14%, and Norway and Poland by 8%. Australia’s corporate tax revenue was reduced by about 7%, which equates to roughly $5.4bn in forgone revenue in 2017.
The study, called The Missing Profits of Nations, was written by economists from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Copenhagen, and published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. It says governments have been unable to stop profit-shifting in recent decades because they have lacked the incentive to do so. It says higher-tax countries, like Australia, have been more willing to focus their enforcement efforts on relocating profits booked by multinationals in other high-tax countries because the tax information has been easier to find, and cheaper and quicker to pursue. It says enforcement on tax havens has been neglected because it is has been harder (since little data exists), costlier (because multinationals spend large resources defending their shifting to low-tax locales), and lengthier (due to lack of cooperation between haven and non-haven countries). “Our analysis shows, consistent with theory, that the vast majority of high-tax countries’ enforcement efforts are directed at other high-tax countries,” the paper says. “In effect, non-haven countries steal revenue from each other while letting tax havens flourish.”
The paper highlights how the rise of multinational corporations such as Google, Apple, and Facebook have changed the global tax system. “These firms don’t seem to move much tangible capital to low-tax places – they don’t even have much tangible capital to start with. Instead, they avoid taxes by shifting accounting profits,” the paper says. “In 2016 for instance, Google Alphabet made $19.2bn in revenue in Bermuda, a small island in the Atlantic where it barely employs any workers nor owns any tangible assets, and where the corporate tax rate is 0%.
The Coalition government has gone some way to cracking down on corporate tax avoidance in recent years. It introduced the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL) in late 2015, increasing penalties for significant global entities that enter into tax avoidance and profit shifting schemes It also introduced the Diverted Profits Tax, which came into effect in mid-2017, in a bid to prevent the diversion of profits offshore through arrangements involving related parties.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/multinationals-move-16bn-from-australia-to-tax-havens-each-year,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/multinationals-move-16bn-from-australia-to-tax-havens-each-year
2018-06-19T18:00:18Z,world,World news,Coalition launches inquiry into sexual harassment over #MeToo revelations,"The Turnbull government will help fund a new national inquiry into sexual harassment in Australian workplaces to be spearheaded by the Australian Human Rights Commission, partly in response to shocking revelations from the #MeToo movement. The minister for women, Kelly O’Dwyer, was to confirm on Wednesday that the government would provide $500,000 towards the inquiry to be run by the sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins. • Sign up to receive the top stories every morning
The commission is now conducting the fourth national survey into workplace sexual harassment, with results expected in August. Jenkins said the early indications from that research suggested harassment rates in Australia had increased significantly since the last survey was conducted in 2012. “We need to continue working to create a society where this kind of conduct is unthinkable, and where sexual harassment at work is not something people simply have to put up with,” Jenkins says.
“I believe this national inquiry is a huge step in the right direction.” The government says more than 20% of Australians over the age of 15 have been sexually harassed, and 68% of that cohort were harassed in the workplace. O’Dwyer, characterising the new inquiry as a world first, said action was necessary. She said the inquiry would “consider the drivers of sexual harassment in the workplace, the use of technology and social media and the legal framework, as well existing practices to inform practical recommendations that will assist Australian workplaces deal with this sensitive and difficult issue”. O’Dwyer said unchecked sexual harassment, as well as being inappropriate, impacted on workplace productivity and participation. “We already know that the personal and career consequences of workplace sexual harassment are very significant. “The organisational impacts are also substantial, including reduced productivity, high staff turnover, absenteeism, compensation claims and early retirement. “The inquiry will draw on economic modelling so we will have a better sense of how much it is costing individual Australians as well as well as Australian businesses.” O’Dwyer said the case studies that had come to light as a consequence of the #MeToo movement have highlighted the prevalence of poor behaviour.
Jenkins said the commission would use the findings from the inquiry to identify the scale of the problem in Australia and examine incidences across a range of sectors. “We will examine the current Australian legal framework on sexual harassment, including a review of complaints made to state and territory anti-discrimination agencies,” the sex discrimination commissioner says. “In making our recommendations, we will consider the changing work environment and existing good practice being undertaken by employers to prevent and respond to workplace sexual harassment.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/coalition-launches-inquiry-into-sexual-harassment-over-metoo-revelations,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/coalition-launches-inquiry-into-sexual-harassment-over-metoo-revelations
2018-06-19T16:26:02Z,world,World news,Rogue beekeepers and dirty tricks blamed for rise in Belgian hive heists,"Dirty tricks by rival beekeepers have been blamed for a rise in hive thefts in Belgium after huge growth in interest in the hobby. Following the disappearance of 150,000 bees from hives near the Flemish town of Tessenderlo, keepers have been advised to keep a keen eye on their insects and alert the police to suspicious activity. Luc Aspeslagh, chair of the General Flemish Beekeepers Association, said he had received a growing number of reports of thefts from Belgian apiaries. Such was the difficulty and danger in stealing bees that the thieves were most likely to have come from within the beekeeping community, he said. Aspeslagh told De Standaard newspaper: “In recent years I have noticed an increase in the number of cases. Bees – and their value – are more of an interest nowadays. “A layman can at most steal the honey from a cabinet [holding a beehive]. Maybe a beekeeper does not have any bees after the winter and therefore he is looking for a quality new bee population. Or it is someone who wants to benefit from the potential yields of a hive. We also see that there is just jealousy in the game: beekeepers who will remove the better bees from someone else.” The thieves in the Tessenderlo case are believed to have had to use a trailer to carry away the hives, such was the size of the haul. Should they pot the honey and sell it at the market rate, it is estimated they could make as much as €1,000 from the crime. The bees’ keeper, named only as Patrick, said the remaining bees had reacted badly to the theft. “The thieves must have come with a trailer, because the beehives do not fit in the car and are too heavy to carry alone”, he said. “The remaining bees are traumatised and aggressive.” The bees had been the subject of monitoring by the University of Ghent as part of research on pollen, and the study will have to start afresh next year.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/rival-beekeepers-blamed-over-rise-in-hive-heists-in-belgium,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/rival-beekeepers-blamed-over-rise-in-hive-heists-in-belgium

He said the document’s serial number corresponded to one of a batch of passports stolen in 2014. AFP said the passport, of which it had seen a copy, was dated 19 March 2018 but had not been stamped or signed by the country’s foreign minister, Charles Armel Doubane. On Friday lawyers for the three-time Wimbledon champion informed the high court in London that he had been appointed as the CAR’s attaché to the EU on sporting, cultural and humanitarian affairs in April. They argued this gave him diplomatic immunity from bankruptcy proceedings under the Vienna convention. According to the German daily Die Welt, Doubane told journalists in Bangui that Becker was “not an official diplomat for the Central African Republic. To be recognised as a diplomat, it would require not just president’s nomination but also my signature as foreign minister.” Moroubama said the job Becker claimed to be doing for his nation – which, despite abundant natural resources including gold, diamonds and uranium, ranks bottom of the UN’s human development index – “does not exist”. Becker, who became the youngest male grand slam champion when he won Wimbledon as an unseeded player in 1985, was declared bankrupt in June last year over an undisclosed sum owed to the private bankers Arbuthnot Latham & Co. After his lawyers submitted the application for immunity, Becker said the decision to commence bankruptcy proceedings against him was “both unjustified and unjust” and he was asserting immunity “to bring this farce to an end so that I can start to rebuild my life”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/boris-beckers-diplomatic-passport-is-a-fake-says-car,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/boris-beckers-diplomatic-passport-is-a-fake-says-car
2018-06-19T14:46:15Z,world,World news,Saudi-backed Yemeni forces capture Hodeidah airport,"Saudi-backed Yemeni government forces have captured the airport at Hodeidah and have started preparations for the more complex task of capturing the city and its port nine miles (15km) to the north. The port is critical to the supply of aid to the rest of the famine-struck country. Confirmation that the airport on the southern outskirts of the city had been seized after three days of fighting came from both TV pictures and eyewitness accounts. At least 40 Houthi fighters who had held the airport were killed, but most retreated into the city, preparing to fight a potentially intense street-by-street campaign that could endanger tens of thousands of civilians.
The military advance came after the UN special envoy for Syria, Martin Griffiths, left the Yemeni capital, Sana’a, after failing to broker a ceasefire that would have seen the port taken under UN control. Griffiths provided a closed-door briefing to the UN security council by satellite link on Monday, but departed Sana’a without speaking to the press. The security council has been divided over whether to demand a ceasefire, and Russia, its current chair, gave a downbeat assessment of the chances for a diplomatic breakthrough after the meeting. Most western states oppose the Iranian-backed Houthi takeover of Yemen, but also assert a military solution to the civil war is not possible. Griffiths has expressed concern that a prolonged battle for the port could endanger aid supplies for the entire country. Hodeidah port acts as the distribution point for nearly 80% of the aid going across Yemen. The Saudi and UAE forces that are providing military support to the campaign by the Yemeni government led by Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi to win back control of the port insisted Houthi surrender had to be unconditional, rejecting proposals that the rebels remain in the city, but the port could be placed under UN control. The port is currently functioning. The UAE insists it has elaborate contingency aid plans in place if the battle for the port is either prolonged or leads to damage to its infrastructure, so interrupting the supply of food, water and fuel. But the International Rescue Committee said these assurances were little but “a publicity stunt meant to draw attention away from the undue suffering the attack is causing”. Amanda Catanzano, the aid agency’s policy director said: “The so-called relief plan announced by the Arab coalition in Yemen must be seen for exactly what it is; a justification to launch an attack that will have catastrophic consequences. The modalities for the delivery of this plan are vague, and the plan alone will not address the underlying causes of conflict in Hodeidah, nor the level of humanitarian need that will be created by a siege or attack on the port and the city itself. “Nobody following this war for the past three plus years can believe that the Saudi coalition has any intention of prioritising the wellbeing of Yemeni civilians. The Hadi government, backed by this coalition, has been in control in Aden and other areas in southern Yemen for three years, yet, innocent Yemeni civilians living in these areas continue to suffer from a total lack of basic healthcare and critical life-saving services.” According to the International Organisation for Migration, 76,000 people have been displaced across the 13 districts of the Hodeidah governorate since the Saudi-led advance began. The numbers that have left the city itself is put as low as 6,000, but many exit routes have been blocked.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/saudi-backed-yemeni-forces-capture-hodeidah-airport,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/saudi-backed-yemeni-forces-capture-hodeidah-airport
2018-06-19T14:05:00Z,world,World news,EU to consider plans for migrant processing centres in north Africa,"The EU is to consider the idea of building migrant processing centres in north Africa in an attempt to deter people from making life-threatening journeys to Europe across the Mediterranean, according to a leaked document. The European council of EU leaders “supports the development of the concept of regional disembarkation platforms”, according to the draft conclusions of an EU summit due to take place next week. The EU wants to look at the feasibility of setting up such centres in north Africa, where most migrant journeys to Europe begin. “Such platforms should provide for rapid processing to distinguish between economic migrants and those in need of international protection, and reduce the incentive to embark on perilous journeys,” says the document seen by the Guardian. Although the plan is winning influential support, it faces political and practical hurdles, with one expert saying it is not clear how the EU would get foreign countries to agree to be “vassal states”.
Migration is high on the agenda of the two-day summit, which opens on 28 June. EU leaders will attempt to reach a consensus on how to manage the thousands of refugees and migrants arriving each month. The German and French leaders, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, met near Berlin on Tuesday to agree on a common approach, amid fears in their camps that the European project is unravelling. Before the meeting France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Europe was “in a process of disintegration. We see states that are turning inward, trying to find national solutions to problems that require European solutions.” He called for “a new European project” on immigration, as well as economic and financial issues, “to consolidate Europe in a world where you have the United States on one side, China on the other and we are trapped in the middle”. At the end of the meeting, which was dominated by eurozone reform, Macron said the EU would “work with countries of origin and transit” to cut off illegal people-smuggling routes, and build “solidarity mechanisms, both externally and internally”. The EU border and coastguard agency Frontex would be expanded to become “a true European border police”. Merkel is under pressure from her hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, to come up with a European plan by the end of the month. Germany continues to receive more applications for asylum than any other EU member state. Seehofer wants German border guards to start turning people away if there is no EU-wide progress. It was not immediately clear how the EU document’s proposal for “regional disembarkation platforms” would work, or where they might be set up. Elizabeth Collett, the director of the Migration Policy Institute in Brussels, said it was a “watered-down version” of Austrian-Danish proposals that had called for arrivals in Europe to be sent back to their point of departure to have their claims processed. “What has clearly changed is the level of political backing for this,” she said. The plan prompted questions about how it would work and the cost involved, she said. “It looks great on paper, but can you get countries to sign up from outside Europe and basically be vassal states?” The other big problem was ensuring the centres met EU standards, she said. “The conditions, the processing, all of the things that require a high degree of knowledge and are quite hard to manage within the EU, these are big questions.” The plan, however, appears to be helping unite EU countries that are deeply divided on migration. Italy and France support the idea of asylum centres outside EU territory, an idea that helped defuse diplomatic tensions after the two countries clashed when the new populist government in Rome refused to allow the docking of a ship carrying 630 migrants. Macron, who has previously raised the idea, proposed it when he met the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, last week. The EU struck a deal with Turkey in 2016 that drastically reduced migrant flows, but the bloc has found it harder to work with north African governments, especially Libya, from where most sea crossings begin. The European commission has rejected a Turkey-style deal with Libya because of instability in the country. But Italy’s previous government struck deals with Libyan militia and tribes and helped relaunch the Libyan coastguard. These actions contributed to a sharp reduction in the number of people crossing the central Mediterranean, but critics reported an increase in human rights violations. According to the draft document, the EU would like to set up the centres in collaboration with the UN refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration, a UN-related body that has previously criticised the paucity of legal routes for African migrants to travel to Europe. Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU migration commissioner, is expected to spell out details of the disembarkation centres later this week.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/eu-migrant-processing-centres-north-africa-refugees,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/eu-migrant-processing-centres-north-africa-refugees
2018-06-19T13:28:30Z,world,World news,Kim Jong-un meets Xi Jinping for third time,"One week after holding a summit with the US president, Donald Trump, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, his third visit since March. On Tuesday, the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV showed Kim and Xi holding talks at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, usually used for formal state visits. Analysts believe Kim is in China to brief Xi on the summit, seek economic assistance, as well as pay deference to Beijing, which is eager to emphasise its role in talks between North Korea, the US, and South Korea. “We hope this visit can help to further deepen China-North Korea relations, strengthen strategic communication between both countries on important issues and promote regional peace and stability,” spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular briefing. Kim’s visit comes after a historic summit in Singapore where he and Trump signed a joint declaration pursue complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. In exchange for that pledge, the US has cancelled military exercises with South Korea, something Beijing had previously floated and known as the “freeze for freeze” initiative. Kim is expected to ask Xi for help in easing international sanctions. China is North Korea’s largest trading partner, but international sanctions have crippled North Korea’s economy and drained the country’s foreign currency reserves. After the summit, China suggested international sanctions on Pyongyang could be lifted. “I think Kim seeks sanctions relief and wants to ensure he has Chinese support as North Korea prepares to discuss details of negotiations with the US aimed at denuclearisation, security assurances, and other issues,” said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Xi undoubtedly wants to get a readout of the summit with Trump from Kim.” The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said in a press briefing last week that China had committed to keeping sanctions until Pyongyang had achieved complete denuclearisation. On Tuesday, Geng said sanctions were not “a goal in themselves”. “It is not in the interest of [Beijing] to have an unstable nuclear state at its doorstep, neither is it favourable for it to have US military presence at its borders,” said Anwita Basu, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. “A diplomatically negotiated settlement with the main parties involved in the region would satisfy China’s desire to maintain stability in its immediate neighbourhood and prevent the increased militarisation of the region.” On Tuesday, Chinese state media broke with precedent and announced Kim’s two-day visit. Previous visits by North Korean leaders have been shrouded in secrecy and confirmed only after their departure. Security was heightened along Beijing’s Changan avenue as well as the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, where Kim and his wife stayed in March. Kim brought his wife and the two attended a performance as well as a banquet, according to CCTV. On Sunday, Chinese state media reported Kim had sent Xi a congratulatory letter and a floral basket for his birthday.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/kim-jong-un-meets-xi-jinping-for-third-time,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/kim-jong-un-meets-xi-jinping-for-third-time
2018-06-19T10:56:40Z,world,World news,Nato chief warns over future of transatlantic relationship,"The head of Nato has warned that the deep divisions between the US under Donald Trump and its European allies are not going away and there is no certainty that the transatlantic relationship and its military alliance will survive. Against a backdrop of Trump’s open baiting of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, over immigration and her domestic difficulties, Jens Stoltenberg has called for all Nato members to work to avoid a disastrous breakdown in western unity. Writing in the Guardian, Nato’s secretary general admits that “political storm clouds” are putting a strain on the ties that bind the Nato allies. But, in an appeal to leaders before the military alliance’s summit in July, the former prime minister of Norway says that “where differences persist, we must limit any negative impact on our security cooperation”. Stoltenberg – who is meeting Theresa May in Downing Street on Thursday as he prepares for the summit in Brussels – writes: “Since the alliance was created almost 70 years ago, the people of Europe and North America have enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity. But, at the political level, the ties which bind us are under strain. “There are real differences between the United States and other allies over issues such as trade, climate change and the Iran nuclear agreement. “These disagreements are real and they won’t disappear overnight. In fact, nowhere is it written in stone that the transatlantic bond will always thrive. That doesn’t, however, mean that its breakdown is inevitable. We can maintain it, and all the mutual benefits we derive from it.” Stoltenberg’s intervention comes at a point of extreme tension among the leadership of the western powers. In seeking to defend his administration’s policy of separating children from their parents at the country’s border, Trump launched an extraordinary attack on Merkel and the EU on Tuesday, likening Europe to a “migrant camp” while claiming that “the people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition”. Merkel is embroiled in a tense standoff with her interior minister over immigration. She faces a two-week deadline to find a European solution or risk the collapse of her governing coalition. Trump has already caused a fracture in relations with traditional US allies by reneging on his country’s commitments in both the Paris climate change agreement and the nuclear deal with Iran. He is also threatening a transatlantic trade war with the EU, and has criticised Germany and others for not spending enough on defence and freeloading off the US. Of the 29 Nato members, only eight, including the US and the UK, spend more than 2% of their GDP on defence, a threshold that the alliance agreed should be met by all the countries by 2024. Germany spent €37bn (£32.5bn), or 1.2% of GDP, on defence last year. Asked for his position last month on those countries underspending, Trump warned: “They’ll be dealt with.” Greater “burden sharing” is set to be a theme of the Nato summit in Brussels, along with Stoltenberg’s desire to improve the readiness of Nato forces to deploy in quick order, and to build on the alliance’s counter-terrorism efforts, including through the training of the Iraqi military and an extension of financing for Afghan forces until 2024. However, as with the last summit, it is likely that it will be Trump’s determination to highlight the heavy burden on the US taxpayer that will dominate. Stoltenberg praises the US under Trump for its renewed commitment to Nato, an organisation that the US president once described as obsolete. But he points out that cuts in defence spending among the Nato allies have been reversed across the board. An extra $18bn (£13.6bn) has been spent by non-US Nato allies on military equipment alone since 2014. Stoltenberg writes: “The United States and Canada are stepping up their commitment to Europe’s security. In fact, since coming to office, the Trump administration has increased funding for the US presence in Europe by 40%. The last US battle tank left Europe in 2013 but now they’re back in the form of a whole new US armoured brigade. “This isn’t a one-way street. European allies, with the UK in the vanguard, are stepping up too – spending billions more on defence and taking responsibility for Euro-Atlantic security alongside their North American allies.” Stoltenberg, who will meet the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, on Wednesday before meeting the prime minister and giving a speech at Lancaster House on Thursday, says the US and its allies need to raise their heads from the current divisions and recognise the need for unity at a dangerous point in world history. He writes: “It is – and has always been – in our fundamental interest to stand together on defence. And that is as true now as ever. Because we face the most unpredictable security environment in a generation: international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, cyber-attacks – and, of course, a Russia which has used force against its neighbours, which tries to meddle in our domestic affairs, and which seems to have no qualms about using military-grade nerve agents on our streets. “Our achievements side-by-side are unprecedented. So as long as we stand together, even if the road does indeed get rough, it will always lead in the right direction: peace and security for our nations and our nearly 1 billion citizens.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/transatlantic-relationship-at-risk-says-nato-chief,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/transatlantic-relationship-at-risk-says-nato-chief
2018-06-19T10:00:09Z,world,World news,"Justin Trudeau promised to protect indigenous rights. He lied, again | Khelsilem","The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project is no ordinary pipeline. This project, which the government of Canada has just decided to nationalise, will travel more than 1,000km from northern Alberta through unspoiled wilderness to end at the port of Vancouver. The port is on the Salish Sea, part of the hereditary territory of the Squamish People. The Salish Sea is home to some of the world’s largest wild salmon runs. Majestic orcas swim in the waters and feed on the abundance.
You might remember Vancouver from the 2010 Winter Olympics: beautiful mountains, clear water and clean air. Is this a location you would choose to turn into an oil port, exporting up to a million barrels of crude oil per day? It defies common sense. So why is it even proposed, you ask? Because there is an existing, much smaller pipeline there. That’s the entire rationale. Because someone built a pipe more than 50 years ago, let’s build a new one three times as large. The decision by the government of Canada to take over the Trans Mountain pipeline Expansion Project is yet another example of indigenous rights being ignored in Canada. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, promised to do things differently than his predecessors. He promised indigenous peoples that our rights would be respected, and he has broken that promise, yet again. He promised us he would put pipeline expansion through a brand-new review, and instead the government is spending billions of dollars to buy it and, if necessary, complete and operate it over our objections.
By the way, the original pipeline carried 150,000 barrels of oil per day, which was primarily for domestic use. Today it carries 300,000 barrels, achieved by adding more pumping stations and pushing through more oil. So when the megapipe, with an estimated daily load of 800,000 barrels, is built, that capacity is only the beginning: it could double in capacity, with very little anyone could do about it. If this pipeline is completed, these pristine waters will become the sailing grounds for more than 21,000 huge oil tankers over the next 50 years, carrying the world’s most toxic oil – diluted bitumen – from the Alberta tar sands. That is the minimum number of oil tankers; it could be more. A single incident would render the beautiful beaches of the city, surrounding islands and Vancouver Island uninhabitable. It would kill the Salish Sea and destroy our Squamish territory. All it takes is just one incident – and no one, from industry experts to the government, can guarantee that won’t happen. Why risk it? We are told that “world-class” measures will be in place to prevent a spill and deal with one if it happens. A “world-class” standard for oil spill cleanup is that 10% to 15% is successfully recovered from the ocean. Of the remaining 85% to 90%, what doesn’t evaporate will destroy the beaches or sink to the bottom of the ocean to kill everything that now lives there, forever. That is the reality no one wants to talk about. It will destroy the Salish sea.
Why risk it? Alberta is already able to sell its oil through pipelines to the US. That oil is already being exported around the world, in ever-growing amounts, through US oil ports. We know that, if built, this is a 50- to 60-year risk. Can we trust governments, or a corporation, to have the best interests of Squamish people and the residents of our province and city at heart through that whole time? We know that financial constraints could make government or companies cut back on spill mitigation or prevention. In Canada we have seen cash-strapped governments close coast guard bases, lighthouses and weather stations, and allow search and rescue fleets and aircraft to age without being properly replaced. Governments cut back on oversight of all industries on a regular basis, only to express surprise when something goes wrong. And those are just the things we can control. What about the quality of the mega-tankers which will now enter our port? Will they be in top mechanical order? Who knows? Certainly, the Canadian government will never inspect them. If you know this port, it has a very narrow opening, aptly called First Narrows. Medium-sized cruise ships barely fit. The current is powerful and unpredictable. For a mega-tanker it is exceedingly tight – and then they have to go through the Second Narrows before arriving at the terminal. Can they do that 21,000 times without a single incident? Why take the risk?
The decision to risk billions of taxpayer dollars and to pursue completion of a pipeline that threatens Squamish Nation territory and our people is appalling, and a continued betrayal of promises made to us by Trudeau. He told Canada’s indigenous people that our rights would be respected and upheld. He has broken that promise. He promised us he would put the pipeline expansion through a brand-new review. He has broken that promise as well. And this same government promises it will have our best interests in mind if the pipeline proceeds. You can see why we don’t trust them.
While proponents of the pipeline will say that 43 First Nations have agreements with Kinder Morgan, it’s important to dig deeper. A First Nation has rights in their territory, but not in mine – and so free, prior, and informed consent is required in all indigenous territories. We’re also hearing from First Nations such as Upper Nicola and Yale First Nation that, while agreements are in place for their First Nation, it doesn’t equal enthusiastic consent for the project. Out of the 117 indigenous groups who were a part of the consultation by the federal government, nearly two-thirds do not have any agreements with the company at all.
The Squamish Nation will continue to fight to protect our inlet, our communities and our economy. Regardless of who owns the project, our position has not changed. An expanded Trans Mountain pipeline would triple the capacity of diluted bitumen and is expected to increase the number of tankers from five to 35 each month. The tankers pass by three Squamish Nation communities on the Burrard Inlet. A single diluted bitumen marine spill would be catastrophic for our communities, our economy and our home as a Squamish people. We have a right to practice our culture, our way of life, and to continue our right to self-determination in our territories. This is a right that we have never surrendered, and it is a right we will continue to defend.

2018-06-19T06:30:05Z,world,World news,'Not as ironic as I imagined': the incels spokesman on why he is renouncing them,"When news broke in April that a rental van had plowed through throngs of pedestrians in Toronto, killing 10 people, Jack Peterson never imagined that it would have anything to do with him. The 19-year-old Chicago native was single, a college dropout and a self-identified incel. Short for “involuntary celibate”, the term was originally coined for a website support forum for singles. It has since been claimed by an online community of men largely organized around misogyny, with discussions such as how to punish women for not having sex with them.
When media began reporting that the alleged perpetrator of the Toronto attack, Alek Minassian, self-identified as an incel, Peterson thought it was fake, just a trolling effort by some dark-minded prankster. By the next morning, however, the post was confirmed. Minassian claimed to be part of the incel community. Police would subsequently allege that he specifically targeted women in his attack. The incel message boards lit up. “Alek minassian is an incel martyr,” wrote one poster. Another referred to Minassian and to Elliot Rodger – the 22-year-old who went on a killing spree in 2014 in Isla Vista, California – as “true incel heroes”.
With incels suddenly thrust into the public eye, Peterson found himself a semi-official spokesman, one of few members of the community willing to show his face to media, and to use his real name. In interviews with everyone from the BBC to Vice to the Daily Beast, Peterson attempted to defend his community while denouncing the violence committed in its name. Peterson has his work cut out, not least explaining away posts normalizing rape and encouraging mass shootings, which are commonplace on incel messageboards. Some incels have discussed mass rape fantasies and compiled guidelines for stalking. A typical post on Reddit’s incel page from November 2017 calls women “pure and utter evil, who have no thoughts or feelings and should be seen as the malevolent creatures they truly are”. Despite these overt expressions of misogyny, Peterson said he had always seen them as darkly ironic. He suspected, he said, that the posters were non-violent – merely venting, and frustrated by a lack of social capital that he, too, shared. He had bad acne as a child and was bullied. “I felt a strong sense of rejection from, specifically, women,” he says. Peterson had grown up without a dad, he says, and was raised by his mother. He was 11 when he discovered 4chan, the anonymous image-posting site that has served as a petri dish for online culture, memes and, on some of its boards, virulent anti-feminist, racist, xenophobic and antisemitic views. “That’s where I became immersed, at a very young age, in reject culture,” Peterson says. “It was a place to vent.” After Rodger’s day-long rampage in 2014, his anti-feminist manifesto blaming women and sexually active men for his own loneliness and celibacy went viral on 4chan, serving as inspiration for a group of men who had adopted the label “incel” from the work of an amateur sexual activist (who has since expressed horror at how the term was hijacked). The fledgling movement spawned dedicated incel webforums, including Incel.me, the board Peterson frequented.
To many incels, Rodger represented a hero who struck back against a society they perceived as unfair. Posters on incel boards commonly fantasize about “going ER” – for Elliot Rodger – and encourage other posters to do so, inciting them to violence and suicide. Peterson spent his days in his bedroom, lurking on these forums. Last year, he started actively contributing. Under the username “jackbud”, he offered support to other members, and in March he recounted to the forum how “in 4th grade some girl found out i had a crush on her, and she started yelling ‘eww’ and almost cried”. In another, he wrote: “That’s why these communities are so helpful, they let you know you aren’t alone.” Generally, when a thread would crop up advocating murder or violence, Peterson would tell them to knock it off. On Incels.me, Peterson now says, he could be “completely open”.
Unlike others on the forums, Peterson wasn’t terribly political. Even though his birthday in 2016 fell on election day, it was pretty clear, whichever way he voted, he didn’t feel too strongly about it. He told the forum he supports feminism, insofar as he believes in equality of the sexes – though in one post he added, echoing a common belief of “men’s rights” activists, that he doesn’t support the “undertone” of “female dominance or female superiority” in modern feminism. Soon, with another member of the forum, Peterson started a podcast to discuss incel-related issues. It was a fairly lo-fi production, rife with technical issues, bad internet connections and cheap microphones, but grew popular. The format was a call-in show, where Peterson and a co-host would discuss various topics of interest to the community, and listeners could join in via Skype or chime in through a dedicated chatroom. It was immediately after hosting a show discussing the Toronto attack that he was thrust into the public eye. In the recording, Peterson’s tone is somber. “I don’t condone violence,” he says, insisting that “most of us feel that way”. His guests, however, took a different tack. “This is the result of what happens when people – especially young, ugly dudes – are just isolated from society completely,” said one guest, who uses the username “mikepence”. Another guest, who remained anonymous, blamed the supposed end of monogamy, the dawn of a “polygamous society” and the proliferation of birth control and online dating as the trigger for “genetic impulses” that lead to this type of violence.
Incels.me pinned the podcast to its homepage, and journalists began to reach out. Peterson fielded calls from some two dozen different media outlets who wanted to know about the role of incel culture in the Toronto attack. He tried to paint the movement as not inherently violent or sexist. The response from his own community shocked him. The message boards threw the interviews back in his face. One poster wrote that he wasn’t a “true” incel. They called him a “normie”, incel-speak for someone who isn’t. Others said he wasn’t even terribly ugly, nor was he a virgin. One wrote that in Peterson’s media appearances he put “100% blame on incels” instead of focusing on “how women’s behavior has changed”. Peterson had tried to tell the world that the incels didn’t hate women – only for the incels to cry foul. “The response I got,” he says, was: “‘You’re misrepresenting us: we really do hate women. We’re not joking.’” In the midst of this, another unexpected thing happened. Peterson started hearing from, as he calls them, “normal people” – feminists, especially – who wanted to talk, not argue. “With all this media storm, I’ve talked to a lot of people, a lot of journalists, and I’ve gotten a lot of nice, normal people – you know, not incels – reaching out to me,” he says. “Emails, Twitter, YouTube messages, comments and everything. And it’s kind of proven to me that I don’t always have to be the reject loser who sits inside all day.” He started seeing the forum in a different light. The posts encouraging mass shootings – “going ER” – began to seem quite real, and quite terrifying. He began to question whether his effort to defend the movement was misguided. “I always viewed it as very dark humour, and people being ironic,” Peterson says. “Not as ironic as I imagined.”
In early May, Peterson asked the administrator of one of the incel webforums to cancel his account. The next day, he posted a YouTube video entitled “Why I’m leaving Incels”, where he spells out his change of heart. It’s by far the most popular video on his page, racking up nearly 50,000 views in a month. “I think I actually need to do something with my life,” he says in the video. “It can kind of just suck you into depression to be constantly looking at forums like Incels.me, because of the content, and because of how defeatist some of the attitudes can be.” The reaction was mixed. Some commenters wished him good luck, others were furious. “We have been betrayed,” wrote one poster. Another subtly encouraged members to dox Peterson – that is, to publish his personal information online, which can results in things like bomb threats being called in to a victim’s home, school or workplace. “I’ve, more and more, seen the community for the absurd place that it is,” Peterson says. Others would consider “absurd” a mild criticism of a community that has broadly sympathised with mass murder. Peterson’s analysis of what provokes the posters on these sites/message boards will sound, to many, like an attempt to excuse violent misogyny. He claims it is a community riven by lack of self-confidence. Many of the posters, he says, are teenagers grappling with social anxiety or depression. Most seem to be obsessed by their physical appearance: members regularly post pictures of themselves, only to be told how unattractive and ugly they are by other members. In fact, many of the members are perfectly good-looking guys. Peterson agrees. “Looks are probably not the primary factor, here,” he says. Peterson says an overarching theme is one of victimization – leading to the anger and frustration expressed by many on the forums, and a central theme in Rodger’s manifesto.
“A lot of incels think they’re owed shit from the world,” Peterson says. “The mindset is kind of like this: ‘I’ve been bullied and rejected my whole life so because of all the suffering I’ve experienced. Now the world owes me sex, it owes me friends, it owes me success, because of all the failures I’ve had.’” For Peterson, it was simply experiencing the world beyond the message boards that broke this cycle of victimhood. That spate of media interviews, and the new contacts and conversations that resulted, convinced him he can do more with his life. He hopes others will follow his lead. “Exposure to social situations, exposure to women – stuff like that will probably solve it for most guys,” he says. “It’s not this black-and–white thing you’ve created it to be, in these fantasies and these delusions that are often talked about on the forums.
“The first thing I’m really trying to do is really to get out there more in the world and become more social,” he says. “It’ll be tough to maintain this level of confidence and productivity if I don’t have a strong circle of friends.” In the meantime he has kept talking to the media, trying to argue for a wider understanding of the incel community. It’s obvious he still feels protective of his former online home, even if he’s awake to the violent misogyny that plagues it. “That’s definitely part of why I did all this media, is to say: ‘Listen, I’m not a bad guy, I’m not a sexist person, I’m not a violent person, and I don’t think most incels are,’” he says. “I still don’t think most incels are.” But he isn’t deluding himself: “Incel and violence are going to be forever tied.” In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

The House of Lords has voted by an increased majority to insist on giving parliament a veto over Britain crashing out of the European Union. It is a riposte to Theresa May, who last week was accused of betraying Dominic Grieve and his rebel Tory MPs over the “meaningful vote”. In other Brexit news: the UK government will on Thursday release a “statement of intent” about the “streamlined” process that Britain’s 3.4 million EU citizens will have to go through if they want to stay. Brussels, meanwhile, is seeking to keep Britain under the jurisdiction of the European court of human rights by stipulating that any deal for police and security co-operation between the UK and EU will depend on it. * * * ‘Not on my watch’ – Donald Trump has said the US will not become a “migrant camp” like Europe as his administration faces heavy criticism for separating nearly 2,000 children from their parents in just the past six weeks. Hillary Clinton accused Trump of using “frightened children as a negotiating tool”. Trump is pressuring Democrats to negotiate with Republicans on funding for his border wall and tighter immigration restrictions, in exchange for protections for young undocumented migrants known as Dreamers. * * * Rapper gunned down – The rap artist XXXTentacion, real name Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy, has been shot and killed in Florida. Police said two attackers sped off in an SUV after Onfroy was gunned down while shopping for motorcycles. Onfroy, 20, had been awaiting trial for allegedly assaulting his pregnant girlfriend. The rapper was briefly taken off Spotify when the alleged assault came to light. * * * Faff diets – “How to cook eggs in bulk in an oven.” Just one tip from the world of “meal prep” where you get all your clean-eating-paleolithic-Atkins-intermittent-fasting food for the week ready in one go, pack it into plastic containers that are preferably colour-coded … then put it on Instagram. “It is favoured by those who wish to control portion size and calorie consumption and those following, say, a high-protein diet,” explains Laura Barton.
“Wellness bloggers”, fitness preeners and other opportunists of the internet have not taken long to invade the turf. But total cynicism might be unjustified. “It’s sort of Lego cooking, isn’t it?” says the food writer Matthew Fort. “But anything that encourages people to cook meals from scratch must be a good thing.” * * * ‘Terrible human consequences’ – A record 16.2 million people were forced to flee their homes in 2017, according to the UN refugee agency. Syria topped the list followed by Afghanistan, South Sudan, Myanmar and Somalia. Around the world there are 68.5 million displaced people – more than the total population of the UK. The actor and refugee ambassador Angelina Jolie has warned that UNHCR activities in Syria are seriously underfunded, leaving women, children and families in desperate need. The UN general assembly is due later this year to consider for adoption a new “global compact” on responding to refugee crises. Tomorrow is World Refugee Day. * * * Best movies of 2018 so far – This Briefing writer actually liked the Force-free Solo more than any other recently released Star Wars film. So it is gratifying to see it celebrated in our list of this year’s movies you need to see if you haven’t already – helpfully in alphabetical order, and yes there is one starting with Z. World Cup Let’s get things rolling with today’s live blog after Harry Kane’s double at the last minute produced a win for England when they were on course for a draw against Tunisia. Barney Ronay writes that Kane rescued all English fans from heavy weather and unbearable introspection of another slow first-week World Cup death. In five talking points, Dominic Fifield writes that profligacy in attack and sloppiness in defence very nearly cost England two points.
Elsewhere, Romelu Lukaku scored a double as Belgium strolled to an easy win against Panama, the underdog nation succumbing to a superior, classy side. Thomas Hitzlsperger, meanwhile, writes that German manager Joachim Löw is expected to change personnel rather than strategy against Sweden, after their shock loss to Mexico.

Lunchtime read: Multiple orgasms and where to find them “The G-spot will remain a sort of gynaecologic UFO: much searched for and discussed, but unverified by objective means.” Not so the clitoris, writes Rose George: “This mighty, magnificent organ has more nerve endings than the penis and exists, as far as we know, only to give pleasure.”
Women should eschew “G-spot amplification” and “the O-shot”, and instead focus on what is already in reach when searching for an orgasm with an encore, she recommends. “I prescribe better knowledge: women can orgasm singly and multiply orgasm, but often it has to be learned.” Sport England might be in the grip of their worst rugby union Test run for four years, but Eddie Jones is defiant, saying he’s “never seen such an upbeat group”. With both men struggling with injury over the last year, Andy Murray will take on Nick Kyrgios at Queen’s in an effort to test his match fitness. Alex Hales knows he needs to make the most of every opportunity while playing cricket for England, after having lost his place as one-day international opener. Tommy Fleetwood says his second-place 63 at the US Open is “proof” he can compete at major golf tournaments. In Australia, Kate O’Halloran explains why men in sport can and should lead by example on violence against women. Business Asian stocks have tumbled after Donald Trump threatened a tariff hike on more Chinese goods. Shanghai fell 2.3%, the Hang Seng dropped 2%, in Japan the Nikkei 225 lost 0.9% and Seoul’s Kospi was down 0.8%. Markets in Taiwan, New Zealand and south-east Asia also declined though Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.3%. Sterling traded at $1.325 and €1.140 overnight.

The Sun splashes with the headline “I’m buzzing!” in reference to the team’s success despite an “insect swarm” at the stadium. “US will not be ‘migrant camp like Europe’, declares Trump” – how the Guardian covers the president’s comments on Europe’s immigration policies versus his own. The FT leads with the same story: “Trump accuses Merkel of letting migrants transform Germany”.
Both the Times (“There’s no more money, Hammond tells cabinet”) and the Express (“Taxes will rise to pay for NHS boost”) have splashes about the NHS funding increase.

2018-06-19T05:20:56Z,world,World news,Refugee children's story turned into a heartwarming claymation video,"“We’ve had kids in the past who have been boy soldiers, [forced] into the military as young as 11 or 12,” says David Rothstadt, the principal of Noble Park primary school in Victoria. “We’ve had students who have lost family members, and been witness to it. We’ve had kids who have come by boat, their lives in danger. People don’t come by boat lightly.” Ninety per cent of the children at Rothstadt’s school in Melbourne’s south-east come from non-English speaking backgrounds. Many are refugees. And 13 of them, who escaped to Australia from crisis areas but are now thriving in the classroom, have written a story about a 10-year-old’s boat journey which has been brought to life in a new stop-motion animation. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon
First published as an illustrated book, Ali and the Long Journey to Australia was a collaboration between a Monash University researcher, Mervi Kaukko, and Noble Park primary. The kids who wrote the story, Rothstadt says, are now 11, 12 and 13 – and, while Ali and his family are fictional, they brought in their own experiences. “Some of them came by boat. Some spent long periods of time in refugee camps in Kenya, Sudan, on the Thai/Burmese border … The story about the bombs and the father being taken away? That’s an amalgam of a couple of real experiences.”
Eleven-year-old Sithwat, who co-wrote the book and only started speaking English five years ago, says: “It’s pretty awesome. I had never written a book but I always wanted to.” The children created the clay figures for the book’s illustrations, which were animated by Melbourne-based Clem Stamation. “I couldn’t believe it. The bodies move!” Sithwat says. “How do you do that?” The project was the brainchild of Kaukko, a Finnish researcher from Monash University. With her colleague Jane Wilkinson, Kaukko has interviewed 45 refugee children, each identified by their teachers as doing well in school. Her work investigates how these students do not only survive but thrive in schools. “It’s not all about trouble and trauma: it’s about things going well,” she tells Guardian Australia. “What’s common among all the kids I interviewed is they are just normal kids, and they like things kids like.
“Ali [in the story] wanted to save his soccer ball. Little things like that matter for any child, and refugee kids are not an exception.” Kaukko spent 18 months interviewing child refugees before one girl suggested their conversations be turned into a book. “She said, ‘Who is going to read the findings?’ I told her, ‘Not very many – it’s going in an academic journal.’ She said, ‘Wouldn’t it be nice if more people could read our stories?” The researcher hopes the animation showcases positive stories about refugees (“There’s so much emphasis on what’s difficult for them”), and promotes child-centric ways of teaching. It was written using a pedological method called “storycrafting” which, she says, works well with children who don’t speak English as a first language. “The children started creating a story and added bits on top of each other’s stories. They combined their ideas, imaginations and experiences, negotiating where the plot would go and what would happen.” Kaukko’s approach – focusing on the children’s strengths, and doing things a little differently – tapped into the philosophy that drives Rothstadt’s school. “We have a developmental learning approach, with a real focus on play-based learning … which most schools stop at year two,” he said. “We call it exploratory- or inquiry-based learning, and we take it through to year six.”
While classes are still structured, this approach makes the children responsible for some elements of their own education – and the school looks different as a result. “There are less desks, and more nooks and crannies for kids to tuck themselves away in,” Rothstadt says. This can help children with traumatic pasts feel more secure.
“We have some formal chairs and desks, but we also have adaptable sorts of furniture for kids to sit comfortably and write well, while sitting on the floor, or on a beanbag, or lying across an ottoman … it’s about generating a whole environment.” Rothstadt says the requirements of education in Australia often leave traumatised children behind. “We need to recognise that the first pre-condition for learning is that children feel safe and secure … You drop a 14-year-old boy from Sudan into a class about modern European history – what do you reckon the engagement will be? We need to really rethink how we provide learning for these students. “That’s not to say don’t be aspirational or have high expectations – but have a genuine support space for these kids, so that they can experience success.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/refugee-childrens-story-turned-into-a-heartwarming-claymation-video,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/refugee-childrens-story-turned-into-a-heartwarming-claymation-video
2018-06-19T04:07:47Z,world,World news,Less 'bias and bigotry' needed in Australian-Sino relations says China ambassador,"China’s ambassador to Australia has called for Australia and China to harbour less “bias and bigotry” towards each other and work harder to build mutual trust, saying no one is benefiting from the current “cold war mentality”. Cheng Jingye also rejected suggestions China is intentionally over-burdening some Pacific island nations with debt to bring them under Beijing’s control, saying it is “absurd” to suggest such a thing. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon
His remarks come a day after Julie Bishop, the foreign affairs minister, confirmed the Turnbull government will compete with China’s infrastructure development spree in the South Pacific to ensure small island nations in Australia’s neighbourhood “retain their sovereignty”. Australian foreign policy experts are increasingly wary of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious trillion dollar plan to expand Beijing’s influence across 70 or more countries, including in the Pacific, with a spending spree on hundreds of large infrastructure projects that dramatically expands China’s geographic footprint. Cheng spoke at an Australia-China Business Council event in Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday, using his opening address to call on Australians to view China far more favourably.
He said China was willing to work with Australia to improve bilateral relations, but Australia had to stop being suspicious of Chinese motives. He said the Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi recently held a meeting with Julie Bishop where he outlined China’s plan for its development path and its visions for developing relations with other countries. “He pointed out China follows a development path that is completely different from that of traditional major powers,” he said. “China never interferes in the internal affairs of [other] countries, let alone carries out so-called ‘infiltration’ of other countries. China’s idea is to carry out equal cooperation with all countries, including Australia, to achieve mutual benefit and win-win outcomes.” Cheng said it was his belief that, in order to “disperse the clouds”, Australia and China needed to be more inclusive and behave with less bias and bigotry. “We need to see each other’s development and positive intentions from a more positive perspective with less cold war mentality,” he said. “We need to build more mutual trust, with less misunderstanding. We need to develop more connections between our two countries and two peoples with less barriers. And we need to respect each other’s core interests and major concerns while managing the differences in a constructive manner.”
After his speech, when Cheng was leaving the event, he gave unscripted remarks to journalists that were more pointed. He said it was “ridiculous” and “absurd” to suggest that China was over-burdening some Pacific island nations with debt. “We have a growing economic cooperation with some island countries, they are on an equal footing and I think it is mutually beneficial,” he said. “We have always been sensitive to any possible debt burden, and any items that we have in cooperation with those countries we have been very careful about their ability to [repay] the debt.” When asked who he had in mind when he mentioned bias and bigotry, he said it was up to others to come to their own conclusions. “You can make your own judgements,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/less-bias-and-bigotry-needed-in-australian-sino-relations-says-china-ambassador,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/less-bias-and-bigotry-needed-in-australian-sino-relations-says-china-ambassador
2018-06-19T04:00:02Z,world,World news,'They’re trying to break me': Polish judges face state-led intimidation,"Three high-profile Polish judges have complained of a “state-led campaign of intimidation and harassment” against them, as Poland’s ruling party tightens its grip on the judiciary. Since taking power in 2015 the Law and Justice party (PiS) has assumed direct oversight of state prosecutors and the judicial body that appoints, promotes and disciplines judges, as well as the power to dismiss and appoint court presidents, who wield considerable power and influence in the Polish justice system. A disputed law on the supreme court, forcing the retirement of 40% of its judges, is due to take effect on 3 July. Judges involved in politically sensitive cases or who have expressed opposition to threats to judicial independence have told the Guardian they are frequently threatened with disciplinary proceedings and even criminal charges, and in many cases are subjected to allegations of corruption and hate campaigns orchestrated by leading PiS politicians. “I became an enemy of the state,” said Waldemar Żurek, a district court judge in the southern city of Kraków, who served as spokesman for the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), the body that appoints and disciplines Polish judges, until it was taken over by government appointees this year. As the public face of the KRS’s attempts to argue for judicial independence, Żurek received hundreds of abusive and threatening messages to his work phone after false allegations about his personal life were published in pro-government media outlets. Members of his family were also targeted. When state prosecutors opened an investigation into why one of the rear tyres on his car had burst in suspicious circumstances at the height of the controversy, they showed no interest in gathering evidence, Żurek said, instead using the investigation to demand he hand over as much personal information as possible, including telephone records going back several years. “All they were interested in was obtaining information they could use against me – they want me to know that they are watching everything I do,” said Żurek, who believes he is under surveillance by state security services. It is an experience shared by Wojciech Łączewski, a district court judge in Warsaw. In 2015 he convicted Mariusz Kamiński, a senior PiS politician, of abuse of public office when serving as the head of Poland’s central anti-corruption bureau. He sentenced Kamiński to three years in prison for illegal activities including falsifying documents, illegal surveillance and misleading courts so as to obtain warrants under false pretences. But after the PiS candidate Andrzej Duda won a presidential election later that year he pardoned Kamiński, who was subsequently appointed as the minister responsible for the Polish security services. The pardon was later ruled unlawful by the supreme court, but Kamiński remains in post. Since then, Łączewski has seen off one disciplinary charge and is now facing criminal charges relating to Kamiński’s trial, including an allegation – which he strongly denies – that he revealed the identities of undercover agents during the proceedings. Łączewski said his house was broken into and sources within the Polish justice system had confirmed to him that he had been placed under surveillance by the security services that Kamiński now oversees. “They’re trying to break me and they are winning. I’m tired, I want to live in peace. They have the power of the whole state behind them and I’m alone,” said Łączewski, 41, whose wife, a lawyer who worked in Poland’s constitutional court, was sent to work in a basement archive and then dismissed after the government engineered a takeover of the court at the end of 2016. “Even if I win my proceedings, they still win, because they will claim it as proof that judges are colluding to protect each other.” Judges contacted by the Guardian said they faced an impossible dilemma: stay silent and lose their independence, or speak out and be accused of “politicisation”, face disciplinary charges and lose their credibility in the eyes of the public. “We are all hoping to avoid being put in a situation where we have to make a decision on a political case,” said one lower court judge in south-east Poland, speaking on condition of anonymity. Prosecutors are preparing charges against Igor Tuleya, a Warsaw district court judge who last year ruled that Law and Justice MPs had deliberately obstructed opposition MPs from participating in a vote on the state budget during a parliamentary crisis in December 2016. He found that more than 200 PiS MPs and staff had given false testimony about the existence of a pre-conceived plan to do so. “They use the same methods for all of us, it’s always the same scenario,” said Tuleya, who has become a hate figure in the pro-government press. He recently received an anonymous email warning him that rumours were being circulated in legal circles that he was a drug addict. In May it was announced that Żurek and Tuleya would be summoned before a new “ethics panel” of government-appointed judges and MPs. The panel includes Krystyna Pawłowicz, a PiS MP who has already publicly stated that Tuleya should not be a judge, declaring during a session of parliament’s justice committee last year that certain judges should be sent to North Korean-style concentration camps for “re-education”. “We can definitely say there’s a growing atmosphere of oppression around certain judges and courts,” said Małgorzata Szuleka, of the Warsaw-based Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, noting that state prosecutors who had expressed concerns about political interference had also had disciplinary proceedings initiated against them. Another judge who has publicly criticised the government’s changes said the pressure being exerted on dissenting judges had become so great that even his home town’s priest had urged his mother, a devout Catholic, to convince her son to stop expressing his opposition to the changes. He claimed to have been approached by an intermediary representing the justice ministry offering him a court presidency in exchange for his acquiescence. The pressure is likely only to increase with the establishment of a new supreme court “disciplinary chamber” presided over by ruling party appointees. Poland faces censure from the European Union for the passage of the legislation retiring 40% of the supreme court, which the PiS leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, claimed had been infiltrated by “leftism and subordination to foreign forces”. “We are returning to something like the Communist times, where the ambitious compromise their principles and true independence depends on the character and integrity of individual judges,” said Łączewski. “They can drive me out of the profession, they can even drive me out of the country, but they can never kill the independent judge that lives within me.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/theyre-trying-to-break-me-polish-judges-face-state-led-intimidation,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/theyre-trying-to-break-me-polish-judges-face-state-led-intimidation
2018-06-19T02:47:23Z,world,World news,Pentagon cancels Freedom Guardian military drill with South Korea,"The United States and South Korea have cancelled a major military exercise scheduled for August, a week after Donald Trump said he would end the “war games” in a surprise concession during his summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. The Pentagon said Operation Ulchi Freedom Guardian would not take place, while Washington and Pyongyang continue to discuss denuclearisation following Trump’s historic meeting with Kim in Singapore last Tuesday. The announcement came as Kim travelled to China to brief president Xi Jinping on his Singapore meeting with Trump. This is Kim’s third trip to China this year, coming less than a week after he met Trump in Singapore for historic talks. Last year’s drill was held over 11 days and involved 17,500 US troops and 50,000 from South Korea, along with those from several other countries that fought in the 1950-53 Korean war.
The cancellation came after long discussions between the secretary of state, Jim Mattis, and his counterpart in Seoul, Song Young-moo. “We are still coordinating additional actions. No decisions on subsequent war games have been made,” Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said. “There is no impact on Pacific exercises outside of the Korean peninsula.” The South Korean defence ministry said in a statement: “South Korea and the United States have agreed to suspend all planning activities regarding the Freedom Guardian military drill scheduled for August.” No decision has been made on other US-South Korea drills, it added. There was no immediate reaction from North Korea. The decision does not affect two other major exercises, Key Resolve and Foal Eagle, which usually include live-fire drills with tanks, aircraft and warships and feature about 10,000 American and 200,000 South Korean troops. The drills usually take place each spring but were delayed slightly this year as a conciliatory gesture amid a lowering of inter-Korean tensions during the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. Trump surprised officials in Seoul and Washington last week when he abruptly announced that he was suspending military exercises with the South, “unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should”. Speaking to reporters in Singapore, Trump said that pausing the drills would save the US “a tremendous amount of money” and described them as “very provocative” – echoing North Korea’s criticism that the exercises are a rehearsal for a US-led invasion. Trump had not informed the South Korean government or the US military of his decision, which contradicted both countries’ belief that the drills are purely defensive in nature and essential preparation for a possible North Korean attack. The exercises typically comprise beach landings and repelling an invasion by the North, but have also featured “decapitation” strikes targeting senior figures in the regime. Critics in Congress have warned that ending joint drills could weaken the military alliance between the US and South Korea, which hosts 28,500 American troops. Japanese officials have also reacted cautiously to Trump’s announcement.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/pentagon-cancels-freedom-guardian-military-drill-with-south-korea,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/pentagon-cancels-freedom-guardian-military-drill-with-south-korea

Puan was given to Perth zoo in 1968 and is believed to have been born in Sumatra 1956. At 62 years she lived well beyond her typical life expectancy and was recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest verified member of her species in 2016. According to the zoo, Sumatran orangutans rarely live beyond the age of 50. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon
Puan played a key role in breeding programs and gave birth to 11 children. She has 54 descendants in Australia, the US, Indonesia and elsewhere around the world. “Apart from being the oldest member of our colony, she was also the founding member of our world-renowned breeding program and leaves an incredible legacy,” said Holly Thompson, the zoo’s primate supervisor in a statement. “Her genetics count for just under 10% of the global zoological population.” Puan was euthanised on Monday after suffering age-related complications that the zoo said were affecting her quality of life. Zookeeper Martina Hart, who had worked with Puan for 18 years, wrote a heartfelt obituary after her death.
“Over the years Puan’s eyelashes had greyed, her movement had slowed down and her mind had started to wander. But she remained the matriarch, the quiet, dignified lady she had always been,” wrote Hart in the obituary, provided to Guardian Australia and printed in full in the West Australian. “Puan demanded and deserved respect, and she certainly had it from all her keepers over the years. She was the founding female of the best breeding colony in the world.” “Puan taught me patience, she taught me that natural and wild instincts never disappear in captivity.

2018-06-19T00:04:29Z,world,World news,'It's exhilarating': Japan's female sumo wrestlers take on sexism,"It isn’t hard to see why Chisaki Okumura is one of Japan’s best female sumo wrestlers. Combining her considerable height and heft with flashes of speed, her practice bouts end with a succession of opponents thrown to the ground or shoved unceremoniously out of the ring. On a humid, wet afternoon in central Japan, Okumura draws on her reserves of strength for a final, punishing series of drills with a male opponent. By the end, it is hard to tell who is more exhausted.
For more than two hours every weekday afternoon, the 17 men and nine women of Asahi University’s sumo club stretch, warm up and perform drills together, although for safety reasons they conduct full-on bouts separately. Training is centered on two dohyo – a dirt-covered 4.55m diameter circle marked out with half-buried rice-straw bales - which are among the few places where female sumo wrestlers are defying the centuries-old sport’s uneasy relationship with gender.
As amateurs, the women athletes at Asahi and other universities are not bound by the ancient traditions governing professional sumo - in which only men can compete. But that might not be the case for much longer. Many hope the ban on women joining the professional sumo ranks will one day be overturned, proving that deep-seated misogyny has no place in a sport striving to be accepted as an Olympic event. In April, not long after professional sumo was rocked again by allegations of bullying and violence, an incident at an exhibition tournament in Maizuru, near Kyoto, triggered a new campaign to rid Japan’s de facto national sport of its sexist traditions. The row was triggered by after several women, including at least one nurse, rushed on to the ring to administer first aid to the local mayor, who had collapsed after suffering a stroke. Using the public address system, the referee repeatedly ordered them to leave the ring, but the women refused. Officials sprinkled “purifying” salt on the wrestling surface after they had left. Sumo officials later denied that this had been done because of the women’s presence in the ring. Salt is customarily scattered on the ring before bouts and after a wrestler has been injured. The impromptu first responders had fallen foul of an ancient rule banning women from entering, or even touching, the dohyo. The rule has prevented local female politicians from presenting awards inside the ring. The Maizuru incident not only embarrassed sumo but was also seen as a metaphor for the treatment of women in Japan, which performs poorly in global tables of gender equality and female political representation. ‘Sumo is for everyone’ Tomoko Nakagawa, the mayor of Takarazuka in western Japan, has unsuccessfully petitioned the Japan sumo association to lift the ban. “I can’t understand why it is only the sumo world that refuses to change or is even going backwards,” she told Agence France-Presse. The sport’s struggle with sexism is equally baffling to Okumura, who has been wrestling since she was at middle school. “Sumo shouldn’t be thought of as a sport for men and women, it’s for everyone,” says Okumura, runner-up in last month’s international women’s sumo invitational championships in the 64-80kg category. “I definitely benefit from being able to train with the men, and I don’t get the impression that they’re looking down on me and the other women. If I were allowed to compete against them in a proper bout I think I could hold my own.” The Asahi club was formed eight years ago and is now one of about half a dozen women’s sumo clubs at Japanese universities. The female members use the same number of kimarite – or winning moves – as the men, but wear their mawashi belts over shorts and T-shirts.
“There are some people who still struggle to accept the idea of women’s sumo, but I’ve never thought it was at all unusual,” says Shigeto Takahashi, the club’s manager, who has been coaching female wrestlers for 35 years. “The only real difference is that the women have to be a little more careful about injuring their shoulders, but they’re not allowed to wear any padding.” Kaori Matsui, an associate professor in the university’s department of health and sports sciences, and the club’s deputy manager, said it was natural for women to compete in sumo, having already broken down barriers in other contact sports such as wrestling and judo.
The number of new women taking up amateur sumo is static, however, a problem she blames on the dearth of female coaches to offer guidance to girls and young women. “Some people I meet are amazed that there is even an international women’s sumo scene,” she says. “There needs to be a more coordinated approach to promoting the brilliance of women’s sumo. When you watch it close up, it’s exhilarating.” While weary wrestlers gulp down cups of cold tea from a copper kettle, Minayo Nishimoto shows few signs of fatigue - unsurprising, perhaps, for a woman who has been hurling her comparatively slight frame around sumo rings since she was nine years old. “I understand that the dohyo is regarded as sacred, but whichever way you look at it, the ban on women is sexist,” says Nishimoto, who prides herself on her uwatenage overarm throw. “But that just makes me all the more determined to carry on and be the best female wrestler in Japan.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/its-exhilarating-japans-female-sumo-wrestlers-take-on-sexism,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/its-exhilarating-japans-female-sumo-wrestlers-take-on-sexism
2018-06-18T18:00:05Z,world,World news,Evangelical Christians step up abortion clinic protests in Queensland,"An evangelical group has ramped up demonstrations outside several Brisbane abortion clinics as Queensland prepares to reform its 1899 laws that make abortion a criminal offence. Guardian Australia is aware of several recent verbal clashes between members of the anti-abortion group “Project 139” and clinic patients. The group has sought and received permits to conduct protests at four Brisbane clinics until at least August. In response, Pro Choice Queensland has also taken to the streets, mobilising volunteers who carry purple umbrellas outside clinics and escort women safely past protesters. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon
Sinead Canning from Pro Choice Queensland said the “pro choice defenders” had previously volunteered to support women during more sedate protests. But Canning said the latest demonstrations had been more aggressive and confrontational than anything she had experienced before in Australia. Last week a protester was filmed harassing a woman outside an abortion clinic in the inner-Brisbane suburb of Spring Hill. In the footage, which has been shared on social media, a woman can be heard screaming at a demonstrator to “shut up”. The protester replies: “That baby’s got a heartbeat”. Guardian Australia understands Project 139 is the anti-abortion offshoot of a Brisbane-based “evangelical action group” called Operation 513. It documents on Facebook encounters with women who become “very angry” and “hostile”. Project 139 did not respond to a request for comment. Canning said the protestors’ actions had been “pretty confronting”. “All of the clinics have requested our presence so we can escort the patients in. Some people might go into those clinics with ectopic pregnancy or a wanted pregnancy [with complications] … they’re faced with pretty rabid harassment by these people.
“Not only are they harassing the patients, but they’ve taken to harassing the [pro choice] volunteers.” After successful moves to legalise abortion in Ireland and Argentina recently, Queensland looms as a significant next battleground for the issue. The Queensland government has asked the state’s Law Reform Commission to review and modernise abortion laws, which have been unchanged since being written into Queensland’s criminal code in 1899. Doctors who provide abortions face 14 years in prison, while women can be jailed for seven years. The last attempted prosecution in the state occurred eight years ago, when a Cairns couple was tried and acquitted for terminating a pregnancy. The law reform commission is due to table its recommendations by the end of the month, and the Queensland government is likely to bring a bill before parliament this year. It is understood the new legislation will also create a provision for “safe access zones” to prevent the sorts of protests that are ongoing outside clinics. For now, campaigns on both sides are ramping up for the debate. Anti-abortion protesters held a march through Brisbane in March and have been increasingly visible presence on city streets and outside the state parliament. New South Wales joined several other states, including Victoria, earlier in June when it passed a law making it illegal to harass women outside abortion clinics. Taking on social law reform is viewed by some as a bold strategy for the Palaszczuk government in a state with a long conservative history. It’s understood the government is cautious to temper the pace of reform, and will not bring forward a debate on euthanasia until it has shepherded the abortion laws through the parliament.
A Feburary 2017 poll by Fair Agenda found 82% of Queenslanders believed it should be legal for a woman, in consultation with a doctor, to terminate a pregnancy. A spokeswoman for anti-abortion group Cherish Life said the footage she had seen of the protesters was “appalling” and that Cherish Life did not run its own demonstrations. In a media release responding to safe access zone laws passing in NSW, the group defended “sidewalk counsellors” who they said “do a tremendous amount of good”. Cherish Life said the group wanted “safeguards” for women included in any new legislation including mandatory counselling, cooling off periods and a requirement for doctors’ referrals.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/evangelical-christians-step-up-abortion-clinic-protests-in-queensland,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/evangelical-christians-step-up-abortion-clinic-protests-in-queensland
2018-06-18T16:21:30Z,world,World news,Sharp fall in number of people seeking asylum in EU,"Fewer people sought asylum in the European Union last year, although numbers remain higher than before the arrival of 1 million people in 2015 triggered a political crisis that continues to divide Europe. Showing a sharp drop in asylum claims, the latest report from the EU’s asylum office was published on Monday after emergency talks in the German government over asylum policy and a bitter standoff between EU nations over a migrant rescue ship that eventually docked in Spain after being banned from Italy and Malta. The EU’s asylum office counted 728,470 applications for international protection in 2017, a 44% reduction on the 1.3m applications the previous year. More than 1 million people entered the EU in 2015, many fleeing the war in Syria.
Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan remain the most frequent countries of origin for asylum seekers, accounting for 29% of all claims. The downward trend of asylum claims continued in the first four months of 2018, the EU asylum office said, although numbers have still not returned to pre-crisis levels. About 460,000 people applied for asylum in EU countries in 2013. The fall in asylum applications reflects a sharp drop in people making the hazardous journey over the eastern Mediterranean to Greece and the central Mediterranean to Italy, although there has been an increase in people travelling from west Africa to Spain, albeit from a lower base. Germany continues to receive more applications for asylum than any other country in Europe, with 222,560 claims in 2017, folowed by Italy, France and Greece. The UK was in fifth place, with 33,780 applications, accounting for 4.6% of all EU asylum claims. But the backlog remains high: 954,100 claims are awaiting a decision, including 443,640 in Germany, according to the EU asylum office.
The EU has spent more than two years trying to agree common asylum rules, but talks are deadlocked over whether there should be a compulsory system for allocating refugees to different member states. EU leaders will discuss the question at an EU summit next week, although a German government spokesman dismissed reports of an emergency meeting taking place this weekend. Angela Merkel told her Conservative allies that she would report back on the results of negotiations with the EU on 1 July, while rebuffing an ultimatum from her interior minister, Horst Seehofer. The former leader of the Bavarian CSU, the sister party to Merkel’s CDU, said police should turn back migrants at the border if there was no progress within two weeks. The German chancellor dismissed the threat, saying there would be “no automatism” if no European deals were found. “Turning away migrants at our borders at the heart of Europe will lead to negative domino effects that could hurt Germany, and put into question European unity,” she said. In a diplomatic push before the summit, Merkel will meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Tuesday, following her talks on Monday with Italy’s new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte. Sophie Magennis of the United Nations refugee agency said the standoff over the Aquarius rescue ship brought into stark relief the importance of the EU agreeing on a mechanism to share refugees. “Now really is the time for EU member states to come together and to agree on their approach to this issue,” she said. “We do not have a crisis of numbers, we continue to a crisis of political will and that is something that needs to be addressed.” Talks are deadlocked over whether there should be a compulsory quota system to allocate asylum seekers around the EU, after seven countries rejected a compromise proposal earlier this month. Hungary leads a central European bloc that insist any mandatory quotas are unacceptable, while Italy has argued any reform is worthless without compulsory relocation to ease the pressure on frontline states. The quota clash is holding up progress on other EU asylum reforms, such as greater harmonisation of procedures and conditions in reception centres across the bloc. One of the biggest differences is recognition of asylum claims: while non-EU Switzerland granted asylum to 90% of claimants, the Czech Republic gave refugee status to only 12% of people on their first application.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/sharp-fall-in-number-of-people-seeking-asylum-in-eu,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/sharp-fall-in-number-of-people-seeking-asylum-in-eu
2018-06-18T16:12:49Z,world,World news,Israel indicts former cabinet minister on Iran spying charges,"Israel has arrested and indicted a former government minister on charges of spying for Iran, the country’s internal security services have said. Gonen Segev, who worked as energy and infrastructure minister in the 1990s, “was recruited and acted as an agent on behalf of Iranian intelligence”, police and the Israel Security Agency, better known as the Shin Bet, said in a statement on Monday. He was detained in May “on suspicion of committing offences of assisting the enemy in war and spying against the state of Israel” and indicted on Friday for multiple charges of “transferring information to the enemy”, the statement said. It said Segev was first in contact with officials at the Iranian embassy in Nigeria in 2012 and that he twice met Iranian “operators” knowing they were from Iranian intelligence. He allegedly met more Iranian spies around the world at hotels and apartments and had received a “secret communications system” to help him encrypt messages. Accusing him of providing information on security sites in Israel including buildings and officials in political and security organisations, the statement said Segev also passed on material related to the energy sector. A trained physician who held the rank of captain in the Israeli military, Segev found his public standing soured when he was arrested in 2004 for attempting to smuggle tens of thousands of ecstasy pills from the Netherlands to Israel, allegedly using an expired diplomatic passport. He left the country in 2007 after his release from prison and has since lived in west Africa. The police and Shin Bet said they rearrested Segev after he attempted to fly to Equatorial Guinea in May. He was refused entry and extradited to Israel where he remains in custody. It said the 62-year-old had introduced other Israeli citizens, some connected to the country’s security and foreign relations establishment, to Iranian intelligence officers who he presented as “regular businessmen”. It did not say if other Israelis were under investigation. Segev’s lawyers did not immediately comment. Israel has long fought Iranian-supported militant groups, including Hezbollah in Lebanon to the north and Hamas in Gaza to the south, and the two countries have a history of espionage. In April, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said security services had managed to retrieve half a tonne of material on Iran’s nuclear programme from a warehouse in Tehran. This year, the shadow war between the two nations erupted as Israel repeatedly bombed Iranian forces operating in neighbouring Syria while also accusing Iranian troops of firing rockets at its soldiers and sending a drone into its airspace.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/israel-indicts-former-cabinet-minister-gonen-segev-iran-spying-charges,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/israel-indicts-former-cabinet-minister-gonen-segev-iran-spying-charges
2018-06-18T15:32:27Z,world,World news,Yemen crisis: Saudi coalition demands Houthis' unconditional withdrawal,"The UN’s hopes of negotiating a ceasefire with Houthi rebels in the vital port of Hodeidah in Yemen appear to have been dashed after the Saudi-led coalition backing the Yemeni government said it would only accept the rebels’ unconditional withdrawal from the area. The UN special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, has been in the country seeking a deal whereby the port, currently under Houthi control, is handed over to the UN and its relief agencies. The port is the distribution point for up to 80% of the food, water and commercial fuel vital to the lives of more than 8 million Yemenis in severe need. The UN and aid agencies fear a prolonged fight will endanger the aid supplies. But the United Arab Emirates, the key military supporters of the UN-backed government, has insisted it will not accept anything but an unconditional withdrawal.
The Houthis are extremely unlikely to agree to this, since it would amount to surrender of the area with no guarantees on the future status of Yemen. “There can be no conditions in any offers to withdraw,” the UAE’s foreign minister, Anwar Gargash, told a press briefing in Dubai. “If the rebels wanted to set conditions, they should have thought of that a year ago … Now is not the time to negotiate.” Gargash’s remarks reflect his military planners’ confidence that the estimated 3,000 Houthi troops in the area can be defeated without damage to the port infrastructure. He said: “Our approach is one of gradual, calibrated and methodical pressure designed for unconditional withdrawal of Houthis. Our earlier efforts to ensure Hodeidah as a humanitarian and commercial port failed. It became quickly clear that the Houthis were buying time. Their financial and strategic interest was to prolong the war. We will not allow this war to last for another two to three years.” He added: “It is time for a political process. The Houthis need to be part of that process – but you can’t be 3% of the population, yet claim through the barrel of a gun to own 50% of the country.”
UAE sources may also fear that a ceasefire would give the Houthis a chance to regroup and acquire extra arms, or to try to rebuild international diplomatic support against the attack. Fighting around the Hodeidah airport continueds, but the massive air superiority of the Saudi coalition appears to be helping Yemeni government ground forces to make progress. The UAE sources said the coalition had captured the southern part of the airport, but has not yet secured the perimeter due to an unwillingness to fire on Houthi forces hiding among civilians in a village to the west of the airport. On Sunday the UN’s humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, Lise Grande, said talks on a transfer of the port to UN control were at an advanced stage. Griffiths is expected to brief the security council on his talks later on Monday, and will set out the continuing points of difference between the two sides. Gargash said the Saudi and UAE-led offensive aimed “to help the UN envoy in his last chance to convince the Houthis to withdraw unconditionally from the city and avoid any confrontation”. He pointed out the road for Houthis to leave Hodeidah and head for the capital Sana’a had been kept open. The head of the Houthis’ unofficial government, Abdulaziz bin Habtoor, accused Saudi-led forces of “escalating their attacks on the western coast when they felt there were serious moves towards a solution”. The Saudi alliance imposed a near-total blockade on Hodeidah port earlier this year, alleging Iran was using it as a major conduit for illicit arms deliveries to the Houthis. Gargash said on Monday that his country and its allies aimed to “avoid civilian casualties”, adding that the operation was “going very well”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/yemen-crisis-saudi-coalition-demands-houthis-unconditional-withdrawal-from-port,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/yemen-crisis-saudi-coalition-demands-houthis-unconditional-withdrawal-from-port
2018-06-18T12:36:41Z,world,World news,Upskirting: government confirms plan to introduce ban,"The government has confirmed it will introduce legislation to ban upskirting after a Conservative backbencher was berated by party colleagues for blocking a bill to make the practice a specific criminal offence.
Downing Street said ministers would adopt the private member’s bill so that the surreptitious taking of sexually intrusive images would be outlawed before the summer recess. Theresa May has come under intense pressure from MPs and the public to push through the law after Tory MP Sir Christopher Chope blocked the bill, which was put forward by the Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse, last Friday. The prime minister promised on Sunday that the government would take on the legislation, which would create a new criminal offence punishable by up to two years in prison. It followed a campaign by the freelance writer Gina Martin after police declined to prosecute a man accused of taking pictures up her skirt at a music festival in London last summer.
May tweeted on Sunday: “Upskirting is an invasion of privacy which leaves victims feeling degraded and distressed. I am disappointed the bill didn’t make progress in the Commons today, and I want to see these measures pass through parliament - with government support – soon.” Cabinet ministers were among those who publicly criticised the move by Chope, whose Commons office door was adorned with a string of knickers on Monday. Homemade knicker bunting was also said to have been hung outside his constituency office in protest. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, had revealed that his daughters would be disappointed and said the law needed to be reformed. The equalities minister, Penny Mordaunt, and the justice secretary, David Gauke, said change would come regardless, while Tory backbenchers were furious at the damage done to the party’s reputation. The Tory MP Simon Clarke said Chope had “embarrassed himself” and “does not speak for me or Conservatives” on the issue, while fellow Dorset MP and defence minister Tobias Ellwood branded him “a dinosaur”. The cabinet on Monday discussed the issue, which typically involves taking a picture of a person’s underwear without their knowledge. However, there was no specific mention of Chope or the potential reform of private members’ bills. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “The cabinet discussed upskirting, which the prime minister said is an invasion of privacy which leaves victims feeling degraded and distressed.”
The Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, had told colleagues “the measure is one the government supports and has received extensive support both within and outside parliament”. The PM”s spokesman added: “She was pleased to confirm that we will adopt this as a government bill. The aim is to secure second reading as soon as possible and before the summer recess”. Chope, who has regularly obstructed private members’ bills in the past, delayed the voyeurism (offences) bill on upskirting by shouting “object” during its second reading in the Commons, meaning it could not be put through to the next stage without debate and a vote, which will not happen for weeks. The MP for Christchurch said he backed the intent of the bill, and objected to it because he does not support the principle of legislation being passed without debate at second reading. He said he hoped the government would now adopt it. In an interview with his local newspaper, he admitted to being “a bit sore about being scapegoated” over the bill. “The suggestion that I am some kind of pervert is a complete travesty of the truth,” he told the Bournemouth Echo. Chope has also asked why, if the issue was such a priority, ministers had not allowed government time for legislation, rather than in effect squeezing the time available for other backbench bills.",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/18/upskirting-government-confirms-plan-to-introduce-ban,https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/18/upskirting-government-confirms-plan-to-introduce-ban
2018-06-18T12:19:21Z,world,World news,French air traffic control 'causes third of Europe's air traffic delays',"French air traffic control (ATC) causes one-third of air traffic-related flight delays in Europe each year, at a cost of about €300m (£263m) to airlines, according to a French parliamentary report. Air traffic control-related delays make up about 15% of total flight delays in Europe. Strikes by controllers and outages caused by antiquated equipment have been blamed for the disruption to aviation, the senate’s finance committee said. Vincent Capo-Canellas, a centrist senator and the report’s author, said: “Our country is responsible for 33% of the delays due to air traffic control in Europe.” He said the situation was unlikely to improve when France’s 4,000 ATC staff were facing increases in air traffic: there were 3.1m flights last year in Europe, 4% more than in the previous year and 8.6% more than in 2015. Capo-Canelas added: “We are a long way behind our [European] neighbours. The control equipment is antiquated.” He said this was especially worrying as €2bn had been spent modernising ATC since 2011. Last week Ryanair said there would be an airspace “meltdown” unless urgent action was taken to halt the rolling industrial action by French controllers. The senate report found that between 2004 and 2016 they were on strike for a total of 254 days, far more than controllers in any other European country. Second were controllers in Greece, with 46 days, followed by Italy, with 37 days and Germany, with four days. For several months, France’s 4,000 air traffic controllers have been engaged in a series of strikes to protest against staff cuts and a lack of up-to-date technology, blamed on a “lack of investment”. The reports says: “Every day of strike in France has a much bigger impact on European traffic than [strikes] in other European countries.” French controllers are trained at the National Civil Aviation School where the state pays them just under the minimum wage while studying on condition that they sign up for at least 10 years on graduating. They can earn about €5,000 a month and generally work a three-days-on, three-days-off rota. “Everything suggests the situation will only become worse in the years to come and strong solutions must be put in place right away to bring things up to scratch as soon as possible,” Capo-Canellas said. The good news, he added, was that safety was still given total priority. • This article was amended on 20 June 2018. An earlier version said that the French parliamentary report showed that last year, the country’s air traffic control caused one-third of flight delays in Europe. This has been corrected to say one-third of air traffic-related flight delays. According to the report, air traffic related flight delays made up about 15% of all flight delays.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/french-air-traffic-control-causes-third-of-europes-flight-delays,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/french-air-traffic-control-causes-third-of-europes-flight-delays
2018-06-18T11:59:02Z,world,World news,Poland's de facto leader recovering from 'life-threatening situation',"Speculation is mounting about the long-term future of Poland’s ruling rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS), after senior government officials acknowledged that the party leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, who has not made a public appearance since April, was treated in hospital earlier this year for a “life-threatening situation”. Kaczyński returned to work last week after spending 37 days in a Warsaw military hospital. His aides had long maintained that his absence had been due to arthritis in his knee, but on Friday the health minister, Łukasz Szumowski, told Polish radio that “Jarosław Kaczyński’s state of health was such that not accepting him to the hospital would have threatened his life, and therefore he was admitted in an acute manner”. No further details have been released. Kaczyński, who turns 69 on Monday, is the leader and driving force behind the Law and Justice party, which assumed office after victory in parliamentary elections in 2015. Though the former prime minister does not hold any public office other than that of a backbench member of parliament, he is Poland’s undisputed de facto leader, handpicking ministers and making strategic decisions on the future of the country from his party office in a ramshackle building in central Warsaw. In recent weeks, senior officials have moved to quash the speculation regarding Kaczyński’s health, in comments that appeared to be directed at members of their own party. “All those dreaming about replacing Kaczyński, must get armed with a very long patience,” said the interior minister, Joachim Brudziński, earlier this month. “The chairman is in full control of what is going on in the party and is not planning a political retirement.” “Please be calm, [Kaczyński] is keeping his eye on things,” Marek Suski, chief of staff to the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, also a Law and Justice member, told a pro-government weekly last week. Having co-founded Law and Justice with his late twin brother, Lech, in 2001, Kaczyński has no obvious successor as leader of the party, with some commentators suggesting that his departure could trigger a substantive realignment on the right of Polish politics.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/polands-de-facto-leader-recovering-from-life-threatening-situation,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/polands-de-facto-leader-recovering-from-life-threatening-situation
2018-06-18T11:58:53Z,world,World news,"No evidence against Amnesty's jailed Turkey head, police conclude","Turkey’s Amnesty chair, Taner Kılıç, could be freed this week following a year in detention after a police report conceded there was no evidence to back up the chief basis of the charges against him. The case is being watched closely by the European commission as a bellwether of Turkey’s overall political direction in the midst of its closely fought presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday. The newly submitted 15-page police report presents no evidence to show that Kılıç ever had the encrypted mobile messaging app ByLock on his phone, which Turkish authorities claim is used by followers of the exiled cleric Fethullah Gülen. The prosecution alleged that the presence of the app was sufficient grounds to charge him with terrorist offences last June.
Amnesty had previously commissioned two expert reports to show ByLock had never been on his phone, but the reports did not persuade the courts to release him. Kılıç is facing a further hearing on 21 June. The new police report – seen by Amnesty – details the forensic examinations carried out on Kılıç’s laptop, mobile phone, three USB sticks, a sim card and a memory card. The report concludes that “there is no evidence that falls within the parameters of the investigation” for each of the items under investigation. The presence of ByLock on a phone has been used by the Turkish authorities repeatedly as evidence to prove that the owner was part of a secret network of Gülenists accused of masterminding a failed coup against the Turkish state two years ago. Tens of thousands have lost their jobs or been imprisoned on allegations of being a Gülenist in the past two years. Salil Shetty, Amnesty International’s secretary general, said: “The failure to substantiate the accusation against Taner comes as no shock. What is shocking is that it has taken more than a year for this police report to be submitted, and during that time Taner has been locked behind bars. “Taner has become a potent symbol of what is happening in today’s Turkey, where many human rights defenders spend their days either languishing in jail or living in constant fear of being imprisoned for months or years. It is high time to end this relentless crackdown on human rights.” Kılıç was detained on 6 June last year and sent to jail three days later. Ten other activists, including İdil Eser, Amnesty Turkey’s director, were detained a month later. Eight of them were held for almost four months before being released on bail at their first hearing in October. In December, the Turkish authorities admitted that thousands of people had been wrongly accused of downloading ByLock. They published lists containing the numbers of 11,480 mobile phone users, leading to mass releases. Kılıç was not yet among those listed for release.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/turkey-new-police-report-raises-hopes-for-amnesty-chairs-release,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/turkey-new-police-report-raises-hopes-for-amnesty-chairs-release
2018-06-18T10:35:26Z,world,World news,Australian nun Sister Patricia Fox wins appeal to stay in Philippines,"There were tears of relief and joy at Sister Patricia Fox’s modest home in Quezon City, the Philippines, after it was announced her appeal against the withdrawal of her missionary visa had been successful. But the 71-year-old Australian nun remains under threat of deportation under a separate action that is still before the authorities and pending a decision. Late on Monday the Department of Justice announced that the Bureau of Immigration had erred in cancelling Fox’s missionary visa on the grounds of her political activism. Fox’s visa is now valid until September, when it expires. She plans to apply for a renewal.
The decision came as a shock to Fox and her lawyers, who earlier in the day were making plans for the opposite result. Fox said she was immensely relieved and “I nearly burst into tears. My fellow sisters are laughing and crying.” She said she would now unpack the bag that she has had awaiting a variety of possibilities, including jailing, deportation or “going to ground”. The secretary of the Department of Justice, Menardo Guevarra, earlier told the local Inquirer newspaper that the decision on Fox would be made on its merits, and that President Rodrigo Duterte had personally assured him that he would not interfere. He also said he had not sought guidance from the president. Fox’s lawyer, Jobart Pahliga, said that the decision was a “huge” victory not only for Fox but for the rule of law in the Philippines. He said the legal team was not yet dropping its guard, but was now optimistic that Fox would be able to stay at least until September. • Sign up to receive the top stories every morning
“We had assumed that because the president had acted against her that the Department would just go along with his whims,” he said. He said that the decision would also affect another 15 similar cases where the Bureau of Immigration had withdrawn visas from foreign nationals because of political activism. Most of those people had already been deported. “Without the outpouring of international support for Sister Fox none of this would have happened.” Before the decision, Pahliga said he had advised Fox not to go into hiding but instead to appear as prominently as possible in public. This morning she was addressing an ecumenical conference of bishops in central Manila. This evening she plans to attend a memorial service for Father Richmond Nilo, who was gunned down in front of his congregation eight days ago in a chapel in Zaragosa, in the province of Nueva Ecija, while preparing for mass. Nilo was the third priest to be killed in six months in the escalating tide of gun violence in the Philippines. Fox, who has been a missionary in the Philippines for 28 years, was arrested on the personal order of Duterte on 16 April and threatened with deportation, following her participation in a human rights fact-finding mission in the southern island of Mindanao earlier that month. Later, her missionary visa was cancelled by the Bureau of Immigration. It is this latter decision that has now been overturned. The deportation order has also been appealed, but no decision has been made.
Pahliga said it was not out of the question that Fox might be deported, but that if the government understood its own rules, this should not happen while there was an active appeal, and he now thought it unlikely. “If they do deport her, where is the rule of law in the Philippines today?” he said. Mindanao has been placed under martial law by Duterte on the grounds of terrorist threats from Islamic State sympathisers and the New People’s Army, the armed wing of the Communist Party. The fact-finding mission of which Sister Fox was part reported stories of extra-judicial killings of farmers, the violent breakup of unionism at the Coca Cola factory in Davao, and that Indigenous people and local peasants were being forced from their land to make way for mines and palm oil and banana plantations. The mission also heard that peasants were being forced into false confessions that they were members of the New People’s Army. Meanwhile the Catholic bishops’ conference of the Philippines this morning announced that it would not support allowing priests to carry guns in the wake of the recent shootings of priests Archbishop Romulo Valles said that arming priests was contrary to the teachings of Jesus to shun violence and “turn the other cheek”. Four days before Nilo was killed, Father Rey Urmenata was shot and wounded in Calamb City, Laguna province. In April Father Mark Ventura, known for his advocacy against mining, was gunned down and killed in Cagayan province. In December last year Father Marcelito Paez was shot dead in Jaen town, Nueva Ecija, after helping with the release of a political prisoner. The Catholic bishops also released a statement regarding the killing last year of three teenagers in the so-called “war on drugs”.
These cases, three among many, have caught the public’s imagination partly because of the youth of the victims, and partly because in one case CCTV footage and eyewitness statements contradicted the police version of events. Police claimed that Kian Loyd Delos Santos, 17, of Caloocan City, shot at them and was killed in self defence in August last year during a drug raid, but witnesses have claimed they saw police detain and restrain him, drag him in to a laneway and shoot him in the head. Two other Caloocan City teenagers, Carl Angelo Arnaiz, 19, and Reynaldo de Guzman, 14, were discovered dead within weeks of Delos Santos’s killing. The Catholic Bishops’ Conference released said in a statement “we are appalled by the remorselessness by which even the young are executed … The relentless and bloody campaign against drugs, that shows no sign of abating, impels your bishops to declare: ‘in the name of God stop the killings’.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/australian-nun-sister-patricia-fox-wins-appeal-to-stay-in-philippines,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/australian-nun-sister-patricia-fox-wins-appeal-to-stay-in-philippines
2018-06-18T10:20:15Z,world,World news,Iván Duque wins election to become Colombia's president,"Colombia has chosen Iván Duque, a conservative neophyte, to be its next president after a long and divisive campaign that often centred on a controversial peace process with leftist rebels the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc).
Duque, who opposes the peace deal, won in a second round runoff election on Sunday with 53.9% of the vote. His vanquished opponent, Bogotá’s former mayor Gustavo Petro – once a leftist militant himself – defends the peace process. Despite being the first leftist in the conservative country’s history to come so close to the presidency, he lost on the night, taking 41.8% of the vote. Many now worry about the fate of the fragile peace deal signed with the Farc in 2016, which formally ended 52 years of civil war that left 220,000 dead and seven million displaced.
That deal initially failed to pass a referendum with voters outraged by its guarantees of softer sentencing for rebel leaders and guaranteed seats in congress. It was later amended and ratified by lawmakers, a move some viewed as undemocratic. Sunday gave them another chance to voice their disquiet. Farc’s wartime leader, Rodrigo Londoño, tweeted after the result: “We have lived the quietest elections of the last decades, the peace process bears fruit. It is a moment of greatness and reconciliation, we respect the decision of the majorities and we congratulate the new president. Now to work, the roads of hope are open.” Duque promised on the campaign trail to modify the deal’s most contentious components, something that resonated with voters. On a clear Sunday morning in Bogotá’s central Ciudad Jardín neighbourhood, voters filed into a school repurposed as a voting station when polls opened at 8am. “I am voting for Ívan Duque,” said Marcelo Rodríguez, dressed in a Colombian football shirt. “I want peace but we can’t have it without justice.”
Others at the poll station were less convinced. “Amending a deal is the same as tearing it up,” said Andrea Gómez, a student. “Some people in Colombia won’t be happy without war.” Duque – who will turn 42 just before taking office on 8 August – will be Colombia’s youngest ever president, though his party, Democratic Center, has a coalition in Congress. He also has the backing of several industry leaders and, perhaps most importantly, ex-president Alvaro Uribe, still an immensely powerful – if divisive – figure in Colombian politics.
Uribe, who dealt severe military blows to the Farc during his tenure from 2002 to 2010, led the campaign against the peace deal in 2016’s referendum. He was Duque’s earliest champion for president, having persuaded his protege to leave a job at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington DC to fill a party senate seat in 2014. Duque’s opponents say is little more to than Uribe’s puppet, a charge particularly worrying given the hardline svengali’s authoritarian tendencies. While president, a state intelligence agency was shut down after Uribe used it to spy on the opposition, journalists and members of the supreme court. His military campaign against the rebels was marked by grave human rights abuses: thousands of civilians were murdered in order to falsely inflate combat statistics.
Both men denied the charge, and accused Petro of being the real threat to democracy. Uribe, after voting in Bogotá’s historic Plaza de Bolívar, said that Duque was the only bulwark against Petro’s “destructive socialism” – the same force he said has mired neighbouring Venezuela in economic and political turmoil. Petro was reluctant on the campaign trail to distance himself from Venezuela’s late president Hugo Chávez, and with 1 million Venezuelans having fled to Colombia, many here worry that Petro could bring a similar fate.
Duque’s market-friendly economic policies appealed to voters near the Venezuelan border, though younger and more moderate voters worry about his conservative social policies from drug policy and crime to abortion. The campaign was long and ugly, with stark polarisation revealed in the first round when Duque and Petro eliminated a handful of more moderate rivals. Now, Duque’s job will be build bridges between Colombians divided on ideology and the peace process, with the worst outcome being another flare up of civil war. “Polarisation is common in politics around the world,” Pedro Piedrahita Bustamente, a political science professor at the University of Medellín previously told the Guardian. “But here, where there is a history of internal armed conflict, it could be a dangerous thing.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/ivan-duque-wins-election-to-become-colombias-president,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/ivan-duque-wins-election-to-become-colombias-president
2018-06-18T08:11:09Z,world,World news,Osaka earthquake: three people dead after 6.1-magnitude tremor,"Three people have died and more than 200 others were injured after a powerful earthquake shook the Japanese coastal city of Osaka and nearby areas during the morning rush hour on Monday. The victims were named as Rina Miyake, a 9-year-old girl, and Minoru Yasui, an 80-year-old man, who died when they were hit by collapsing walls after the magnitude-6.1 quake struck just before 8am local time, media said. A second man, Motochika Goto, 85, was crushed by a falling bookcase at his home.
The quake, which did not trigger a tsunami, left more than 170,000 households without power in Osaka prefecture and neighbouring Hyogo prefecture, where an earthquake killed more than 6,400 people in the city of Kobe in January 1995. Monday’s earthquake was of a relatively low magnitude but caused violent shaking due to its shallow depth of 13km. It registered up to a lower-6 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 0 to 7. Quakes of a lower-6 intensity make it hard for people to stay on their feet and can topple unsecured furniture and other items. Officials warned of possible strong aftershocks. “There are fears that the risk of house collapses and landslides has increased in the areas shaken strongly,” said Toshiyuki Matsumori of the country’s meteorological agency. “Please make sure that you are fully on alert about seismic activities and information on rainfall, and stay clear of dangerous places.” Experts said the earthquake could have involved a fault that has not moved for more than 10,000 years. “We may have to consider the possibility of even greater earthquakes following, as happened in the quakes in Kumamoto,” Kyodo news quoted Shinji Toda, an earthquake geology professor at Tohoku University, as saying. Dozens of people were killed in Kumamoto in south-western Japan in April 2016 after two powerful earthquakes struck within two days of each other. TV coverage of the immediate aftermath of the Osaka quake showed ruptured underground pipes spewing water on to the street, while firefighters were seen tackling a blaze at a home on the city’s northern outskirts. A number of other fires were reported. Kansai Electric Power said no irregularities had been detected at three nuclear plants in the region. Several rail services were suspended, including the bullet train. Television images showed passengers getting off trains and walking along the tracks between stations. The car manufacturer Daihatsu said it had suspended operations at its plants in Osaka and nearby Kyoto, while the consumer electronics firm Sharp said its factories were operating normally. “I saw the ceiling and the floor undulating, and I could barely stand. I was very scared,” Katsufumi Abe, who was at Osaka’s main railway station when the quake struck, told Kyodo.
The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said the government was assessing the damage and that its priority was to rescue anyone trapped inside buildings. He said he had instructed officials to “swiftly collect information on the damage, do their utmost to rescue people and save lives… and provide timely information to the public”. An American visitor to the city described being woken up by violent shaking. “We were sleeping and it woke us up abruptly,” Kate Kilpatrick, who was staying in a hotel in Osaka, told Reuters. “It was so terrifying because this is my first earthquake. I thought it was a nightmare because I was so confused. The whole world was aggressively shaking.” Some residents said their homes had not suffered structural damage but that the shaking had sent objects flying off shelves. Monday’s earthquake was the third measuring higher than magnitude-4 to have struck Japan – one of the world’s most seismically active countries – in recent days. In March 2011, a magnitude-9 earthquake triggered a tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people along Japan’s north-east coast.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/osaka-earthquake-japan-61-magnitude-tremor,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/osaka-earthquake-japan-61-magnitude-tremor
2018-06-18T06:00:36Z,world,World news,The good men: inside the all-male group taking on modern masculinity,"On a warm Tuesday evening, a dozen men gathered on couches at a Lululemon location in Toronto called The Local. Since last year, as an experiment to reach more male customers, the store has been home to The Huddle, a male bonding group which meets Tuesday nights after closing to work out, run, or meditate. But once a month, the men circle up to talk about, well, their feelings.
Downtempo jazz and cartons of maple sap water greeted me as I plunked myself down next to a young man who recently quit his job to become a freelance cinematographer. The evening’s facilitator, Alex Cameron, a man with hulking, tattoo-plastered arms and slicked-back salt-and-pepper hair, told us the theme for this session: emotional literacy. Cameron, who is 40, runs a psychotherapy practice nearby. To start off, Joe, a slight man in a hoodie, volunteered a story about how he came to realize that vulnerability was a strength rather than weakness. “I’ve never shared this in front of a group before,” said Joe, 34, who told us the story of his mother passing away when he was three; how his dad became hardened and distant; and how, at the age of 27, he found himself in deep depression. “I was single, in a job I hated, with very few friends I could count on. I felt like we are all going to die anyways, so what’s the purpose of trying?” Uncovering blocked emotions, Joe told us, saved his life. “I realized if I wasn’t going to take my life, I had to go back in time and work through my feelings. I was a 27-year-old living in a little boy’s trauma. I needed to prove to myself that it was safe to feel again.”
We went around the circle sharing whatever came to mind about manhood, emotions, relationships, Donald Trump, Justin Trudeau, Jordan Peterson, the fact that most mass shootings are committed by socially isolated white men. “Conversations with other men are usually very superficial,” said Marvin, a transplant from Germany who works at an ad agency. “It’s always about sex and money,” the man next to him added. (Some of the participants declined to be named for this story.) “Like, ‘Oh, I got laid last night’. It gets boring.” “It’s not only fucking boring, it’s unhealthy,” said Marvin. “Most men suffer alone.” The discussion shifted to the meaning of anger. “I played football growing up and I learned that, as a man, you kept things inside so you could use them as a weapon. But emotions are energy and they have to move, they have to be released,” said Chris, who recently returned from a chakra retreat in Belize. Many men never learn “how to release that energy without using force”. “Anger is like an iceberg,” Alex Cameron, the therapist leading the session, told us. “Anger is what you see, but it comes from everything else below the surface – shame, fear, guilt. For most men, it feels safer to get angry than express sadness or vulnerability.” He wrapped up on a more personal note. “When I feel vulnerable, I cry. It looks like sadness on the outside, but it feels powerful.” Liberation from boys being boys I’ve dropped in on The Huddle several times over the past six months. One meeting focused on mental health and substance abuse; a former drug addict shared the story of his attempted suicide and recent recovery. Another served as a #MeToo confessional. “I bet every man in here has a story about how they’ve mistreated a woman,” the facilitator prodded. After a deafening silence, one man threw up his hands. “I know I’ve done some foul shit.” I met a Reiki healer, a construction worker, a former professional soccer player, a gym owner, a bartender, and several social workers. The group appeared to attract mainly straight, unmarried men in their thirties who share interest in fashion, athletics, and wellness trends; the tattoo quotient of the participants was high. In a nation, and a neighborhood, that is predominantly white, The Huddle crowd skews about 50% black. Lululemon’s dive into the murk of modern masculinity is a hipster-approved strand in a longer lineage of male reckoning. Alongside the din of women’s lib in the late 1960s was the lesser known men’s liberation movement. “Male liberation calls for men to free themselves from the sex role stereotypes that limit their ability to be human,” wrote psychologist Jack Sawyer, an early proponent, in a 1970 issue of Liberation magazine. “The battle of women to be free need not be a battle against men as oppressors. The choice about whether men are the enemy is up to men themselves.”
Today the pro-feminist men’s movement champions causes ranging from reducing violence against women to raising awareness about male suicide and prostate cancer. Adherents dwell in gender studies programs, social justice groups, and mental health organizations—and in small groups of men who gather in coffee shops and living rooms for heartfelt talk. Pro-feminist masculinity has remained relatively obscure, though #MeToo may be changing that. “It’s allowed male feminists like myself to come out of the shadows,” Michael Kehler, a University of Calgary masculinities studies professor, told me by phone. His career, after two decades of “quiet, diligent work to move this agenda forward,” has flowered with media requests and speaking engagements. In January, Kehler became North America’s first masculinities studies research chair. “Until recently, there was an allowance, or even an expectation, for men to behave badly, like it was a natural way of being,” Kehler said. “[I]t was written off as ‘boys being boys’ or ‘that’s just locker room talk’. If you didn’t talk about sports or engage in sexualizing banter, other men might question the adequacy of your masculinity.” Kehler believes this older breed of masculinity is dying. Some evidence, however, suggests otherwise. Pro-feminist men feel that by modulating hypermasculinity, and ceding a wider wedge of societal power to women, they can clear a path to male enlightenment – something good for men and women. But a countermovement has gained steam. Known as the men’s rights movement, these ad-hoc, mainly internet-based activists are resistant to policies promoting women’s equality and to the men-as-oppressors narrative generally. Oddly enough, the movement’s ideological godfather, Warren Farrell, was a well-known male feminist in the seventies who marched alongside Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem. By the time Farrell’s 1993 book The Myth of Male Power arrived on shelves, his metamorphosis was complete: “What we, as feminists, did is put men into the oppressor class and called it patriarchy,” he once said of his previous self. While some strands of the men’s rights movement tout their efforts to provide men’s shelters, male-centric mental health services, and legal support in paternity cases, others are openly misogynist. “Pussy is the only real empowerment women will ever know,” wrote Paul Elam, the founder of AVoiceForMen.com, to promote the website’s “slap-a-violent-bitch month” in 2017. “Put all the hopelessly wishful thinking of feminist ideology aside and what remains is the fact that it is men and pretty much men only who draw power from accomplishment, who invent technology, build nations, cure disease, create empires and generally advance civilization.” Elam’s online community has been deemed a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. ReturnOfKings.com, a blog for “pickup artists” (men focused on manipulating women into sex), has also earned this distinction. The website’s founder, Daryush Valizadeh, even suggested rape should be legal “if done on private property”. Also in the constellation of men’s rights groups are “incels” – men who blame women for their inability to attract a mate. (The word is a contraction of “involuntary celibate”.) The online subculture reached notoriety in April when 25-year-old Alek Minassian drove into two dozen pedestrians in Toronto. Eight of the 10 killed were women. “The Incel Rebellion has already begun,” Minassian posted on Facebook moments before he rammed his rental van into a Yonge Street sidewalk. ‘Black kids can’t afford therapy - we have to fix ourselves’ Jahmal Padmore, one of the organizers of The Huddle, believes that blaming women, or anyone, does not dissolve one’s woes so much as harden them. The bespectacled, well-muscled 34-year-old gently badgers his male friends to show up for The Huddle because he knows firsthand how difficult it is to reach out for support. “Black kids can’t afford therapy – if we’re going to get fixed, we have to do it ourselves,” Padmore, the son of Antiguan immigrants, told me. “So I just went on YouTube and watched a lot of personal development videos.” Padmore’s craving for self-discovery accelerated as he approached his 30th birthday. He was drinking heavily and had some brushes with mental illness. One day he came across a series of videos by the University of Toronto psychology professor Jordan Peterson, focused on men’s pain. Padmore was hooked – briefly.
“Peterson talked about finding your personal capacity within. I love that, that’s real, that’s what a lot of young men are looking for. When guys are maturing and coming to terms with the fact that they’re not going to be an NBA star, or whatever dreams or expectations they had aren’t being fulfilled, it can be painful. And because we’re men, we’re socialized to not express those feelings of frustration in a healthy way.” In the early 2010s, the eccentric professor was known for TedX talks with innocuous, New Age titles like “Potential” and “Redefining Reality”. But Peterson also had a reputation for blistering attacks on male laziness – “Clean up your room!” he often barks at his young followers – and criticizing political correctness.
In 2016 Peterson’s viral popularity exploded after he protested Bill C-16, legislation adding gender identity to the characteristics protected by Canadian anti-discrimination law. The publication of his book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos in January this year vaulted Peterson into international stardom. While Peterson maintains the persona of a self-help guru styled as a stern but loving father figure – “To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life,” he writes – the threads of intolerance in his work, and the rhetoric of some of his followers, teeter toward hate. In a recent New York Times profile, Peterson surmised that the Toronto van attacker “was angry at God because women were rejecting him”. He suggested “enforced monogamy” as a societal cure for incels and other disgruntled young men. Peterson has never hidden his view that women should submit to conventional gender roles, but in May he published a chummy 90-minute interview with Warren Farrell, cementing his affinity with the men’s rights movement. Padmore sensed these threads years before they were making headlines. “The problem I have with Jordan Peterson and his ilk is that, for them, finding your personal [capabilities] comes at the expense of others. I have a huge issue with the tendency to blame women and trans people and anyone that doesn’t conform. Go deep, try to find out more about yourself – of course – but don’t drag other people down.” Another reason he quickly fell from the orbit of Peterson’s charisma: “I’m black.” Peterson’s fan base, which is 84 % male according to the data analytics firm Zoomph, is well-steeped in racist alt-right culture. He does not endorse the extreme right-wing movement, but it’s no coincidence that it has largely endorsed him, while the pro-feminist men’s movement has not. But can Lululemon make it cool?
Doing pro-feminist men’s work under corporate auspices comes with certain pitfalls. The Huddle is free of charge, but when Padmore shouts “Hit me up if you want a discount on some stretchy pants,” one can’t but feel like the target of a sophisticated marketing scheme. The corporation in question also has some skeletons in its closet. “You know, feminists really hate Lululemon,” my wife said when I mentioned The Huddle. She referred me to an article urging women to “drop [their] Lululemon obsession”. Lululemon’s founder, Chip Wilson, once suggested that breast cancer rates rose in the nineties because of “cigarette-smoking Power Women who were on the pill…and taking on the stress previously left to men in the working world”. He said that Lululemon clothing was not for plus-sized or even average-sized women. In 2015, after being forced to recall a number of yoga pants with a conspicuous defect – they became see-through in the crotch after a short period of use – Wilson resigned. In 2016, a supervisor at a Lululemon in California was accused of raping a female co-worker. The victim’s lawsuit painted the company as a haven for sexual predators – a place, BuzzFeed wrote, “where women are encouraged to wear tight clothes to work, lewd comments go unchecked, and hookups between bosses and subordinates are accepted as par for the course after a wild night of drinking”. This February, Wilson’s replacement as CEO, Laurent Potdevin, was also forced out for misconduct, possibly because of a relationship with a subordinate. (Further details have not yet emerged.) When I contacted Lululemon headquarters to ask how the company reconciled its brand identity as a beacon of yogic enlightenment with its reputation as a bastion of toxic masculinity, a PR rep supplied me with a statement attributed to Ben Stubbington, senior vice president of men’s design: “At Lululemon we ‘live in practice’. This is translated literally on the yoga mat and also in all ways we walk in life. […] As the definitions of masculinity constantly evolve in society, we embrace deconstructing its traditional confines, working to the principle that addressing vulnerability is a strength and has immense power to give back.” Padmore, unwilling to defend the company, took a more prosaic stance. “I’m not particularly concerned with Lululemon’s past, present, or future image; I’m concerned with showing up and doing things that impact people’s lives in a positive way.” He said he hasn’t seen any signs of a culture of toxic masculinity at the company since being hired a year ago. The righteous aren’t immune to hypocrisy, he added. “I think a lot of liberal white folks get caught up in perfection. You’re going to make mistakes, you’re going to fuck up. But I think you have to be okay with that and keep pushing forward.” If the various men’s movement subcultures are in competition for followers, the pro-feminist folks are losing badly. Jordan Peterson has 1.2 million followers on YouTube and more than 700,000 on Twitter. Prominent pro-feminist male personalities count four or five digits at most. Jeff Perera, a figure in Toronto’s pro-feminist men’s community, told me he hasn’t won any converts from the Peterson camp, but has occasionally lost friends who “converted to the other side”. “We put out a lot of statistics about the unfortunate realities women go through, which are important for men to hear,” Perera said. “The problem is a lot of men don’t want to hear some expert telling them what a shitty person they are. They’re like, ‘Yeah, I wasn’t planning on raping anyone today, so peace out’.” Around the time Trump was elected, Perera, 42, worked part-time for Next Gen Men, a non-profit that works with teenage boys to get them thinking outside the gender box. During one afterschool program at an elite prep school outside Toronto, the conversation, Perera recalled, turned to the new US president. “I described him as the ‘televangelist of toxic masculinity’. I said to the guys, ‘He’s like Cobra Commander from GI Joe – he has to have his supervillain logo on everything from his helicopter to his evil headquarters at Trump Tower’. One of the boys looked at me with kind of a deadpan stare, and was like, ‘That’s actually kind of cool’. It was this moment where I had a crisis of faith. I realized that the movement is failing.” The coolness quotient of the pro-feminist men’s world, at least in the eyes of the average adolescent male, is rather low. Attendees of the annual conference put on by the National Organization of Men Against Sexism are likely to be treated to rousing renditions of songs like “Let the Woman In You Come Through” or “Womb Envy”. One can imagine howls of laughter from 16-year-olds forced to sing along to “It’s Only A Wee-Wee, So What’s the Big Deal?” Which is why it may not be a bad thing for a trendy, globally recognized brand, however imperfect, to take up the torch. Jian Pablico, who originated The Huddle at Lululemon’s Vancouver headquarters, told me his role as a “mindful performance manager” is to “curate” non-traditional masculinity for “men who may not be part of that culture yet”. That’s why the touchy-feely talks are held only one day a month. “We wanted to find a way to bring people together who might be hesitant about showing up for a conversation on vulnerability,” Pablico said. “Sweating together first helps it come naturally. Once you suffer together in a workout, you begin to bond and a layer of the mask comes off. It’s then a little easier to chat afterwards over a beer. Or a kombucha.” *** Jordan Peterson views feminism as an emasculating force. He believes men ought to be allowed to be unapologetically tough, ambitious, competitive, and forceful. But no one in the pro-feminist camp has really suggested that men can’t be tough, ambitious, competitive, or forceful – only that it is unhealthy to suppress other ways of being. After his Huddle session on emotional literacy, Alex Cameron, the therapist, showed me his tattoos. I’d assumed they were a relic from some previous life as a bouncer or lumberjack. It turns out he got them on graduating his master’s in social work. One arm depicts a dragon, symbol of virility; the other, a phoenix, which in Chinese mythology signifies feminine grace.“We have opposing sides within us,” Cameron said. Harmony, he believes, must come from “embracing our entire self”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/the-good-men-inside-the-all-male-group-taking-on-modern-masculinity,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/the-good-men-inside-the-all-male-group-taking-on-modern-masculinity
2018-06-18T05:27:53Z,world,World news,"Monday briefing: NHS windfall is 'Brexit dividend tosh', says Tory MP","Top story: May’s claim draws fire Hello, this is Alison Rourke with the top stories to start your week. Theresa May has come under fire for promising that a Brexit windfall will provide an extra £400m a week for the NHS. May – who will pledge an extra £20bn in annual real terms from 2023-24 in a major speech – has been ridiculed for linking the money to Brexit savings. “At the moment, as a member of the European Union, every year we spend significant amounts of money on our subscription, if you like, to the EU,” she said on BBC One’s Andrew Marr show. “When we leave we won’t be doing that.” Two senior Tory MPs, who are also doctors, took aim at May: “The Brexit dividend tosh was expected but treats the public as fools. Sad to see Govt slide to populist arguments rather than evidence on such an important issues,” tweeted Sarah Wallaston, who chairs the Commons health and social care committee. Dr Philip Lee, MP for Bracknell, tweeted: “There is no evidence yet that there will be a ‘Brexit dividend’ – so it’s tax rises, more borrowing or both.” The PM’s decision to frame extra spending specifically as a benefit of leaving the EU has been widely seen as a sop to hardline Brexiters in her cabinet, echoing Boris Johnson’s suggestion during the EU referendum that Brexit would free up £350m a week extra for the NHS. * * * Melania Trump speaks out– The First Lady has spoken out against children being held separately from their parents at the US-Mexico border, in a rare public statement at odds with her husband’s hard-line on immigration. “Mrs Trump hates to see children separated from their families,” a spokesperson said. “We need to be a country that follows all laws”, but also one “that governs with heart”. The unusual public intervention from Melania Trump came as reports emerged of immigrant children being held in cages created out of metal fencing at a warehouse in Texas, after being separated from their parents. One cage had 20 children inside. * * * Russia’s nuclear bunker – Vladimir Putin appears to have upgraded a nuclear weapons storage bunker in the country’s Kaliningrad enclave, which lies between Poland and Lithuania. In the latest sign of Moscow’s increased emphasis on nuclear arms in its standoff with Nato, the Federation of American Scientists will publish satellite images on Monday, which the organisation says will show the facility being deepened and covered with a new concrete roof in recent months. “It has all the fingerprints of typical Russian nuclear weapons storage sites,” said Hans Kristensen, the director of the nuclear information project at FAS. * * * Refugee suicides raise alarm – At least three teenage refugees arriving in Britain from Calais’s migrant camp in the last six months have killed themselves. Three young men from Eritrea, two aged 18 and one aged 19, took their own lives in London, all having fled conflict without their parents. The lawyer for one of the refugees has called for the coroner to examine the actions of the local authorities responsible for him, the adequacy of his accommodation, of the age assessments, and of access to mental health services. * * * David Dimbleby calls time – David Dimbleby will step down as chair of the BBC’s Question Time after 25 years. But the veteran presenter, who turns 80 this year, said he had no plans to retire from journalism. “Instead, after years in the studio, I now plan to return to my first love: reporting,” he said. Speculation has begun as to who will replace him in December, with leading internal candidates including Today hosts Mishal Husain and Nick Robinson, as well as Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis and Kirsty Wark. * * * Windrush Day – An annual celebration of the Windrush generation and their descendants will be held on 22 June – the day the MV Empire Windrush arrived in Tilbury Docks in 1948, carrying about 500 migrants. The communities minister, Lord Bourne, said the annual event would help to “recognise and honour the enormous contribution” of those who arrived between 1948 and 1971. The move comes after the Guardian revealed how some members of the Windrush generation and their children were wrongly detained and deported and others were denied access to healthcare, work, housing benefits and pensions. * * * World Cup Here we go again. Strap yourselves in for the ride: England’s long-awaited campaign finally kicks off today, against Tunisia in the Volgograd Arena. Nothing changes when it comes to the raised expectations surrounding England on the eve of another World Cup adventure – Tunisia coach Nabil Maâloul said England could win the tournament – but Gareth Southgate is at least aiming to change the perception of English football as he sends his young, vibrant team out in Russia.
In Moscow, Joachim Löw accepted his defending champions had been “negligent” and “haphazard” after Germany’s Group F defeat against Mexico – one of the North American nation’s greatest victories – while it didn’t go to script for Brazil either; the five-times world champions were held by Switzerland in their opening match. And in Mexico City, jubilant fans set off earthquake sensors as they celebrated their team’s winning goal in their match against Germany. Highly sensitive earthquake sensors registered tremors at two sites, seven seconds after the game’s 35th minute, when star player Hirving Lozano scored.

Maybe you’re not getting enough sleep. As Nic Fleming writes, there’s substantial evidence that REM (rapid eye movement sleep – the sleep that dominates in the hours before waking) plays a vital part in consolidating memories relating to learning motor skills, such as learning to play a musical instrument or ride a bike.
Learning a complex new skill can also lead to significant improvements in episodic memory tests. And if you’re not convinced by either of those, thinking positive appears to boost memory performance. * * * Sport Brooks Koepka made history by becoming just the third man since the war to win back-to-back US Open titles after holding off Tommy Fleetwood to retain the crown at Shinnecock Hills.

There is one story dominating the front pages today – Theresa May’s promise of extra funding for the NHS, a claim many of the papers are sceptical of. “May under fire for claim ‘Brexit dividend’ will fund NHS windfall,” says the Guardian. “Black hole in May’s cash plan for NHS,” is the Times’ take, while the FT has: “May faces Tory backlash over funding of £20bn NHS boost”. The Telegraph is worried about a “Stealth tax to pay for NHS boost”. Meanwhile the Daily Mail reports the story, but turns its critical attention onto the NHS, saying May was warned that “NHS waste” must be cut as spending was increased, with “Let’s go to war on NHS waste”.

2018-06-18T05:00:34Z,world,World news,Kaliningrad photos appear to show Russia upgrading nuclear weapons bunker,"Russia appears to have upgraded a nuclear weapons storage bunker in its Kaliningrad enclave, in the latest sign of Moscow’s increased emphasis on nuclear arms in its standoff with Nato, according to a new report. The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) has published satellite images which the group says show a storage facility in the Baltic coast enclave between Poland and Lithuania being deepened and then covered with a new concrete roof in recent months. “It has all the fingerprints of typical Russian nuclear weapons storage sites,” said Hans Kristensen, the director of the nuclear information project at FAS. “There is a heavy-duty external perimeter of multilayered fencing. The bunkers themselves have triple fencing around them as well. These are typical features from all the other nuclear weapons storage sites that we know about in Russia.”
The work on the bunker began in 2016, and the new roof was put on earlier in the summer. “It’s a site we have been monitoring for quite some time and there have been and there have been some upgrades in the past but nothing as dramatic as this one. This is the first time we’ve seen one of the nuclear bunkers being excavated and apparently renovated,” Kristensen said. “These pictures don’t prove that there are nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad now, but they do show it is an active site,” Kristensen said.
He said it was unclear whether the Russian military already had nuclear warheads at the site, or that they are about to bring them in, or whether the facility was being upgraded so that nuclear weapons could be moved in at short notice. Kaliningrad, formerly the East Prussian outpost of Königsberg, is currently in the public eye as one of the venues for the football World Cup. It is also emerging as a critical square on the east European chessboard in Vladimir Putin’s efforts to push back assertively against Nato expansion. The Russian military announced in January this year that the necessary infrastructure had been built to accommodate a permanent presence of mobile Iskander-M missiles, capable of carrying conventional and nuclear warheads a range of 500km. The missiles were due to be combat ready early this year.
The US says that because of their range, the Iskanders represent a violation of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. Kaliningrad also serves as a base for Russia’s Baltic fleet. Unlike Nato, the Russian military, particularly its navy, has kept many of its tactical weapons systems nuclear capable, including anti-ship missiles, short range land-attack missiles and even air defences. As tensions with the west have escalated over Ukraine and Syria, Putin has put more emphasis on Russia’s nuclear arsenal. In March this year, Putin unveiled a range of new nuclear weapon designs which he claimed could overcome any western defences. Kristensen said it was unclear what kind of warheads the renovated bunker in Kaliningrad is meant to serve, but it is much closer to the naval base than the missile base, which is further inland.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/kaliningrad-nuclear-bunker-russia-satellite-photos-report,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/kaliningrad-nuclear-bunker-russia-satellite-photos-report
2018-06-18T04:59:31Z,world,World news,'The fool builds walls': China takes aim at Trump trade war threats,"Chinese state media has attacked the White House for escalating the prospect of a trade war, calling the administration of president Donald Trump “selfish” and “rude” and “mundane” in its capriciousness.
“The unpredictability of [the] Trump administration has become mundane, or even boring for China,” an editorial in the state-run tabloid Global Times said on Sunday. “It reinforces the difference in images of the two countries: one challenges the foundation of global trade through sudden attacks; and one that is prepared to defend itself in a trade war that it cannot avoid.” After months of negotiations, China and the US are on the brink of an all-out trade war. On Friday, the US unveiled a list of $50bn in Chinese goods to target with 25% tariffs, pledging more duties if China retaliated. Within hours China released its own list of retaliatory tariffs to place on $50bn in US imports. An editorial in the People’s Daily on Saturday said the latest trade provocations allowed China “to see more clearly the face of the Trump administration, one that is rude, unreasonable, selfish and headstrong”. China’s official Xinhua news agency added: “The wise man builds bridges, the fool builds walls. With economic globalisation there are no secluded and isolated islands.” China’s proposed tariffs on more than 500 categories of US goods, a list more extensive than the one it released in April, appear aimed at hurting Trump’s Republican base before the US midterm elections in November. The list includes beef, poultry, pork, dairy products, seafood, tobacco and soybeans. China is the largest buyer of US soybeans. Beijing said it would also target $16bn of US products like coal, crude oil, natural gas, and medical equipment at a later date. The situation could still escalate. US trade representative Robert Lighthizer has said the White House will release a plan by the end of the month on restricting Chinese investment in the US and limiting Chinese purchases of advanced technology from the country. Trump has said he would triple the value of Chinese imports subjected to tariffs to $150bn. Other levers Beijing has already begun to employ include extra inspections on current US imports into China. “The economic damage of the tariffs announced so far won’t be too big in the scheme of things. But that could quickly change,” said Roland Rajah, the director of the international economy programme at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. Chinese state media still left room for the possibility of negotiations. “Given the frequent flip-flopping of the Donald Trump administration, it is still too early to conclude that a trade war will start,” said an English-language editorial in the China Daily.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/china-trump-trade-war-threats-the-fool-builds-walls-media,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/china-trump-trade-war-threats-the-fool-builds-walls-media
2018-06-18T04:00:35Z,world,World news,Barcelona calls for extra state aid to help settle Aquarius arrivals,"Barcelona city council has said more state aid will be needed to help settle refugees and migrants as the Catalan capital prepares to take in 100 people from the rescue ship Aquarius. Ignasi Calbó, the co-ordinator of the Barcelona City of Refugees programme, said that Pedro Sánchez’s new Socialist government needed to back up its humanitarian gesture with money and policies. “If it’s committed on the issue of refugees, the Sánchez government has no option but to provide resources,” he said. “There could be 300 more Aquarius this year so there needs to be a consistent policy.” The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, also called earlier this week for the central government to fulfil its obligations. “Cities can’t do it all themselves. We need policies and resources that allow us to plan for this,” she said. Since the Barcelona City of Refugees plan was launched in 2015, the city council has spent €6m (£5.2m) attending to 11,600 refugees and illegal immigrants. Colau has asked the new Madrid government to re-establish the €200m refugee reception fund that was abolished in 2011. “The government’s gesture has to be accompanied by resources,” Calbó said. “We’ve had 10 years of the People’s party who have done nothing to deal with refugees and immigration and have done nothing for the cities that are in the frontline when it comes to migration.”
It will fall to the city’s Service Centre For Immigrants, Emigrants And Refugees) to accommodate and arrange schooling for the new arrivals. The state has an obligation to provide housing via NGOs for the first 12 months, which can be extended to two years in the most vulnerable cases. If the refugees have learnt the language and found work by the end of that time, they become legal residents like any other immigrant. If they do not, and jobs are scarce, they have to rely on organisations such as Caritas, the Catholic church’s charitable wing. “It’s going to be difficult to find places for these people,” a spokeswoman for Caritas’s immigration programme said. “We have emergency housing for 85 people but all the places are occupied.” Another 80 places offered by the city authorities are also full. How many of the 100-plus unaccompanied minors on board the Aquarius will arrive in Barcelona remains to be seen, but the city already hosts about 2,000, mainly from Morocco. There is a chronic shortage of resources to help these young people, many of whom end up living precariously on the street, often resorting to crime in order to survive. Much of the burden again falls on the voluntary sector, but Caritas has facilities to house just 10 minors. The new Spanish government has been praised for taking in the 630 people aboard the Aquarius, but the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has said the country face “another very challenging year” as people cross the Mediterranean in search of refuge and a better life. Figures from the International Organisation for Migration show that 8,309 migrants and refugees have reached Spain by sea so far this year, and 240 have died en route. Last year, 21,468 refugees and migrants arrived by crossing the Mediterranean, and 224 people died on the journey. The 2017 figures were a threefold increase on the previous year. María Jesús Vega, a spokeswoman for UNHCR Spain, said the agency applauded the government’s decision to help the migrants and refugees on board the Aquarius. She also said the strong and positive response from regional governments, city councils and civil society groups could pave the way for a necessary review of how Spain deals with migrants and asylum seekers. “This could be an excellent opportunity to reconsider the national strategy on managing arrivals,” she said. “We’re seeing coordination mechanisms that allow regional and autonomous governments to participate in the process of taking in people. That’s the direction we need to go in when it comes to dealing with the challenges of the current situation, of which there are many.” UNHCR has previously called for closer coordination between government departments, police, maritime rescue services and NGOs, and improvements to the infrastructure for registering, identifying and protecting new arrivals. José Javier Sánchez Espinosa, the deputy director for migration at the Spanish Red Cross, said the challenges embodied by the plight of the Aquarius required an international response. “It’s not just a problem with Europe’s southern border or Spain’s, or with the Aquarius,” he said. “It’s a phenomenon that calls for a European solution at the very least. It’s about long-term global inequalities when it comes to economics and security.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/barcelona-calls-for-extra-state-aid-to-help-settle-aquarius-arrivals,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/barcelona-calls-for-extra-state-aid-to-help-settle-aquarius-arrivals
2018-06-18T04:00:35Z,world,World news,Turkey elections 2018: everything you need to know,"What is happening in Turkey? The country will hold presidential and parliamentary elections on 24 June. If no candidate wins an outright majority in the first round of the presidential elections, a second round will be held on 8 July between the top two candidates in the race. Why are the elections being held now? The elections were supposed to be in November 2019. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, however, called for early elections back in April. He said that Turkey needed to “overcome uncertainty” at a troubled time in the region, amid its ongoing military operations in Syria and Iraq. Critics, however, say the race was brought forward because Turkey’s currency and economy are suffering and the president wanted to preempt the downward trend. He may also be hoping to capitalise on nationalist sentiment after military victory in Syria, where rebels backed by Turkey defeated Kurdish militias near the border in a region called Afrin. Why are these elections important? This is arguably the most important election in Turkey’s modern history. The new president will assume an office imbued with sweeping executive powers that voters narrowly approved in a constitutional referendum last year. These include the power to issue decrees with the force of law, appoint the cabinet and vice-presidents as well as senior judges. If he wins, Erdoğan will continue to shape Turkey and its society for years to come. Who is running for president? Erdoğan, of course. He remains the most popular political leader in Turkey. But he faces several important opponents who have done unexpectedly well so far in the campaign, and, as a result, a second-round contest is now the most likely outcome. There is Muharrem İnce, a charismatic physics teacher who is the candidate of the main opposition group, the Republican People’s party (CHP), and Meral Akşener, nicknamed the ‘she-wolf’. She is the leader of the new nationalist Iyi (Good) party and is popular with both youth and working-class Turks. Temel Karamollaoğlu, the leader of the Islamist Felicity party, is also running, and has emerged as a key critic of Erdoğan even though their parties share ideological roots. Selahattin Demirtaş, a charismatic politician once dubbed the ‘Kurdish Obama’ and who leads the leftist and Kurdish issue-oriented People’s Democratic party (HDP), is running for the presidency from his prison cell in the city of Edirne. He awaits trial on terrorism charges. What’s happening in parliament? There are two main coalitions running for parliament. The first includes the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) of Erdoğan, which are in a coalition with the nationalists. On the opposite side is an alliance that includes the secularists of the CHP, the breakaway nationalists of the Iyi party, and the Islamists of the Felicity party. They make strange bedfellows in a political system where secularists and Islamists have traditionally been bitter enemies, but such is the importance of these elections that former rivals have banded together to oust the president and his entourage. The HDP is running by itself. The Turkish constitution requires that parties obtain at least 10% of the national vote to enter parliament, a law that favours larger parties. A new bill recently allowed the formation of election alliances like those described above, which will allow smaller parties like Felicity to win some seats in the legislature if their alliance as a whole crosses the 10% threshold. If the opposition alliance performs as expected, and the HDP gets over 10% of the popular vote, the ruling AKP could lose its majority in parliament. So who will win? Erdoğan was hoping to catch his opponents by surprise when he called for a vote, but attendance at ruling party rallies has been lacklustre, and the Turkish leader does not appear to be at the top of his game. The economy has also caused headaches, with the Turkish lira falling in value against the dollar, concerns mounting over the long-term health of the economy, and fears over the Central Bank’s independence. Still, Erdoğan is the most popular Turkish politician, and is likely to win the presidential race. Polls are notoriously unreliable in Turkey, but for now it looks like he will easily win the first round, but without an outright majority. A second-round race against Ince or Aksener still favours the president, but is increasingly looking too close to call. It will depend on whether the opposition can draw away conservative and nationalist voters, as well as Kurdish voters angry about Erdogan’s alliance with the nationalists. Also, there is a very real possibility that Erdoğan will win the presidency but lose parliament to the opposition, which has promised to roll back the constitutional amendments passed last year. But, under those same amendments, the president can dissolve parliament, and the legislature can call new presidential elections in response. According to some ruling party officials, that’s exactly what Erdoğan might do, which would give his party a chance at a do-over, but plunge Turkey into uncertainty.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/turkey-elections-2018-everything-you-need-to-know,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/turkey-elections-2018-everything-you-need-to-know
2018-06-18T04:00:34Z,world,World news,Turkey's Islamists and secularists join forces in bid to unseat Erdoğan,"The leader of Turkey’s largest Islamist party rattled off what he believes to be the failures of president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government: a high unemployment rate, a widening trade deficit, a chaotic foreign policy, a stalled European Union membership application and a state of emergency since the failed 2016 coup – all of which have damaged fundamental rights and freedoms. Temel Karamollaoğlu, the Manchester-educated head of the Saadet (Felicity) party, says it is for these reasons and more that he is running for president. He has also allied with staunch secularists in the race for parliament – a coalition that would have been unimaginable a decade ago. Two weeks before presidential and parliamentary elections, the race is unexpectedly tightening. Although Erdoğan remains the most powerful and popular politician in Turkey, his opponents have performed exceptionally well in opinion polls, with recent ones suggesting the legislative hold of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) could be broken. In an environment of declining freedom of expression and purges of dissidents as well as growing displays of public piety in a country where secularism is enshrined in its founding principles, a consistent voice of opposition has emerged from an unlikely quarter. Islamists, who were once ideological allies of the president, have joined the alliance trying to weaken his hold on power. “The policies that Erdoğan or his government are following do not help Turkey stand up on her own feet in almost all aspects and policies, whether economic or foreign policies,” Karamollaoğlu told the Guardian. “His method of approach, the discourse, causes polarisation in Turkey. He is in great extent disrespectful to the upholding of law.” Karamollaoğlu’s party was once led by Necmettin Erbakan, the father of Turkey’s modern political Islamist movement, one-time prime minister and former mentor of Erdoğan. Erdoğan and other key figures in the movement, who were seen as more reform-minded at the time, split off to form the AKP, which has ruled Turkey since 2002. Turkey’s president likes to portray himself as the global defender of Islam and has sought to position himself as a champion of Muslim causes and a leader of a solidarity movement for the oppressed faithful around the world, another stance that plays well with conservative voters.Karamollaoğlu said his party’s vision for Turkey is one of UK-style secularism in which religion and the state can co-exist peaceably, a self-sufficient economy and a foreign policy based on dialogue and diplomacy, with closer ties to Muslim nations. He wants to abandon the pursuit of EU membership in favour of a special status agreement, as well as the strategic alliance with the US that is already frayed under Erdoğan. For the elections, the Felicity party has entered an alliance with the main secular opposition bloc, the Republican People’s party (CHP). The Islamists and secularists make for unlikely bedfellows, united by their opposition to the president and his ruling party, despite their bitter ideological disparity. “We don’t have the same policies or the same understanding of governance, in economics, in foreign policy,” Karamollaoğlu said. “But we have certain principles we agreed, [like] separation of government and the judiciary … press freedom, lifting of the state of emergency.” The oddity of the pairing belies the broader campaign to draw away voters from Erdoğan’s religiously conservative base, which has reliably voted for him. His strongest rivals in the presidential race are making implicit appeals to religious voters by signalling their own piety. Meral Aksener, the leader of a new nationalist party, points out that she performed the pilgrimage to Mecca and, though she does not wear the veil, she regularly performs daily prayers. Muharrem Ince, the CHP’s candidate, attends Friday prayers.
Karamollaoğlu’s candidacy and vociferous opposition to the AKP’s policies also blurs the traditional dividing lines of Turkish politics, and marks a public disavowal of the idea that Erdoğan is the only legitimate champion of the pious. Religious voters often point to Erdoğan’s personal piety as a factor in his appeal, as well as his support for Islamist causes like the headscarf, which under the ruling AKP was allowed in universities and state institutions. To many conservative voters, Erdoğan’s rise signalled that public displays of faith had become mainstream, after decades of the vilification of religion and its adherents. It was a repudiation of the “White Turks”, the secular elite who controlled the military and the state’s bureaucracy and looked down on their religious countrymen as ignorant and poor. Distrust will continue to pose a challenge to opposition parties who want to draw in conservatives in sufficient numbers to tip the scales.
They hope, for example, that conservative voters in Kurdish areas who have long voted for the AKP will vote for other parties this time around, due to a combination of Erdoğan’s electoral alliance with the nationalists, Turkey’s military operations against Kurdish militias in Syria, and the sweeping crackdown on dissident Kurds, as well as the failed promise of the inclusive vision of Turkey once espoused by Erdoğan’s AKP. “We are witnessing a fracturing of the [AKP] base,” said Huda Kaya, an MP with the Kurdish issue-oriented People’s Democratic party (HDP), who campaigned for the right to wear the headscarf and previously supported the AKP. “The most distinct and vivid words in our memory is when Erdoğan said all 80 million [people in Turkey] are my fellow citizens if they vote for me or not,” she said. “We kept our hopes on this being the truth … but all the promises, the equality, rights and freedom, the position of Kurdish society is nothing near what was promised.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/turkey-islamists-and-secularists-join-forces-in-bid-to-unseat-erdogan,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/turkey-islamists-and-secularists-join-forces-in-bid-to-unseat-erdogan
2018-06-18T00:50:08Z,world,World news,Philippine lawyer finds unlikely ally in Duterte in fight to legalise gay marriage,"In the Philippines, where Catholicism is dominant and divorce is still illegal, a young atheist, openly gay lawyer is leading a historic fight for same-sex marriage. Jesus Falcis, 31, will face the supreme court on Tuesday to argue that a law limiting marriage to a man and a woman violates the 1987 Philippine Constitution, which he said doesn’t make gender specifications on who can be married. “I took up law to change the law. As a gay person, as a member of the minority I want to challenge laws that discriminate against LGBT people and advocate for laws that would help us,” said Falcis.
Falcis has found an unlikely ally in his fight in the Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte. Falcis has been a vocal critic of Duterte’s bloody anti-drug campaign and the ousting of supreme court chief justice Maria Lourdes Sereno. But on this issue, he and Duterte agree. “I support same-sex marriage,” Duterte said in a speech at an LGBT event in his hometown Davao City last December. “The problem is we’ll have to change the law. But we can change the law.” It is thought Duterte’s support for gay marriage is in part inspired by his antagonistic relationship with the church. He habitually attacks the bishops in his speeches and likes to distributes a book exposing sexual abuse and corruption in the church. Falcis filed his petition in 2015 arguing for same sex couples to be granted legal rights including visitation and custody rights, property and rights of inheritance.
It is difficult to predict which way the supreme court will rule on the petition, but attention for the cause is a big win for the LGBT community, said University of the Philippines constitutional law professor Antonio La Viña. La Viña said the supreme court could have easily dismissed the petition procedurally because is no urgency in the situation of Falcis, who doesn’t have a partner he wants to marry. “The court is intrigued by the questions being raised in this case. They want to listen,” said La Viña. “I actually thought they would have dismissed the petition on procedural grounds. It means they are open to the substance of the case.”. Oral arguments are held only for high-profile issues. La Viña said it should be seen as an opportunity to change minds and present an option for a more inclusive meaning of marriage. “It’s historic. They actually get the chance to be heard. Change always starts with you getting a seat at the table. The oral arguments is akin to a seat at the table. They are given a chance to defend their position,” La Viña said.
A number of gay couples who attempted but failed to get marriage licenses have also filed a supreme court petition to bolster Falcis’ petition. The petition has encountered strong opposition from the church. The Phillipines has the largest number of Catholics of any country in Asia – 74 million as of 2010 or about 80% of the population – and church opinion looms large over issues like same-sex marriage. The Philippines is the only country other than the Vatican that still bans divorce. “It’s natural law. Families may only be formed by a man and a woman. What is the purpose of marriage? It’s openness to life and procreation,” said Manila Auxillary Bishop Broderick Pabillo, echoing a pastoral letter the church released in 2015 shortly after the petition was filed. Falcis said the church position is irrelevant to his petition, arguing that the country’s family code doesn’t require married individuals to procreate and that there is no law prohibiting gay couples from adopting. “I want to emphasise, we are talking about civil or legal marriage. Churches all over the country will still be able to perform their own religious marriages according to their own doctrines,” Falcis said. Hundreds of LGBT people are planning to gather outside the supreme court, when Falcis argues the case next week. “There will be a short program outside the supreme court. There will be performances and statements from allies and supporters. We’re hoping for around 500 to 1,000 people or even more,” said Vince Liban of U.P. Babaylan, the largest LGBT student organisation based in the University of the Philippines. “To be honest, I’m not sure what to expect. But hope is what keeps the struggle alive. We will try to reason with them,” said Liban.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/philippines-lawyer-gay-marriage-duterte-church,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/philippines-lawyer-gay-marriage-duterte-church
2018-06-17T19:04:38Z,world,World news,US and South Korea to announce suspension of 'large-scale' military drill,"South Korea and the US are expected to announce the suspension of “large-scale” military drills next week, with the provision that they will restart if North Korea fails to keep its promise to denuclearise, a South Korean news agency said on Sunday. Citing an unnamed government source, the Yonhap agency said the suspension was likely to affect only major joint exercises, not more routine military training.
Donald Trump surprised officials in Seoul and Washington after his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore last week, when he pledged to end “war games”. Immediately after the announcement, US forces in Korea said they had received no guidance on stopping any drills and South Korean officials said they were trying to figure out which exercises Trump was referring to. At a Senate hearing on Thursday, Trump’s nominee to be ambassador to South Korea, the retired admiral Harry Harris, backed the idea of a “pause” in major military exercises. He said his understanding was that any suspension would involve only major military exercises and that regular training of US forces in South Korea would continue, although final decisions were up to the Department of Defense. Trump said via Twitter on Sunday that it was his initiative to suspend military drills – a step North Korea has long sought. “Holding back the ‘war games’ during the negotiations was my request because they are VERY EXPENSIVE and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation,” the US president wrote. “Also, quite provocative. Can start up immediately if talks break down, which I hope will not happen!”
Trump also tweeted a defence of widespread criticism of the summit, his apparent concessions to Kim and his praise of the authoritarian leader. “Funny how the Fake News, in a coordinated effort with each other, likes to say I gave sooo much to North Korea because I ‘met’,” the president wrote. “That’s because that’s all they have to disparage! We got so much for peace in the world, & more is being added in finals. Even got our hostages/remains!” He added: “The denuclearization deal with North Korea is being praised and celebrated all over Asia. They are so happy! Over here, in our country, some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give Trump a win, even if it does save potentially millions & millions of lives!” About 28,500 US troops are stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the Korean war, which ended in 1953 in an armistice that left the two Koreas technically still at war. The US-South Korean exercise calendar hits a high point every year with the Foal Eagle and Max Thunder drills, which both wrapped up last month. The next major drill, Ulchi Freedom Guardian, is planned for the end of the summer. Last year, 17,500 US and more than 50,000 South Korean troops participated in Ulchi Freedom Guardian, an exercise mostly focused on computerised simulations rather than live field exercises that use weapons, tanks or aircraft.
Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, said on Thursday his government would need to be flexible when it came to applying military pressure on North Korea if it was sincere about denuclearisation. Moon said South Korea would carefully consider joint military drills with the US and asked his officials to cooperate with Washington on the issue, his office said in a statement. Yonhap also reported on Sunday that during military talks between the two Koreas on Thursday, South Korean officials asked their northern counterparts to relocate artillery 30km to 40km away from the heavily fortified military demarcation line that divides the two countries. The South’s defense ministry denied it made such a request, Yonhap said. The talks, the first in more than a decade, were held in the border village of Panmunjom in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) and followed an inter-Korean summit in April at which leaders of the two Koreas agreed to defuse tensions and cease “all hostile acts”. North and South failed to reach any concrete agreement, officials said. North Korea proposed the disarming, on a trial basis, the Joint Security Area in Panmunjom, the only site in the DMZ where both countries’ soldiers stand almost face to face, the South’s presidential spokesman said on Friday.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/us-south-korea-north-korea-large-scale-military-drills-trump,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/us-south-korea-north-korea-large-scale-military-drills-trump

This prompted a ban on passengers carrying laptops on flights from 10 airports in the Middle East and North Africa bound for the US. Tariq, a car mechanic who became a jihadist and boasted about his bomb-making skills on Twitter, is believed to have helped create bombs that could be disguised as laptop batteries and taken on planes. Dean says Tariq is now adapting drones to strike football stadiums and other crowded venues.
The disclosures from Dean, a former al-Qaida explosives expert recruited by secret services to infiltrate UK jihadist circles, were made in his new book, Nine Lives. Dean first met Tariq, who once went by the nom de guerre Abu Muslim al-Britani, while working as an undercover agent. In the book, written with Paul Cruickshank and Tim Lister, Dean writes: “An intelligence source told me in 2017 that Abu Muslim was involved in Isis efforts to develop bombs that could be smuggled onto aircraft disguised as laptop batteries.” The discovery is believed to have caused the US to ban some airlines from the Middle East from allowing passengers to take laptops onto flights as carry-on luggage. The ban, which also covered electronic tablets and e-readers, was initiated in March last year but lifted four months later after improved security checks had been put in place.
Dean told the Sunday Times in May that Tariq, a divorced father of two who was born and brought up in Dudley, is now on the Syria-Iraq border where he is developing drones laden with explosives with the potential to attack sports arenas. Tariq served three-and-a-half years in prison for conspiring to defraud banks and post offices. He then left the UK in July 2012 to fight for Islamic insurgents in Waziristan in the tribal belt of north-west Pakistan. After leaving the UK he resurfaced on Twitter to share chilling images of a new high-tech bomb-making laboratory he assembled there. The self-declared bomb-maker used the social media platform to distribute information from the Mujahideen Explosives Handbook. He tweeted pictures of multiple pages of handwritten notes on electronic components that could be used to assemble bombs, along with basic information on the chemicals needed to make crude toxins and poisons.
In an interview with the Guardian in November 2014 via direct message on Twitter, Tariq said his transition towards a more fundamentalist mindset began in 2000. “It was after … I started reflecting on the creation of God that I came to understand there was a creator who gives life and takes life,” he said. He skipped bail and fled to Pakistan to avoid being tried for fraud in Wolverhamton crown court in April 2005 but said that he was deported back to the UK in October 2007 and subsequently served his sentence for three and a half years. Following his release, he said, he went to the tribal regions of Pakistan “to evict the infidels from our occupied lands and to implement the laws of the almighty God”. While there he said his co-jihadist members were killed in US drone strikes. Asked about his role in Isis he said that he was working in explosives and also trained as a sniper.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/aimen-dean-al-qaida-agent-mi6-spy-role-us-laptop-ban,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/aimen-dean-al-qaida-agent-mi6-spy-role-us-laptop-ban
2018-06-17T16:38:59Z,world,World news,Merkel gets extra time to reach deal with EU over asylum row,"Germany’s interior minister, Horst Seehofer, has signalled he is open to giving Angela Merkel more time to reach a deal with Germany’s EU partners over an asylum row that has threatened to bring down her government. As the German chancellor met leaders of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Sunday in an attempt to divert the collapse of her fledgling administration, Seehofer emerged from emergency talks with his Christian Social Union (CSU) saying he had no intention of toppling Merkel. Seehofer wants police stationed at borders to turn back refugees and migrants arriving from other EU countries but signalled he would give Merkel two weeks’ grace to reach migration agreements with EU partners. “No one in the CSU is interested in bringing the chancellor down, or dissolving the CDU/CSU parliamentary partnership or destroying the coalition,” Seehofer told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, adding that he did not want the asylum row to endanger the coalition government, which is less than 100 days old. Seehofer said his party was keen to find a way to limit the number of asylum seekers arriving in Germany. “We finally want to have a solution for the return of refugees at our borders which is fit for the future,” he added. But he was quoted in the Welt am Sonntag as having voiced his scepticism about the future of the CDU/CSU alliance in a meeting of the CSU’s leadership. “I cannot work with this woman any more,” he was quoted as saying. At the centre of the showdown between Merkel and Seehofer, who are bitter rivals after the chancellor’s decision to allow almost a million refugees into Germany three summers ago, is disagreement over whether to allow those who have already registered in another EU country entry to Germany. Seehofer has said these migrants should be turned away at the German border whereas Merkel has said this can only happen with the agreement of the relevant EU states. Merkel is only too aware of the fragility of European unity, which has been sorely tested over the refugee crisis. She fears a situation in which people are sent from country to country, with countries like Greece and Italy continuing to bear the brunt of the crisis. Merkel was reportedly planning to contact all her EU counterparts over the next few days in the hope of striking a series of bilateral deals, ahead of a crucial EU summit at the end of June at which she hopes to come to an agreement to end the impasse. A spokesman for Merkel denied reports that she was planning to host a special crisis summit before the talks. Such a move could only happen if it was organised by the European commission, he said. The CSU appeared to be at pains at the weekend to limit the damage done to the conservative alliance amid growing evidence the German government could be about to collapse. The CSU faces a crucial state election in its home of Bavaria in October, and its hardline stance has widely been interpreted as an electioneering tactic as it attempts to claw back voters lost to the anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland party. Joachim Herrmann, Bavaria’s interior minister, insisted the CSU was not intending to destabilise the CDU. “We’re not looking for a fight within the union,” he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine. “But the expectation of the citizens towards the interior minister is that he should act.” He added his party was not seeking to dissolve its decades-long alliance with the CDU despite widespread reports to the contrary. Seehofer has earned the wrath of politicians across the political spectrum for appearing to seek a major confrontation with Merkel, threatening to place police at the border even if she rejected his plan, which would leave her little choice but to sack him. But doing so would bring down her government and her own political career would almost certainly be over. Amid widespread calls for Merkel to sack Seehofer anyway, particularly if she wanted to retain her credibility, Jan Korte of the far-left Die Linke party said: “This Rambo in lederhosen needs to be stopped.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/angela-merkel-extra-time-reach-deal-with-eu-asylum-row,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/angela-merkel-extra-time-reach-deal-with-eu-asylum-row
2018-06-17T16:05:38Z,world,World news,Taliban refuse to extend truce with Afghan forces,"Afghanistan’s first taste of peace in 17 years is expected to end after the Taliban refused to extend a three-day ceasefire during which civilians, militants and soldiers hugged and danced together over the festival of Eid. The Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said: “The ceasefire ends tonight [Sunday] and our operations begin tomorrow, inshallah [God willing].” The Taliban’s decision to take up arms once more comes despite the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, on Saturday indefinitely extending the Afghan government’s own ceasefire and his request that the militant group follow suit to prolong the first countrywide lull in hostilities since the US invasion in 2001. Hopes are nevertheless higher than ever before that an agreement can one day be reached. On Sunday the Taliban ordered their fighters not to enter major cities after an Islamic State suicide bombing killed 26 people in Narangahar province, near the city of Jalalabad. Another Isis suicide attack in Jalalabad on Saturday killed 17.
However, the ceasefire between Afghan forces and the Taliban was scrupulously observed and some analysts said the order to fighters not to enter cities stemmed from concern that they might enjoy peace too much. “Of course the leadership might fear some of them just stay,” said Thomas Ruttig, of the Afghan Analysts Network (AAN). Over three days, Afghans witnessed the kind of scenes few dreamed possible. Thousands of Taliban fighters were welcomed into Kabul, Kunduz, Ghazni and other cities. Some posed for selfies with soldiers, some handed out red roses, and in Kabul some sought out a famous ice-cream parlour. News of the ceasefire’s end came as a blow to many fighters. “I and thousands of Afghan Taliban definitely want the ceasefire extended,” Muhammadullah, 22, told the Guardian. “I went to the city and the mosques were full of people, I did not notice anything against the Islamic rules. After the sweet three days of peace, going back to bloodshed looks strange. How can you even compare peace with war?” The Taliban senior council met on Sunday to discuss the ceasefire and Ghani’s overture. According to insiders, the leadership was stunned by the jubilant scenes in city centres. The hardline deputy leader and son of Mullah Omar, Mullah Yaqoob, was particularly dismayed. In an audio message obtained by the Guardian, he said there had been “no permission for mixing with Afghan forces”, which he said “totally disobeyed the terms of the ceasefire”. One senior Taliban member said the leadership, recognising the pressure for peace within the group’s ranks, was considering a 10-day ceasefire over the next Eid festival, in September. However, he said there was disappointment that Ghani had not been more specific on the subject of US troop withdrawal. “Ghani should have created a timeline,” he said. “That might have created attraction to extend the ceasefire.” Michael Kugelman, of the Wilson Centre, said a tit-for-tat extension had never been likely. “If the Taliban’s to agree to a reconciliation process, it will do so at a time of its own choosing and not by reciprocating the government’s own moves,” he said. Progress towards peace is not helped by hardliners’ belief that they are winning the war, a view not contradicted by the latest report from the US watchdog, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. It said a surge in bombing raids under the Trump administration had not won back any of the 15% of the country under Taliban control – the highest level on record. Yet civilian pressure on the Taliban to negotiate is growing. A convoy of 80 civilians on a 400-mile peace march from the capital of Helmand province, Lashkar Gah, to Kabul has come to symbolise the stubborn determination of the public to end a war that has brought so much loss. Conditions abroad have also rarely been as conducive for talks. Pakistan, long thought of as a spoiler, has held an increasing number of bilateral negotiations with Afghanistan since the middle of 2017, partly under pressure from China, its key ally in the region. On 12 June the army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, visited Kabul and expressed support for the ceasefire.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/taliban-refuse-to-extend-truce-with-afghan-forces,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/taliban-refuse-to-extend-truce-with-afghan-forces
2018-06-17T15:13:42Z,world,World news,"Macedonia changes name, ending bitter dispute with Greece","After almost three decades, one of the most intractable Balkan disputes has ended on the banks of a lake as Greece and Macedonia signed an accord formally heralding a new era of peace. On a historic day for a region long soaked in the politics of animosity, the prime ministers of the neighbouring states declared that the bitter dispute over Macedonia’s name was finally over – despite scattered protests on both sides of the frontier. Once ratified, the pact will see the small Balkan nation being renamed the Republic of North Macedonia. “This is our own rendezvous with history,” the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, told officials gathered under a giant marquee pitched at the edge of Lake Prespa, where the borders of Greece, Macedonia and Albania meet. “We are here to heal the wounds of time,” he insisted, adding that for too long the Balkans had suffered from “the poison of chauvinism and the divisions of nationalist hatred”.
The Macedonian prime minister, Zoran Zaev arrived at the ceremony by speedboat. He called on critics of the agreement, which was announced five days ago, “to step out of the past and look to the future”. “Our peoples want peace … We will be partners and allies,” said Zaev, who must have the pact passed by parliament and endorsed by a referendum before it is accepted by Greece. “We are proud of today’s agreement … May we stay as forever united as we are on this day.” There was rapturous applause as the countries’ respective foreign ministers signed the accord. To get to this point has not been easy – and challenges posed by nationalist hardliners could yet scupper the deal. But the significance of a day, as heavy in symbolism as historic import, was lost on neither. From the moment its neighbour proclaimed independence as the Republic of Macedonia following the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1991, Greece has believed its chosen name and symbols conveyed ill-disguised territorial claims against its own province of Macedonia.
Maps depicting the landlocked state’s borders extending to the strategic port city of Thessaloniki, Greek Macedonia’s capital, have helped stoke fears. So, too, has the appropriation of ancient Greek figures. The erection of a gargantuan statue of the warrior king Alexander the Great in Skopje’s central square fuelled further claims of cultural theft. In 1994, as the confrontational rhetoric deepened, Athens imposed a trade embargo against its neighbour, saying the Slavic state’s policies posed “a real and present danger to Greece”. But on Sunday all of that appeared to have been relegated to the past. Taking the podium after adding his own signature to the accord, Matthew Nimetz, the UN special envoy who has mediated negotiations since the early 1990s, spoke of the “political courage” required to arrive at this point. The EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini and EU enlargement commissioner Johannes Hahn, who were present for the signing, spoke glowingly of the signing as a rare moment of success for Europe. The pact opens the way to Macedonia joining Nato and beginning EU accession talks. Previous such moves have been blocked by Athens and triggered growing western security concerns in a region that has become increasingly susceptible to Russian influence. By agreeing to rename itself the Republic of North Macedonia the country will replace an interim accord under which it joined the UN 23 years ago as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The agreement means Skopje will need to make more than 150 changes to its constitution before Greece brings the pact before its own parliament for ratification – a task replete with challenges for Zaev, who like Tsipras has taken a progressive view on the issue, and faces considerable opposition from nationalists. Macedonia’s president, Gjorge Ivanov, has refused to support the deal, presaging a stormy few months ahead. Changing hearts and minds on an issue that is as much about identity – ethnic, cultural and linguistic – as it is about pride, will be paramount in the runup to a referendum that Zaev has called for the autumn at the latest. But the social democrat, who has been likened to John F Kennedy, is also described as a natural peacemaker by supporters desperate to see their impoverished country join the rest of the world. Ivanov can veto the accord but ultimately will have to accept it if parliament endorses the pact a second time round. Tsipras, who survived a vote of no-confidence on Saturday brought against his leftwing government by the conservative opposition over the deal, faces similar challenges. Mustering enough votes in parliament to ratify the pact without the support of the nationalist Anel party, his junior partner, won’t be easy. A poll released at the weekend showed 68% of Greeks rejecting the agreement. But while the path ahead is strewn with potholes, both sides have said there is no going back. Affiliate parties in Europe have already begun jockeying to convince politicians in Athens and Skopje that the row has to end. The Lake Prespa accord erases the last trace of the old Yugoslavia. With the adoption of its new name, Macedonia will not only assume a new title, it will ultimately change the map of Europe. • This article was amended on 18 June 2018 to correct the spellings of the Anel party and Gjorge Ivanov.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/macedonia-greece-dispute-name-accord-prespa,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/macedonia-greece-dispute-name-accord-prespa
2018-06-17T13:57:09Z,world,World news,"Aquarius refusal was betrayal of European values, says charity boss","The head of the world’s largest humanitarian network has accused Europe of betraying its fundamental values by ignoring the plight of the rescue ship Aquarius, as the 630 people it saved finally reached Spain after eight days of desperation, closed ports and rough seas. Malta and Italy’s refusal to take in the migrants and refugees rescued off the coast of Libya last weekend revealed the extent of the faultlines in EU migration policy, with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, condemning Rome’s “cynicism and irresponsibility”. The fate of those on board the Aquarius was only settled after the new Spanish government offered to take them in to help avert “a humanitarian catastrophe”. Speaking as the ship’s passengers reached Valencia on Sunday, Elhadj As Sy, the secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), praised Spain’s response but said Europe had let itself down. “There are values that are cultural values and values of civilisation and the world often looks up to Europe for those values,” he told the Guardian. “Not because Europe really owes it to the world but because Europe embodies those values. That’s what Europe stands for, that’s what Europe is promoting in its diplomacy, in its policy in its culture, in its civilisation. “When it comes now to applying those values and welcoming people in need – through solidarity, through care, through support, through humanity – a failure to do so is obviously a betrayal of those values.”
Even after the political tumult of the past few days, Sy said the IFRC still expected the rest of Europe “to step up to the plate like Spain did”. Asked whether the Italian government’s stance had created a dangerous precedent, he replied: “I hope not. Despite what happened, which we regret, we cannot lose sight of the fact that Italy has been welcoming refugees in their tens of thousands over the years.” Sy’s strong language was echoed by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which operates the Aquarius with the charity SOS Méditerranée. “This whole episode is an indication of the failure of European migration and asylum policies,” said Karline Kleijer, head of emergencies at MSF. “It’s high time that politicians put lives before policies. If you look at European asylum and migration policies, the humanity has gone. It’s no longer about human beings but border management. We’ve lost our soul.” Kleijer said the standoff over the Aquarius’s passengers – and the five days it had taken to sail to Spain – had limited the ship’s search-and-rescue capacity. “That might cost lives,” she said. Hundreds of people onboard the ship were transferred to an Italian navy ship and an Italian coastguard vessel this week after Spain proposed Valencia as a safe harbour. The coastguard ship arrived at 6.20am on Sunday, followed five hours later by the Aquarius and, two hours after that, the navy vessel. Their passengers – including at least seven pregnant women, 104 children, as well as people who had been treated for hypothermia and fuel burns – were met by the Red Cross at the docks and given medical checks. Those needing urgent treatment were taken to hospital, while others were taken to a reception centre in the port where supplies of food, clothes, nappies and personal hygiene kits were distributed. An enormous banner hanging from the makeshift camp read “Welcome home” in Valencian, Spanish, English, French and Arabic. The operation, which was coordinated by Valencia’s regional government, also included 400 interpreters and staff from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, who were present to help passengers fleeing war or persecution claim asylum. Among those rescued were people from Nigeria, Sudan, South Sudan, Eritrea, Ghana, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Although all 630 disembarked in Spain, Macron’s government has offered to take in anyone who wishes to settle in France once the necessary procedures have been completed. Aloys Vimard, MSF coordinator onboard the Aquarius, said the voyage to Spain had been difficult, with four-metre waves pitching the boat about and making people sick. He said many of the passengers had recounted being tortured, sexually assaulted and enslaved while they waited to cross over from Libya. “We’ve been hearing horrific stories. People tell us how they were exposed to a high level of violence – and even torture, including sexual violence,” he said. “It’s unfortunately very common that women are sharing these kinds of stories but we’ve also collected a significant number of testimonies from men who were exposed to this kind of violence. They were forced to witness men being raped in their cells while they were in captivity.” Vimard said one Nigerian man had told of being pushed into forced labour in Libya. “When he was leaving his cell, he saw a pregnant woman who was looking very, very bad and suffering. She was just lying on the floor and he wanted to ask her how she felt. He was beaten by the guards because he was taking care of this woman. He had to leave and when he came back from work, he heard the woman had died.” European leaders are due to discuss migration and asylum at a summit at the end of the month. Spain’s new foreign secretary, Josep Borrell, has described the country’s decision to welcome the Aquarius’s passengers as a “highly symbolic act” intended to jolt Europe out of its “ostrich politics” on the issue of migration. Sy said he hoped the meeting would include recognition of “migration as a situation to manage humanely and not as a crisis or a problem to solve”. He called for leadership, courage, humanity and “a quieter dialogue about migration without the fire and emotion of politics. Looking at it in a more sober way can help to address those extremely important issues.” He said countries such as Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Uganda had taken in millions of refugees between them with far less fuss than was being made over the arrival of 630 people in Europe. “I’m looking forward to the day when a boat like the Aquarius can dock in any port in Europe or any other part of the world without creating this media interest and being a sensation or an exception,” Sy said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/aquarius-refusal-was-betrayal-of-european-values-says-charity-boss,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/aquarius-refusal-was-betrayal-of-european-values-says-charity-boss
2018-06-17T13:14:30Z,world,World news,"Salvini meets Cardinal Burke, staunch critic of Pope Francis","Matteo Salvini, the far-right Italian interior minister who once questioned Pope Francis’s legitimacy, has met Raymond Burke, the Argentinian pontiff’s fiercest critic in the Vatican, signalling an unprecedented gulf between the leader of the Catholic church and a key figure in the new populist government.
Salvini, the leader of the League party, has long been at odds with Francis over the issue of migration, the pope’s outreach to Muslims and his calls for Europe to integrate migrant communities. The rift seemed to take a turn for the worse late last week, when a photograph emerged of an amicable meeting between Salvini and Burke, a staunch conservative.
It was not their first encounter. The pair have met on two other occasions, according to a Vatican watcher who is close to Burke. The US cardinal, one of four to sign an openly critical letter to Francis last year questioning guidance that allows priests to determine whether remarried Catholics could receive communion, has praised Donald Trump and adopted a far more critical stance on migrants than the pope. The meeting was unusual because the new Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has not yet had a formal meeting with Francis. Salvini’s controversial decisions on migration have created the impression that he is setting Italy’s agenda. Burke is seen as the ringleader of a faction of the Catholic church opposed to Francis. Like Salvini, he counts the far-right populist Steve Bannon, who is Catholic and formerly served as a White House strategist for Trump, as a confidante. Salvini was criticised before the 4 March election when he brandished a rosary during an election event and swore to remain faithful to Italians. Salvini is Catholic and reportedly attends mass but he is divorced and lives with a partner. Any possible alliance between Salvini and Burke, a reactionary who has blamed “radical feminism” for marginalising men and was once demoted by Francis, is noteworthy given how critical Salvini has been about the pope. When a Catholic newspaper criticised Salvini in 2016, he responded by saying: “My pope is Benedict.” That was a reference to Francis’s conservative predecessor who resigned in 2013, an act not witnessed in the Catholic church for centuries. Francis has since been a tough critic of capitalism and the exploitation of the developing world, and has suggested it is a Christian duty to treat migrants with dignity and respect. He has, however, steered clear of becoming involved in Italian politics, preferring instead to focus on the “global church” and seeking to decentralise power away from Rome. He appeared to have a good relationship with Matteo Renzi, the former centre-left prime minister, but did not get involved in his campaign to make civil unions legal in Italy. The pope did, however, speak at length last week about the importance of treating migrants with respect. The fact that he made his comments as Salvini turned away the Aquarius rescue ship with 630 migrants on board and said all non-Italian ships would be barred from entering Italian ports, may not have been a coincidence. “I would like to point out that the issue of migration is not simply one of numbers, but of persons, each with his or her own history, culture, feelings and aspirations,” Francis said. “These persons, our brothers and sisters, need ongoing protection, independently of whatever migrant status they may have,.” His comments may not, however, carry much influence. “The church does not have the political influence it used to have,” said Giovanni Orsina, a political historian at Luiss University in Rome. “The Italian public opinion is with Salvini, and they don’t care what the church says.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/matteo-salvini-cardinal-burke-critic-of-pope-francis,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/matteo-salvini-cardinal-burke-critic-of-pope-francis
2018-06-17T12:56:41Z,world,World news,UN in advanced talks to take over besieged Yemen port,"Talks are at an advanced stage for the United Nations to take over the administration of the vital port of Hodeidah under siege from a Saudi-led coalition, the UN humanitarian coordinator Lise Grande said on Sunday. The Red Sea port is the main distribution point for commercial and humanitarian supplies into Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition have threatened to seize the port militarily from Houthi rebels, but the UN special envoy Martin Griffiths is trying to broker a deal for the port to be administered independently by the UN. This would meet Saudi demands that the Iranian-backed Houthis can no longer use Yemen’s main entry point to smuggle arms and raise taxes to keep their war economy alive. Both Britain and France failed to persuade the Saudi-led coalition not to mount the offensive last week, fearing the military attacks risk interrupting the supply of vital aid into a deeply fragile state. There are further claims that the Houthis have mined the port, and could blow up its infrastructure as part of a scorched earth policy that incapacitates the aid programme. Griffiths has been in Sana’a, the capital of Yemen, to negotiate with the Houthis for their orderly withdrawal from the port. He is due to report to the UN security council on Monday. Grande said a political solution to the crisis was required and that Griffiths’ talks to negotiate the handing over of the port by the Houthis and the United Arab Emirates to the UN had reached an advanced stage. In theory UN inspectors have boarded all ships entering Hodeidah to check commercial and humanitarian supplies do not contain weapons bound for the Houthis. The UAE claims the Houthi’s raise as much as $30-40m a year in taxes through their control of the port. Grande said 70% of humanitarian supplies and 90% of commercial supplies entered Yemen through the port, adding she feared a cholera outbreak of the kind that gripped the country last year. She said she was overseeing the largest humanitarian operation in the world and aid workers had decided to return to the city of Hodeidah due to the scale of the crisis. But there are doubts Griffiths will be able to broker a deal on the port’s administration given the Saudi-led coalition is determined to use its military advantage – and lack of active political opposition from the west – to press not just for a Houthi withdrawal from the port area, but from the entire region. Some members of the UN-backed Yemen government were making far wider demands of the Houthis than simple withdrawal from the port and town. The UAE foreign affairs minister, Anwar Gargash, said the handover of the port needed to form part of a wider settlement. “The UAE and coalition appreciates the tireless determination of the UN envoy to persuade the Houthis to put down their weapons and enter into meaningful political discussions,” he said. “We and all of Yemen would welcome good news out of Sana’a. We encourage the envoy’s efforts to facilitate the safe handover of Hodeida to the legitimate Yemeni government.
“Meanwhile the people of Hodeida urgently want to be liberated. The coalition will continue with its military and humanitarian preparations to achieve this urgent result.” On Thursday, the UN security council demanded that Hodeidah port be kept open to vital food shipments but stopped short of backing a Swedish call for a pause in the offensive to allow for talks on a militia withdrawal. Jan Egeland, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said the port had to be handed to UN administration to allow peace talks to start. He asked whether US, French and British diplomats were asleep. The UK Middle East minister, Alistair Burt, speaking at Chatham House on Thursday, said the UK had urged the Saudis and UAE not to launch the attack, but the Saudis had rejected this, saying the three year civil war could be ended faster with an assault on the port. Burt added the British had said their piece to the Saudis, implying the UK was not intending to take any further action to dissuade them from their chosen course.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/un-in-advanced-talks-to-take-over-yemen-port-hodeidah-under-saudi-led-siege,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/un-in-advanced-talks-to-take-over-yemen-port-hodeidah-under-saudi-led-siege
2018-06-17T10:30:11Z,world,World news,‘Our island is like a mosaic’: how migrants are reshaping Sicily’s food culture,"Shapoor Safari left Kabul in 1996 after the mujahideen knocked on his door and tried to order him into their ranks. He fled first to Pakistan, then to Iran where he washed cars and learned to solder metal, then to Turkey, where he worked in a bread factory, putting mini brioches on the conveyor belt to go into the ovens. Two friends told him there was a boat going to Italy. He paid $3,000 for his place. “It was 2002. It was the first boat to go to Italy,” he told me without pride. “There were 150 of us. Afghans, Pakistanis, Iranians, even a few Iraqis. Men, women, families, children also. On the second day, food and water ran out. The crew gave some biscuits to the children. On the third day, the captain began to sell bottles of water for $100.” On the fourth day, there was a storm and the engine stopped and the boat heaved violently in the waves for three hours, until they got it started again. On the fifth day, they were rescued by the Italian navy and taken to a camp in Calabria. In those days, the numbers of migrants and refugees was far fewer, processing was faster. In two or three months, Safari had documents allowing him to work.
For seven years, he travelled all over Italy: Milan, Turin, Rome, Venice. He took jobs in supermarkets, as a dishwasher, making pizza; one summer, he picked olives, another tomatoes. But he never managed to get a permanent contract. He was alone. He looked at the map, saw Sicily being “kicked” by the Italian boot, and got on a train to Palermo. There, he seemed to find his feet. He worked for a year in the kitchen of the Teatro Massimo, from morning until midnight, earning €25 a day. Then he left and went to work in other restaurant kitchens, watching, learning, cooking. Food is as much, or more, about identity, memory and family as it is about sustenance. Sicily’s history is one of successive empires, “dominations” as Sicilians term them – Greek, Phoenician, Roman, Byzantine, Gothic, Arab, Norman, Spanish, and most recently, Sicilians laugh, Italian – that have come ashore and into its cooking pots. Safari told me: “Palermo is different, I feel here people are looking forward to meeting new people. Sicily,” he added laughing, “is not Europe!” Its culture comes as much from its position as a Mediterranean island as it does from its inclusion in a relatively recent Italian union. Palermo’s mayor, Leoluca Orlando, likes to say that it is a Middle Eastern city that happens to be in the EU. The sweet and sour taste of Eastern agrodolce is key to its cuisine. Its most famous dishes are pasta con le sarde, a sardine sauce often made with capers and raisins, and almond granita, the descendent of an Ottoman sherbet. Levantine pine nuts, pistachios and sesame seeds are generously scattered over gelato or spaghetti. In Palermo, couscous with fish is a staple family dish. Since the Arab Spring in 2011, the fall of Gaddafi and the subsequent breakdown of law and order in Libya, roughly 400,000 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean and landed in southern Italy and Sicily. The majority are young African men, but before them came Bangladeshis and Tamils; in the 1990s, Tunisians came over to work in the fields. As much as the recent African influx comes with political, ethnic, economic and even criminal complications, there is a part of Sicilian tradition that identifies with the new arrivals. Sicily has always been an island of immigrants and, in the 20th century, of emigrants. How, I wondered, given this background, are the more recent migrants encountering a new continent around Sicilian tables and integrating in its kitchens?
Safari is now head chef at Moltivolti in Palermo, half-restaurant and half a shared space for NGOs working with migrants, a utopian bubble in the midst of a big city and a bigger issue. His kitchen team comprises a Sardinian, two Senegalese and an Iraqi. The menu is international: from Sicily, pasta with swordfish and aubergine or broccoli, anchovies and raisins, or artichokes and bottarga; Italian lasagne; hummus from Jordan; tabbouleh from Lebanon; falafel from Palestine; Argentinian sweet potato; Iraqi kebab with pumpkin; and Tunisian brik with tuna. “Do you like cooking?” I asked. At this question, finally, Safari smiled. “When I am in the kitchen, when I am cooking or teaching people – it is messy and people are stirring and arguing, I feel the same as I did with my family all around.” Moltivolti lies at the heart of the Ballarò neighbourhood of Palermo. Alleyways strung with washing wind into piazzas overlooked by crumbling madonnas. For many years, Ballarò was a dilapidated, clannish ghetto, increasingly depopulated as families moved to airier suburbs. Several years ago, new arrivals began renting here and now the area is an extraordinary mix of mafia, migrants and hip young social entrepreneurs. In the market that runs like a spine through the neighbourhood, Bangladeshi groceries sell cassava, okra, scotch bonnet chillies and mangoes beside stalls piled with springtime artichokes and still-warm ricotta, while Sicilians yell the virtues of flashing silver sardines, lemon granita and freshly fried chickpea fritters, known as panelle. “We are in the middle here,” Claudio Arestivo, one of the co-founders of Moltivolti, told me, “I feel we are living an experiment.” Not far from Moltivolti is the Astalli Centre for migrants, housed in several buildings built around a gothic cloister. “The Jesuits help us a lot,” Emanuele Cardella, the director, told me. (In Ballarò, and all over Sicily, the Catholic church is active in providing frontline services for migrants). Cardella gave me a tour of the classrooms and workshops where they give lessons in computer science, Italian, English, tailoring, carpentry, ceramics, and the dining room where they feed 100 people every day for breakfast. In the kitchen, Cardella explained, they have also run a cooking course for several months, for 10 or 12 migrants at a time. He showed me photographs of several groups, smiling for the camera in front of the centre’s stoves: women and men, headscarves and beards. “Afghan women, people from Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Ghana, Morocco, Tunisia.”
The course deliberately features half Italian and half foreign cuisine. “I discovered tikka masala!” Cardella told me, kissing his fingertips enthusiastically. “It’s great! It is amazing the infinity of combinations of new tastes to discover. If we mix different cultures, we increase exponentially our discovery of new taste. It’s amazing to see, for example, a Nigerian cook discover Indian spices.” I met Ricardo Pizzuto and Samuel Torres, who oversee the cooking class, as they were teaching a group of children to sing the Italian national anthem accompanied by bongo drums. Pizzuto said he had never explained a new technique or a new ingredient without someone from the class finding a correlation to their own culinary background. I told them that I had seen three aubergine dishes on the menu at Moltivolti – baba ganoush, caponata and a dish of aubergine with mint, parmesan and eggs described as Lebanese. I half-joked that they were more or less the same thing, but Torres shook his head. “No,” he said, with conviction. “They are different. If we mix them, we lose their identity.” I began to see that the Sicilian model of integration as less a melting pot of assimilation than as layers of different cultures, each distinct and delicious, what a third-generation pastry-maker described to me, pointing at a millefeuille, as “stratificazione”. “We are just like a mosaic,” mayor Orlando told me, proudly, adding another metaphor. Despite an “Italians first” rhetoric gaining traction and votes in the March national elections, Italy’s shift to the right on immigration issues has been less pronounced in the south and Sicily. The new interior minister recently visited the island and declared he’d had enough of Sicily being “the refugee camp of Europe”, and told migrants: “Get ready to pack your bags.” Mayor Orlando responded in a written statement: “We are severely worried about declarations which sound like propaganda slogans, that can compromise the well-established culture of welcoming and human rights respect of all, without splitting citizens with labels such as ‘locals’ and ‘migrants’.” Orlando has long championed migration as a human right and has launched a movement to abolish the residency permit. Just as prohibition gave rise to gangsters and cartel violence accompanies the drug trade, Orlando argues that limiting people’s freedom of movement creates the opportunity for criminal enterprise. “Our project is to be different but to be equal,” he told me in April. “To be different because we are human beings. To be equal because we are human beings.”
The juxtaposition is evident walking along the Via Maqueda, the Roman road that runs along the meridian of the city, where Bangladeshis fry samosas and pakoras between gelato shops and pizzerias. Side alleys ring with the clatter and chatter of informal front-room restaurants set up by Senegalese women have set up kitchens in their apartments. The woman behind one of these, Ami Fall, served up great mounds of maafe (spicy peanut stew) and yassa fish with onions when I ate there one lunchtime with three teenagers from Gambia, Guinea and Senegal who had been in Sicily only a few months and were finding it hard to get used to a diet of pasta. Fall has been in Palermo for more than 15 years and now cooks pasta al forno, lasagne, Moroccan couscous. “My children eat everything!” she said, laughing as a woman with curly blond hair poked her head around the door and said “Salve!” “Hey!” replied Fall. “How’s your mother doing?” “Not well.” “I’m so sorry!” Fall turned back to me. “It’s like family here, she is a neighbour, just like a sister, she helps the kids with their homework.” “I’m going to get a crepe,” called the neighbour. “Do you want one?” “Some Sicilians are really like Africans!” Fall said, laughing. As much as people are different, they can’t help mixing, especially when they eat. One afternoon at Moltivolti I met Safa Neji, who had come to see her Iraqi chef friend. Her family had moved to Sicily from Tunisia more than 20 years ago, she has an Italian passport and goes back often to visit relatives. “My grandfather complains when my mother makes him couscous,” she laughed. “He says she has lost her Tunisian-ness and makes it in the Sicilian way.” I asked her if she felt Tunisian or Sicilian, realising, even as I said it, that it was a crass question. “I am me,” she said simply. “There is no difference between Palermo and north Africa. Tunisia,” she pointed, as if towards the next neighbourhood, “is right here.”
Neji showed me photographs of the feast she and her mother had prepared to celebrate her graduation. There were two tables, each covered with a red tablecloth, side by side. One was laid out with Tunisian food: a mound of couscous with chickpeas, carrots laid against the ramparts, meat on a separate platter, fried brik triangles, Tunisian frittata “which is similar to the Sicilian but has parsley”. The second table was laid with Italian food: small pizzas and tarts with tomatoes and courgettes, everything on the Italian side was speared with a toothpick. I said it was interesting that even the method of eating, traditionally with your hands, on the Tunisian table and on the Italian, with an implement, was separate but equally represented. Neji nodded and, laughing, said she and her mother always liked to eat with their hands when they were in Tunisia, but grandfather would admonish them, as if it were something a bit retrograde. While young Sicilians are interested in the spicy new flavours, their parents tend to retain a more conservative palate. But traditions evolve: I met several migrants who worked as housekeepers and cooked for middle-class Sicilian families, learning family favourites and introducing their own recipes. Ambi Aram from Mauritius – another multiracial island, where Indians, Africans and Chinese have influenced local dishes – told me she cooks curries for the family she works for – “They like it hot and spicy!” – and often adds ginger to the Italian soffrito of onions and garlic. “I modify. I invent. Happiness is when we get to know another tradition, another taste.” This melding and blurring is also taking place in restaurant kitchens, where plenty of migrants have found jobs. At one of the mayor’s favourite trattorias, Il Pipino Rosso, housed in the medieval brick alcoves of a 14th-century palazzo, the owners were so impressed with a Syrian chef who put falafel and tabbouleh on the menu that they are in the process of opening a Syrian restaurant with him in a village outside the city. Their Bangladeshi pizzaiolo, Sheikh Al Mamun, told me he sometimes makes dishes using Indian spices, adding turmeric and ginger to the minestrone, for example. The new chef, Tizziana Allegri, was excited: “It’s beautiful, Sicilians are very open to new tastes. Here people find different flavours.” And one evening, I had dinner in a typically Sicilian trattoria, one I found by chance, and saw on the menu, amid the classics, pasta alla norma, pasta with pistachios, pesto Trapanese made with almonds, and “gnocchi with swordfish, salmon shrimp and curry”.
When I told Sicilians that curry-pasta was creeping into their culinary repertoire, they were sceptical. But cross-cultural pollination is unavoidable. “I think all the world is mixing food because more people are coming, there is immigration, and people are travelling more, too,” Patrizia di Benedetto, the chef of the Michelin-starred Bye Bye Blues told me. For the celebrations of a local saint’s day last year, at Moltivolti they made arancini, fried rice balls, with a maafe sauce. At the Astalli Centre the chef, Ricardo, makes a ragu with Indian spices. “Sicily is a triangle,” Bonetta dell’Oglio, the chef, slow-food activist and author explained, pointing to the tattoo of the outline of the island on her forearm. “It is divided into three valleys by three mountain ranges.” One, she explained, looked towards Italy, one towards Africa, one towards Tunisia and the Maghreb. “All of these places and dominations enriched our culture.” Dell’Oglio had invented “sushiliana”, using couscous instead of rice and fish marinated in orange, lemon, white wine, salt and sugar and wrapped in a sheet of nori, to show that new concepts could be created with Sicilian flavours. For the wasabi, she made a paste of red chilli peppers. After all, she told me, many ingredients considered Sicilian were once foreign. “The Arabs brought the first citrus, lemons and oranges and mandarins, a thousand years ago. The Spanish brought peppers and tomatoes from the New World. Tomatoes only really arrived 200 years ago. Before that, they were more ornamental plants, people didn’t trust them. Think how quickly tomatoes have become part of almost every aspect of Sicilian cuisine.”
At Moltivolti one evening, they held a cooking class for a group of 40 students from Rotterdam studying cultural economics and entrepreneurship. They made traditional Sicilian cannoli, what was described as “Zambian polenta” – a cornmeal dish called nshima – and then Safari showed everyone how to make dumplings. He told his story through the ingredients. The spice mix of coriander, cumin, cardamom, garlic and pepper are his Afghanistan home; the flour reminds him of the Turkish bakery; the yogurt is from Iran; and the liquid to bind recalls his time on the boat when he learned the value of every single drop. One of the Dutch professors watched as a long tongue of dough rolled through the pasta machine and was taken up by many hands as everyone cheered. “And what is better than cooking together, hearing different stories?” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/our-island-is-like-a-mosaic-how-migrants-are-reshaping-sicilys-food-culture,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/our-island-is-like-a-mosaic-how-migrants-are-reshaping-sicilys-food-culture
2018-06-17T09:27:12Z,world,World news,Aquarius migrants arrive in Spain after rough week at sea,"The 630 migrants and refugees rescued off the coast of Libya and turned away from Italy and Malta have begun to arrive at the Spanish port of Valencia after seven days at sea. An Italian coastguard vessel, Dattilo, the first of three ships transporting the group, pulled into Valencia harbour at 6.20am carrying 274 people. The Aquarius arrived in Valencia a few hours later, entering the port shortly after 11am local time and carrying 106 migrants and refugees. A third ship the Italian naval vessel, the Orione, is due to pull into the port later on Sunday. It is carrying 250 people. The migrants’ plight, which has laid bare the deep divisions over migration within the EU, has seen the French president, Emmanuel Macron, accuse the Italian government of “cynicism and irresponsibility” by refusing to let the rescue ship Aquarius dock in one of its ports. Their immediate fate was only settled on Monday when the new Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country would take them in, saying it had a duty to help avert “a humanitarian catastrophe”. The Aquarius is a rescue ship operated by the charities SOS Méditerranée and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). Aloys Vimard, MSF coordinator aboard, said the past few days had been difficult, with rough seas making people sick.
“This is not a cruise ship,” he said. “It’s a search-and-rescue ship. It’s not made for people to stay on for more than two, three, four days. Because of the weather, we asked everyone to stay inside the accommodation and they were really cramped in the room we have. People were sick because of the waves. “It was difficult to see and I have in my mind a breast-feeding mother who was trying to feed her child while she was seasick.” As soon as they disembark, the rescued people – who include at least seven pregnant women, 104 children and teenagers and people suffering from burns caused by fuel – are to receive medical checks from the Red Cross.
The international medical organisation has deployed hundreds of staff and volunteers to the area and has set up tents and a reception centre in the port. Rows of blue and green camp beds had been erected in the centre on Saturday afternoon and boxes of food, nappies and clothes were stacked close by. Outside the warehouse hung a huge banner, reading, “Welcome home” in Valencian, Spanish, English, French and Arabic. Staff from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, will be present to help passengers fleeing war or persecution claim asylum, while 400 interpreters will be on hand to ensure proper communication. The operation is being overseen by Valencia’s regional government. It also emerged on Saturday afternoon that the French government had offered to take in any of the Aquarius passengers who wished to settle in the country once the necessary procedures had been followed.
Spain’s decision to accept the migrants and refugees comes amid rising tensions within the EU and calls for a fundamental reappraisal of the current migrations system. Spain’s new foreign secretary, Josep Borrell, has described the country’s decision as a “highly symbolic act” intended to jolt Europe out of its “ostrich politics” on the issue of migration. The recently formed government has also announced plans to extend public healthcare to foreigners without residence permits, and is looking at removing the barbed wire that tops border fences in the two Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta in North Africa. The UNHCR has warned that Spain is facing “another very challenging year” when it comes to helping and protecting those arriving on its shores. On Friday and Saturday alone, Spain’s maritime rescue service saved 933 people trying to cross the Mediterranean and recovered four bodies.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/migrant-rescue-ship-aquarius-to-dock-in-spain-after-rough-week-at-sea,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/migrant-rescue-ship-aquarius-to-dock-in-spain-after-rough-week-at-sea
2018-06-17T08:21:09Z,world,World news,"Between Italy’s cliffs and sea, migrants bid to outwit police","For the fifth time in one week, Sami, a 25-year-old from Guinea, was trying to cross into France from the Italian border town of Ventimiglia. As the train glided along a track sandwiched between the steep cliffs of the Maritime Alps and a glistening Mediterranean sea, passing well-manicured beach resorts along the way, he was feeling hopeful. “I just need to get as far as Marseille where I have a friend who can help me reach Germany,” he told the Observer. “All I want is a better life – in Guinea it is impossible, it is so corrupt.” But, after a week of thwarted attempts to cross an impenetrable border, Sami’s plan was scuppered once again by border police at Menton-Garavan, the first stop along a route that passes through Monaco and Nice before arriving in Cannes. Along with three others, he was escorted off the train and immediately recognised by an officer who had intercepted him the day before. Tourists aboard the train looked on in bewilderment. “On some days we find between 10 and 20 migrants on each train,” said the officer leading the team of four. “We are doing nothing wrong in sending them back; it’s within the law. They are supposed to stay in the country in which they first arrived.” This game of cat-and-mouse has played out between France and Italy since early 2011, shortly after the Arab spring and Syrian war prompted the biggest migration crisis since the second world war. Between January and May this year alone, French authorities say they sent back 10,524 people who tried to cross either by train, or by walking along the motorway or a deadly mountain path. The situation reached boiling point last week when Emmanuel Macron, the French president, was accused of “hypocrisy” by Giuseppe Conte, Italy’s new prime minister, after he criticised his southern neighbour for blocking the Aquarius from Italian ports. The rescue ship had saved more than 600 people from the sea off Libya. The order came down from Matteo Salvini, the recently installed anti-migrant interior minister and leader of the far-right League, which is now in government with the populist Five Star Movement. Relations between Macron and Conte appeared to have thawed on Friday in Paris, where they called for the EU to establish asylum processing centres in Africa as a way of stopping the flow of migrants across the Mediterranean. But in the perennial migrant waiting room of Ventimiglia, a seaside town which has become known as the “Calais of Italy”, charity workers are unconvinced. “Where will they set up these centres? Definitely not in Libya,” said Daniela Zitarosa, from the Italian humanitarian agency Intersos. “You can’t exactly put centres in countries from where asylum seekers escaped because their lives were in danger.”
Zitarosa contributed testimony to a report released by Oxfam on 15 June accusing French border police of detaining migrant children as young as 12 without food or water, cutting the soles off their shoes and stealing sim cards from their mobile phones before illegally returning them to Italy. The allegations came two months after French police were accused of falsifying the birth dates of migrant children on “refusal of entry” documents so they could pass them off as adults and send them back. Under the Dublin regulation, child migrants in France cannot be sent back to Italy if they request asylum. EU law stipulates that unaccompanied minors must be protected, and that those seeking asylum in one member state have the right to be transferred to another where they have family members. The police officer at Menton-Garavan dismissed the claims as “completely false”. He said: “If that’s what they say, that’s what they say … we’re just here doing our job, monitoring the trains.”
At least 16 migrants have died while trying to cross into France since September 2016, either by falling off the mountain path or being hit by cars. A migrant was recently electrocuted after climbing on top of a train, the police officer said. Some 16,500 people, a quarter of them children, had passed through Ventimiglia in the nine months to April, according to the Oxfam report. About 500 are currently staying in a Red Cross camp on the outskirts of the town. Local authorities recently dismantled a makeshift camp beneath an underpass along the banks of the Roia river. Meanwhile, a priest who had been hosting people in a church opposite was forced to stop after receiving threats. Zitarosa estimates around 200 migrants are sleeping rough, in parks or on the beach. She said there had been an increase in arrivals in recent weeks as the summer approached: “You hear stories every day from people who have suffered … starting from personal accounts in their home countries and then their experience in Libya and the sea crossing,” she added. “ Then, in Ventimiglia, they are being pushed back and suffer even more. It’s not an easy job and it makes me feel deeply sad. With all the political stuff I feel even more worried about the future as these people are not being treated like human beings – politics is being made out of people and it needs to stop.” For Sami, who arrived in Italy by boat and had been sleeping for more than a week in a park in Ventimiglia, yesterday’s setback did not mark the end. He is determined to make it to Germany and find work. “This is my fifth time,” he said. “I will keep trying.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/italy-ventimiglia-migrants-stuck-at-border-crisis-suffering,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/italy-ventimiglia-migrants-stuck-at-border-crisis-suffering
2018-06-17T08:02:08Z,world,World news,Mozambique: the secret rainforest at the heart of an African volcano,"Standing in a pit in the red soil of a mountaintop forest in northern Mozambique, Dr Simon Willcock was dirty but very excited. “Undisturbed forest is incredibly rare,” he said. “That is why we scaled a 125-metre-tall cliff with a pickaxe.” Willcock, from Bangor University in Wales, knew of no other rainforest in Africa that scientists can confidently say has not been disturbed by humans. “It’s a unique site in Africa,” he said, plunging the axe down into the chest-deep hole with a whump. Like a villain’s fortress in an old James Bond movie, Mount Lico rises vertically from the land around it, the ancient centre of a volcano with the forest nestled in its crater. It was discovered by Dr Julian Bayliss, who examined satellite imagery looking for an undisturbed tropical rainforest. When he spotted Lico on Google Earth, he said, the forest on top “was isolated and appeared totally undisturbed”. With a smile, he added: “That makes it very exciting.” Bayliss, from Oxford Brookes University, had form: he is known for having found Mount Mabu, the largest rainforest in southern Africa, as well as a number of new species of butterflies and other creatures in the area since then.
Rainforests are the oldest living biomes on Earth and contain roughly half the known species of life. They also store more carbon for longer than any other living system. Some tropical rainforests date back to the dinosaur age, but virtually all show signs of past human activity. Bayliss wondered if there were mountaintop forests that might be untouched. He remembers thinking: “What would a forest like that look like?” The answer was Lico. But the mountain’s formidable geography – its circling rock wall rises 700 metres above the plain – raised a whole new series of questions in terms of accessibility. Bayliss decided to focus on a “shorter” cliff of about 125 metres on one side, and to put together an expedition that would place scientists on the top of Lico via that vertical rock. But how would they be able to get up there? It took two years to assemble the 28-person dream team of biologists, logistical crew, plant experts, and researchers for the first expedition that took place last month, led by Bayliss. Funded in part by Ranulph Fiennes’s Transglobe Expedition Trust, UK-based Biocensus, as well as the African Butterfly Research Institute, the project was an academic partnership between 13 universities, museums and research institutions on three continents.
From his home office in a converted chapel in the Welsh mountains, Bayliss contacted Jules Lines and Mike Robertson, professional climbers widely regarded as two of the best in the UK. Robertson famously ascended the Eiffel tower solo in protest against French oil company Total (and was subsequently arrested by the French police). Lines is known in climbing circles as The Dark Horse for his solo climbing without a rope. The climbers scaled the rock face above the scientists’ basecamp and secured two ropes from the top all the way down to the bottom. Patiently they taught the scientists how to get up and down safely. “Learning to ascend a 125-metre cliff in the jungle is a lot to ask of people,” said Robertson, with a certain understatement, holding the safety line for 29-year-old Ana Gledis da Conceição Miranda, a Mozambican biologist working at the Pringle and EO Wilson laboratory. Like most of the researchers, she struggled with the rope ascenders but didn’t give up. “These scientists are bloody gritty and determined; it’s impressive,” Roberston said.
Ferrying gear and supplies, the two climbers went up the ropes more than 40 times. Despite a medical emergency as a result of an extreme infection, everyone was able to get up and down the ropes safely. But the risk remained. “There is no rescue here,” said Lines, taking a break at the top. “We are it.” Bayliss believes Lico could be one of the most pristine forests on Earth. Willcock and his colleague, Dr Phil Platts from the University of York, dug for two days to get to the forest bedrock to read the soil layers like a history book of Lico’s past. Every fire that ever burned here, many of the plants that grew, even millions of caterpillar droppings are all recorded in the soil. (Caterpillars are everywhere on Lico, so numerous in the trees above that their droppings fall like a dry, soft rain.) “This forest provides a unique insight into the effects of climate change on forests over time,” said Platts, shovelling from the pit. After 10 days of discovery, the team was back at base camp in Lico’s shadow. The hole in the forest had been refilled, the topsoil replaced, and Colin Congdon, a veteran lepidopterist, was comparing finds with Bayliss. Among their small translucent papers was Lico’s first confirmed new species: a butterfly. The scientists expect it will be far from the only one. There is a line-up of potential new species to be confirmed in the months to come, from snakes to frogs, toads, a snake-like amphibian called a caecilian, a shrew, a snub-nosed rodent, more butterflies, crabs and even a flowering plant. Cataloguing potential new fish species, Vanessa Muranga, a 27-year-old marine biologist from Mozambique’s Natural History Museum, had two wrapped in gauze in front of her. “It’s so exciting when you find something that might be new,” she said.
Lico contains other mysteries, too, including partly buried ancient pots that the team discovered near the source of the main stream. According to the local community, no one in memory or legend has ever been on top of the mountain. How did the pot-makers get up the sheer cliff? Was the land around Lico higher then? Could the soil analysis help date them? Anthropologists from Mozambique’s Natural History Museum are investigating. From a South African herpetologist to a Brazilian biogeographer, a botanist with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, to a mammal expert from Swaziland, the expedition to Lico represented a successful collaboration between local and international research institutions. This, according to Hermenegildo Matimele, curator of the National Herbarium of Mozambique in Maputo and Bayliss’s Mozambican counterpart on the expedition, was the greatest thing about it. On the last night of the expedition, the scientists gathered around the base camp’s fire to share a celebratory drink. Perched on a packing crate with a big smile, Bayliss expressed satisfaction that everyone had made it off the mountain with their precious samples. And, he added with characteristic understatement, “it’s great, too, that nobody died”. The expedition was funded by the TransGlobe Expedition Trust, Biocensus, The African Butterfly Research Institute, DMM Climbing, and Marmot tents. The photojournalist’s travel was paid for by Alliance Earth.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/mozambique-mount-lico-rainforest-new-species,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/mozambique-mount-lico-rainforest-new-species
2018-06-17T07:00:09Z,world,World news,Why Dutch teenagers are among the happiest in the world,"In a biology class at a secondary school near Rotterdam, Gerrit the skeleton is not the only one with a permanent grin. The Groen van Prinstererlyceum, which first trialled happiness lessons a decade ago, teaches some of the least troubled teens in the world. In report after report, the Netherlands tops OECD countries for high life satisfaction among its young people. It contrasts starkly with the picture in countries like Britain, where depression and anxiety are on the rise among teenagers, and the US, where the number of young people taking their own lives has risen sharply.
So why is this flat, damp country of 17 million people with its history of Calvinism and colonialism so good at giving young people an optimistic outlook? Dr Simone de Roos, a researcher at the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP), says life satisfaction among teenagers has not dropped since 2013. “I think Dutch children have generally positive interactions in all their social surroundings,” says De Roos. “They have a supportive environment at home, with friends and also at school. Dutch parents give a lot of support and have mild control. There’s an egalitarian climate, teachers are not authoritarian but accept the feelings of pupils, and pupils trust teachers.” The last Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study, comparing children of 11, 13 and 15, showed a happy Dutch youth. When asked where they would be on “Cantril’s ladder” – with the worst possible life for them on 0 and their best at 10, about 94% of Dutch boys said six or above. Dutch girls were slightly lower, ranging from 84% to 92%.
According to that report, young people in the Netherlands were also in the top five for eating breakfast on weekdays, watching more than two hours of weekday television, having kind and helpful classmates – and in the bottom five for being overweight, having sex before 15, and feeling pressure from schoolwork. They were less likely than average to experience bullying and generally found it easy to talk to parents. The results chime with a 2016 Dutch Statistics Office study of 4,000 people from 12 to 25, who ranked their happiness at 8.4 out of 10, and a PISA report in 2015 noting that the country – alongside Finland and Switzerland – seemed “able to combine good learning outcomes with highly satisfied students”. Of course, the general state of the nation helps. There is little unemployment in the Netherlands, relatively low inequality and a healthy economy. Five months ago the SCP compared the Netherlands favourably with 25 years ago, while another study showed people were more optimistic than last year. “At some point there’s a critical mass of optimistic voices, and then it gets its own dynamic,” says Prof Paul Dekker, the SCP programme leader in values and meaning. The director of the World Database of Happiness, Prof Ruut Veenhoven, also believes young people are less burdened by an expectation to “be good”. “If you look across Europe, the Dutch and the Danes are the most lenient and focus more on developing autonomy than giving priority to obedience – and that fits the society,” he says. “Children are more free to do what they want, and in doing what they want, develop an idea of what they really like and social skills. A happy boy may be sometimes not a very good boy.” In Dutch, there is no phrase that means literally “you are a good boy” or “good girl”, says 14-year-old Tjalling Appelhof, from Amsterdam. “You say ‘bravo, lad’ or ‘well done’ or ‘thank you’,” he says. Like most Dutch teenagers, he cycles to school and feels he has a good level of self-determination. “I can say how late I come home – not at 3am, I mean, but some time before bedtime!” he says. “I think I have enough freedom.”
Despite the country’s reputation for cannabis smoking, the Trimbos Institute reports a downward trend for using alcohol and drugs and smoking in Dutch children aged 12 to 16. Such activities are described by HBSC experts as “risk behaviours” that impact happiness. Other negatives are bullying and fighting. At Groen van Prinstererlyceum, Dani Karremans, a 16-year-old majoring in sciences, believes such pressures are not extreme in the Netherlands. “If I compare things with other countries and especially other schools, you hear that people are bullied, often seriously,” he says. “Here, you don’t really see that. If people try to bully me, I just ignore it. I’ve got my own friends who I get on with. I don’t have a social ‘image’ or think that everyone has to like me – it’s not realistic.” Dani, whose mother is Indonesian and Polish and whose father is Moroccan, says his father spends more time on Facebook than he does. Saffron Jones, also 16, and majoring in social sciences, is half-English and half-Dutch. She says that from when her parents split up 11 years ago, her friendship group has always been supportive. “I could always stay with my friends at primary school. Now, if I’m stressed about school, mostly one of my friends is good in that subject, so I’ll call them and they help. It calms me down.”
The HBSC data supports this: 86% of Dutch teenagers say their classmates are kind and helpful, putting the country top of the tables at 13 and 15. Sex education starts at four, and Saffron says her boyfriend is accepted by her friends and parents. Meanwhile a poster on her school’s wall encouraging people of all sexualities to “come out” reaffirms that openness is OK. The rate of teenage pregnancies in the Netherlands is also the lowest in the EU. The Dutch school system – almost entirely publicly funded – incorporates major exams at about the age of 12 and three levels of secondary education from practical to the most academic. But it is possible to progress from one to the other or repeat a year and, despite concerns about dropping standards and increasing segregation, such flexibility could make for less stress. Yara Agterhof, 17, from Vlaardingen, has just changed her subject focus. “I was a year ahead, [taking] physics, chemistry and biology,” she says. “I figured it was too hard for me and made a decision to go back. Now I have a different profile with the things I do actually enjoy. I don’t feel like I’ve lost a year and I think my parents feel: ‘As long as you’re happy, we’re happy.’” There are social problems such as differences between minority ethnic and native Dutch achievement, while one in nine children grows up in poverty. But Jacqueline Boerefijn, a biology teacher at the Groen van Prinstererlyceum, says even if a school wants to expel a child, it must find another school for them, so there are incentives to deal with issues.
But Boerefijn, who developed happiness classes at the school a decade ago, and also gives positive psychology lessons to educators, is worried that Dutch children are under threat from new pressures around educational achievement. “Please stop putting the bar higher, because we have happy children,” she says. “We already have so many highly educated people, and at the moment there are not enough people to do the plumbing and carpentry jobs.” For Tjalling, it is pretty simple. “In the Netherlands we are rich, most things around children are well organised, like school and healthcare, and if people are poor, we try to help them. That’s maybe why children are happy. “It rains a lot. But you get used to it.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

2018-06-17T07:00:08Z,world,World news,"After off-pitch upheavals, team colours lose allure for some Brazil fans","Historically, football united Brazil’s 200 million-plus people, who took pride in their national team’s record five World Cup wins and wore its emblematic canary yellow and green shirt during games that emptied city streets.
Then came the recession, the street demonstrations, the endless graft scandals, the divisive impeachment of the leftist president Dilma Rousseff and, more recently, a debilitating national truckers’ strike during which protesters waving Brazilian flags called for a military coup. Nowadays, Brazilians are no longer as proud of their country or their team – to the point that some fans will wear red when Brazil line up for the first game against Switzerland – while others are even going so far as to root for arch-rivals Argentina. One street in a working-class neighbourhood in Teresina, in the north-eastern state of Piauí has even been painted in the light blue and white of Messi’s team – the equivalent of a Halifax road being decorated in Germany’s white, black, red and yellow. The colours were the idea of Raimundo Pereira Júnior, 35, who talked his neighbours into contributing £5 each to daub 8 Street with Argentina’s colours. He said that he and his neighbours are supporting Argentina – a country he has never visited – to express their disgust over failing public services and corruption. “The country is broken. It is an embarrassment. I am ashamed to live here in Brazil today,” he said. Such revulsion is a sign of the rising discontent and disillusionment. Even in the dark days of the military dictatorship, which ruled from 1964-1985, leftwing guerrillas suffering torture in prison rooted for Brazil in the 1970 World Cup, according to Rousseff, a former member of the armed resistance, who told the story four years ago while trying to fire up enthusiasm for the previous tournament, which Brazil hosted. After a slow start, Brazilians got behind their team that time around – but a humiliating 7-1 thrashing by Germany in the semi-final left deep scars on the national psyche. “Nobody swallowed the 7-1,” said Pereira Júnior. And since then the country has staggered from one crisis to another. In 2016, Rousseff was impeached after huge street demonstrations by middle-class Brazilians angry about rampant graft who wore canary yellow and green team shirts. Many see her removal as a coup by any other name and leftists have sworn off the national colours.
“They have taken the green and yellow of Brazil and I will not wear it any more,” said Angela de Siqueira, 62, a retired university professor in Rio de Janeiro who used wear a team shirt to watch Brazil games – but this year doesn’t even have a copy of the match schedule. In April Luísa Cardoso, 26, an architect and designer from Uberlândia in Minas Gerais state started selling a red version of the Brazil shirt emblazoned with the hammer and sickle – but the Brazilian Football Federation, the CBF, warned her off using its logo. That turned out to be a blessing, because the CBF has faced more graft scandals than many troubled Brazilian institutions. Last December its former president José Maria Marin was convicted of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering and is awaiting sentencing in a US jail. In April his successor, Marco Polo Del Nero, was banned for life by Fifa for taking bribes, fined 1m Swiss francs and lost his job. Consquently, said Cardoso, “many people said they prefer the new shirt without the CBF symbol.” Some of her townsfolk are even opting for the green shirt of fourth division Uberlândia Esporte Club. But Cardoso will still support her home country. “I will cheer for Brazil and after they are out, I will cheer for Argentina,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/brazil-world-cup-shirt-colours,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/brazil-world-cup-shirt-colours
2018-06-17T05:00:10Z,world,World news,"Next stop, Nina Simone … Paris metro ‘must honour its heroines’","To travel on the Paris métro is to take a journey through French – and world – history. Honoured with a station name are war heroes, statesmen, artists and writers including Charles de Gaulle, Markos Botsaris, Franklin D Roosevelt and Victor Hugo. But notable by their absence are women. Only four of the 303 stops on 16 lines are named after female figures, French or otherwise. Now, with two new stations being created on a central line extension, French feminists say it is time to end the snub. The campaign group Osez le féminisme (Dare to be a feminist) is urging people to vote for a woman in an online consultation that offers six possible names – three male and three female – that closes on 17 June. “Did you know that in Paris only four métro stations out of 303 make reference to a woman … You want to change that? So vote!” the organisation writes on its Facebook page. Raphaëlle Rémy-Leleu, a spokeswoman, told the Observer: “We have to rename a few more existing stations after women. Most stations make reference to the exploits of what we call in France the Grands Hommes, but we have some great women who also deserve to be recognised. Unfortunately, this is not reflected in the métro which is an example of how France continues to ignore the role of women in its history.” Among the proposed new station names are the French singer-songwriter Barbara – born Monique Andrée Serf – who died in 1997; Lucie Aubrac, a member of the French Resistance who died in 2007; and the American singer Nina Simone, who died in 2003.
Last month, the Europe stop on line 3 was renamed Europe-Simone Veil in honour of the health minister and Auschwitz survivor, who died last year. The three other stations named after women are Barbès-Rochechouart, a tribute to Marguerite de Rochechouart de Montpipeau, who was abbess of Montmartre; Pierre et Marie Curie, after the Nobel prize-winning physicists, and Louise Michel, a Paris Commune militant. There is a Rosa Parks station on the RER suburban rail network in north Paris, named after the American civil rights activist. Rémy-Leleu said: “Historically, we have effaced women from transport. In fact, the situation is even worse than reported, because of those four stations, only one is not part of a composite name and that is Louise Michel, a station that’s not actually in Paris intra mures [within the city walls].” Last November, President Emmanuel Macron said his country was “sick with sexism” and declared gender equality and combating violence against women to be a “great cause” of his presidency. In March, following a backlash led by the actor Catherine Deneuve against the #MeToo movement that enraged feminists, the government said it would promote gender equality in education, the workplace and daily life, including fines for sexual harassment in public places. Progress, however, is slow. Last year, for the first time since the modern exam was introduced more than 20 years ago, a book by a woman was among the required works for the literary baccalauréat. La Princesse de Montpensier is a 17th-century court romance by Madame de La Fayette. Françoise Cahen, who teaches at a lycée in a south-eastern suburb of Paris, set up a successful petition calling for the education authorities to address the sexism. Last week, while adjudicating at an oral baccalauréat exam she was shocked to discover that not one of the texts given to 300 pupils to study had been written by a woman.
“It was so depressing. Things are slowly but surely getting better, but there’s still some way to go,” Cahen said. “The publishers of school books are making a lot of effort to improve the proportion of women writers and so things are moving forward but gradually.” Osez le féminisme’s Métro campaign has been criticised by those suggesting there are more important issues. Rémy-Leleu admits the station campaign is “symbolic”, but points out that the group is also pushing for lesbian couples and single women to be given the same access to fertility treatment as heterosexual couples. It is also running a protest against a concert tour by Bertrand Cantat, a rock star who was convicted of killing his partner Marie Trintignant in 2003. France has a history of naming roads or railway stations after celebrated figures, even foreigners. Last November, the Burgundy town of Avallon named a street after Jo Cox, the MP for Batley and Spen who was killed during the Brexit campaign in June 2016. But this is the first time métro station names will be chosen by the public. They are due to open in June 2021.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/paris-metro-male-names-world-without-women-public-vote-new-stations,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/paris-metro-male-names-world-without-women-public-vote-new-stations
2018-06-17T05:00:09Z,world,World news,"Doubted at home, bypassed abroad: is Merkel’s reign nearing a frustrated end?","For nearly 14 years as Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel has defined and personified Europe’s middle ground: pragmatic, consensual, mercantilist, petit-bourgeois, above all stable. It is little wonder the leader of Mitteleuropa’s major economic power has dominated the political centre for so long. But what if Merkel falls? Can the centre hold? These are increasingly urgent questions as the once unassailable “Mutti” struggles to hold together a fractious coalition. The immediate issue, which is likely to come to a head on Monday, is a furious row over EU immigration policy. But other problems are piling up, with unpredictable consequences for Europe’s future cohesion. Merkel’s political obituary has been written many times, but now the final draft is nearing completion. She is under fire from the hard-right, anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which stormed into the Bundestag last autumn. She has problems with the failing, unpopular Social Democrats on her left, on whom she depends for support. More seriously, though, Merkel is being challenged from within by her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, former chairman of Bavaria’s rightwing CSU, which is allied to Merkel’s Christian Democrats. In sum, Seehofer is demanding Germany no longer admit migrants who have first entered the EU via other member states – which is nearly all of them. In Merkel’s view, such a bar would be illegal and would wreck her efforts – ongoing since the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis, when Germany accepted 1 million migrants – to create a balanced, EU-wide policy of voluntary migrant quotas. She says Seehofer should wait for this month’s EU summit to come up with a joint plan. The problem with that approach is twofold. Seehofer’s CSU, which faces a critical electoral clash with the AfD in October, complains that the EU has been trying and failing to agree this for years. Another objection, as her critics see it, is that most Germans, recalling her 2015 “open door” policy, do not trust Merkel on this issue. Polls indicate 65% back tighter border controls. Last week’s row between France and Italy, sparked by Rome’s decision to refuse entry to a ship, the Aquarius, carrying 629 migrants rescued off Libya, showed how improbable is the prospect of agreement at the Brussels summit. Italy’s new populist leadership, in common with an emerging axis of nationalist-minded governments in Austria, Hungary and Poland, believes it has a mandate to halt the migrant flow. Meanwhile, so-called “frontline states” such as Greece, Spain and Italy accuse “destination states” such as Germany, France and the UK of failing to accept a fair share of migrants.
Divisions have been exacerbated by the failure, so far, of a key Merkel-backed initiative, the multibillion-euro EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, to reduce migration by addressing “root causes” in places such as Nigeria, Eritrea and Somalia. Reported scandals over the mistreatment of migrants, and inflammatory publicity given to crimes carried out by asylum seekers, stoke the tensions. Merkel’s difficulties extend beyond one rebellious senior minister. In the view of many analysts, she has not re-established her domestic authority since the CDU lost seats in last September’s federal elections and she scrabbled for months to form a coalition. On international issues, Merkel also appears jaded and discouraged, according to close observers. Der Spiegel paints a picture of a leader whose cherished worldview of a rules-based international order has been severely shaken by the apparent impunity enjoyed by authoritarian regimes such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia and Xi Jinping’s China. The advent of Donald Trump, the “disrupter-in-chief”, and his America First ideology has proved even more damaging than Merkel feared, Der Spiegel said. “If Hillary Clinton had won the US election, Merkel would not have run again [in 2017],” it reported, citing a close confidant. “But that didn’t happen. In his new book about his years in the West Wing, former Barack Obama adviser Ben Rhodes writes that Merkel felt obligated to defend the free world order in the wake of Trump’s victory.” Maybe that struggle is proving too burdensome. The immediate post-Obama days, when Merkel was hailed as western democracy’s lone saviour, are long gone, too. Trump appears to be conducting a vendetta with Germany over what he sees as unfair export practices and unequal defence spending. Is there a competitive, misogynist tinge to his behaviour? Probably. In any event, Berlin has more to lose than most if promised retaliatory EU tariffs, which Merkel failed to water down, provoke a full-blown trade war with Washington. Meanwhile, Trump’s loud-mouthed ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, openly conspires with her conservative rivals. Yet it is Europe, where the Merkel brand has been pre-eminent for so long, which may prove her biggest end-of-career disappointment. Merkel has been outflanked by the reform agenda espoused by Emmanuel Macron. France’s brash new president seeks greater European integration in financial matters, eurozone policy, development and defence. Another, separate bust-up looms over funding the EU’s first post-Brexit budget shortfall. Many in Germany suspect Macron wants Berlin to foot the bill for his grand plan. Smaller EU states are suspicious, too. Popular pressure is for less Brussels, not more – witness the Eurosceptic mood in Italy and Greece. Rather than build a more united Europe, Macron’s ideas could tear it asunder. Merkel’s response has been characteristically cautious. But the sense that she has lost the initiative, and is no longer the leading lady holding things together, is palpable. And, behind her back, Germany’s nationalists and populists skulk like thieves in the night, with knives drawn.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/angela-merkel-doubted-at-home-reign-ending,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/angela-merkel-doubted-at-home-reign-ending
2018-06-17T05:00:06Z,world,World news,Colombia votes in election that could become fresh poll on Farc deal,"Colombia goes to the polls on Sunday to choose the country’s first president since a historic peace deal was signed with leftist Farc rebels. From 8am, voters can choose between Iván Duque, a neophyte conservative who opposes the peace deal, and Bogotá’s former mayor Gustavo Petro, once a leftist rebel himself, who defends it.
That deal, signed in 2016, formally ended five decades of civil war that killed 220,000 people and displaced 7 million. However, the deal was initially rejected in a referendum, with many taking umbrage at the accord’s promises of softer sentencing for rebel leaders and guaranteed seats in congress. Duque’s mentor, hardline former president Alvaro Uribe, led the campaign to upend the deal, though it was later amended and ratified by lawmakers. Many Colombians feel they have been blindsided by the move and on Sunday will have a chance to take their outrage to the ballot box.
The bruising race has revealed surging polarisation in the Andean nation, with both candidates eliminating moderates in a first round last month, without gaining enough of the vote to win outright. Polls put Duque as the favourite, though a key decider of the election will be which candidate is able to win the votes that went to defeated centrists in the first round. Duque, though market-friendly, talks tough on drugs and crime, while Petro wants to wean Colombia off its dependence on fossil fuels. Both men have accused each other of authoritarian tendencies.
Petro has had to defend himself from claims he favours neighbouring Venezuela’s collapsing socialist model. More than a million Venezuelans have fled to Colombia, stoking fears among many voters that their country could face the same fate. Petro is the first leftist candidate to make it this far in the conservative country. Some worry Duque, a political unknown before being handpicked by Uribe in 2014 to fill a party senate seat, will be his mentor’s puppet if elected. Uribe’s time in office was marked with military successes against the Farc that took huge tolls on civilians. He also weaponised a state intelligence agency to spy on opposition figures. The insults have been thrown from afar, with Duque breaking tradition by refusing to debate with Petro on live television on the eve of the election. Experts worry that the spectre of political violence could return to a fiercely divided country, despite a Farc peace deal that has already been partially implemented. “Polarisation is common in politics around the world,” said Pedro Piedrahita Bustamente, a political science professor at the University of Medellín. “But here, where there is a history of internal armed conflict, it could be a dangerous thing.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/colombia-votes-election-farc-deal-petro-duque,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/colombia-votes-election-farc-deal-petro-duque
2018-06-16T17:16:36Z,world,World news,Isis claims deadly suicide bombing as Afghans celebrate Taliban ceasefire,"At least 25 people have been killed in a suicide bombing in eastern Afghanistan as elsewhere across the country jubilant scenes marked the first ceasefire between the Taliban and Afghan government in 17 years. Islamic State, which is not part of the ceasefire, claimed the attack in Nangarhar province, near the city of Jalalabad. Civilians, Taliban members and Afghan soldiers were killed as they mingled together in unprecedented fashion on the second day of the festival of Eid, which marks the conclusion of Ramadan. The Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, announced on Saturday that the government would extend its week-long ceasefire, which had been due to end on Tuesday, indefinitely. In a rare televised address, Ghani thanked the Taliban for observing the truce and asked the group to extend its own three-day Eid ceasefire, which it announced after the government’s in a promising sign of reciprocity. For many Afghans it has been first glimpse of peace in their lifetime.
Unarmed Taliban fighters waving flags entered Kabul and other major cities after the government said it would allow them to visit their families over the holiday. Militants hugged and posed for photographs with soldiers in uniform. Some handed out red roses. In Kabul, others sought directions from locals to the capital’s most famous ice-cream parlour. There were also rare scenes of impromptu diplomacy as the interior minister, Wais Barmak, met Taliban members on the outskirts of the capital and district governors broke bread with their Taliban “shadow” counterparts over lunch. “I’m 40 years old and this is the best Eid I’ve had in my entire life,” one Kandahar resident said on a BBC radio phone-in. “I can see Taliban walking around among ordinary people.” Taliban members were similarly moved. “Tears were in our eyes and we could not speak for weeping,” Baz Muhammad, a 26-year-old commander in the Haqqani branch of the Taliban, said. “We were warmly welcomed in by everyone ... I felt for the first time in the eight years of my jihadist life that I am at least safe.” Others said the ceasefire had shifted their perception of peace. “I offered an Afghan soldier breakfast with me,” said Mullah Hanif Shah, a 30-year-old subcommander in Zabul province. “This was a dramatic development. I hope now that my leader and president Ghani make peace.” Ghani said in his televised speech that he was ready to discuss the removal of foreign forces, which were excluded from the Taliban’s ceasefire and remain a key stumbling block to peace in the eyes of many fighters. A senior member of the Taliban’s council said the group would meet on Sunday to discuss Ghani’s offer and that the ceasefire could be extended if a date was set for the withdrawal of US forces. The UN secretary general’s special representative for Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto, wrote in the Washington Post: “I truly believe the outlines for a peace deal are now discernible through the haze and dust of war.” The ceasefire followed large peace rallies around the country and came as 80 citizens continued a 600km-long peace march from Lashkar Gah to Kabul. Barnett R Rubin, an Afghanistan at the Center on International cCooperation, said the ceasefire would make it easier for high-level talks to occur as Taliban fighters had strictly obeyed the command of their leaders. “They are all involved and they all have ownership ... It hasn’t been limited to a ceasefire. There has been mass fraternisation,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/isis-claims-deadly-suicide-bombing-as-afghans-celebrate-taliban-ceasefire,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/16/isis-claims-deadly-suicide-bombing-as-afghans-celebrate-taliban-ceasefire
2018-06-16T14:59:00Z,world,World news,Tourists and tech bring resilient Iceland back from the brink,"Ten years since the financial crisis in Iceland, the noise of the computer servers mining for bitcoin on a former Nato airbase is many decibels louder than the vast turbines spinning away in the hydroelectric power plant down the road. Having come through the crisis a decade ago, Iceland is now enjoying an economic revival, with technology, renewable energy and tourism replacing the unsustainable boom in banking. Visitor numbers have quadrupled and output per head is among the strongest in Europe. The employment rate is the highest in the world. But there are fears the economy could bubble out of control once more as tourist money floods in, pushing up the value of the Icelandic króna – which is among the most volatile free-floating currencies in the world, given the tiny population behind it. The price of cod used to push the króna around even before the hot money from the banking industry arrived; now it’s visitors arriving at Keflavik airport, next to the shimmering, sulphurous Blue Lagoon, that shift it. Ten years since the collapse of the Icelandic economy, the country’s government has invited the Observer to see how things have changed. Touring a room with thousands of box-sized supercomputers – LEDs blinking and cooled by the arctic wind, each consuming more energy from geothermal and hydroelectric power than the average household – would suggest quite a lot has happened in a decade. Sigurður Hannesson, director general of the Federation of Icelandic Industries, says: “Historically we had fishing, now we have tourism. But we need to diversify further to make the economy more stable.” There could hardly have been a more unlikely victim of the financial crisis than a country of about 350,000 inhabitants – equivalent to the population of Bradford – occupying a volcanic island midway between Europe and North America. The landscape is weather-beaten and the capital, sleepy Reykjavik, seems a world apart from the City or downtown Manhattan. Remote and full of crashing waterfalls, glaciers and geysers, Iceland had been best known for decades to outsiders for the northern lights, fishing and the fermented shark dish known as hákarl. Yet the island’s boom-bust-boom economy has punched above its weight for years, with Iceland adding sporting prowess this year as the smallest nation ever to send a football team to the World Cup. The problems came as the country began to emulate the neoliberal policies of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher by cutting taxes to stimulate private investment throughout the early 2000s. Inflation soared and the central bank was forced to use dizzyingly high interest rates to keep control, jacking them up to 15.5% in the months before the 2008 crash. Money came flowing into the country’s private banks as depositors from across Europe sought world-beating interest rates on their savings. The lenders stretched themselves further with funding from financial markets and went on a buying spree of assets around the world – acquiring foreign firms, property and football clubs and taking their assets to about 10 times the size of the domestic economy.
When the global economic storm of 2008 landed, with the US sub-prime bubble bursting and the world’s banks ceasing to lend to one another for fear they would never be repaid, Iceland’s big three lenders – Kaupthing, Glitnir and Landsbanki – had debts worth more than six times national annual economic output. They quickly came crashing down. “Even compared to other very highly financialised centres such as Luxembourg or Singapore, Iceland looked ridiculous,” says Jessica Hinds, European economist at Capital Economics. “What was driving growth back then was very much a financial-sector bubble, which of course ended disastrously.” But rather than stepping in with taxpayers’ money like the British and Americans did, the Icelandic government let its banks go bust. Unlike the complex UK economy and its globally significant financial system, so the argument went, relatively small Iceland could afford to do so. The repercussions were still significant, as protesters took the streets throwing snowballs and eggs. The prime minister, Geir Haarde, was found guilty in a special trial staged after the crash – ostensibly for failing to hold emergency cabinet meetings in the run-up to it – and the country replaced him with Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir. Driving through Reykjavik past the government house (originally constructed as a prison before its use in politics), Edward, a taxi driver from the city, says “people were pissed” about the bankers’ and politicians’ actions. “And justifiably so … Look at what happened.” Iceland became the first European country since the UK in 1976 to go to the International Monetary Fund for a bailout – requiring $2.4bn, equal to nearly $7,000 for every man, woman and child – before imposing capital controls that were not removed until last year. The króna lost half its value in the three years to the end of 2010, while GDP plunged by 15% during the slump – the biggest contraction recorded by a wealthy economy during the crisis. The impact was similar to the one seen by the British economy after the sudden drop in the value of the pound straight after the Brexit vote, which triggered a jump in inflation and a fall in consumer spending – only amplified for a country 1,000 miles from mainland Europe and reliant on imports. Household spending fell by a quarter and investment dropped by almost three quarters. Despite the turmoil, the weak currency was also Iceland’s saving grace, sparking an export revival and encouraging tourists to the country. The ash cloud of 2010 spewing from one of its volcanoes, grounding flights across Europe, raised fears that Iceland’s recovery could go up in smoke. But tourist numbers have steadily risen by about 25% a year since 2010, hitting 2.2 million last year. The country has now more than made up for the fall in GDP since the crash. By 2016 the economy was growing by as much as 7.2% before the pace moderated as a result of the króna appreciating in value. However, it is still forecast to maintain a growth rate of about 3% over the next two years – more than double the UK’s. Investment has also returned, including from the UK’s richest man – Brexit-supporting Ineos chief executive Jim Ratcliffe – who has bought swaths of land in the north, including three salmon rivers.
Locals thank the tourists for rebooting the economy but are almost overrun, and grow annoyed by hire car drivers pulling over on the side of the single major road around the island to snap pictures of the landscape. There are plans for investment but currently the national infrastructure – which can be difficult to upgrade with only 350,000 people to raise taxes from – sometimes struggles to cope during the peak summer months. Iceland’s finance minister, Bjarni Benediktsson, recognises that the huge number of tourists brings its own challenges. “It’s not just the roads … The health minister just told me in a cabinet meeting that 10% of visits to the emergency room are from tourists. We need more nurses and doctors and staff to accommodate all of the people.” Having reached near maximum capacity, the country is now seeking to diversify its economy into new avenues to make sure its current upswing can be sustainably maintained, without spiralling out of control like last time. “People who used to work in banking have now moved into technology,” says Kristinn Árni Lár, founder of tech website Northstack. “Technology jobs are becoming more and more important for the economy.” Tech startups focused on increasing the sustainability of cod fishing at places like the Ocean Cluster, a hip startup hub in Reykjavik, could be one way forward, as could the bitcoin industry at the Verne Global data centre – although, having witnessed an economic collapse in a country where the banks were not regarded as too big to fail but, says Benediktsson, “too big to save”, the finance minister is wary about Iceland becoming an important centre for cryptocurrency mining. “It cannot be excluded as a risk factor … it might affect our economy if it’s a sector that continues to grow and collapses. I’m not saying that will happen, but it would have an effect.” But whatever happens in Iceland’s economic future, one growth industry its citizens will never hope for again is banking.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/iceland-tourists-tech-resilient-bank-from-brink-financial-crisis,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/16/iceland-tourists-tech-resilient-bank-from-brink-financial-crisis
2018-06-16T14:39:49Z,world,World news,Italy bars two more refugee ships from ports,"Italy’s interior minister has sparked a new migration crisis in the Mediterranean by barring two rescue boats from bringing refugees to shore, a week after the Aquarius was prevented from docking. “Two other ships with the flag of Netherlands, Lifeline and Seefuchs, have arrived off the coast of Libya, waiting for their load of human beings abandoned by the smugglers,” Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant party the League, wrote on his Facebook page. “These gentlemen know that Italy no longer wants to be complicit in the business of illegal immigration, and therefore will have to look for other ports [not Italian] where to go.” Italy’s closure of its ports to the migrant rescue ship Aquarius, which was carrying 620 people, triggered warnings from aid agencies of a deadly summer at sea for people trying to cross the Mediterranean. Axel Steier, the co-founder of Mission Lifeline which operates the Lifeline ship, said his crew had rescued more than 100 migrants off Libya on Friday in an operation with a US warship, and transferred them to a Turkish merchant vessel. He said his ship was too small to make the journey from Libya to Italian ports and that he always transferred migrants to other ships, but insisted those craft should have the right to land in Italy. “I am sure there is an obligation for Italy to take them because its closest safe harbour is Lampedusa. We hand over migrants to Europe because of the Geneva convention,” he said. Vessels chartered by an assortment of European NGOs have plied the waters off Libya for three years, rescuing migrants from leaking boats and transporting them to Sicily. Following Salvini’s decision to prevent the Aquarius from docking, however, Malta quickly followed suit, leaving the vessel stranded at sea until Spain offered to take the ship. It is due to arrive in Valencia on Sunday. Crews of the NGO boats say Salvini’s port closures leaves them without anywhere close by to take the people they rescue, and that the move will prove counterproductive. “It will not stop people coming,” said Ruben Neugebauer, of the German charity ship Sea Watch. “They will come anyway, but more of them will die.” Sea Watch refused last week to take 40 migrants rescued by the US navy ship Trenton off Libya, fearing a fate similar to that of the Aquarius. Trenton waited four days before being allowed to dock in Sicily. Charities say the NGO boats are a vital lifeline, rescuing more than 88,000 people in the past two years, but critics say they are a pull factor, encouraging people to make the dangerous sea journey. More than 600,000 migrants have made the crossing from Libya to Italy in the past four years, and Salvini’s stance reflects frustration that the rest of Europe refuses to take its share of arrivals. At least 13,000 people have drowned trying to reach European shores. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, accused Salvini last week of cynicism and irresponsibility, but at the same time refused to allow the Aquarius to dock at French ports. “Malta and Italy didn’t open their ports, but then most other European governments didn’t help either,” said Izza Leghtas, a senior advocate at Europe for Refugees International. “They are all passing the ball among themselves.“ If the NGO boats are unable to land the people they rescue and cease to operate, Operation Sophia, an EU anti-smuggler mission patrolling the Mediterranean, may take up some of the slack. NGOs, however, say its warships operate too far out to sea, given that people traffickers favour towing rubber boats full of migrants to the edge of Libya’s 12-mile territorial waters before setting them adrift. Italy’s port closures come despite an 85% fall in migrant crossings since last year. The decrease is in part the result of the EU and Italy training and funding Libya’s coastguard to intercept vessels.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/italy-bars-two-more-refugee-ships-from-ports,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/16/italy-bars-two-more-refugee-ships-from-ports
2018-06-16T11:00:44Z,world,World news,Portland man says he was attacked by man linked to far-right Senate candidate,"A man from Portland, Oregon says he was attacked by a member of the far-right Proud Boys group who has links to a Republican Senate candidate in Washington state.
Tim Ledwith, 34, said he was punched by Tusitala “Tiny” Toese, 22, who is aligned with the Proud Boys, a “western chauvinist” group founded by Gavin McInnes, a co-founder of the Vice Media empire. Toese is also a prominent member of Vancouver, Washington-based Patriot Prayer, a group that has staged rallies that have often turned violent in the Pacific north-west over the past year. Patriot Prayer is led by Joey Gibson, a Republican candidate in the US Senate primary in Washington.
Ledwith said the attack happened in a busy shopping area in Portland at around 2.30pm on Friday 8 June. Toese and two other men had been yelling at strangers from a truck, he said. “They were yelling: ‘Support Trump, build the wall,’” Ledwith said. Ledwith responded with a profanity, he said, and the men stopped their vehicle. Ledwith said Toese and another man, Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer supporter Donovan Flippo, got out. “They were calling me a faggot and slinging epithets at me,” Ledwith said. “Tiny walked over calmly and … punched me in the face. I’m like, half his size. I was not a threat to them. I’m 34 years old, not 17. This is not a thing that happens to me day-to-day.” Ledwith said the punch knocked him to the ground and opened a gash in his lip. He was treated at hospital, he said, receiving several stitches. A witness, who did not wish to be identified, told the Guardian she saw the attack from a block away. Toese, she said, punched Ledwith. Flippo, she said, stood beside Toese but was not physically involved. Ledwith offered no physical provocation, the witness said, and did not respond violently.
Photos showed Ledwith’s injuries and Flippo walking towards the pickup truck, wearing a T-shirt marked “Antifa Removal Service”. The pickup, which carries Washington plates, is registered to Russell Schultz of Vancouver, Washington, a known attendee at Patriot Prayer rallies. On 4 June 2017, a Patriot Prayer rally was held in Portland after a double murder on a commuter train allegedly carried out by a man who attended a Patriot Prayer event. The event featured a speech by the chair of the local Republican party and demonstrations by thousands of counter-protesters. Subsequent marches have degenerated into open brawls. The Facebook pages of Toese, Flippo and Schultz feature videos, memes and photography of violence, often carried out by Proud Boy members, at Patriot Prayer events. All three have posted video of a violent rally in Portland on 3 June this year. Toese was arrested at Patriot Prayer events in Portland last August for disorderly conduct, and again in December for disorderly conduct, harassment, assault, and an outstanding warrant. The publication Willamette Week reported violence from Toese in Portland as far back as May 2017. Video from the 3 June rally shows him once again brawling with counter-protesters. Ledwith said he had participated in two counter-protests at Patriot Prayer rallies. At the 4 June 2017 rally, he received a citation for disorderly behavior and was released by National Park Service officers. He thought the men who allegedly attacked him did not recognize him. Toese, Flippo and Schultz did not respond to requests for comment.
Gibson announced his Senate candidacy in February. He is seeking to progress from a crowded primary to challenge the Democratic incumbent, Maria Cantwell, in November. Asked about the alleged attack, Gibson responded in a text message that he had only heard rumors about the attack on social media, but “I didn’t pay attention because I hear stuff like that all the time”. He said he would “ask around” about the incident.
A Portland Police Bureau (PPB) spokesman confirmed that Ledwith reported an assault on Tuesday, and that it had been referred to the detective division. The investigation was ongoing. Earlier, the PPB confirmed that officers were called to the scene on Friday by two people. One call came from an employee of a local business, police said, and one from someone who “appeared to know the person that was reportedly injured”. The Southern Poverty Law Center lists the Proud Boys as a hate group. Earlier this month, speaking to the Guardian in New York, McInnes praised Patriot Prayer. In the interview, he compared Gibson to an imprisoned British anti-Islamic activist, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson. Both men, he said, “have an electricity that is almost divinity”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/portland-proud-boys-alleged-attack-man-patriot-prayer-joey-gibson,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/16/portland-proud-boys-alleged-attack-man-patriot-prayer-joey-gibson
2018-06-16T07:00:39Z,world,World news,A historic handshake … but what did the Trump-Kim summit really achieve?,"It says a lot about the world of diplomacy in 2018 that the most expert commentary on Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un’s Singapore summit came from a tearful former basketball player, Dennis Rodman.
Unlike all the other talking heads dissecting the summit, Rodman has actually met Kim, and spent more time talking to the North Korean leader than anyone in the western world. Almost everyone else is just guessing. Rodman’s view was Kim was a “big kid” who wants to “enjoy his life” and ideally visit the US. When Rodman kept a promise to bring a basketball team to North Korea, Kim told him “this is the first time someone has ever kept their word to me and my country”. If only the world treated Kim the same way, Rodman said in an emotional CNN interview in which tears streaked down his cheeks, “the door will open”.
In Singapore, Trump was practising the Rodman school of diplomacy, behaving towards the North Korean like a solicitous uncle. The president adopted hazy North Korean language on denuclearisation, ditching more precise US arms control terms, defended Kim over the regime’s appalling human rights, and presented him with a gift in the form of a unilateral concession, the suspension of military exercises. “The summit statement is big on hyperbole and short on substance – it reads like it was written by the North Korean negotiating team,” said Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the New America thinktank who has led back-channel contacts with North Korean officials. If this had been Obama, or any other US leader, Trump would have led the howls of derision at these acts of appeasement of a mass murderer. But hypocrisy is not so much a character flaw in Trump as a defining characteristic: actions he denounces in others become admirable when he carries them out himself.
“I signed an agreement where we get everything, everything,” Trump claimed on Friday. In the face of widespread disgust at Trump’s extravagant kowtowing to a dictator responsible for mass murder, the president claimed it was the price for keeping Americans safe. “You know why, because I don’t want you to be killed with a nuclear weapon,” he told a reporter. To some extent, Trump is claiming credit for defusing crises he had helped create, with last year’s “Little Rocket Man” insults and threats to “totally destroy” North Korea. But the standoff with North Korea goes back decades, and – as has happened during previous periods of diplomacy – the two sides had pulled back from the brink in advance of the summit. There have been no North Korean nuclear and long-range missile tests for eight months. Trump claimed he suspended military exercises unilaterally for budget reasons, but the move also removes a flashpoint, and may go some way in lifting the fog of paranoia in Pyongyang. The first test of the new dialogue should be imminent. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is supposed to meet his North Korean counterparts in the next week, and it should be apparent soon if Kim intends to keep his promise to Trump that he would dismantle a missile engine testing site. Robert Carlin, a former CIA officer who was deeply involved in earlier negotiations with the North Koreans, said Pyongyang could do away with its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) programme altogether. “They developed an ICBM programme to get our attention, and it worked. It absolutely worked.” Carlin said. “If they can get something for it, it’s not so hard to give it up.” Another early step could be a freeze on the production of fissile material, shutting down a five-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon which is the only known source of the regime’s plutonium, and a facility for making tritium, used in making hydrogen bombs.
North Korea could also shut down its plutonium reprocessing and uranium enrichment facilities or put them under monitoring. In this scenario, major nuclear disarmament, actually dismantling weapons, would be put off till later, perhaps years later. That would involve a North Korean declaration of their arsenal, access for international weapons inspectors to verify that declaration, following by the disassembly of its weapons and production capacity, which would be shipped out of the country. The regime would only give up weapons it now sees as a guarantee of survival once it has confidence it would not be attacked, according to this argument – and that could take years. “I think it’s important if we can keep up this sensible relationship with the leader, then it’s going to pay dividends,” Carlin said. “People who say: no, he’s a murderous thug, you shouldn’t be dealing with him – what would they have us do? What’s the alternative? Clap him in irons the next time we see him? It’s ridiculous.” Under a proposed timetable put forward by Carlin and a Stanford University physicist, Siegfried Hecker – one of the few westerners to witness the North Korean programme first hand, it would take six years to reach the disarmament phase, and up to 10 years to complete it. For many arms control advocates, this gradual, phased approach is fraught with wider risk. They argue that negotiations with North Korea that are not directly aimed at the speedy dismantling of its rogue nuclear weapons programme would give it legitimacy and send the wrong message to other regimes contemplating whether to build their own bomb. “Trump is legitimising a brutal dictator and the underlying idea that achieving nuclear weapons makes you a legitimate leader. It’s a sad day for diplomacy and arms control,” said Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. From an arms control point of view, the joint statement in Singapore was particularly empty, and significantly less rigorous than a similar joint declaration in 2005. It incorporates the very vague North Korean pledge of steps “toward complete denuclearisation”, a stock phrase of the regime that can mean many things, none of them concrete.
Nor is there any timetable or any mention of verification. These are things the Trump administration had insisted in the run-up to the summit that it would demand of Kim. When Pompeo was asked about verification the day after the summit, he immediately lost his temper, calling the question “insulting” and even “silly”. The defensiveness is understandable given how far short the summit fell of its own expectations. The agreement reached thus far has none of the rigour and substance of Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, which Trump and Pompeo reviled. They are, however, committed to maintaining the appearance of success – at the very least until the congressional midterm elections
In that time, the US and North Korea are committed to further meetings. Those would be an opportunity for Kim to offer unilateral concessions of his own, such as the downgrading of the missile programme. If Rodman is right, and addressing the leader’s paranoia and sense of betrayal is the key to “opening the door”, it could lead to a virtuous cycle of disarmament. If he’s wrong, it will be very hard, if not impossible, to resume the pre-summit level of pressure on Pyongyang. In the absence of nuclear tests, neither China nor Russia, or even South Korea would support a return to isolation. Trump will have been comprehensively played. “Kim will make concrete concessions along the way that further reduce tensions, such as a codification of a testing suspension, freezing the nuclear and missile programmes and even some rollback,” DiMaggio said. “But chances are high that Trump’s approach will morph from ‘complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement’ to ‘we can live with a nuclear North Korea’.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/trump-kim-summit-analysis-north-korea,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/16/trump-kim-summit-analysis-north-korea
2018-06-16T07:00:39Z,world,World news,Colombia's polarised election raises fears for fragile peace,"On a leafy street outside a private university in Medellín, Colombia’s second city, José Botero is plastering cars with bumper stickers. “Vote for Duque,” he shouts to the approval of passing drivers, who honk their horns. “He’s Colombia’s only choice!” Botero is campaigning for Iván Duque, the frontrunner in a bitter presidential race that will conclude on Sunday in a runoff between two candidates from the extremes of the political spectrum.
Duque, a conservative from the Democratic Centre party, and Gustavo Petro, a former mayor of Bogotá – and onetime urban guerrilla – are both campaigning on anti-establishment platforms and picked up enough of the vote in last month’s first round to eliminate a handful of moderate candidates. Hanging in the balance in Sunday’s vote is a fragile peace with the former rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) – a deal which Duque opposes and Petro supports. Botero’s mother was still pregnant with him when his father was kidnapped and murdered by the Farc – and like many Colombians, he was disgusted by the peace agreement.
The deal, which won the outgoing president Juan Manuel Santos a Nobel peace prize, formally ended a war that left 220,000 dead and 7 million displaced. But its terms – including guaranteed seats in congress for Farc leaders and promises of softer sentencing – proved too much for voters who narrowly rejected the agreement in a referendum in late 2016. The deal was amended and later ratified in congress, but many still want it revised. Duque – who has promised to amend key parts of the deal – promises them that opportunity. “No one is against peace,” said Botero, echoing one of Duque’s talking points. “But we won’t see it with the deal that Santos signed.” Pedro Piedrahita Bustamante, a political science professor at the University of Medellín, said Duque’s camp has exploited divisions opened by the peace process. “Colombians are culturally accustomed to war,” he said. “Justice is seen as an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.”
Duque, a fresh-faced but prematurely grey 41-year-old, spent much of his adult life in Washington DC working at the Inter-American Development Bank, before he was hand-picked for a senate seat in 2014 by former president Álvaro Uribe. Like his mentor, he is a social conservative: tough on drugs and crime and opposed to gay marriage. Much of Duque’s voter base was gifted to him by Uribe, who left office in 2010, but remains a major player in Colombian politics.
Uribe’s tenure was dogged by scandal. A state intelligence agency was shut down after he used it to spy on the opposition, journalists and members of the supreme court. His military campaign against the rebels was marked by grave human rights abuses: thousands of civilians were murdered in order to falsely inflate combat statistics. But he commands huge support in his hometown Medellín and the surrounding Antioquia province, which voted overwhelmingly against the peace deal.
“Like him or hate him, Uribe has been a force in every major election since 2002 when he first came to power,” Piedrahita said. “And here in Antioquia he is the king.” Uribe is constitutionally barred from re-election, and although both men have vehemently denied that the former president would have any say in government if his protege is elected, many see Duque as his puppet. Before Duque announced his candidacy, many Uribe supporters had already pledged their vote to the former president’s cause. Billboards appeared on rural highways, emblazoned with the words “whoever Uribe says”. “Uribe is the best president Colombia has ever had,” said Johnny Andrés Copete, a civil servant who moonlights as a community organiser for Democratic Centre. “But Duque is the future now – there’s no division here.” In Medellín, support for Duque is practically universal. Cars are plastered with his campaign’s bumper stickers; billboards loom over the city showing him with his arms out, as though inviting a hug. José Rodríguez, one of the city’s countless taxi drivers, admitted he had never heard of Duque until a year ago. “But we trust Uribe here – if he could ever run again, I’d vote for him.”
Nowadays, the hot-tempered former president presents an image of an affable, grandfatherly figure – but that view is far from universal. Luz Marina Galeano remembers Uribe’s tenure well. She leads a group of women who lost loved ones in one of Medellín’s poorest slums when Uribe ordered a military crackdown on Farc’s urban militias. As army Black Hawk helicopters whirled overhead, more than 1,000 soldiers flooded the streets of the Comuna 13 district, rooting out suspected rebels and their supporters. When the troops withdraw, paramilitaries filled the vacuum, continuing a terror campaign against civilians. “We victims remember the war because we lived it,” said Galeano. Galeano’s husband was accused by paramilitaries of working with the guerrillas, and was last seen being dragged from a bus in 2008. His remains are thought to lie with hundreds of others in a landfill site overlooking the city. “A vote for Duque is the same as voting for Uribe – and it means more war,” she said. Uribe has attempted to undermine several investigations into his involvement in paramilitary massacres, and with Duque at the helm opponents worry the former president could avoid any legal reckoning. A key witness in one investigation recently turned up dead. Steven Levitsky, professor of government at Harvard University and co-author of How Democracies Die, worries that should Duque win, Colombia risks backsliding towards authoritarianism.
“There’s certainly cause for concern,” he said. “If you look back at the Uribe presidency, the human rights record was terrible. You saw various attempts to concentrate power and various efforts – some successful – to violate civil liberties.” The question many are asking is whether Duque – who in his rhetoric is more moderate than Uribe – will be able to distance himself from his mentor. “The more distance that appears between the two, the safer Colombian democracy is,” said Levitsky, adding that the leader in modern history to have successfully ruled via a puppet leader is Vladimir Putin.
“It may seem that Duque is a political nobody without much political experience or talent, so it looks from the vantage point of today that Uribe should have a pretty easy time of controlling him.” But for Duque’s supporters, he remains the only option regardless of what academics say. His market-friendly approach differs from Petro, who rails against multinational corporations. Petro’s hesitancy in distancing himself from neighbouring Venezuela’s late president Hugo Chávez also opened him up to criticism. More than a million Venezuelans have fled to Colombia to escape their country’s political and economic crisis. Some voters, stoked by bellicose rhetoric, worry that Petro could lead Colombia into similar chaos. “I’m voting for Duque for the salvation of my country,” said Camila Rodríguez, a student in Medellín voting for the first time in her life. “If Petro wins, the Farc won’t answer for their crimes and we risk becoming like Venezuela.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/colombias-election-peace-ivan-duque-gustavo-petro,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/16/colombias-election-peace-ivan-duque-gustavo-petro
2018-06-16T06:00:38Z,world,World news,'Dubai in Paris': French climate protesters fight plans for €3bn theme park,"Tending her rows of courgettes, leeks and potatoes, Cécile Coquel, a telecoms worker and guerilla gardener, stood firm despite local authorities’ recent warning that everything must be ripped up and the field vacated. “These are the vegetables of the resistance!” she proclaimed. “We’ll fight to save this land.” The patchwork of highly fertile fields 15km (9 miles) from Notre Dame cathedral, as the crow flies, is the closest remaining farmland to northern Paris, nudging up against some of the most deprived towns on the French capital’s outskirts. But it has become a political and environmental battlefield as the state and private investors prepare to concrete over around 280 hectares of it. They plan to create a business park and a vast €3bn (£2.6bn) theme park, leisure and tourism complex called EuropaCity. With a giant indoor snow dome and fake ski slopes, enormous waterpark, virtual reality rollercoasters, art exhibition spaces, a circus, hotels and a shopping “experience”, it aims to attract a staggering 30 million visitors a year, rivalling Disneyland Paris. The project has been dubbed “Dubai in Paris.” “The irony is that we’re right next to Le Bourget where France signed the Paris climate accords and then Emmanuel Macron promised to ‘make our planet great again’,” sighed Coquel, 46, a former Communist councillor. “This type of giant out-of-town development seems like a relic of the past. If we instead replanted this land with market-gardening, we could feed the surrounding area with local produce.”
EuropaCity, which would cover 80 hectares and take almost 10 years to create, would be the biggest private investment in France since the construction of Disneyland Paris in 1992. Its supporters, along with some local mayors, say that it would bring 10,000 jobs to the northern suburbs, parts of which have unemployment rates that are more than double the national average.But protesters warn that building a giant out-of-town leisure and tourism complex goes against the government’s green credentials. Even president Macron’s environment minister, Nicolas Hulot, has been critical of the idea of building on agricultural land. But the state supports the project.
In March a local court suspended the development permit saying the public needed to be better informed over the environmental impact. The state has lodged an appeal. The row comes at a time of theme park expansion in France, which the pro-business president Macron has welcomed. Disneyland Paris, Europe’s most visited theme park, recently announced a €2bn investment to expand and build three new areas based on Marvel superheroes such as Spider-Man and the Hulk, a snow-queen inspired attraction based on the animated film Frozen as well as another Star Wars zone. Macron hailed the Disney expansion, declaring “France is back!” Disneyland Paris sits on a 2,230-hectare site about 32km east of Paris and the company already owns the land for the new development. The park, which has struggled with vast debt in the past, accounts for 6% of France’s tourism income, and employs more than 16,000 people – although workers come from more than 100 countries, not just from the local area. Further north of Paris, Parc Asterix, the theme-park devoted to the comic book crusader from ancient Gaul, is also building new attractions. At a protest picnic on the farmland known as the Triangle de Gonesse, where EuropaCity is planned, Jean-Yves Souben remembered cycling his bike near here as a child. The Green councillor said: “Right now the mayor of Paris is planting greenery on walls and roofs in Paris to combat climate change and fight the city’s rising temperatures. And yet this prime farmland bordering the capital is about to be concreted over. It makes no sense!” Environmentalists opposing the theme park have presented their own project to turn the area into a market-gardening hub to meet organic food targets in local school canteens. “This is about the climate,” said Robert Levesque, an agricultural engineer. He said concreting over this land so near Paris could raise the temperature of future heatwaves in the city and surrounding area. “It’s a rare jewel,” said the economist and urban-planner Jacqueline Lorthiois. “It makes no sense to develop this, it would be an environmental aberration and I don’t believe the jobs created will go to local people.” In the nearby town of Aulnay-sous-Bois, Kamel Lakal sat in a cafe by an independent bookseller and a long parade of local shops. He is head of the local association of shopkeepers, and ran a florist and an opticians. “Developing a vast out-of-town complex with hundreds of shops threatens to siphon off local trade and wipe us out,” he said. “We’ve built up a town centre here, but it’s very hard and we’re at the end of our rope. Putting in a huge new shopping development would kill us”. Maria Da Silva, a market-stall holder and representative of the markets federation, said that with local small business unable to compete, thousands of jobs in the area would be lost. “The government had promised to do more to protect town-centres - this goes against that. We’re angry.” Benoît Chang, the head of the EuropaCity project, which is led by the French group Auchan and the Chinese conglomerate Wanda, denied the project would harm local businesses, insisting it would bring 10,000 jobs and increase the dynamism of the area. He said EuropaCity would be “extremely innovative” and go beyond environmental and sustainability targets. “We have fixed extremely high environmental standards that’s why the project is so expensive,” he said. He argued that the project would be concentrated on the south of the current farmland area in order to preserve around 400 hectares of the farmland to the north. But on the guerilla gardening patch, the protesters were determined. “Imagine this covered in concrete, it breaks my heart,” said a local translator, Rabha Belbachir. “We’re smaller than David and they’re 100 times bigger than Goliath. But this is about the future of the planet.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/europacity-theme-park-france-climate-protesters-dubai-paris,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/16/europacity-theme-park-france-climate-protesters-dubai-paris
2018-06-16T04:12:34Z,world,World news,"Muslims in Australia at a crossroads, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells says","The government frontbencher Concetta Fierravanti-Wells says Muslims in Australia face prejudice as they arrive at the same “crossroads moment” faced by preceding waves of immigrants. The minister for international development has used a contribution to a compilation rebooting Robert Menzies’ “forgotten people” speech and essays to reflect on the challenges Muslim Australians face, and to emphasise the importance of open dialogue inside and outside the community. She says the various waves of immigrants since the early days of European settlement have all been “targeted” – from the Chinese, Irish and Germans, through the postwar cohort of Italians and Greeks, the Vietnamese and Lebanese in the 1970s and, more recently, Muslim groups. “In that journey, each came to what I term their crossroads moment – that moment when the community says: we are part of Australia; we have come here; we have left our homes; our children were born here; we have made sacrifices to get here; they cannot be in vain; and we cannot let our positive contribution to Australia be judged by the actions of a few rotten apples in our community.” Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon
Fierravanti-Wells says Muslims in Australia face prejudice. She recounts an anecdote from 2016 when she asked a group of business leaders: “If you had to hire someone and you had three CVs, all with equal qualifications, from Fred, Mario or Mohammed, who would you employ? “No one spoke. The looks on their faces answered my question.”
She says to deal effectively with the security challenges presented by young Muslims being radicalised, Australia needs to understand why young people are vulnerable to those overtures, which include the difficulty of finding a job. “To me, this is the essence of what Menzies was talking about,” Fierravanti-Wells says. “Rather than fostering hatred, deal with the issues head on. To resolve the challenge of radicalisation, it means working with communities at risk to ensure they not only own the problem but support them to own the solution. “With hindsight, I do not believe that we have done so effectively in the past, but we very much need to do so in future.” Fierravanti-Wells says the community must safeguard the wellbeing of its young people. “It is not a vague or general responsibility but one that now falls on parents, community leaders, friends and families who are close to someone who is disillusioned with their life or misguidedly find an attraction to Daesh or Isis.
“These people are the frontline – the first to see changes in a person who is becoming radicalised and stop that young person before he or she goes too far down the wrong path. “I appreciate, from my many consultations across the spectrum of the Muslim communities, many are fearful because they are being targeted by some Australians who prefer to hate, rather than understand that the bad deeds are being done by a few. “They can face prejudice, especially women who have often borne the brunt of abuse because of their attire. As Liberals, we believe in the inalienable rights and freedoms of all people, including freedom to practise their religion and beliefs without intimidation or interference, so long as those practices are within Australian law.” The essay by Fierravanti-Wells appears in a collection edited by Paul Ritchie, a former speechwriter to Tony Abbott. In his original 1942 essay, Menzies argued that the cultivation of the spirit of hatred against the Japanese was not a proper instrument of war policy. The new collection, which has contributions from Malcolm Turnbull, Abbott and a number of frontbenchers, will be launched at the federal council meeting of the Liberal party on Saturday afternoon. Fierravanti-Wells says the original essay was written “at the height of the war and anti-Japanese propaganda”. “Menzies’ concerns were that the propaganda was proceeding on the no doubt honestly held belief that a spirit of hatred amongst our own people is a proper instrument of war,” she says. “He asked himself the question: Are Australians so lacking in the true spirit of citizenship that they need to be artificially filled with the spirit of hatred?
“Seventy-fve years on it is a question that still holds true. Today’s war is much more insidious, with atrocities abounding. Terrorism and the hatred it engenders can strike at the very heart of our society, literally as you walk down the street. This makes instilling fear and engendering hatred just as easy as in 1942.” She notes that intelligence is vital in any war, and the Muslim community in Australia has made a positive contribution to combating security threats. “Most of the recent terrorist attempts have been foiled following intelligence from the [Muslim] community. In alerting authorities they have put their duty to Australia, its laws and values ahead of competing concerns for family or friends whose actions sought to harm Australians.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/muslims-in-australia-at-a-crossroads-concetta-fierravanti-wells-says,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/16/muslims-in-australia-at-a-crossroads-concetta-fierravanti-wells-says

The Liberal party’s youth arm had called on the government to relocate its embassy from Tel Aviv to Israel’s legislative capital, and to suspend all aid to Palestine “until it terminates its ‘Martyr’s fund”.
The motion, which is non-binding, was carried in a vote 43 to 31, but the foreign minister said there was no chance the government would adopt it as policy. There are 110 council delegates who have voting rights at the national council. “While I understand the sentiment behind this resolution, the Australian government will not be moving our embassy to Jerusalem,” Bishop said. “Jerusalem is a final status issue and we have maintained that position for decades and we are doing all we can do to ensure that any support we give to the Palestinian Authority is only used for purposes that we determine.” Bishop said she had recently written to her Palestinian counterpart to ensure Australian aid, about $43m in the next financial year, was being spent on health, education and governance.
“Our funding to the Palestinian Authority is subject to a memorandum of understanding, defining precisely how it is used and subject to very close audit to ensure that no funds are diverted to the so-called Martyr’s fund,” she said. But Australia did side with the United States to vote against a UN human rights council motion for an independent investigation into last month’s “March of Return” protest deaths. In explaining why Australia was the only other nation, other than America, to vote against sending in investigators, Australian officials said they were concerned the investigation “was not independent or impartial.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/australia-rules-out-moving-its-israel-embassy-to-jerusalem,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/16/australia-rules-out-moving-its-israel-embassy-to-jerusalem
2018-06-16T01:32:21Z,world,World news,Vietnam police investigate American for 'causing trouble' during protests,"The authorities in Vietnam are formally investigating an American man of Vietnamese descent accused of involvement in anti-government protests. William Anh Nguyen, born in 1985, was one of thousands of people who protested in Ho Chi Minh city on Sunday against a draft law to develop economic zones under which land leases of up to 99 years will be offered to investors. The American from Houston, Texas, is currently studying in Singapore.
Protesters fear the leases might be snapped up by investors from powerful neighbour China, with which Vietnam has a rocky history. Nguyen was “gathering and causing trouble” in Ho Chi Minh city on Sunday and was filmed on camera urging others to climb over barricades, the state-run Vietnam News Agency reported. Video footage and witness accounts of a subsequent police crackdown show Nguyen dragged through the streets by plain-clothed police, bleeding from a head injury. State media reported on the weekend that Nguyen had been prosecuted by the Vietnamese police for disrupting the peace, but the US embassy has confirmed he is still under investigation and no formal charges had been brought. The relationship between China and Vietnam has long been strained, but with the growth of Chinese influence across south-east Asia – mainly through infrastructure projects as part of their Belt and Road Initiative – and China’s increasing encroachment across the South China Sea, some Vietnamese have become fearful of their neighbour. Nguyen was one of more than 100 arrested in the demonstrations, which also took place in Hanoi and central Vietnam’s Khanh Hoa and Binh Thuan provinces, where protesters faced tear gas and water cannon when they tried to storm the office of the People’s Committee. A US state department official said it had raised concerns and engaged with Vietnamese authorities on the matter and that the Vietnamese government permitted consular access to Nguyen on Friday.
The official said they were deeply concerned by reports that Nguyen was injured on Sunday at the time he was taken into custody by Vietnamese authorities and that they would continue to push for continued and regular access to Nguyen. Vietnam’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang denied any use of force against Nguyen during a news conference on Thursday. Ho Chi Minh police said on their website on Friday that they were dealing with 310 people over the protests and that seven of them were criminal cases. It was unclear if Nguyen was one of the seven. They said initial investigations showed there were signs of political opponents and reactionary groups having incited people to protest and destabilise the security and political situation. Vietnam is one of several countries in the region that have claims in the South China Sea, through which an estimated $5tn in trade passes each year. Reuters contributed to this report An earlier version of this article stated that Nguyen had been formally charged by the Vietnamese police. He is still under investigation and has not been prosecuted.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/vietnam-prosecute-american-protests-william-nguyen-state-media,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/16/vietnam-prosecute-american-protests-william-nguyen-state-media
2018-06-16T00:57:03Z,world,World news,Who is Winston Peters? The 40-year rise of New Zealand's next acting PM,"It will have taken the kingmaker 40 years in politics to become king. On Sunday, when New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern is due to deliver her first child, Winston Peters will receive a text message. It will confirm to him that he has taken over the role that he has circled for decades, after first winning entry to parliament in 1978. Peters, 73, will be acting prime minister in Labour’s left-leaning government. The ascension of power will be a curious one for Peters who, at times through his career, has looked like he could take the role with ease and at others like he has actively sabotaged for himself.
Peters and his minority party, NZ First, have often been in positions of consequence – lending support to major parties and allowing them to tip the balance of power in New Zealand’s MMP electoral system. It has lended him the oft-used nickname the “kingmaker,” which he became last year after throwing his support behind Labour. In return he became deputy prime minister and foreign minister, minister for state owned enterprises and minister for racing. In each of these cases he has demanded a price – often with the stipulation that he is offered top cabinet jobs in new governments. He has been foreign minister, representing New Zealand’s interest on the world stage, and deputy prime minister before. In 1996, he secured the job for the right-leaning National-led government. He was kicked out from the role two years later after a leadership challenge from Jenny Shipley, the woman who would become the country’s first female prime minister. “Winston could have been prime minister but for want of himself,” Shipley told Radio New Zealand last year, as part of the broadcaster’s “9th floor” interview series. “His complexity often got ahead of his capability. Watching him on a good day he was brilliant,” she said.
“He was an 85% outstanding leader. And the 15% absolutely crippled him because he would get so myopically preoccupied with a diversion that it took away his capability and intent on the main goal.” Such diversions have become front and centre in recent years. In 2008, he became embroiled in a NZ$100,000 election donation scandal involving a Monaco-based multimillionaire. He famously held up a “NO” sign at a media conference to answer any and all questions about the incident. But he has also been hawkish – leading an inquiry into alleged tax evasion in the Cook Islands, which resulted in a change of legislation and calling out Hollywood actor Ben Affleck for misrepresenting New Zealand’s role in the Iran hostage crisis during his blockbuster film Argo. Peter’s hallmark policy has been the “super gold card” which offers free off-peak travel for all superannuation recipients over 65.
More recently, however, he has sued heads of his own government’s departments after details of his superannuation overpayment were last year leaked to media. Peters is seeking $1.8m in damages for the leak from, among others, the attorney general David Parker, who Peters will direct in cabinet after this weekend. This week he also called for “heads to roll” at the huge dairy cooperative, Fonterra, which is New Zealand’s largest company. In March, Fonterra announced its first ever loss – $348m for the six months to September. “A massive hundreds of hundreds of millions of dollars loss needs an explanation ... there needs to be some accountability,” Peters said. “It goes to the top and the buck stops there.” After Ardern gives birth, it will for Peters, too.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/who-is-winston-peters-the-40-year-rise-of-new-zealands-next-acting-pm,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/16/who-is-winston-peters-the-40-year-rise-of-new-zealands-next-acting-pm
2018-06-15T23:00:29Z,world,World news,The unassuming Australian nun taking on Rodrigo Duterte,"On Monday, Sister Patricia Fox is likely not to be at home. Normally, she spends the morning sitting in the walled front yard of the modest home in Quezon City, north-east of Manila, that she shares with six of her fellow nuns. Mornings, she says, are “lazy” time. She drinks tea, takes calls from friends and colleagues and prepares for an afternoon of voluntary work. But on Monday, if her legal appeals fail, officers of the Philippines Government are expected to arrive, take her away and forcibly deport her – or worse. Jails in the Philippines are tough places.
The stick-thin 71-year-old nun doesn’t plan to let it happen. “I will go to ground,” she says. “I won’t tell you more, but I won’t be sitting around talking to journalists. They should not deport me when I have an appeal underway. And it won’t happen if I can help it.” Sister Fox has been living and working in the Philippines for more than 28 years without receiving a word of publicity. Now, she has sprung to international attention as the Australian nun who has riled a president. In person, it is hard to imagine anyone less threatening. She needs her glasses to read, admits to scattiness and a forgetfulness when it comes to names. She used to be a school teacher, but claims she was “hopeless” – too soft and no discipline. She says she isn’t scared, though she has lost weight due to stress. Under it all, though, she is determined – and brave. In a turn of events that she admits to finding completely bemusing, her personal story has overshadowed the facts she was trying to bring to international attention when she managed to annoy the president. For the first time in this interview, Fox revealed that hers is not the only case of deportation. Five other foreign nationals who worked with her have been targeted. One is in detention, two others have had their passports withdrawn, and two have left the country, one deported and one voluntarily. In all these cases, it has been judged for various reasons that publicity will not help. Fox will not reveal their identities. From Melbourne to Quezon City Fox grew up in suburban Melbourne, the middle of three children in a committed Catholic family. She left school early, finished a teaching degree in night school and became a nun in 1969 at the age of 21, at a time when religious orders were changing rapidly in the wake of Vatican II. She worked in the inner Melbourne suburb of Kensington, helping the tenants of public housing towers. Bailing kids out and being a regular character witness before the court inspired her to become a lawyer, graduating in 1984 and going on to work in community legal centres. Fox didn’t engage intensely with the aftermath of the Vatican II council, but she and her order were profoundly influenced by liberation theology – the synthesis of Christian theology and Marxism then being developed in the 1960s in Latin America. In the late 1980s, her order made a profound policy decision to, as she puts it, “see the world through the eyes of the poor”. After research and exploratory visits, they focused on the Philippines, then in the aftermath of the overthrow of President Ferdinand Marcos and the end of martial law. Fox arrived there to live in 1990, working first in the provinces and rising to be the national co-ordinator of rural missionaries in 2001. From the beginning, she found common ground with farmers and agricultural workers, and in recent years she has volunteered for organisations including UMA Pilipanas, a peak body of agricultural unions and worker groups. Provoking a president Between 6-9 April this year Fox was one of about 30 representatives of human rights groups to travel to the southern island of Mindanao on a fact-finding mission, investigating reports of human rights abuses. Their findings were released this week but have gone almost entirely unreported, both by the Filipino and international media. Duterte has imposed martial law in Mindanao, citing terrorism both from Islamic State sympathisers and from the New People’s Army, the armed wing of the Communist Party. But the fact-finding mission heard that this was cloaking other motivations. Fox and her colleagues heard stories of indigenous people and subsistence farmers being summarily executed or forced off their land to make way for mining and extensions to palm oil and banana plantations. In a statement the group said that the Duterte regime, supported by the USA, had “unleashed a dirty war against farmers and communities…Fear and terror engulf the vast population of farmers, national minorities and the civilian population.”
The group gathered testimony of tribal people being forced to join the military, under threat of being declared members of the New People’s Army (NPA), the armed wing of the Communist party, and executed. They documented a total of 428 cases of forced or fake surrenders and over 100 cases of farmers being killed, often in front of witnesses, by masked gunmen. In the communities of Lupiagan and Licoan, the group was told of residents recently being summoned by the military and promised gifts of rice and money. When they arrived, they were instead photographed mugshot style, holding blank placards. Later, they were shocked to hear on the radio that their names were on a list of NPA members who had surrendered. At every stage, the group was aware of being under surveillance. There were two incidents that Fox believes were the immediate cause of Duterte’s action against her. On one day she and other members of the group visited a jail to interview political prisoners, and on another she attended a demonstration of locked-out workers at the Coca Cola factory in the southern city of Davao. The Coca Cola workers had been employed on contracts for years, with long hours, poor pay and no job security. They formed a union only to find themselves summarily sacked. A picket line was violently broken up by police. On the day the fact-finding mission visited, the workers had called a press conference outside the walls of the factory. The military turned up, but the press didn’t. Nevertheless the workers organised speeches and Fox was invited to say a few words. Aware of the bristling military presence, she reflected that Duterte himself had stated he wanted to end the practice of long-term casual work. She agreed to speak. “I thought I’d just quote the social teachings of the Catholic Church. You know, the right to unionise, the right to a fair wage, the right to security of tenure. And I said that I felt sorry for them, and that I hoped they got their jobs back so they could care for their families. You know, pretty tame sort of stuff.” “He’s clearly angry” Shortly after she returned to Manila, Fox heard that other members of the fact-finding delegation were in trouble with the authorities. She was nevertheless taken by surprise when, at two o’clock in the afternoon on 16 April, six black-uniformed officers from the immigration authorities hammered on her door and demanded she go with them immediately, to “clarify” some things. When she arrived at the bureau of immigration she was told she was being deported as an undesirable alien because she had been joining illegal rallies. Fox believes that she, like some of her colleagues who had been targeted, was expected to leave the country quietly. But in her 28 years of work in the Philippines Fox had gained many supporters.
She had texted friends while in the car being driven to the bureau, and within hours of her arrest church representatives and community groups had mobilised. A crowd had gathered outside the bureau, and international groups were making statements and inquiring about her welfare. She sensed the tension in the room as the officials struggled with the growing outcry, while trying to comply with what is now known to have been a direct instruction from the President. By evening, a pro bono lawyer arrived to represent her. Demanding to see the evidence, Fox and her lawyer were shown two photos – one of the visit to the political prisoners and one of the gathering outside the Coca Cola factory. Neither, Fox’s lawyer pointed out, were rallies. The story shifted. Fox did not have her passport on her. It was being kept by the travel agent who handles the sisters’ business. Now, she was told that she was being deported because she was an undocumented alien. She spent that night sleeping on the floor of the office. Her lawyer presented her passport to the bureau at about 10am the next day, and after more hours of waiting Fox was released, on the understanding that the department would take five days to present further evidence against her, and that her lawyers would have ten days to contest it.
As she walked out of the bureau, Fox was surrounded by cheering supporters, but the euphoria didn’t last. The next day was chilling. Duterte declared in a public address that he had personally ordered her to be investigated for “illegal political activities” and went on to publicly denounce her, saying she had treated “the Philippines like a mattress to wipe your feet on”. “He’s clearly angry, and that’s frightening,” says Fox. On April 23, with the deportation case still before the courts, the government revoked her missionary visa and gave her 30 days to leave the country. Fox’s legal team found out when the bureau issued a media release. An appeal to the Department of Justice bought Fox an extension of the deadline, until this coming Monday. The government was claiming that missionaries were meant only to preach and convert, and were not meant to travel outside their local area. After 28 years in the country, this was news to Fox. It is this – the attempt to prevent foreign religious people from engaging in advocacy - that has galvanised the international religious community. The case is now being fought because of the importance of the precedent. Hence Fox’s determination to avoid being deported before proper legal process. “The international community has to open its eyes” She has been asked by some of her friends whether she would agree to meet Duterte, given a chance. “I said I would hold a meeting with him if I could take with me the people that I spoke to on the fact-finding mission. The farmers, the tribal people, the workers, the fisherfolk. They are the people that I would like him to listen to. Because they’re the ones whose lives are at stake.” Meanwhile, she says: “The international community has to start looking at what’s happening here and not closing their eyes to it because business interests.” She was pleased to see that the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, spoke up recently for human rights in the Philippines. On the other hand, the United States, China and Australia have helped the Philippines anti-terrorism effort through intelligence-sharing and financial aid. The mining companies that are causing farmers to be pushed off their land are internationally owned, including Australian interests. One way or another, Fox is likely to be back in Australia before Christmas. Her visa, before it was cancelled, was due for renewal in September. Even if she wins it back, it is hardly likely to be renewed. And what will she do once back in Australia? She has no idea. She would, she says, be much more outspoken about what she has seen than she can be while living in Manila. Otherwise, “I’d find some cause to get involved in, like refugees.” Manila, these days, is a frightening city for those who fall out of favour with the authorities. People are shot in the night as part of the so-called war on drugs. Is Fox frightened something might happen to her? She knows her family and fellow nuns are worried. “I think, though, that I am now too high profile for anything bad to happen. Me! I am the least interesting person I know. But there you go. Isn’t it strange?”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/the-unassuming-australian-nun-taking-on-rodrigo-duterte,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/16/the-unassuming-australian-nun-taking-on-rodrigo-duterte
2018-06-15T23:00:29Z,world,World news,Kim Jong-un: The story of the boy dictator who bested the US president,"Kim Jong-un was never destined to rule North Korea. It was never preordained he would be the one to accelerate the isolated nation’s nuclear weapons program, and force the US president, Donald Trump, to sit down for a meeting of equals.
But through a combination of ruthless ambition and luck, Kim achieved what no other leader of North Korea has, recognition as the head of a nuclear power and international statesman. The boy dictator went head-to-head with Trump and won. Kim Jong-nam, Kim Jong-un’s older half brother, was widely seen as next in line but fell out of favour in 2001 when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake passport so he could visit Tokyo Disneyland. Shortly after this incident, Kim began being groomed for senior leadership, attending the top officer training school in Pyongyang. When Kim came to power it was not so much his father’s shoes he slipped into as his grandfather’s.
Where Kim’s father was a recluse who shunned public attention, the young leader is outgoing, frequently photographed embracing ordinary citizens, a broad smile across his face. Where Kim Jong-il would pen a New Year’s editorial, Kim Jong-un delivers a speech broadcast on television. “He’s much more willing to take risks than previous leaders, and he has shown a new side of admitting fault. That’s a whole different attitude that we haven’t seen before,” says Jenny Town, the managing editor of monitoring group 38 North. “Ultimately, these high-level summits, with the US and China, after all the war talk and the suffering the people endured, shows that in the end world leaders are treating North Korea as an equal, and that plays well domestically.”
His sister, Kim Yo-jong, is a senior official in the Propaganda and Agitation Department and has reportedly worked to craft an image that evokes the revolutionary leader. In the beginning there was violence The early days of Kim’s rule were brutal. As he sought to consolidate power at the age of 27 in a society that reveres age, he purged those who he felt could be a threat. Kim’s uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who handled relations with China, North Korea’s closest ally, was publicly arrested in the middle of a Workers party meeting and executed. Kim would later be accused of ordering the assassination of his older brother in the Kuala Lumpur airport in February 2017. Public executions of military officers increased under Kim, according to North Koreans who escaped the country. He has also done nothing to dismantle the massive system of political prisons, which the United Nations says house as many as 120,000 people and is guilty of crimes against humanity. But he did break with his father in one crucial aspect. The elder Kim for years had pushed a military-first policy, or songun, where North Korea’s limited resources were foremost allocated to its costly nuclear weapons program. Kim Jong-un altered that formula and placed economic development on a par with weapons development.
A construction boom in Pyongyang followed and when Kim declared at the beginning of the year North Korea had completed its nuclear force, analysts say it was a signal the economy would now be Kim’s priority. His meeting with Trump was the apex of that risk-taking behaviour. He left North Korea at a predetermined time, raising the possibility of domestic instability in his absence, but the reward for the summit was too good to pass up. World tour beckons “The goal for Kim Jong-un now is to get economic support, in terms of financial flows, blunting sanctions, and attracting investment in the special economic zones,” said Scott Snyder, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. There are likely to be summits with more world leaders, including Russian president Vladimir Putin and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, to “further Kim’s standing as an international statesman”, Snyder added. Even if Kim agrees to dismantle rocket testing facilities, as Trump has claimed, it would probably only scratch the surface, according to Snyder. There are signs that Washington’s “maximum pressure” policy is already cracking under Kim’s diplomatic push. China, which accounts for over 90% of trade with the North, is reportedly relaxing its enforcement of sanctions and South Korean companies are eager to begin investing. All of this has validated Kim’s strategy of taking big gambles, since each one has so far paid off. Kim gained legitimacy in his meeting with Trump, while the US walked away with a vague commitment that North Korea has said before, only to reverse course later. The document Trump and Kim signed, in the midst of a great deal of theatrics, confirmed positions North Korea has been espousing for years.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/kim-jong-un-the-story-of-the-boy-dictator-who-bested-the-us-president,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/16/kim-jong-un-the-story-of-the-boy-dictator-who-bested-the-us-president
2018-06-15T19:57:36Z,world,World news,"Rising clarinet star's ex-girlfriend must pay $375,000 for trying to sabotage his career","By the age of 20 Eric Abramovitz had become a fixture in Canada’s classical music competitions, winning radio features and solo performances for a number of orchestras. So when the young clarinetist applied for a prestigious scholarship in Los Angeles to study under a renowned music instructor, he was surprised to receive a rejection letter. It wasn’t until two years later that he discovered the rejection – sent under the name of the famed instructor – had not come from the school, but instead from his girlfriend. Fearing he would leave Montreal for the new opportunity, she sabotaged his application, all while comforting him as he struggled to make sense of the rejection.
This week, an Ontario superior court judge ruled that Abramovitz’s former girlfriend, Jennifer Lee, should pay C$375,000 ($284,000) in compensation for “despicable interference” in a critically important career opportunity. “To find out it was the person who I had trusted the most and loved, was a simultaneous stab to the back and the heart,” Abramovitz told the Guardian. In his decision on Wednesday, the justice, David Corbett, admitted it was difficult to place a dollar amount on lost opportunity: “One hears, particularly in the arts, of the ‘big breaks’ that can launch a promising artist to a stratospheric career. I cannot speculate as to how high and how quickly Mr Abramovitz’s career might have soared, but for the interference by Ms Lee.” He reached his final amount after examining forfeited tuition costs, living expenses and depressed earning power. Lee did not defend the claim against her. In 2014, Abramovitz and Lee met at McGill’s Schulich School of Music in Montreal, where the two students formed a romantic relationship. Abramovitz soon moved in with Lee, and trusted her with the password to his email account, according to court documents. Abramovitz applied for a highly selective scholarship that would allow him to complete the final two years of his undergraduate degree in Los Angeles. Winning the scholarship would not only fund the $51,000 tuition and living expenses at the prestigious Colburn Conservatory of Music, but would also let him study under Yehuda Gilad, an instructor Corbett called “one of the best clarinet teachers in the world”. Each year, Gilad only accepts two students from around the world.
When the Colburn Conservatory of Music emailed to congratulate him on his acceptance to the program, Abramovitz never received the email. Without his knowledge, Lee intercepted the correspondence after monitoring incoming emails. Fearing that her boyfriend would leave Montreal, she sent a reply in his name – and declined the school’s offer. In order to maintain an illusion of credibility, Lee then created a fraudulent email account in Gilad’s name –giladyehuda09@gmail.com – and sent an email to Abramovitz, telling him that while he had not received a spot in the selective program, he had could still receive a much smaller scholarship of $5,000. Lee knew that Abramovitz would not be able to afford the hefty tuition costs fees nor the cost of living in California. “It was a very crushing feeling. I was so driven and really wanted it. I was very disappointed about it and feeling down after I got the rejection,” said Abramovitz. It wasn’t until months later, in a separate audition with Gilad, where both student and teacher each asked why the other had rejected them, that the ruse slowly became evident. In May 2016, nearly two years after the rejection, Abramovitz and his friend tried an old password of Lee’s on the email account, which Gilad confirmed didn’t belong to him. Upon successfully gaining access, they discovered the recovery email and phone number belonged to Lee.
The couple had parted ways in 2014, but when confronted with the evidence, she denied the allegations. In a sworn affidavit, Gilad said that Abramovitz had been “robbed of his opportunity to study with me” and called Lee’s actions “unthinkable” and “immoral”. Abramovitz eventually had the opportunity to study under Gilad at the University of Southern California’s Thornton School of Music, through a separate program that didn’t have funding from the school – nor the prestige of acceptance into the original program. In 2018, he joined the Nashville Symphony. “Obviously, it’s a regrettable situation,” said Abramovitz. “But I still think that preparing as seriously and working hard elevated my level and improved my game. So it still wasn’t all lost.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/clarinet-player-eric-abramovitz-girlfriend-fake-rejection-letter,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/clarinet-player-eric-abramovitz-girlfriend-fake-rejection-letter
2018-06-15T17:00:46Z,world,World news,Angela Merkel stands firm as Germany's refugee row intensifies,"Angela Merkel has stood firm against unilateral moves to turn refugees back from Germany’s borders amid a tense dispute on migration policy between the chancellor and her interior minister that could yet bring down the fledgling government. The standoff in Berlin echoed deepening divisions across Europe over how to handle irregular migration. The issue was also the focus of talks in Paris on Friday, at which the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, called for radical, Europe-wide changes to EU refugee policy. Horst Seehofer, Germany’s interior minister, remained poised to carry out a threat to introduce police controls on Germany’s southern border, according to reports on Friday, as leading members of his CSU party – junior partners of Merkel’s CDU in the coalition government – urged the chancellor to back down. The hardline interior minister is demanding the right to turn refugees away if they have already applied for asylum in another EU country or had their applications rejected in Germany, a proposal Merkel rejects as in breach of EU law and because she is determined to find a Europe-wide solution. Merkel, who is in her fourth term as chancellor, has rarely found herself in such a precarious position. If Seehofer goes ahead and implements the most contested part of his immigration “masterplan”, she will have little choice but to sack him. But that would lead to the collapse of her government, which has been in power for less than 100 days, and almost inevitably to the end of her chancellorship. An interior ministry source told German media that “all that’s needed is a phone call” for Seehofer to implement his plan.
Merkel continues to insist national border controls will only speed up the end of the passport-free Schengen system. Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Friday she was firmly opposed to unilateral moves to turn back refugees that could increase pressures on countries such as Italy and Greece. “We must not contribute to weakening the European Union and purely national measures setting the tone again in Europe,” Seibert said. “Then Europe wouldn’t play the strong role in the world that’s required now.” In Paris, Macron and Conte sought to patch up a Franco-Italian diplomatic spat sparked this week by the French president accusing Rome of “cynicism and irresponsibility” after anti-immigration minister Matteo Salvini refused the Aquarius migrant rescue ship access to Italian ports, forcing it to head to Spain. The two leaders called for the EU to set up centres to process migrants’ asylum claims in their home countries, mainly in Africa. “We should create European centres in the countries of departure,” Conte said at a joint press conference. Macron told reporters he supported the idea of “branches of our asylum agencies to tackle this question on the other side” of the Mediterranean, adding that greater solidarity with Italy was needed over the migrant burden it is shouldering. The French president also called for tougher protection of Europe’s external borders insisting “the proper response is European” but needed adapting, including “profound reforms” of the EU’s Dublin regulation which requires migrants to claim asylum in the first European country they enter. Macron openly backed Merkel in her standoff with Seehofer, saying countries should be “committed to the paths taken by their heads of state or government”. The EU 27 are due to discuss changes to the bloc’s asylum rules at a summit at the end of June, but there are few signs they are ready to coordinate their policies. Merkel has the backing of her CDU party to wait until the summit. She reportedly said she felt “strengthened” by the party support, and was not expecting her government to collapse. But with other EU members at loggerheads on the issue, and Merkel having herself admitted it is highly unlikely a European deal can be reached so quickly, the decision to wait until 28 June might do little other than buy her a stay of execution. The CSU has said it is not prepared to wait for two weeks. Markus Söder, the minister president of Bavaria and a leading member of the party, said: “Why will we achieve something in two weeks that was not possible in three years?” The reference was to the refugee crisis in the summer of 2015, when Merkel’s open-border policy allowed almost a million refugees to enter Germany – a decision widely blamed for helping the rightwing, populist and anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) into the Bundestag in elections last year. The CSU’s party executive is due to meet on Monday to hammer out its position on the issue, while the CDU’s leadership is to assemble on the same day, meaning a renewed showdown between the two partners – who until the refugee crisis had cooperated in relative harmony for decades – is to be expected. The stubborn stance of the Bavaria-based CSU has been put down to its upcoming state elections, where it faces a drubbing by the AfD to which it has already lost millions of voters. Söder insisted the CSU was not staging a putsch to topple Merkel. “It’s about restoring trust in the German state of law which has been shattered,” he said. Germany’s finance minister, Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats, also partners in the coalition, accused the CDU and CSU of acting as though they were in a fantasy thriller. “The task of governing our country is not an episode of Game of Thrones, rather a serious matter,” he tweeted on Friday.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/angela-merkel-precarious-as-germany-refugee-row-intensifies,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/angela-merkel-precarious-as-germany-refugee-row-intensifies
2018-06-15T16:08:20Z,world,World news,UN rejects plan to demand immediate ceasefire in Yemen port,"Yemeni pro-government forces have closed in on a rebel-held airport as they pressed ahead with a sweeping offensive on the key Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, despite warnings from aid agencies that the attack could jeopardise vital aid supplies to a country on the brink of famine. The swift advance was an important early success for the Saudi-led coalition, which launched the operation in Hodeidah three days ago and says it can seize the city quickly enough to avoid interrupting flows of aid to millions facing starvation. Coalition warplanes bombed Houthi rebel positions on Friday, while rebels said in an official statement that they fired a ballistic missile on fighters’ gathering, but gave no report of causalities. The advance came after the UN security council rejected a move to demand an immediate end to the fighting around the strategic port. The 15-strong body failed to agree to a statement calling on forces led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to implement a ceasefire, with the US and UK both voicing opposition to the text introduced by Sweden.The council instead called for restraint and “urged all sides to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law” in fighting for the city currently held by rebel Houthi forces. The International Committee of the Red Cross warned on Friday that “more and more fighters” were arriving in Hodeidah, a city with a population of around 600,000 people. It described the streets of the city as “nearly empty” and that those living in Hodeidah were stocking up on fuel and food, fearing a possible long siege. The battle has killed at least 139 fighters since it began on Wednesday, medical and military sources told Agence France-Presse. Salim al-Shamiri, an employee of the Norwegian Refugee Council, escaped the city for the capital, Sana’a, by road with his family at the beginning of the assault but remains in touch with relatives still trapped in Hodeidah. “I spoke to friends there an hour ago. They said that they could hear jets flying over the city today and the sound of airstrikes outside. “My family told me that today people are being really cautious with no movement in the streets despite the fact that they should be out for Eid.”
David Miliband, the chief executive of the International Rescue Committee, challenged claims Hodeidah’s port and humanitarian aid could be protected during an attack, saying there was “a great danger of besiegement and long-term urban warfare”. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the Saudi-led coalition, backing Yemen’s exiled government against the Houthi rebels, had repeatedly failed to make the progress it had predicted since it entered the war in 2015. “The immiseration of the Yemeni people is quite extraordinary: 22 million in need of humanitarian aid; 8 million at risk of starvation; 50,000 died last year from cholera or cholera-related diseases,” he said. The impasse at the UN keeps open the option of a direct attack on the port for the Saudi-led coalition, but it is aware this could lead to a massive backlash from western governments and aid agencies.
Lana Nusseibeh, the UAE ambassador to the UN, insisted the military offensive was “a deliberate, carefully prepared and executed operation”. Saudi Arabia’s UN ambassador, Abdallah al-Mouallimi, added: “Our desire in Hodeidah is not to infuriate the Houthis or to kill as many of them as we possibly can. To the contrary, we have allowed them safe passage to the north of the city if they want to drop their arms and leave.” He challenged reports calling Hodeida “a lifeline to Yemen for humanitarian aid”, arguing there were nine ports in Yemen and two in Saudi Arabia that could be used to reach those in need. The security council’s refusal to call for a ceasefire suggests the UK, US and France have accepted the Saudi and UAE claim that jeopardising aid flows is a justifiable risk if Houthi forces can be ousted from the city.
It will fuel claims, led by the former Conservative international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, that Britain is not acting as an honest broker on Yemen at the UN, but siding with Saudi Arabia because of the UK’s strong commercial links with the Gulf states. The UK ambassador to the UN, Karen Pierce, denied this. Critics of the Saudi-UAE assault say it has been timed to scupper the initiative of the UN special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, who was due to publish his peace plan on Monday and had been trying to negotiate a Houthi withdrawal from the port in return for the UN taking charge.
The UAE argues privately that capturing Hodeidah will deprive Houthis of $30m-$40m (£22.5m-£30m) in revenue and force them to negotiate. It also claims the port has been used to smuggle weapons from Iran, including missile parts used to fire into Saudi Arabia. The UAE said the US had rejected its request for intelligence, minesweeping and airborne reconnaissance assets for the Hodeidah attack, but France had agreed to provide minesweeping support.
The French government stressed such operations would only be carried out after the port had been freed. Stressing the threat to food supplies, Lise Grande, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, said: “Dozens of UN staff are in the city helping to deliver food, water and health services. We estimate that 600,000 civilians are in the city – many of whom are dependent on assistance to survive.” Adama Dieng, the UN special adviser on the prevention of genocide, said: “Starvation of civilians as a method of war is a war crime and was condemned by the security council in resolution 2417 of 24 May 2018. “It seems that the first test of this resolution is Yemen: Hodeidah is a lifeline for the delivery of aid and the coalition’s airstrikes can kill many more people over time through famine and hunger when damaging such civilian infrastructure.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/un-rejects-plan-to-demand-immediate-ceasefire-saudi-uae-coalition-in-yemen-port,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/un-rejects-plan-to-demand-immediate-ceasefire-saudi-uae-coalition-in-yemen-port
2018-06-15T15:59:07Z,world,World news,UK visa of Russian oligarch who met Arron Banks under review,"The oligarch who met Arron Banks to discuss a lucrative gold deal is one of 700 wealthy Russians whose “tier one” visas are being reviewed after the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Siman Povarenkin is entitled to residency in the UK, and eventual citizenship, through his wife Irina’s visa. She moved to Britain in 2013 with their two children after investing at least £2m. Povarenkin travels regularly from Moscow to visit his family. In November 2015 Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, introduced Povarenkin to Banks, the Brexit campaigner and Leave.EU donor.
Banks had insisted his contacts with Yakovenko amounted to one “boozy six-hour lunch”. In fact, Banks had three meetings with the ambassador, two in the run up to the EU referendum. Yakovenko suggested Banks might be interested in investing in Povarenkin’s mining business. The deal could potentially have netted him billions of dollars, according to documents. Banks denied wrongdoing on Tuesday in a bad-tempered session with the culture, media and sport select committee. He said the deal did not happen. “I met with him [Povarenkin], I’m a businessman, why shouldn’t I?” Banks said, adding that he had “no business” in Russia. On 17 July 2016 Banks tweeted: “I am buying gold at the moment & big mining stocks.” Povarenkin is a successful entrepreneur with top-level Kremlin contacts. According to people familiar with his business affairs, the state entity involved in the potential deal was Sberbank, Russia’s biggest bank. Sberbank’s CEO is Herman Gref, an influential former economics minister. In 2013 Gref had dinner with Donald Trump during the Miss Universe beauty pageant in Moscow, which Sberbank co-sponsored. Trump “had a good attitude towards Russia”, Gref said afterwards. In 2014 the US imposed sanctions on Sberbank over Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The documents suggest further meetings and discussions took place between Povarenkin and Banks, after the initial introduction, including a trip by Banks to Moscow in February 2016, the Observer reported. Banks told CNN reports of the trip were not true.
On 5 July 2016, less than two weeks after the referendum, Sberbank announced it was upping its stake in Povarenkin’s company GeoProMining, from 25.75% to 31.5%. Povarenkin became rich while still in his 20s, contemporaries say. One described him as a diminutive figure with long, dark curly hair. He speaks English well and with a strong Russian accent, they said. “He was a young and wealthy guy. It wasn’t very clear what the source of his wealth was. There were literally hundreds of such people in Russia during this period,” said one Moscow businessman who met him socially. Povarenkin was born in the Siberian city of Omsk. He later worked for the Moscow private equity company Industrial Investors Group. Its boss, Sergei Generalov, was a deputy in the state parliament and energy minister under Boris Yeltsin. Generalov is in turn close to Sergei Kiriyenko, Vladimir Putin’s chief of staff. Povarenkin’s home is a six-bedroom mansion in Gribovo, a village set amid pine forests seven miles (12km) west of central Moscow. The area is favoured by Russia’s political and business elite. One of his neighbours is Vladislav Surkov, a personal adviser to Putin. One person familiar with the Moscow business world said of Povarenkin: “He’s a typical ‘minigarch’ guy who managed to cobble together a bunch of assets, deploying the typical Russian means of doing it.” The person said Povarenkin had good krysha, from the Russian word for roof, meaning a powerful patron deep inside Russia’s ruling structures. “Who his krysha really is I don’t know,” the person said. Between 2005 and 2008 Povarenkin set up GeoProMining, buying gold mining enterprises in Armenia, Russia and Georgia. The purchase would have involved substantial borrowing. Like other businessmen, including Banks, Povarenkin makes extensive use of offshore vehicles. In 2013 Irina Povarenkin and the couple’s two children moved to London, according to legal documents. She was able to do so after buying a tier one investors’ visa, available to well-off foreigners who invest at least £2m in government bonds. Povarenkin is classed as his wife’s dependent. The Home Office is currently reviewing the status of about 700 Russians, including the Chelsea FC owner, Roman Abramovich, who made use of the scheme before rules were tightened in 2015. The review follows the poisoning in March of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence officer, and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury. In 2015 the Povarenkins purchased an £11.3m flat in Ebury Square in Belgravia, west London, documents show. Typically the gold tycoon spends about 70 days a year in the UK, flying in regularly from Moscow to see his family. Summers are spent at a luxury chateau in Normandy that was owned by the late Yves Saint Laurent. In February 2017 the oligarch flew to London to celebrate his wife and son’s birthdays. At Heathrow airport he was served with a writ from a disgruntled former business partner, Ruslan Bestolov. Bestolov alleges that Povarenkin owes him $7.5m (£5.6m), arising from two joint mine projects in the Russian republic of Yakutia. Povarenkin denies this. In 2017 the case went to the high court, when Bestolov successfully argued that the dispute should be heard in London and not Moscow. A judge ruled that Povarenkin had a “substantial connection” to the UK, in contrast to other Russian oligarchs such as Oleg Deripaska whose visits are more fleeting. It is unclear why Yakovenko introduced Povarenkin as a potential business partner for Banks, who gave £12m to the Brexit campaign, becoming the biggest political donor in UK history. The ambassador and the oligarch appear to have a good working relationship. In 2011 the pair visited the London Stock Exchange, together with a delegation from Yakutia. A Moscow financial source described Povarenkin’s international assets as “complicated”. Asked why he might have been interested in investment from Banks, they said: “Personal, state and business interests can all be combined in Russia.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/uk-visa-of-russian-oligarch-who-met-arron-banks-under-review,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/uk-visa-of-russian-oligarch-who-met-arron-banks-under-review
2018-06-15T15:19:02Z,world,World news,Tory MP Christopher Chope blocks progress of upskirting bill,"A bill to make upskirting a specific criminal offence punishable by up to two years in prison has been blocked in the House of Commons after a single Conservative MP objected to it. The voyeurism (offences) bill on upskirting – the taking of surreptitious, sexually intrusive images – was put forward by the Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse after a campaign by Gina Martin. Police have declined to prosecute a man Martin accused of taking underskirt pictures of her on his phone at a music festival in London last summer. As a private member’s bill it would normally have little chance of becoming law. But early on Friday the justice minister Lucy Frazer said the government would back it. However, when the deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle read out the name of the bill later that day, the Tory MP Christopher Chope shouted: “Object”. Without sufficient time in the session for a proper vote it was sent back for another try on 6 July. The MP for Christchurch also used the Commons session to delay another government-backed bill, which would make it an offence to attack police dogs or horses, or prison officer dogs. Both were among a series of private member’s bills being given their second reading in the Commons on Friday. If no MP disagrees they are passed without a vote and can be given a date for their third reading. Last year Chope proposed 47 private member’s’ bills of his own.
Theresa May expressed her “disappointment” that the upskirting bill had been delayed and pledged the government would get it through parliament. The prime minister said: “Upskirting is an invasion of privacy which leaves victims feeling degraded and distressed ... I want to see these measures pass through parliament – with government support – soon.” Other MPs were more vocal in condemning Chope, including some of his fellow Tories. Hobhouse said she was furious at Chope’s objection, which prompted calls of “shame”, including from the Tory frontbenches. “I don’t think he actually has any substantive problems with the bill,” she told the Guardian. “He hardly knows what upskirting is, I think. It’s just he doesn’t like private member’s bills and certainly doesn’t like them when they come from other parties. “It was meant to be a good news story. We were all lining up to say, this is a modern crime and the government is keeping up with crime created by modern technology, which particularly affects young women and children. It is very, very annoying and frustrating that objections to procedure take precedence for him over the right thing to do.”
Hobhouse said she had learned Chope planned to protest shortly beforehand: “I tried to talk to him as he was sitting in the chamber, but his body language was very negative and he didn’t want to talk to me.” Her anger was shared by Tory MPs, including Simon Clarke, who tweeted: “Chris Chope has embarrassed himself with his actions in parliament today, and does not speak for me or Conservatives on the disgusting issue of upskirting.” Fellow Conservative Paul Masterton said: “Do not underestimate just how furious many Tory MPs are about this. This kind of thing does far more damage to the public’s view of our party than endless debates about customs arrangements.” Martin told Sky News” “It’s shameful, it’s annoying. It’s not the end of the road but I’m very angry,.” After the bill was blocked, she said she remained positive. “We knew this was a risk, but I now stand with powerful, passionate women and men behind me, and I am confident that Lucy Frazer is committed to, and will, close this gap in the law,” Martin said. She said both she and her lawyer, Ryan Whelan, had spoken to Chope and he had agreed to meet them to discuss the bill. “I’m positive and hopeful that he will become a supporter.” Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, said he was disgusted by Chope’s move and called on the government to formally adopt the bill. Dawn Butler, the shadow equalities minister, said May had to “show leadership, and show there’s no place in the Tory party for Christopher Chope”. The fate is even less clear for the animal welfare (service animals) bill. Backed by Michael Gove, the environment secretary, it amends the 2006 Animal Welfare Act to make it a specific offence to cause unnecessary suffering to an animal “under the control of a relevant officer”, such as a police or prison officer. The bill also removes the provision for someone to claim they were acting in self defence if they harmed a service animal. It was introduced by Sir Oliver Heald, the Tory MP for North East Hertfordshire, after a police dog called Finn was stabbed by a robbery suspect in 2016. Heald tweeted his disappointment at Chope’s decision and added he had met his fellow MP to try to get his support.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/tory-mp-christopher-chope-blocks-progress-of-upskirting-bill,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/tory-mp-christopher-chope-blocks-progress-of-upskirting-bill
2018-06-15T14:58:36Z,world,World news,Body of British botanist found in South Africa,"Police in South Africa have identified the body of a British botanist who disappeared earlier this year while searching for rare seeds in a remote nature reserve. Rachel and Rodney Saunders are thought to have been looking for rare plant seeds near the oNgoye Forest in KwaZulu-Natal province when they were last confirmed alive in mid-February. Four suspects were arrested within days following a manhunt across the province. Three remain in custody, facing charges of murder, assault and abduction. The badly decomposed body of Rodney Saunders, 74, was found a week after the alleged killing by fishermen in the Tugela river and took several weeks to be identified. Police have given no details of where the remains of his 63-year-old wife were found. “A multi-pronged investigation … led to the positive identification of the mortal remains of Rachel Saunders,” Capt Lloyd Ramovha of the elite Hawks investigative unit said in a statement. Local media have reported that the couple, dual British-South African nationals who ran a business in Cape Town trading rare seeds, had been filmed by a team from BBC Gardeners’ World shortly before they disappeared. Police believe they were kidnapped and murdered by Islamic extremists who talked of killing non-believers around the time of the attack. The case prompted the UK’s Foreign Office to warn that terrorists were likely to try to carry out attacks in South Africa. Africa’s most industrialised country has never suffered a major terrorist incident involving Islamic extremists and no attack followed a similar warning by Britain and the US in June 2016. The new advice was described as alarmist by some local experts. But police evidence during bail hearings suggests the Saunders’ alleged killers were at least in part motivated by radical ideologies. Sayfydeen Del Vecchio, 38, and Fatima Patel, 27, were detained in a raid on a house near Mtunzini, a small coastal town 30km (18 miles) from the oNgoye forest on 16 February. They face charges of kidnapping, murder and robbery. A third man was found in possession of the couple’s mobile phones. He was sentenced to a suspended three-year sentence after coming to an agreement with prosecutors. The case has led to criticism of South Africa’s security services. Del Vecchio, who converted to Islam 15 years ago, was already on a watchlist after being seen on a quad bike watching planes landing and taking off at the King Shaka Zulu airport outside the city of Durban more than two years before the alleged murder. Patel, who is the daughter of a Muslim cleric, was also on a watchlist after being arrested in July 2016 during an anti-terrorism raid conducted Johannesburg. She was later released on bail. Two brothers detained at the same time remain in custody, accused of planning attacks on Jewish, British and US interests in South Africa following contact with an Islamic State extremist. Police found a drone, camping gear, generators and paintball equipment, all bought with Saunders’ bank card in a series of shopping trips, at the home Patel shared with Del Vecchio, along with a GPS device belonging to the couple. Police also allege the couple once flew an Islamic State flag at their home. Lawyers for the accused say police have exaggerated the links to the Islamic State. A police statement to the court claims Del Vecchio had used Telegram, the encrypted messaging service, to advise an unidentified individual on bomb-making techniques. Security officials and experts say there are no known Islamist militant groups actively targeting South Africa, where Muslims make up less than 2% of the population.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/british-botanist-rachel-saunders-body-south-africa,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/british-botanist-rachel-saunders-body-south-africa
2018-06-15T14:41:36Z,world,World news,Timeline: Oxfam sexual exploitation scandal in Haiti,"A leaked document shows Oxfam must make £16m worth of cuts to jobs and relief programmes as it tries to recover from the fallout over a sexual exploitation scandal involving staff in Haiti. This is how the scandal unfolded. 9 February Oxfam is accused of covering up an investigation into the hiring of sex workers for orgies by staff working in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, which killed thousands. After the investigation the charity allowed three men, including the country director, Roland van Hauwermeiren, to resign, and sacked four for gross misconduct, according to an internal 2011 report seen by the Times. 11 February Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, threatens to cut government funding to Oxfam unless the charity hands over all information on its workers’ use of sex workers in Haiti. Meanwhile, Oxfam is hit with allegations that employees used sex workers in Chad in 2006, when Van Hauwermeiren was running operations there. 12 February The Charity Commission launches a statutory inquiry into Oxfam amid concerns it might not have “fully and frankly disclosed” all details about the Haiti allegations. The charity’s deputy chief executive, Penny Lawrence, resigns, saying she is “desperately sorry”, as Haiti demands the prosecutions of aid workers identified as using sex workers. 13 February The actor Minnie Driver, who was one of 16 celebrity patrons for Oxfam, says she is withdrawing her support “in no uncertain terms” after working with the charity for more than 20 years. At the same time, claims emerge that Van Hauwermeiren had been forced out of another British charity seven years earlier after an investigation into the use of sex workers. 15 February Archbishop Desmond Tutu resigns as an ambassador for Oxfam saying he is “deeply disappointed” by the allegations of “immorality and possible criminality”. 16 February Mark Goldring, the chief executive of Oxfam GB, claims attacks are “out of proportion to the level of culpability”, and accuses critics of an anti-aid agenda. In contrast, the head of Oxfam International, Winnie Byanyima, warns that what happened in Haiti “is a stain on Oxfam that will shame us for years”. 19 February Oxfam fulfils a promise to publish its 2011 inquiry into the Haiti sex abuse, which reveals that three staff who were under investigation physically threatened a colleague to ensure that person’s silence. The charity offers its “humblest apologies” to the Haitian government. 20 February Goldring tells MPs on the international development select committee that the charity has lost 7,000 regular donors since the scandal emerged. 22 February Haiti announces it is temporarily suspending Oxfam GB’s right to work in the country pending an investigation into how the charity handled the sexual exploitation case. The suspension is intended to last for two months. 17 March Oxfam is accused of further failures in Haiti by keeping a senior aid worker there for more than a year despite reported sexual harassment claims. According to an internal report seen by the Times, the charity attempted to “contain” allegations against Raphael Mutiku, an engineer who led Oxfam’s installation of water supplies after the earthquake. Oxfam confirms the decision not to dismiss Mutiku was made by Van Hauwermeiren. 16 May Goldring announces he is to stand down as chief executive at the end of the year, citing the scandal and the need for “fresh vision and energy” at the charity. “We are now laying strong foundations for recovery,” he says. 14 June Haiti announces it is withdrawing Oxfam GB’s right to operate in the country “for violation of Haitian law and serious violation of the principle of the dignity of the human beings”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/timeline-oxfam-sexual-exploitation-scandal-in-haiti,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/timeline-oxfam-sexual-exploitation-scandal-in-haiti
2018-06-15T14:19:49Z,world,World news,Puzzler says he has cracked code to stolen Belgian masterpiece,"It has been described as one of the most enduring mysteries in the history of art. Since a daring heist in 1934, the whereabouts of one of the 12 panels of Hubert and Jan van Eyck’s Adoration of the Lamb, arguably the world’s first great oil painting, has baffled police detectives, bemused amateur sleuths and even driven to despair Nazi agents ordered by Joseph Goebbels to find it as a gift for Adolf Hitler. On Friday, however, the authors of a new book told a packed press conference at Ghent’s city hall that they believed they had discovered the location of the missing piece – just below one of the Flemish city’s pretty cobbled squares.
Ghent’s public prosecutor is taking the theory seriously enough to urge residents not to go it alone and pick up their shovels. The precise location on the Kalandeberg is not being revealed to avoid unwelcome interest from treasure hunters. The lower left of the altarpiece’s 12 panels, depicting the “just judges”, was taken from Ghent’s St Bavo’s Cathedral on the night of 10 April 1934. Ghent’s mayor, Daniël Termont, standing alongside the two authors, Marc de Bel and Gino Marchal, said he was preparing to take the next steps under the guidance of detectives still working on the case. “The public prosecutor’s office takes this theory very seriously,” he said. “The investigation into the theft has never been completed. Two people are still in charge of the investigation with the judicial police. “If this new theory was no more than a stunt to promote a book, I would never have cooperated, and as a city we would not have made our council hall available for a press conference.” Termont added: “Do not undertake anything yourself. It may sound ridiculous, but please do not dig any holes on the Kalandeberg. That is work for the police and the public prosecutor’s office.” The Adoration of the Lamb, depicting the story of Jesus Christ, was completed in 1432, and coveted by everyone from Napoleon to Hitler. The Nazis took the remaining panels from Belgium in 1942 to a salt mine under the Austrian Alps, from where they were returned after the war. The investigation into the stolen panel was not always treated seriously by the authorities. The Ghent police commissioner, Antoine Luysterborghs, visited the cathedral on the morning after the crime only to have to shift his attention to a theft at a nearby cheese shop. Others were, however, more cognisant of the scale of the crime. The theft was followed by a ransom demand for 1m Belgian francs. A negotiation via letters commenced between the Belgian government and the mystery ransomer, who returned one of the missing panel’s two parts, depicting St John the Baptist, as a sign of good faith, before going silent. More light was shed on the matter a few months later when a stockbroker called Arsène Goedertier had a heart attack and made a deathbed confession to his lawyer. Goedertier was said to have whispered: “I alone know where the Mystic Lamb is. The information is in the drawer on the right of my writing table, in an envelope marked ‘mutualité’.” The lawyer found carbon copies of the 13 ransom notes, plus a final, unsent note with a clue: “[It] rests in a place where neither I, nor anybody else, can take it away without arousing the attention of the public.” Countless theories have emerged over the decades as to where the panel could have gone. St Bavo’s has been searched six times since the second world war and the whole cathedral was even at one stage X-rayed to a depth of 10 metres. Marchal believes he has found the key to the mystery in five words and one number in the final unsent letter. Their book is called The Fourteenth Letter. “In the fourteenth letter there were six words which were very strange,” he said. “But I worked out that four of the words identified places in Ghent, although old names for them. The fifth word was the number 152. If you go 152 metres from the four locations, there is one point where the routes will meet. And this location was very close to a cafe that Goedertier went to all the time.” The final piece in the jigsaw, Marchal told the Guardian, was when he realised that if you drew the routes on a map from the four locations to the potential hiding place, the letters for the name “Nina” emerged. Nina was the sixth and final of the mystery words on the page. Marchal, an industrial engineer and amateur puzzler, said: “I went to the police in September, but I only made the final connection in January. I can’t say where the location is. But I think, I hope, we will find the panel.” De Bel is a well-known author in Belgium and the book is a fiction, designed for young adults, with Marchal’s theory intertwined. It suggests that under the square are tunnels 80cm wide and 155cm high that could be a perfect place to hide a 55cm-wide and 149cm-high panel. “Young people don’t know this story, they don’t know the Eycks, so I have included Gino’s discovery of the theory in a romanticised story,” De Bel said. “But it is one of the great art robberies of all time. We are waiting for a call from Steven Spielberg now. “I am 95% certain the theory is right and we will find it. It was put there 85 years ago, and so you never know. But Gino is 100% sure.” Marchal said: “Until we find it, it is just a theory, but it is based entirely on facts.” A spokesman for Ghent’s public prosecutor’s office said detectives were taking the theory seriously and were looking at the practicality of digging under the square.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/puzzler-says-he-has-cracked-code-to-stolen-belgian-masterpiece,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/puzzler-says-he-has-cracked-code-to-stolen-belgian-masterpiece
2018-06-15T13:49:49Z,world,World news,"US drone strike kills Pakistan Taliban leader, say officials","A US drone strike in north-east Afghanistan has killed the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Mullah Fazlullah, according to Pakistani and Afghan officials. A spokesperson for Afghanistan’s ministry of defence said two other Taliban militants were also killed in the strike in Kunar province. Fazlullah led the insurgency in Pakistan’s Swat valley between 2007-09 and ordered some of the most shocking attacks in the country’s history, including an assault on a school that killed 132 children and the shooting of the young activist Malala Yousafzai. “I confirm that Mullah Fazlullah, leader of the Pakistani Taliban, has been killed in an joint air operation [with the US] in the border area of Marawera district of Kunar province,” Mohammad Radmanish told Reuters. A spokesman for US forces in Afghanistan said a strike had been launched against a “senior leader of a designated terrorist organisation” but did not name Fazlullah or announce the death. The US had offered $5m (£3.8m) in March for information about his whereabouts. If confirmed, the death of Fazlullah represents a major blow to Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and is likely improve relations between Islamabad and Washington as the US seeks Pakistan’s cooperation in turning a ceasefire in Afghanistan into a longer-lasting peace. Reports of the death of Fazlullah, who took over as leader of the TTP in 2013, were welcomed in Pakistan, where he is reviled for ordering the 2014 Peshawar school massacre. He also oversaw the failed bombing of Times Square in New York in 2016. Fazlullah rose to fame as “FM Mullah”, broadcasting vituperative calls for jihad from his radio station. His followers introduced a brutal form of sharia law during the two-year TTP insurgency in the Swat valley, killing dancers and DVD-shop owners. Muhammad Amir Rana, from the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, said the TTP would struggle to remain a cohesive group after the death of its leader. “It’s a very big loss,” Rana said. “We do not see anyone else who can continue uniting the organisation.” Earlier in the year, Fazlullah’s son was among 20 TTP militants killed in another US drone strike in Kunar. The latest strike may also lessen Pakistan’s suspicions of the US, according to a former EU special representative for Afghanistan. “When one comes down on the list of high profile Pakistan terrorists the US has taken care of it’s pretty impressive,” said Michael Semple. “There have got to be lot of conversations [in Pakistan] around maybe – how do we fit this in with notion they are playing against us?” The strike should also build trust between the US, Afghanistan and Pakistan at a crucial moment in peace negotiations with the Afghan Taliban, he said. On Friday, the Afghan Taliban began its first ceasefire in 17 years to coincide with Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan. The move follows the Afghan government own ceasefire, which started last week.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/us-led-drone-strike-kills-pakistan-taliban-leader-mullah-fazlullah,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/us-led-drone-strike-kills-pakistan-taliban-leader-mullah-fazlullah
2018-06-15T13:39:16Z,world,World news,Delhi's air pollution is now so bad it is literally off the chart,"Smog more toxic than can be measured by monitoring devices has blanketed the Indian capital this week, months before the start of Delhi’s traditional “pollution season”. A thick haze was visible across the city from Tuesday and some government pollution monitors have recorded concentrations of 999 – the highest they can measure – as dust storms kicked up in nearby Rajasthan state blanketed the region. Though the billowing clouds of dust and sand were blamed for the immediate spike in pollution levels, the sight of dense smog engulfing Delhi months before winter has underscored a growing awareness that harmful air is a year-round problem for the city.
Air quality in Delhi usually begins to plummet in October when slower winds and cooler temperatures trap pollutants closer to the ground. But data published by the government’s Central Pollution Control Board shows that air quality has been classed “very unhealthy” – with index scores as high as 270 – every April and May for the past three years, or since authorities began collecting and publishing the statistics. Just a single day in April or May of the past three years had air classified as “good” – 12 April this year, when levels fell to 99. “It clearly shows that this is also a summertime problem,” said Aishwarya Sudhir, an independent researcher who studies air quality in India. Authorities have ordered a halt to all construction in the capital and its satellite cities until the weekend to reduce pollution levels, and doctors have advised people to stay indoors as much as possible. Meteorologists said the presence of a layer of dust across the city is also trapping heat, sending temperatures soaring in excess of 40C. Concern about north India’s air quality crisis is usually most acute after the Hindu festival of Diwali in autumn, when hundreds of thousands of Indians release firecrackers that combine with existing pollutants to form a poisonous haze over the region that persists for months until temperatures cool. Public health experts said pollution levels on some days in November last year were the equivalent of smoking 50 cigarettes per day. India, home to 14 of the world’s top 20 most polluted cities, has the highest rate of respiratory diseases of any country. A leading lung specialist, Arvind Kumar, says the cancer patients he sees Delhi are younger, more often female and more likely to be non smokers than those outside the city. Children are the most vulnerable: a 2015 study concluded about half Delhi’s 4.4m schoolchildren had stunted lung development and would never completely recover.
But pressure on local and central governments to act usually clears along with the air in February when warmer temperatures help to thin the smog. Sudhir said this week’s spike in pollution was a wake-up call that Delhi’s air is rarely safe. “Polluting activities keep going on in the city during summer, including construction, allowing road dust to linger, the operation of coal-fired power plants and other things,” she said. Under an action plan in place since January 2017, pollution levels of the kind recorded this week should have resulted in trucks being denied entry into the city, the closure of brick kilns and other polluting industries, and a ban on using diesel generators. Yet the government seems only to implement some of these measures, and only in response to public outcry, she said. “We tend to act only when it’s an emergency,” she said. “There were forecasts that dust storms would sweep the entire region. They should have acted on these weeks ago, not when it became this severe.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/delhi-blanketed-by-smog-so-toxic-it-cant-be-measured,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/delhi-blanketed-by-smog-so-toxic-it-cant-be-measured
2018-06-15T12:02:22Z,world,World news,Oxfam to axe jobs and aid programmes in £16m cuts after scandal,"Oxfam has warned staff it needs to urgently find £16m of savings and radically reduce the number of its poverty-relieving programmes as the charity copes with the ongoing fallout from the Haiti sex scandal, the Guardian can reveal. An internal document circulated last week by the chief executive of Oxfam GB, Mark Goldring, says the charity will “have to save substantial amounts of money to put [us] on a more stable and sustainable footing”. The seven-page document, which is marked confidential, states: “It is clear ... that the size of our programmes will be substantially reduced for this year and next ... this means making tough choices.” It says job losses are “inevitable”. Selling off high-street shops and reducing the number of countries in which Oxfam operates are both proposals under consideration. Oxfam GB has been struggling to win back the confidence of the public, the UK government and its donors following allegations that members of its staff used sex workers during a relief mission after an earthquake hit Haiti in 2010. The charity stands accused of having failed to disclose details of the alleged sexual misconduct by its staff to the Charity Commission, which has launched an inquiry. The internal document, which has been seen by the Guardian, sets out the charity’s early thinking about how to tackle the reduction in funding in the UK, but explains decisions will have to be taken quickly “to avoid further erosion of financial and organisational health”.
In a statement, Oxfam confirmed the £16m figure and said the “appalling behaviour of some former staff in Haiti ... means we now have less money to provide clean water, food and other support to people who need it”. This week, Haiti banned Oxfam from operating in the country, citing the charity’s “violation of its laws and serious breach of the principle of human dignity”. The revelations also led to a temporary ban on funding from the Department of International Development (DfID). Oxfam GB is at the heart of the charity’s work, employing about 2,000 staff in the UK to support its international campaigns against poverty. In its last annual report, the charity said it had raised more than £400m from donors and helped 11.6 million people across the world. Almost half of the money it raised was from governments and institutions for specific projects, with the funding being “restricted” to those causes. The charity needs to make substantial savings because of a £16m shortfall in its “unrestricted” budget – money raised from its shops and individuals to be spent on whatever it sees fit. The document says £16m represents “around 10% of our relevant income”. With the charity still reeling from the Haiti scandal, the document says one of the charity’s guiding principles over the next two years is to “protect and reinforce women’s rights, gender justice and culture change”.
But with less money coming in, and with programmes greatly reduced, it says, “we need to be running a smaller infrastructure ... sadly the loss of some roles is inevitable as we cannot otherwise make savings of this scale”. It adds: “We will seek to maintain our overall level of support for country programmes but narrow the range of support we offer within our themes of water, women, work and equality. In addition, from 2019 we will begin to reduce the number of countries in which we invest as a partner affiliate.” The charity has also pledged to “sell freehold property to quickly raise substantial funds. This will be done mainly on a sale and lease back basis to preserve our ability to trade from these locations.” The document acknowledges that Oxfam has to win back confidence. “We know we need to better inspire and engage the UK public,” it says. Oxfam had to stop bidding for some institutional donorsafter the Haiti scandal. Some big donors, such as the EU and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) have said they will begin accepting bids from Oxfam again, but the DfID ban has yet to be lifted. An Oxfam spokesperson said: “We are devastated that the appalling behaviour of some former staff in Haiti, and shortcomings in how we dealt with that eight years ago, means we now have less money to provide clean water, food and other support to people who need it. “We are immensely grateful to all those – including more than nine in 10 of our regular givers – who have continued to support us during these difficult times. This support makes a massive difference to people struggling to escape poverty and to survive disasters around the world. “We are cutting head office and support functions to ensure that we can continue with the majority of our lifesaving and life-changing work on the ground, such as helping Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and people struggling to survive war in Yemen. “Our other top priority for investment is our action plan to strengthen our continuing efforts to root out sexual harassment and abuse.” Goldring has agreed to step down from his role later this year. In a statement, he said: “Along with all of you, I feel anger at the impact of the abhorrent abuse of power by those individuals in Haiti in 2011 and Oxfam’s failure to protect the women we were there to support. Oxfam is overwhelmingly a force for good.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/oxfam-warns-staff-urgent-savings-16m-haiti-scandal,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/oxfam-warns-staff-urgent-savings-16m-haiti-scandal
2018-06-15T11:45:43Z,world,World news,Palestinian forces accused of 'vicious' response to protests,"Palestinian authorities launched a “vicious crackdown” on peaceful demonstrators this week, including the arbitrary detention and torture of an Amnesty International staff member, the rights group has said. Laith Abu Zeyad had been monitoring a rare rally in the West Bank demanding that the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, ease punitive economic measures in Gaza, the isolated enclave run by his political rival, Hamas.
Security forces fired stun grenades and teargas on Wednesday at the crowds of hundreds which amassed in the city of Ramallah in defiance of a protest ban announced by Abbas’s ruling Palestinian Authority (PA). Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Middle East and north Africa research and advocacy director said the PA “revealed a dark underbelly of violence and dysfunction” when its security forces “launched a vicious crackdown on peaceful protesters demonstrating against sanctions on Gaza”. He said security officers, many plainclothed, assaulted and arrested dozens of demonstrators and bystanders and beat them while they were in custody. “Laith Abu Zayed spent several hours in police custody where he was severely beaten. Upon his release, he recalled seeing 18 other fellow detainees receive the same treatment,” said Luther, who called for an independent investigation. “The state of Palestine is a party to the main international human rights treaties, so the authorities have obligations under international law to uphold human rights,” he said, calling for countries to “urgently review security cooperation and assistance to the Palestinian security forces to ensure they are not facilitating human rights violations”.
The coastal strip of Gaza, cut off from the West Bank, has suffered a decade-long Israeli-Egyptian blockade that has severely limited the movement of goods and people and which the United Nations calls collective punishment. Hamas seized Gaza from Abbas’s forces in what was nearly a civil war in 2007, and the president has during the past year imposed sanctions on the strip, including not paying full salaries for more than 60,000 civil servants and temporarily cutting off payments for electricity. The protesters say these measures compound the disastrous effects of the blockade for Gaza’s 2 million residents, vast numbers of whom are unable to leave. Abbas, 83 and in power since 2005, has been widely accused by Palestinians of authoritarianism and polls show a majority want him to resign. As president, he has power in parts of the West Bank, which remains under Israeli military occupation. After protests began on Sunday night, the PA’s official news agency, Wafa, announced a ban on planned rallies for Wednesday, saying it would disturb citizens during the holy month of Ramadan. However, on Wednesday night protesters returned and were dispersed by security forces. The demonstrators say they are not aligned with Hamas or any political faction but want to end years of political infighting and alleviate suffering in Gaza.

2018-06-15T11:15:11Z,world,World news,Matteo Salvini: from far-right fringe player to strongman leader,"Matteo Salvini is unofficially assuming the role of prime minister of Italy after a week in which a standoff over stranded migrants and a row with France has bolstered the interior minister’s profile and created the appearance he is setting the country’s agenda. The transformation of Salvini from far-right fringe candidate to popular strongman leader could have vast implications for the future of Italy, its role in Europe and the fragile alliance that now governs the country. His popularity has increased by about 10 percentage points since the 4 March election, which resulted in a hung parliament with his party, the League, placed second in terms of seats. But its current 27% approval rating puts Salvini on equal footing with Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, the largest party, who serves as a minister of labour and industry in the coalition government. It has also won him admiration from the biggest cheerleader in support of far-right populist movements in Europe. “He stepped up and took some pretty dramatic action. I don’t think it could have turned out better for him,” said Steve Bannon, the former adviser to US president Donald Trump who has spent time in Italy and been a vociferous supporter of the far-right surge. Analysts say Salvini’s rise reflects the fact that he is a skilled politician and is competing for attention against Giuseppe Conte, the law professor who was plucked out of obscurity and named prime minister after Salvini and Di Maio agreed neither of them would assume the role, but who is seen as weak.
Salvini, a former talk radio host, has made a career out of demonising migrants. He made good on his campaign promise to crack down on irregular migration this week when, in his first major decision as interior minister, he blocked an NGO ship, the Aquarius, with more than 600 migrants on board from docking in Sicily. While the decision created a humanitarian crisis – Spain ultimately agreed to accept the migrants in Valencia – Salvini celebrated it as a big victory. When Italy’s refusal to accept the migrants elicited a sharp rebuke from Emmanuel Macron, the French president, it was seen among Italians as a deeply hypocritical response, given France’s reluctance to accept migrants and refugees. “There is a void in Palazzo Chigi [the prime minister’s residence] so of course this means that other figures will become more visible,” said Giovanni Orsina, a political historian. “Salvini knows how it works. He has got personality, a political education, and a very clear ideology.” Stopping the Aquarius migrant vessel, Orsina said, had cost Salvini nothing, and the fight with Macron, even for those Italians who do not support the League, has garnered him even more support given the Italian view that the rest of the EU, and especially France, have left the country to deal with the migrant crisis on its own. “Many Italians will say they are not with Salvini but that against the French they are with him, because they will say that what Macron said is false, hypocritical, unbearable,” Orsina said. It was also possible that Salvini – like Matteo Renzi before him – could ride a wave of popularity that collapses, much like the former centre-left prime minister did, he said. Bannon, speaking to the Guardian, said he believed that Salvini had done a “great job” by taking on the issue of migration in the first weeks of the new government. “Particularly since it is the summer and the crisis is only going to continue. And he showed the complete hypocrisy of Macron, and I think it is important for the people of Italy to see that he is willing to stand up,” Bannon said. “It is a central part of why Macron is going to crash and burn, he’s all big talk.” For migrants who were rescued by the Aquarius, the decision led to even more hardship. The boat is not expected to arrive in Valencia until Saturday or Sunday, and there are multiple accounts that those onboard, who include children, are suffering intense seasickness. Their journey to Spain has also been interrupted by poor weather, and legal experts have accused Italy of breaking international humanitarian rules. Flavio Di Giacomo, the spokesman for the UN migration agency, the IOM, said it was not the first time that a boat had been blocked from entering Italy. “What has changed is that this time the public opinion is backing this kind of action, which in part is because the anti-NGO narrative has won in the public opinion,” said Di Giacomo. Salvini, and other Italian politicians, have argued that NGOs who rescue migrants represent a “pull factor”, encouraging African economic migrants to make the journey across the Mediterranean. But many migration experts have argued that poor conditions are forcing migrants to flee, and that the NGOs are saving lives. Within a government that has a share of eclectic personalities, including an undersecretary who believes the moon landing was a hoax, Salvini has stood out in part by setting the agenda in a way that focuses on issues he has control over. “He is making migration the most important issue of the country, and then it follows that the minister who handles migration is the most important leader,” said Sergio Fabbrini at Luiss University. “The Five Star Movement is without an agenda, without a strategy.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/matteo-salvini-from-far-right-fringe-player-to-strongman-leader,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/matteo-salvini-from-far-right-fringe-player-to-strongman-leader

We’ve been overwhelmed by the responses from readers, particularly those of you who have been motivated to get involved – by joining a campaign group, making a donation or even drafting a policy paper. So this week we thought we would ask: have you been inspired to take action by the series? Let us know what you’ve been up to by emailing us at theupside@theguardian.com, and we might follow up for a future story. Back to our roundup: this year has been dominated by the global reckoning around gender relations, with #MeToo, the gender pay gap, parental leave and violence towards women all proving major talking points. This week’s stories reflect the evolution of that worldwide upheaval, from maternal mortality in rural India and sexual assault in Mongolia to parental equality in Canada.
The more time that fathers spend caring for their infants, the better it is for the children and for gender equality. But almost everywhere, take-up rates for parental leave among men are abysmal. In Quebec, a bold plan has seen the problem cracked; it has been deemed such a success that it will soon be rolled out nationwide. Mireille Silcoff reports from Montreal on how they did it. Meanwhile in Mongolia, 31% of women say they have been subjected to sexual or physical violence by a partner, while one in seven says they have experienced sexual violence outside their relationship – twice the estimated world average. Now a high-profile rape allegation against a politician has prompted a fightback among a growing women’s rights movement, as Lily Kuo discovered in Ulaanbaatar. Parts of rural India have long had a serious problem with women dying in childbirth, with some of the worst mortality rates in the world. A group of Indians living abroad decided something should be done to empower women. The Save a Mother initiative has had remarkable success, and Amrit Dhillon visited the village of Purabgaon in northern India to find out more.

2018-06-15T10:00:13Z,world,World news,First Nations look to buy equity in pipeline to have say in project's future,"After Justin Trudeau’s surprise announcement that the Canadian government would nationalize a contentious pipeline, indigenous protesters have been among the most vocal in their opposition to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, arguing that the project trespasses on their territory and poses a risk to the environment. Protests led by First Nations have amplified public unease of over the mega project – which will triple the flow of bitumen from Alberta to the coastal waters of British Columbia – as the country attempts to balance its fight against climate change with an economy driven largely by the energy industry.
But the project may soon find an unlikely group of investors: both the Athabasca Tribal Council and the Athabasca River Métis Council – a consortium of 10 communities – have offered to buy equity in the pipeline. “This is not the indigenous community coming out and saying: ‘We’re pro pipeline.’ We’re pro Trans Mountain. We see the value in it,” said Ron Quintal, president of the Athabasca River Métis. “The only way we’re able to mitigate the environmental impacts is through ownership and having a say in these projects.” The two councils recently met with federal officials, including the infrastructure minister, Amarjeet Sohi, to discuss their proposal.
This will not be the first time Canada’s First Nations have invested in the fossil fuel industries that have encroached on their land and disrupted traditional ways of life. Last year, the Fort McKay First Nation and Mikisew Cree First Nation in Alberta purchased 49% of an oil storage facility – a deal worth more than half a billion dollars. Frog Lake Energy Resources Corp, an indigenous-run company, produces 3,000 barrels of oil a day. A large source of tension around Trans Mountain project centres on the idea of unceded lands: few formal treaties were ever signed between British Columbia’s colonial settlers and the indigenous population – whose descendants argue that they retain the right to control any development. And in a string of previous high-profile legal battles, courts have tended to recognize the broad powers of indigenous land title, giving First Nations a potential veto on development projects. The debate over Trans Mountain has intensified after British Columbia environmental officials recently announced that a spill from the pipeline in late May, which was initially reported to be 100 litres, was in fact 48 times larger. “Despite all this insanity that Justin Trudeau is speaking, the answer is still no, we will never allow a pipeline to come through British Columbia,” Elder Ta’ah Amy George of the costal Tsleil-Waututh said in a statement following the government purchase of the pipeline. The pipeline’s prior owner, Texas-based Kinder Morgan, actively courted indigenous support throughout the process, promising among other incentives, royalties and environmental safeguards. And according to Ernie Crey, chief of the Cheam First Nation, months of high-profile protests obscured the reality of support for the project. “We learn almost daily, as other First Nations speak out about it, that they’re quite comfortable with this pipeline and they’re looking forward to the benefits that will flow from its construction in terms of training, jobs and the opportunity to engage in the construction of it.” He told the Guardian that his community was interested in potentially investing in the pipeline, but required more information on the project before making any commitments. To date, 43 First Nations out of more than 100 have signed agreements in support of the project. “We work very hard to ensure our territories are protected. We’re the stewards of the land,” said Quintal. “But at the same time, I need to make sure my members can put food on the table. I need to make sure they can get quality education and access to quality healthcare.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/trans-mountain-pipeline-first-nations-offer-buy-shares,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/trans-mountain-pipeline-first-nations-offer-buy-shares

2018-06-15T08:46:41Z,world,World news,Kashmir editor shot dead in Srinagar alongside bodyguards,"A leading journalist and editor who worked for peace in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir has been shot dead along with his bodyguards. Shujaat Bukhari had just left the Srinagar city office of his newspaper, Rising Kashmir, on Thursday when three men on a motorcycle fired at him and his two guards, police said.
Bukhari, 50, was hit multiple times in the head and abdomen and taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead around 7.30pm, police confirmed. He is the first journalist to be killed in 12 years and the 14th since 1990 in Kashmir, a mountainous region fought over by India and Pakistan and claimed in full by both. Police have released CCTV footage of three unidentified men who they said were responsible for the “terror attack”.
Militant groups in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir have fought a three-decade insurgency against India and its perceived allies but none claimed responsibility for the attack. Rising Kashmir, which Bukhari founded in 2008, was among the newspapers to have its printing press shut down in 2016 after the killing of a popular militant triggered months of street protests in which nearly 100 civilians were killed and thousands were blinded by pellets fired by the police and Indian paramilitary officers. Bukhari wrote for the BBC at the time that journalists in Kashmir “had to work on a razor’s edge in what is effectively the world’s most heavily militarised zone”. “Threats to life, intimidation, assault, arrest and censorship have been part of the life of a typical local journalist,” he said. “If a local journalist reports an atrocity by the security forces, he risks being dubbed ‘anti-national’. Highlighting any wrongdoing by the militants or separatists could easily mean that he is ‘anti-tehreek’ (anti-movement) or a ‘collaborator’.” Ishfaq Shah, a subeditor at Rising Kashmir, told the Guardian Bukhari had just left the office when staff heard gunshots. They first assumed they were firecrackers being set off in anticipation of the Islamic festival of Eid-al-Fitr. “Then they looked out the window and saw people running,” he said. After Bukhari’s death was confirmed the “devastated” staff returned to the office and worked to finish the day’s edition with a new front page about their editor. “We did it as a tribute to him,” Shah said. “We were taught by this man to do that.”
A witness told the Guardian he rushed to the area after hearing shots and found the editor slumped in his car. “I could only hear his driver murmuring,” he said. A police official at the scene said: “It appears to be a very well-planned attack. The attackers knew the routine.” Police sources have speculated the killing might be related to Bukhari’s involvement last August in a private peace-building initiative involving activists and members of the Indian and Pakistani governments. Senior militant leaders had criticised Bukhari and other Kashmiris involved in the proceedings. The journalist had been given five security guards by the government after a murder attempt in 2000. Three were understood to be posted to his home and two travelled with him. Bukhari’s killing took place amid a push by Delhi to initiate a peace dialogue in Kashmir. A temporary, unilateral ceasefire announced by the government for Ramadan ends on Friday. The Indian home minister, Rajnath Singh, called the editor’s killing “an act of cowardice”. “It is an attempt to silence the saner voices of Kashmir,” he tweeted. “He was a courageous and fearless journalist. Extremely shocked [and] pained at his death.” On Thursday, the UN released its first report on human rights violations in Kashmir, calling for an independent inquiry into allegations of murder, rape and torture committed by India and Pakistan.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/kashmir-journalist-shot-dead-in-srinagar-alongside-bodyguards,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/kashmir-journalist-shot-dead-in-srinagar-alongside-bodyguards

2018-06-15T07:00:09Z,world,World news,Brazil: high prices and low wages fuel surge in Panini World Cup sticker swaps,"On a sunny afternoon outside Sao Paulo’s modern art museum, more than 100 people have gathered to trade football stickers, using paper charts or mobile phone apps to keep record of their collections. Brazil is still reeling from an institutional and political crisis and only just crawling out of a brutal recession, but for one month the World Cup offers some escape from the country’s record unemployment and spiraling violence.
And this year, organized swap meetings – known in Portuguese as pontos de troca – “swap points” have sprung up across the country, helping cash-strapped collectors band together, and get around a dramatic surge in sticker prices. Renato Vasconcelos had collected World Cup football stickers since he was a child, but thought he wouldn’t bother this year when Panini announced in March that it was doubling the price of the five-sticker packets. “I never managed to complete an album before and with the increase in prices, I thought it would be impossible,” said the 33-year-old systems analyst. Yet as the tournament begins, Renato is the proud owner of a completed album – and his partner Mariana is just three stickers short. The couple attribute much of their success to the proliferation of pontos de troca. Facilitated by social media, meetups have been held in parks, stadiums, barbershops and even churches from the industrial powerhouses of the south-east to the jungle cities of the Amazon. With the price increase to two reais (about 50 cents or 40p) for a packet of five stickers, the minimum cost to complete this year’s 682-sticker Panini album is 274 reais ($72 or £55).
But that would be without any repeated stickers, which is virtually impossible. Economists estimate that to complete an album alone would average about 2,000 reais ($525/£395). In Sao Paulo, Brazil’s richest state, the average monthly income was 1,712 reais in 2017, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Gabriel Tasca, 27, completed his first album by acquiring one of the rarer shiny metallic stickers of the Uruguay aquad from Renato’s partner Mariana at the modern art museum swap point, receiving claps and cheers. “I managed to save a lot of money,” he said, estimating that he had spent 300 reais on stickers, before offering his remaining spares to whoever wanted them. Sticker swap meets organized via social media networks first gained national attention before the 2014 World Cup, which Brazil hosted, but since then have grown in popularity. “With the crisis and price increases, more people are opting for swap points this year,” said Diego Moreira, who runs the site Passion to Collect, which lists swap point times and locations with a Facebook group that has nearly 50,000 members across Brazil.
But while collectors say “swap points” have helped out their wallets, many have other complaints. “The problem this year is the bloody shiny ones,” said Francisco Silva, 53, a confectionery shop worker, now on his second album this year, and who has collected every year since 1990. Francisco and other collectors allege that the metallic shiny stickers are in unusually short supply this year and accused Panini of producing fewer to increase profits. Panini denies the allegation. But amid the apparent scarcity, a lucrative black market flourishes. Hardcore collectors disapprove of paying for rarities – instead of swapping them, but at the Sao Paulo modern art museum swap point, some were willing to break the taboo. Collectors at the swap point muttered darkly about a boy who had recently bought the last sticker he needed for 50 reais. “It’s exploitation,” said Vasconcelos. “I think it shows a lack of character.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/brazil-panini-world-cup-sticker-swaps,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/brazil-panini-world-cup-sticker-swaps
2018-06-15T06:20:15Z,world,World news,Iranian asylum seeker dies by suicide on Nauru,"A 26-year-old Iranian asylum seeker has died on Nauru, reportedly by suicide in his tent in the Australian-run regional processing centre. The body of 26-year-old Fariborz K was found in his tent by a family member at about 9am local time on Friday morning. He had recently married. His mother and 12-year-old brother are also being held on Nauru. Fariborz’s wife and mother were both hospitalised on Friday afternoon. His 12-year-old brother Ali has been taken into care by camp authorities. Sources inside RCP3 – the family camp – said refugees and asylum seekers attempted to help Fariborz when they found him in his tent but they were unable to revive him.

In April, Fariborz’s younger brother Ali made a public plea for help for his mother, Fazileh, who was suffering acute physical and mental illnesses, and said his brother was suffering a mental crisis. “I feel helpless because there is no one to help us. There is no one to see how we are suffering. My mother is very sick and my brother is totally depressed,” the boy said in a video. An IHMS health summary report for Fariborz, completed on April 24 this year, identified him as “being severely traumatised” as a result of being held captive as a 10-year-old child in Iran. “He reported long-term engement with psychiatrists in Iran and was on medication at that time. Mr K states though his post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms continue, that he did not wish to engage with specialist health services.” In a November assessment he declined to complete a mental health assessment. “He spoke of being angry at times in the context of his long-term detention,” the report said. Fariborz had also begged for help for his mother. In a handwritten note, written in English, he wrote: “I take the IHMS responsible for my mother’s drastic health situation. My mother’s health is now its worst”. A friend of Fariborz said he had been frustrated by his family’s stalemate after five years detained on Nauru. “I saw him only yesterday. He was a young athletic guy, but he had been suffering a long time because of his family’s situation. He was sick and tired.” Fariborz is the third asylum seeker or refugee to die by suicide on Nauru, and comes only three weeks after a Rohingya refugee on Manus Island killed himself. Twelve people have died from injuries or illness sustained in offshore processing centres since the facilities were reopened in late 2012: asylum seekers and refugees have been murdered by guards or have died from sepsis, medical neglect, accident and suicide.
A spokesman for the department of immigration said: “the department is aware of the death in Nauru today, 15 June 2018. Further enquiries should be referred to Nauruan authorities”. Staff at the regional processing centre told the Guardian: “it is Australia’s responsibility, it happened in their camp”. Iranian journalist and refugee Behrouz Boochani, detained on Manus Island, said: “Department of Home Affairs has referred the case to Nauruan authorities as always. It’s Australia that is responsible for his death, not Nauru! You are the one who exiled people there and denied them medical treatment and support. Dutton must give an answer to people.” The Nauruan government issued a statement on the man’s death. “We can confirm that a man has died in the Nauru regional processing centre today. Our thoughts and heartfelt prayers are with his family. Police are investigating.” Spokesman for the Refugee Action Coalition, Ian Rintoul, said the Australian government was responsible for the man’s death. “There have so many warnings but the toll mounts day by day; the neglect continues. So many cases of medical neglect.” “Peter Dutton must bring all the asylum seekers and refugees to Australia. The US deal is a farce that is now excluding Iranians and Somalis. Dutton has nowhere to settle the people who have been dumped on Nauru and are now dying of despair. Rintoul said news of the man’s death had devastated the asylum seeker and refugee community on Nauru. “He was a well-known, well-liked, athletic young man who did everything he could for his brother and mother.” The Guardian has not revealed the family’s surname out of concern for the safety of extended family members.

2018-06-15T05:54:57Z,world,World news,US calls on Vietnam to release American citizen arrested in protests,"The United States is calling on the Vietnamese authorities to release one of its citizens who was caught up in a violent police crackdown on protestors who took to the streets across Vietnam this week. Will Nguyen, 32, an American from Houston, Texas, who is currently studying in Singapore, was among those taken into custody on Sunday after he participated in a rare protest in Ho Chi Minh city. Video footage and witness accounts show Nguyen dragged through the streets by plain-clothed police, bleeding from a head injury. Vietnam’s single-party communist state bans anti-government demonstrations and the authorities require approval for public gatherings. However on Sunday, protests erupted against the establishment of new economic zones, which some fear will open the country up to further Chinese investment and interests.
The relationship between China and Vietnam has long been strained, but with the growth of Chinese influence across southeast Asia – mainly through infrastructure projects as part of their Belt and Road Initiative – and China’s increasing encroachment across the South China Sea, some Vietnamese have become fearful of their neighbour. Nguyen was one of more than 100 arrested in the demonstrations, which also took place in Hanoi and central Vietnam’s Khanh Hoa and Binh Thuan provinces, where protestors faced tear gas and water cannon when they tried to storm the office of the People’s Committee. There were multiple reports of assaults by the police as they broke up the protests and Brad Adams, Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, said: “With Vietnam’s poor record of handling protests, there’s every reason to believe that police are punishing dissent, not simply keeping public order.”
Nguyen is being held in jail, accused of “disturbing the peace”, but has not been charged. Nguyen’s friends and family said Nguyen, who is of Vietnamese descent, was at the protest as an interested bystander and that he has no political agenda. The protest coincided with him visiting Ho Chi Minh city to find a place to live once he finished a masters degree in Singapore. A close friend of Nguyen’s, Mary-Alice Daniel, who is coordinating efforts to get him released, said: “Protest is unusual in Vietnam and Will was there because he really supported it as a display of civil participation.” “He was there because he supported the Vietnamese people, he had no political agenda, it was not ideological. There is no evidence from people on the ground he was misbehaving in any way or doing anything other than peacefully protesting. But he was unlucky and he happened to be picked out from the crowd.” Daniel does not believe the Vietnamese police knew that Nguyen was an American citizen. Thi Thu Hang, spokeswoman for the ministry of foreign affairs denied that force had been used against Nguyen. US embassy spokesman Pope Thrower said that the embassy was aware of reports of the arrest but declined to comment further. “When a US citizen is detained overseas, the US Department of State works to provide all appropriate consular assistance. Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.” It is thought that more protests may take place this weekend. Last weekend’s rallies were also in protest against new cyber security laws, which require companies like Google and Facebook to store all data of Vietnam-based users in the country and open local offices. It’s feared this could lead to more government censorship online. The Vietnamese authorities have already overseen the creation of a military cyber warfare unit, countering“wrongful views” online.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/us-calls-on-vietnam-to-release-american-citizen-arrested-in-protests,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/us-calls-on-vietnam-to-release-american-citizen-arrested-in-protests
2018-06-15T05:26:38Z,world,World news,Friday briefing: Dirty tricks in Tories' Brexit battle,"Top story: Rebellion back on after row over amendment Hello – Warren Murray with the final briefing instalment of the week. Angry Conservative rebels have renewed their campaign to amend the Brexit bill after Theresa May appeared to renege on the promise of “meaningful vote” for parliament. The Tory group led by Dominic Grieve cried foul after the government weakened the wording of what was supposed to be a compromise amendment. “It is unacceptable. At the end of the process something was inexplicably changed, which had not been agreed,” said Grieve. Rebel peers will try to reinstate Grieve’s original text when the bill goes back to the House of Lords on Monday. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said: “Theresa May has gone back on her word and offered an amendment that takes the meaning out of the meaningful vote. Parliament cannot – and should not – accept it.” Things don’t look like getting any easier for May after the Scottish National party – the third-biggest party in the Commons – vowed to wage a guerrilla campaign of disruption to proceedings “day by day, week by week”. The SNP accuses the government of trampling the rights of the Scottish parliament in the Brexit process. * * * Lewisham East byelection – Janet Daby has held the south-east London seat for Labour but the party suffered a swing to the Liberal Democrats, who leapfrogged the Conservatives to come second. The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, campaigned with the party’s candidate, Lucy Salek, in a seat that voted heavily for remain in the EU referendum. In the end, the Lib Dems succeeded in reducing Labour’s majority from nearly 45% to 25.6% and pushed the Conservatives into third place. * * * ‘Hideous invasion of privacy’ – “Upskirting”, the taking of surreptitious, sexually intrusive photographs, is to become a specific criminal offence punishable by up to two years in prison. Those convicted might also be placed on the sex offenders register. The government has confirmed it will back a private member’s bill introduced by the Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse after a campaign by Gina Martin, who was voyeuristically photographed at a Hyde Park music festival.
* * * Universally discredited – The government’s much-delayed flagship welfare programme may end up costing more than what it replaces, cannot prove it helps more claimants into work and is unlikely to ever deliver value for money. This is the damning verdict of the National Audit Office on universal credit, which has cost £2bn so far to set up and run but is lagging six years behind schedule. An estimated 8 million people are expected to be on the benefit by the time it is fully rolled out in 2023 but only 850,000 are presently claiming it. The NAO report has prompted calls for the rollout to be halted until multiple design flaws are fixed. * * * China tariff row – France’s presidential couple are under fire over lavish spending on dinner settings for the Élysée at the same times as Emmanuel Macron rails about the “crazy cost” of welfare. Estimates put the cost of the 900 dinner plates and matching side plates at between €50,000 and €500,000 depending on how it is calculated. They are being designed and crafted at the Manufacture de Sèvres, suppliers of fine china to the presidential palace since 1848.

Lunchtime read: How to spot the perfect art fake It all started when police seized Venus, by the German Renaissance master Lucas Cranach the Elder, from a French gallery after a tip-off. One art historian places it among “the best old master fakes the world has ever seen.” Giuliano Ruffini, the collector who put it in the market, denies wrongdoing: “I am a collector, not an expert.”
Consider that $450m was paid for Leonardo da Vinci’s Salvator Mundi in 2017 and it becomes clear that the incentive to be a proficient forger has soared; a single, expertly executed old master knockoff can finance a long, comfortable retirement. Forgeries have become so good – and so costly – that Sotheby’s has brought in its own in-house fraud-busting expert. Samanth Subramanian explores modern-day forgers’ sophisticated tricks and the increasingly difficult battle to catch them.

The governing bodies of 12 British sports have demanded an end to a funding policy that puts Olympic medals above all else.

2018-06-15T05:13:32Z,world,World news,Chinese defend Einstein's portrait of their people as 'filthy' and 'obtuse',"Chinese internet users have defended Albert Einstein’s recently published travel diaries in which the physicist calls the Chinese “industrious, filthy people.” Portions of the diaries from his travels in Asia in the 1920s were posted online this week and their content surprised Einstein fans. “Chinese don’t sit on benches while eating but squat like Europeans do when they relieve themselves out in the leafy woods,” he wrote.
“All this occurs quietly and demurely. Even the children are spiritless and look obtuse.” The theoretical physicist, who once said racism was “a disease of white people”, added: “It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.” While some internet users called for a “boycott of Einstein” and said his observations proved “all humans, even Einstein, have a stupid, shallow side,” most said the China Einstein witnessed is nothing like it is today. “Einstein went to China at the wrong time,” said one Weibo user, describing the early years of the Chinese republic, established in 1912, which came after centuries of imperial rule. “Hunger, war, and poverty all pressed on the Chinese. How could Chinese people at the time gain Einstein’s respect?” Many were in strong support of the scientist: “This is called insulting China? That’s ridiculous. Did the Chinese in that era look dirty? When I see the photos from then, they look dirty, Einstein depicted the true state of that era.” Others compared the scientists’s observations to that of Lu Xun, considered the father of modern Chinese literature, who was best known for his scathing satire of Chinese society in the early 20th century. “We praise Lu Xun because he pointed out our disadvantages. Why should we blame Einstein for this?” Historical narratives promoted by the Chinese government often paint the days before China’s communist party took power in 1949 as chaotic.
The state-run Global Times published an editorial on Friday praising the level-headed response of Chinese internet users. The author, who goes by the pen name Gengzhige, wrote: “I’m curious what Einstein would write now if he saw the open attitudes most Chinese show today toward his private diary.” The editorial elicited over 2,000 comments. One of the most liked responses said: “Dignity is earned by oneself, not given by others.” But there were some dissenting voices amongst the comments: “This is just racism. We can see that Einstein is strong in physics but he doesn’t understand humans at all.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/chinese-defend-einsteins-diaries-filthy-obtuse,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/chinese-defend-einsteins-diaries-filthy-obtuse
2018-06-15T04:00:06Z,world,World news,'We have a new chance': Zimbabwe gears up for elections after Mugabe,"The president and his wife drive slowly across the dusty sports ground, preceded by a pickup full of local reporters, flanked by a crowd of excited teenagers, and followed by a large cloud of dust. Banners are held aloft, flags waved. Zimbabwe’s election campaign has reached Chegutu, a small agricultural town on the high, flat uplands 70 miles west of Harare. The rally is one of the first since the official declaration of the campaign last month. The coming election – on 30 July – is the latest turning point in the most tumultuous few months in almost four decades of Zimbabwe’s political history.
In November, Robert Mugabe was forced out of power after 37 years, following a peaceful military takeover supported by the vast majority of the 17 million population. The coming election could decide the former British colony’s course for decades to come. “For so long we were suffering. Now we have a new chance in Zimbabwe,” says Chiedza Marutsa, a 57-year-old farmer attending the rally in Chegutu. The election pits Zanu-PF, the ruling party, against the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), the longstanding opposition. Zanu-PF is led by Emmerson Mnangagwa, a 75-year-old former vice president known as “the Crocodile” who took power when Mugabe was ousted. Polls indicate a potentially close race, but one Zanu-PF should win. Mnangagwa’s message at Chegutu is simple: a vote for Zanu-PF is a vote for economic growth. The average income in Zimbabwe will increase four, five, 10 times in coming years, he promises the crowd, but that requires foreign investors. “What builds clinics, roads, schools, clean water? What makes jobs? It is business … Zimbabwe is open for business,” he says.
The rhetoric is a stark departure from the leftist ideology of the Mugabe years. But Zimbabwe is in desperate need of capital: its once envied infrastructure is crumbling; government debts are massive; civil servant salaries go unpaid; millions need food aid to avoid severe malnutrition. Marutsa says her six children, all educated or with professional qualifications, are without jobs. Senior officials deny any shift in party principles, describing a “course correction” instead. “We are fulfilling what we went for in the 1970s: to build a new and modern country. We are going to break out economically at last,” says Chris Mutsvangwa, a presidential adviser and leader of the powerful veterans of the liberation war. Mugabe has “stolen the future of the young people”, he continues. “We were sliding into the middle ages. Reforms are in the works that will make us the optimal destination for investment in the while of Africa. Discipline, organisation, education and stability will be the building blocks of our future.” The ruling party’s messaging encourages Zimbabweans to look forward to prosperity and stability under an experienced, moderate and reasonable ruler. Anyone looking back may see Mnangagwa in a very different light. A former spy chief, Mnangagwa was Mugabe’s right-hand man for decades. He and other senior officials – many of whom are former senior soldiers – are accused of involvement in massacres in the early 1980s of tens of thousands of civilians in Matabeleland and of masterminding the brutal repression of the MDC in more recent years. Some are accused of corruption and racketeering. Voters know that Mugabe was not ousted to restore democracy but because Mnangagwa and others feared that the 94-year-old ruler’s much younger wife, Grace, was about to take power.
Senior opposition figures are unequivocal about their view on the state of affairs. “We removed a dictator in November 2017 but we did not remove a dictatorship. These are not change agents,” says Tendai Biti, a top MDC official. So far there has been little material improvement for the ordinary Zimbabwean citizen since the end of Mugabe’s rule. Hard currency still remains desperately short and the price of key essentials is still rising. Representatives of major international investment funds have flown into Harare but are wary of committing large sums. When Mnangagwa flew to Beijing this year, he was told that China was happy to help but only when financial and legal systems improved. Until massive loan arrears are cleared, the big multilateral lenders cannot supply the money needed to refloat the economy. This is one reason why senior officials are so keen for Zimbabwe to return to the Commonwealth, from which it was suspended in 2002 after brutal repression and fraud during a presidential election. “Our policy is very clear: we want to be friends with everyone,” says the foreign minister, Sibusiso Moyo, a former general who shot to global prominence when he announced the military takeover of the state broadcasting network. “For many years our people have been suffering and we want to get them out of the quagmire. We need friends to do that. We want to be a member of the community of nations again.”
Opinion of Mnangagwa is divided among western diplomats and analysts in Harare Some are convinced the president wants to be seen as the statesman who has restored democracy in Zimbabwe and who would step down if defeated. Others say the Crocodile “does not have a democratic bone in his body”, but has pragmatically recognised the need to win international legitimacy if his country is to access the financial assistance it so desperately needs. The international community has interests too. Post-Brexit Britain needs a foreign policy success and has made its support for Mnangagwa clear – if conditional on free, fair and credible elections. China continues to take advantage of the Trump administration’s lack of interest in Africa to expand its influence. Recent polls show the MDC leader, Nelson Chamisa, on 28%, and Zanu-PF on 39%. If the gap were to close substantially in the weeks before the ballot, there are fears that hardliners within Zanu-PF may be tempted to revert to the old ways rather than lose power, even if the cost is international opprobrium. “These are the same people who were the enforcers of Mugabe’s regime,” says Welshman Ncube, a senior MDC figure based in Bulawayo, the country’s second largest city. The MDC says there are serious problems with the electoral roll, concerns over the ballot papers, a biased election commission and systematic intimidation of voters in rural areas. They also complain about the obvious and massive bias in the dominant state-run media. “A ruse has been sold to the international community … They are putting stability ahead of democracy, and favouring commerce over good governance,” says Chamisa, who has been leader of the MDC since the death of Morgan Tsvangirai in February. Other MDC officials go further, accusing London and Washington of complicity in repression.
But few deny that the atmosphere is dramatically improved compared with previous elections. Although there have been 71 verified incidents of political violence in the first six months of this year, about half of which were committed by Zanu-PF supporters, respected human rights activists in Zimbabwe say that, so far at least, levels remain relatively low. One international election expert in Harare says logistic and technical preparations for the elections has been “correctly conducted” – a statement that opposition leaders called “outrageous” – and points out that many more respondents are now prepared to answer pollsters questions on voting intentions, suggesting “less fear” than before Mugabe’s fall. The MDC is holding rallies in Zanu-PF strongholds where previously it feared to set foot and has been allowed to march through central Harare.
“A lot remains to be done but in the context we were coming from, to let us canvas, mobilise and organise is a lot of progress,” Ncube says. Mukudzei Majoni, 25, a project officer at Magamba TV, an online network in Harare that faced repeated harassment by the authorities under Mugabe, describes the atmosphere as “weird”. He says: “We’ve never had an election like this. We’ve never had this much peace ... It’s very disorientating.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/we-have-a-new-chance-zimbabwe-gears-up-for-elections-after-mugabe,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/we-have-a-new-chance-zimbabwe-gears-up-for-elections-after-mugabe
2018-06-15T04:00:06Z,world,World news,'The Daddy quota': how Quebec got men to take parental leave,"When Daniel Goldsmith’s first son was born in Quebec in 2013, he took the newborn on a trip to Colorado Springs, the US town in which he grew up.
“I’d smile at a mother in a coffee shop, because her baby was the same age as mine, just weeks old,” he recalls. “And then she’d tell me she was going back to work the following week.” Goldmith, a humanities teacher in Montreal, spoke to old friends about their experiences with babies and work. “It just sounded like the definition of insanity: mothers going back to work two weeks after a baby was born; fathers taking two days off.” The 35-year-old had emigrated to Canada with his wife, Giulia Zaccagnini, a few years earlier. He took advantage of a Quebec social policy unheard of anywhere else in North America: a programme of extended non-transferable paternity leave at 70-75% pay offered by the government. “Most of my [male] colleagues at work are somewhere between 28 and 40, and I don’t know of a single one in the department who’s had a kid who has not taken those weeks of paternity leave,” says Goldsmith. “If something generous like this is being offered, you don’t say no.”
In the family of Canada’s provinces and territories, Quebec has long been the noisy, rebellious child. In 2006, it divorced itself from the country’s complex and lacklustre parental leave programme. The province created its own system, the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP), a model influenced by Scandinavian countries and with the aim of improving gender equality. Along with Quebec’s highly subsidised daycare system – the envy of parents across the rest of Canada, with rates as low as C$7.55 (£4.35) per day per child – QPIP was seeded in the 1990s by the controversial separatist leader Pauline Marois, then Quebec’s minister of families. “Marois is a feminist and fiercely determined,” says Sophie Mathieu, a post-doctoral fellow at Brock University who researches the Quebec parental leave system. “As a province, Quebec went from being the laggard in gender equality – Quebec was the last Canadian province to give women the vote – to being the leader.”
QPIP gave parents higher replacement rates – 70-75% of one’s income, over a maximum 52 weeks – than other Canadian provinces, while offering more flexibility in terms of shared leave. But the most innovative aspect of QPIP is its “daddy quota” — the five weeks of “use-it-or-lose-it” benefits, for fathers and non-biological mothers in lesbian couples. “There is so much working against fathers when it comes to leave,” says Andrea Doucet, the Canada Research Chair in Gender, Work & Care. “Fathers go into work and say they want to take leave, and their bosses say: ‘Well isn’t your wife taking leave?’ Fathers were being penalised for taking leave, all the stuff that women have been going through for so long. “What they found in places like Sweden is that if you give fathers their own leave, something families will lose if they don’t take, taking the leave becomes expected.” Among fathers in Quebec, the effect was close to immediate, with take-up rates among eligible dads jumping 250%. “Over 80% of Quebec fathers take their paternity leave,” says Doucet. And 86% of Quebec parents will also in some way share the rest of their parental leave. Compare that with the 15% of fathers who take parental benefits in the rest of Canada, and the estimated 2% of parents who use the shared parental leave programme in the UK, and the results of what some policy experts have called “the Quebec experiment” begin to seem quite stunning. Globally the picture is even starker. Almost two-thirds of the world’s children under a year old – nearly 90 million infants – live in countries where fathers are not legally entitled to a single day of paid paternity leave, according to new research by Unicef. Ankita Patnaik, an economist at Mathematica Policy Research in Washington DC, authored one of the first papers studying QPIP. She says the programme quickly showed results with regards to time use between couples. “I found that the mothers having babies in Quebec under QPIP were spending more time in paid work one to three years after having their children,” she says. What’s more, Patnaik found that fathers who made use of QPIP were engaging in more childcare and domestic work one to three years later than fathers who did not – 37 minutes more per day, on average.
Doucet, who has studied fatherhood for two decades, says that the true worth of Quebec fathers spending more time with their babies is still difficult to reflect in numbers. “The real question is: later on when the child is sick, who is going to care for the kid? We’ve seen … that when fathers build their confidence, competence, love and the feeling that they are an equal parent, then when things go wrong, it’s not always the mother [who takes responsibility].” While five weeks of leave is a good step in this direction, “it’s just one step”, she adds. Goldsmith, who also used shared parental benefits to take months-long leaves for both his young sons, believes that men caring for their babies in the early weeks of their life has a significant and continuing benefit for family life. “It’s different for dads. Mums have an automatic bond but dads have to earn it. And then when you start getting reactions from your babies, it makes you want to be more involved,” he says. “I want to care for my kids, not because of some abstract theoretical notion of sharing 50/50. My son smiles when I smile, he smiles when he sees me. So I do things for love. Love becomes the reason.” In Canada, that love is spreading. “In the 2018 budget, we have introduced an additional parental sharing benefit of five weeks,” says the families minister, Jean-Yves Duclos. “This is directly related to this very successful experiment in the province of Quebec. “We know it’s policies like this that will help us achieve a more equal and inclusive society. These are the kind of policies we want. Not the kind that build walls. Here in Canada, we prefer bridges.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

One photo posted to Instagram and since deleted was captioned “very very politically incorrect”. “Cotton prices are unreal though so it’s a great time to be pickin,” it said. It showed five men in homemade Ku Klux Klan hoods and robes and one man in blackface and body paint, pretending to be a slave. A public description on Facebook billed the event as a two-day end-of-semester party with a “politically incorrect” opening night. “As exams have just commenced we are already looking forward to the end of term and thus, the idea of the muddy duck ‘two dayer’ has been born,” it said. “Thursday night [is a] ‘politically incorrect’ themed session kicking off at 7.30pm. So grab a kit that would legally get you in the shit and hook right in.” The university’s vice-chancellor, Andrew Vann, said: “Charles Sturt University will not tolerate this offensive behaviour. It does not reflect our university values and we strongly condemn these actions. CSU is currently investigating these incidents and social media posts.”
On Friday, several men in the photos had deleted their Instagram and Facebook accounts. In a now-deleted Facebook post, made at 9pm on the night of the event, the Black Swan Hotel said it had no prior knowledge of the racist costumes. “The pub was made aware of an incident unbeknownst to staff,” it said. “We were unaware of this behaviour happening out the back of the pub, however we have immediately dealt with this. We have zero tolerance and do not condone this behaviour.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/australian-university-students-dress-as-ku-klux-klan-and-in-blackface,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/australian-university-students-dress-as-ku-klux-klan-and-in-blackface
2018-06-14T23:52:39Z,world,World news,'Tourism pollution': Japanese crackdown costs Airbnb $10m,"It has become a familiar scene: tourists in rented kimonos posing for photographs in front of a Shinto shrine in Kyoto. They and other visitors have brought valuable tourist dollars to the city and other locations across Japan. But now the country’s former capital is on the frontline of a battle against “tourism pollution” that has already turned locals against visitors in cities across the world such as Venice, Barcelona and Amsterdam. The increasingly fraught relationship between tourists and their Japanese hosts has spread to the short-stay rental market. On Friday a new law comes into effect that requires property owners to register with the government before they can legally make their homes available through Airbnb and other websites. The restriction has caused the number of available properties to plummet and has cost the US-based company millions of dollars.
Thanks to government campaigns, the number of foreign tourists visiting Japan has soared since the end of a flat period caused by a strong yen and radiation fears in the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima disaster. A record 28.7 million people visited last year, an increase of 250% since 2012. Almost seven million were from China, with visitors from South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong Thailand and the US taking the next five spots. By 2020, the year Tokyo hosts the Olympic Games, the government hopes the number will have risen to 40 million. But for many people living near sightseeing hotspots, the tourism boom is proving a double-edged sword. “Japan’s rise as a bucket-list destination is a mixed blessing,” said Peter MacIntosh, who organises walking tours and geisha evenings for small groups. “When there were very few tourists, people complained, and now that there are lots of them, they’re not ready for it. If it’s like this now, what do you think it’s going to be like closer to the Olympics?” The Gion-Shimbashi area of Kyoto is quiet on this weekday morning, but by the weekend the road in front of Tatsumi Daimyojin shrine, the bridge over the Shirakawa and alleyways dotted with restaurants, homes and ryokans (traditional Japanese inns) will be teeming with an international cast of visitors. Tomoko Okuda, who runs Shiraume, a ryokan that welcomes overseas guests, believes more could be done to educate tourists about local customs before they arrive. “Making a booking at a restaurant and then cancelling on the same day may be acceptable in other countries, but in Japan it causes real problems because of the preparation involved,” Okuda said. “I’ve also heard complaints about people going into old tea houses and coffee shops, taking photos and leaving without ordering anything.”
Kanji Tomita, an architect and member of a group campaigning to preserve the Gion-Shimbashi’s traditional atmosphere, said tourists were welcome, but added that some local businesses were running out of patience. Most complaints target groups loitering in the doorways of private homes, sitting on delicate bamboo fences and trespassing to take the perfect selfie. Others say the sheer number of visitors has led to overcrowded buses, fully booked restaurants and a general din that spoils the city’s miyabi – the refined atmosphere that draws people to Kyoto in the first place. “This used to be a place where you’d only see locals out for a stroll or eating at a restaurant,” Tomita said. “But more and more people read online reviews and make a beeline for the area. It’s a beautiful place and we want visitors to enjoy it, but they should also consider the feelings of the people who live here. It’s not some sort of cultural Disneyland.”
Under the new private lodging law, which was supposed to address a legal grey area surrounding short-term rentals – known as minpaku – properties can be rented out for a maximum of 180 days a year, and local authorities are permitted to impose additional restrictions. The result has been a dramatic drop in the number of Japanese properties available via Airbnb, from more than 60,000 this spring to just 1,000 on the eve of the law’s introduction. The legislation has forced the firm to cancel reservations for guests planning to stay in unregistered homes after Friday and to compensate clients to the tune of about $10m. Complaints about late-night noise and rubbish incorrectly sorted before disposal, along with security concerns, have pitted residents against local authorities keen to cash in on the tourism boom. Tellingly, Kyoto will allow private lodging in residential areas only between mid-January and mid-March, the one time of the year that tourists traditionally avoid. A short walk south of Tatsumi Daimyojin, hordes of tourists have congregated on a street in front of Ichiriki, the 300-year-old teahouse made famous by the book and film Memoirs of a Geisha. Most are here for one reason: to catch a glimpse of the Gion district’s geiko and maiko – or qualified and trainee geisha. “The problem is that everyone thinks of Kyoto as their own private photo studio,” said MacIntosh, who has lived in the city for 25 years. “I’ve seen maiko bursting into tears and fending off people who want to have their photo taken with them. They are not on display. This is a live, working environment.” Other incidents have hardened attitudes towards mass tourism, with TV networks running features on tourists climbing up cherry trees during the blossom season or staggering drunk around Tokyo’s Golden Gai bar district. In May there was widespread anger when more than 100 trees in a popular bamboo forest were found to have been defaced by people carving their names into them.
Alex Kerr, a Kyoto resident and author of several books about Japan, said the country had been caught off-guard. “It’s not just Kyoto – most of Japan is unprepared for the foreign influx because the boom has happened so quickly. Nobody ever expected tourists to come in such large numbers, and it is only just beginning.” Kerr believes better management would ease the pressure, including the introduction of higher admission fees to popular attractions. “Tourism is the last salvation for many rural towns, and even having a big impact on metropolises such as Osaka,” he said. “So clamping down on tourism is not the answer. At the same time, there’s no question that unmanaged crowds can damage the experience, especially in a city like Kyoto where so much of the essence of the culture was about the quiet and meditative atmosphere.” In Tatsumi Daimyojin, the photoshoots have ended and the groups in kimonos move on to the next attraction. “Japan is going through a period of adjustment,” said Okuda. “Kyoto isn’t as big or cosmopolitan as Tokyo, and it is taking time to get used to the influx of visitors. But the last thing I want is for Kyoto to become the sort of place that sends out the signal that tourists should stay away.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/tourism-pollution-backlash-japan-crackdown-costs-airbnb-10m-kyoto,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/tourism-pollution-backlash-japan-crackdown-costs-airbnb-10m-kyoto
2018-06-14T23:01:02Z,world,World news,Police and service dogs and horses receive protection by law,"A bill making it a specific offence to attack police or prison officer dogs or police horses is set to become law after the government decided to back the measure, closing what campaigners said was a loophole in existing legislation.
The animal welfare (service animals) bill, introduced by Conservative MP Sir Oliver Heald, was due to have its second reading on Friday. As a private member’s bill it had minimal chance of securing enough parliamentary time to be passed. But the environment secretary, Michael Gove, said the measure would receive government backing, so as to “offer stronger protection for the many brave service animals that help to protect us”. The bill amends the 2006 Animal Welfare Act by making it a specific offence of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal “under the control of a relevant officer”, such as a police or prison officer. It also removes a current provision for someone to claim self defence if they have harmed a service animal.
It was introduced by Heald, the MP for North East Hertfordshire, following the case of a police dog called Finn, which was stabbed by a robbery suspect in 2016. Finn and his handler, police officer Dave Wardell, a constituent of Heald’s, had tracked the suspect to a garden when he stabbed the dog in the chest. Despite the injuries, Finn – also suffering a head wound – then protected Wardell from an attempt to stab his handler. Finn clung on to the man until reinforcements arrived. He survived and returned to work, but underwent four hours of surgery.
While the arrested man was charged with actual bodily harm against Wardell, the only options over the injuries to Finn were causing unnecessary suffering to an animal or criminal damage. The arrested man received a jail term for the assault on Wardell, but the court decided there was no need to add an additional penalty for the attack on Finn. Wardell said that the bill would be a suitable response to the bravery of Finn, now retired. “When Finn was seriously injured it didn’t seem right to me or the public that he was seen as an inanimate object or property, in law,” he said. Heald said he was delighted at receiving government support: “This is a good day for all of our brave service animals.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/police-service-dogs-horses-animal-welfare-service-animals-bill,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/police-service-dogs-horses-animal-welfare-service-animals-bill
2018-06-14T22:01:10Z,world,World news,"French police cut soles off migrant children's shoes, claims Oxfam","French border police have been accused of detaining migrant children as young as 12 in cells without food or water, cutting the soles off their shoes and stealing sim cards from their mobile phones, before illegally sending them back to Italy. A report released on Friday by the charity Oxfam also cites the case of a “very young” Eritrean girl, who was forced to walk back to the Italian border town of Ventimiglia along a road with no pavement while carrying her 40-day-old baby. The allegations, which come from testimony gathered by Oxfam workers and partner organisations, come two months after French border police were accused of falsifying the birth dates of unaccompanied migrant children in an attempt to pass them off as adults and send them back to Italy. “We don’t have evidence of violent physical abuse, but many [children] have recounted being pushed and shoved or shouted at in a language they don’t understand,” Giulia Capitani, the report’s author, told the Guardian. “And in other ways the border police intimidate them – for example, cutting the soles off their shoes is a way of saying, ‘Don’t try to come back’.”
Daniela Zitarosa, from the Italian humanitarian agency Intersos, said: “Police [officers] yell at them, laugh at them and tell them, ‘You will never cross here’. “Some children have their mobile phone seized and sim card removed. They lose their data and phonebook. They cannot even call their parents afterwards.” Italy accused France of hypocrisy this week for failing to share the burden of the ongoing migrant crisis. The spat developed when the French president, Emmanuel Macron, criticised what he called Italy’s “cynicism and irresponsibility” in turning away a migrant rescue ship with 629 people on board. Matteo Salvini, Italy’s new anti-migrant interior minister, who blocked the Aquarius rescue vessel from docking in Sicily, accused France of turning its back on 10,524 migrants at the border between January and May this year. Capitani said unaccompanied minors had for some time been sent back to Italy by French police, although it was only in March that they allegedly began falsifying birth dates on “refusal of entry” documents – one month after a court in Nice ruled that border authorities had illegally detained and returned children to Italy in 20 cases. Under the Dublin regulation, child migrants in France cannot be sent back to Italy if they request asylum. EU law stipulates that unaccompanied minors must be protected, and that those seeking asylum in one member state have the right to be transferred to another where they have family members. Charities operating at the border have also taken aim at Italy for failing to implement adequate procedures for family reunification, leaving many children stranded and with no choice but to attempt the journey by themselves. The Oxfam report said Italy’s overstretched and bureaucratic system leaves migrants living under the radar in dangerous conditions. Capitani said Italian border police had recently started to accompany minors rejected by France back to the neighbouring country. France tightened rules at its border after 84 people were killed in a terror attack in Nice in July 2016. Ventimiglia has become a bottleneck for people attempting to cross from Italy into France. Oxfam said that at least 16,500 migrants, a quarter of them children, passed through the town in the nine months to April. Most attempt to cross the border by train or via a dangerous mountain path known as the “passage of death”. Charities estimate that at least 12 people died last year while trying to cross into France, either along the mountain route or by being hit by vehicles along a motorway. A 17-year-old from Sudan drowned in June 2017 while trying to retrieve a shoe washed away by a strong current in Ventimiglia’s Roia river. According to Oxfam, 17,337 children arrived in Italy in 2017, 15,779 (91%) of whom were unaccompanied.

2018-06-14T18:11:41Z,world,World news,Mike Pence to be greeted by giant LGBT dance party during Ohio visit,"Mike Pence is going to a drag show on Friday. It’s not listed on his official itinerary for the trip, but when he arrives in Columbus, Ohio, he’ll be greeted by drag queens, soundsystems and hundreds of LGBT revellers. The delightfully festive crossover comes as the US vice-president is set to speak at an event being held by at the controversial pro-Trump non-profit America First Policies, just as Pride weekend in Columbus kicks off. To commemorate the visit, the LGBT community has decided to throw him a party outside the downtown hotel where he’s speaking. In tow will be a dozen drag performers, two DJs, and speeches from politicians like Rick Neal, the gay Democratic candidate for Ohio’s 15th US congressional district.
The Welcome Mike Pence: Big LGBTQ Dance Party was launched on a whim on Facebook on Monday of this week, Jay Smith, one of the organizers of the event explained, and in a few days it has snowballed beyond anything he imagined. Nearly 2,000 have expressed interest on the Facebook page. Apparently a lot of people want to see Mike Pence dance to Robyn. Smith says he’s anticipating five to six hundred people, although that number could grow. “We want to jam the street with as many people as we can celebrating. I would love to see a sea of rainbow and dancing,” he said. “The energy that has developed stems from his record on LGBT issues. It’s been amplified because he’s coming on Friday, the first day of Columbus Pride. The fact that he’s anti-LGBT and he’s coming on Pride weekend? We couldn’t do nothing.” Pence’s record on LGBT issues has indeed been terrible. Some of his greatest bigoted hits came as governor of Indiana, when he signed a so-called religious freedom bill into law that would have effectively served as a license to discriminate against gay people. It was later toned down after an uproar. In Congress, he supported an amendment that would define marriage as only between a man and a woman, and voted against the Don’t Ask Don’t Tell repeal. During his run for Congress he appears to have advocated for the horrific practice known as conversion therapy – something he later denied. America First Policies’ record on the issues isn’t all that great either. Recently Carl Higbie, a top staffer at the group, resigned after numerous racist and homophobic comments he had made in the past were reported. That kind of record would justify a more serious demonstration but partying as protest has a longstanding tradition in the gay community, with pride events traditionally coupling political activism with a celebration of queer culture.
It’s a tactic used by other groups, too. After being caught on video delivering a racist rant in a New York cafe last month, lawyer Aaron Schlossberg was met with revelers outside his apartment partying in the streets and singing along to a mariachi band. A number of high-profile electronic artists and DJs are planning a marathon dance party in the UK to protest against Donald Trump’s first visit. In that spirit, parties like this are an ironic torment. Don’t like Mexicans? Good luck sleeping through this mariachi band, pal. Don’t like gay people? Watch us werk. “We decided to go with the dance party because it’s fun, it’s a loving event. When people dance they’re happy,” Smith said. “We want to demonstrate for the LGBT community, especially those struggling with their gender identity or sexual orientation, that while this administration doesn’t have their back, we have their back and that we’re going to be fighting for them every day.” “The LGBTQ scene here is very strong, and very much supported by the city, from the mayor down,” Sable Coate, one of the drag queens co-hosting the event added. “It’s funny because, I always tell my friends in other cities: you can’t believe how gay Columbus, Ohio, is until you’ve been there to experience it!” That’s something Coate hopes Pence finds out for himself. “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that he chose to come to Columbus during Pride Weekend. We have to show them we’re here in peace, we’re here in happiness, we’re here to celebrate, but we don’t agree with your choices regarding our community and all we want as Americans is equality.” In other words, if you can’t get Mike Pence to go to the drag show, you have to bring the drag show to him.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/mike-pence-lgbtq-dance-party-columbus-ohio,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/mike-pence-lgbtq-dance-party-columbus-ohio
2018-06-14T18:01:25Z,world,World news,"Russians and Brits set aside differences for football, humour and pop","In London’s diplomatic quarter on Thursday, it was finally time for Brits and Russians to put aside poison, politics and pointed accusations and celebrate the many things that they have in common: a sense of humour, the beautiful game and Robbie Williams.
And 52 years of hurt. Yes, Russians enjoyed their footballing high-water mark in 1966 too, when they competed as the Soviet Union, oligarchs and Robbie Williams hadn’t been invented and even Vladimir Putin was just a scrappy teenager. Since then, it has been one long chorus of pain walking down a one-way street. Russia have been even harder to watch than England. As three dozen students, expats, pensioners and officials gathered at the Kensington offices of Rossotrudnichestvo (a Russian cultural cooperation body similar to the British Council in almost every respect apart from one: it is still open), there was a sense that this was not just about the action on the pitch, but the whole spectacle. “Our football is our frustration,” said one Russian fan, a long-term London resident who has changed his name to James Grey. “We do not have the best team,” he said. “But it is an important moment for Russians – Russia will be the best host ever, safe and secure, you will see.”
Elena Doroshenko, who has lived in London for 15 years, agreed. “It gives us a special feeling of pride, a national consolidation,” she said. “The event has a special value for the country and popularity of Russia and our way of life and our people. We are a very welcoming people.” And so the crowd started watching in the peculiar surrounds of a cultural centre, a grand piano in one corner, and paintings by Soviet artist Oleg Kudryashov on the walls. It was all very English, really. There were heads in hands half the time, hoping against hope, and ready to scoff and laugh when things get a bit ugly. There was much head shaking during a scrappy first half and raucous laughter at the diplomatic highlight, when Putin consoled his Saudi guest Mohammed bin Salman with a no-hard-feelings handshake. The relief when Yury Gazinsky opened the scoring was palpable, and by the end all was forgiven when Aleksandr Golovin hammered in the fifth, and strangers were saluting each other like old friends. For Anton Chesnokov, the head of Rossotrudnichestvo in London, it was a fitting end to a busy day that started with a cultural event on bilingualism with Russian and British educators. Here is a man with a tricky job: keeping up the battle for hearts and minds while the diplomacy turns to novichok.
“The more difficult the political situation, the more important our work is,” he said. “But here the World Cup can help, by showing Russia’s visitors a good time. “From what I’ve seen the reception for the English has been great. It’s the best month to visit Russia, it’s warm, people will embrace the culture, they can travel freely.” And the Russian team? “We hope they will perform well to get out of the group and bring joy and fun for Russians. “But the main purpose of the event is for the world to meet in Russia.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/russians-and-brits-set-aside-differences-for-football-humour-and-pop,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/russians-and-brits-set-aside-differences-for-football-humour-and-pop
2018-06-14T16:45:33Z,world,World news,China crisis: Macrons under fire in France over cost of new plates,"With some of their crockery dating back to the time of President René Coty in the 1950s, France’s first couple badly needed a dinner service that “corresponded better to the present day”, the Élysée let it be known. So Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron ordered a set of 900 dinner plates and 300 side plates, designed by the artist Evariste Richer, from the Manufacture de Sèvres, suppliers of fine porcelain to the presidential palace since 1848.
Inevitably, there is now a bit of row over the cost. According to the Journal du Dimanche, the official price tag for the new service was €50,000 (£44,000). The satirical weekly Le Canard enchaîné, however, makes it more like €500,000. Macron’s critics have been quick to highlight the discrepancy, accusing the president of extravagance at a time of national belt-tightening due to his far-reaching programme of economic change. The revelation came, unfortunately, after his head of communications, Sibeth Ndiaye, posted a video of Macron talking animatedly about the “crazy amounts of cash” France spent on welfare without making any great difference. “We plough a crazy amount of cash into minimum welfare benefits and people are still poor,” he said, reviewing a speech he was to give later in the southern city of Montpellier. “People who are born poor stay poor. We have to have something that enables people to get out of it.” The speech subsequently made clear Macron was referring to the need for greater investment in education and reforms to a benefit system that stigmatises recipients while failing to make any real improvement to their lives. But for a head of of state dubbed “the president of the rich”, it did not look good. The pricey crockery, though, has an explanation. A national institution founded in the reign of Louis XV, the Manufacture de Sèvres is fully state-subsidised, and its employees are civil servants. The official bill for the new dinner service would cover the designer’s fee, the news weekly Le Point reported; the rest would not be paid for by the Élysée, but come out of the factory’s budget, partly financed by the culture ministry. The Canard enchaîné’s calculations were based on the catalogue prices, of €400-500 per plate, that the factory charges collectors. “You can’t compare the list price to the public and the price of state orders,” Romane Sarfati, a ceramics expert , told the magazine. “Some will doubtless call this order a waste of public money,” concluded Le Point, noting that most French presidents ordered a new service. “Others will prefer to consider it state support for a heritage industry, and a priceless investment.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/china-crisis-macrons-under-fire-in-france-over-cost-of-new-plates,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/china-crisis-macrons-under-fire-in-france-over-cost-of-new-plates
2018-06-14T15:24:57Z,world,World news,"The Kellogg-Briand pact: world treaty to outlaw war – archive, 1928","In the spring of 1927, the French foreign minister, Aristide Briand, suggested a bilateral nonaggression pact with the US. Taking up the idea, US secretary of state, Frank B. Kellogg, proposed a multilateral treaty signed by all the major powers of the world. The French agreed to this and the Kellogg-Briand pact was signed in 1928, coming into effect on 24 July 1929. Eventually a further 47 nations followed suit, but the agreement had little effect in stopping the rising militarism of the 1930s, and the start of the second world war. Elements of it were later incorporated into the United Nations charter and other treaties.
Editorial: The Signing of the Pact 27 August 1928 Today the flags are flying in Paris in honour of a great event, the German flag among them, and a German minister steps to the table to sign the Pact that outlaws war. Some minds will go back to that day, not 10 years ago, when the pen was forced into the protesting hand of another German minister and a document was laid before him which seemed on every page to wound his pride and crush his hopes for the future of his nation. We talked then of peace, but it was peace at the point of the bayonet; Germany had to sign lest a worse fate should befall her. Today Germany, France, and England meet as equals, constrained by no force but the longing of mankind, to sign the Pact renouncing war. That is a great event, but there is another aspect of today’s proceedings that is not less significant. The Pact is the work of American statesmanship. Mr Kellogg’s signature stands not only for America’s desire for peace but for her readiness to co-operate with Europe. It symbolises her decision to re-enter the distracted world her withdrawal from whose concerns added so much to the difficulties and the dangers of mankind.
Some argue that this is merely a spectacular ceremony, and that it is foolish to build upon it. They ask us to look at realities. These statesmen sign, but what are they saying under their breath? Anybody can talk like a Quaker; but, in hard fact, what concession is any one of these statesmen ready to make for peace? Where will they relax or surrender any privilege or any advantage that helps to maintain their prestige because it stands in the way of universal peace? This mood is natural and, in one sense, it is salutary. No Pact will serve as a substitute for action. However warmly we welcome this demonstration, we must not let our vigilance go to sleep or cease to press for definite constructive and generous measures. Nor is it safe to exclude the Pact itself, and the diplomatic negotiations from which it has emerged in its present form, from criticism. The Pact does not automatically turn the world into a Garden of Eden. It does not even take us automatically out of Bedlam. But it gives statesmanship a new start; it gives mankind a new hope. It is like the League of Nations. Anybody can point out the weaknesses of the League, describe its failures, analyse its vices; but the man who does not see that the creation of the League has put man’s hope for peace and his nobler ambitions on a new basis is blind to the history of human institutions. We can put it in this way: suppose that tomorrow England, France, and Germany had all of them Parliaments that represented their liberal impulses; such a Parliament as we had in 1906 – the Parliament from which South Africa received its freedom. Could not such Parliaments use the League with great and immediate effect? So with the Pact. The Pact may be little or much at any moment; little if Parliaments want little, much so soon as they want much. Let anybody who doubts it put himself in the position into which Lord Grey stepped in 1906 – a world honeycombed with intrigue in which the best man might find his sense of duty bewildered, – and then let him imagine a man of liberal mind taking office in 1929 with the League and the Pact as his sheet-anchors.
But the Pact is not a mere act of policy; it is an act of faith. Nobody, therefore, can measure its effect on the imagination of the world. It is here that politicians, always called on to judge what is before them, most easily go wrong. In the eighteenth century the old world of Europe was shaken by a trumpet sound; the phrase the “Rights of Man.” A cynical observer listening to its ringing echoes might well have said, “Yes; what a delightful and inspiring phrase! What a noble idea! And yet what have the rights of man meant to the great master minds; the men of power who make States or destroy them; who bring happiness or misery, plenty or famine, to the multitudes whose ears are flattered by these phrases? What did they mean to Richelieu or Louis the Fourteenth, to Charles the Twelfth or Frederick the Great? What are they going to mean to Talleyrand or Napoleon?” Good common sense, we may say and yet the man who looks back over the nineteenth century knows how much of its history, good and bad, glorious and terrible, was made by that unsophisticated phrase. Imagination is a force which politicians can not control, and a phrase had set the imagination of mankind on the march. The Pact has stirred the deepest emotion in man’s nature. One of the most moving passages in literature is the speech made by Achilles to Priam who had come to him, broken with grief, to beg for the body of Hector, a speech describing the cruel lot that the gods spin for wretched man, whether his fortune for the moment is good or ill. Whatever politicians may mean by the Pact to the masses of men and women it is the symbol of the most passionate of their hopes; the enemies of yesterday speak beside the dead as Greek and Trojan spoke of their longing for escape from that haunting sense of calamity which made the hour of victory so terrible to Achilles. The Ministers who sign are here today and gone tomorrow; the next generation may not even know their names. But the Pact that outlaws war, like the message that proclaimed the rights of man, has passed far beyond the horizon of their careful plans into that mysterious world which obeys a power that the Richelieus and Napoleons cannot bind.
Mr HG Wells: nationality and peace incompatible – ‘Are we drifting to war?’ 11 July 1929 Mr HG Wells, in a speech broadcast last night through all stations from the BBC headquarters at Savoy Hill, said he proposed to give the gist of the address which he delivered recently in the Reichstag, and he would deal mainly with the question of how far patriotism was compatible with the peace of the world, and how far could we go on being national and patriotic and still keep on the road to an enduring peace for the world. For the last year or so there had been a growing passion for peace demonstrations and peace treaties. The lip service paid to peace was astounding. At times this once sinful planet looked like a grove of olive branches. One could not even open a tattoo without this admonition for peace. But in spite of all this, in spite of the Kellogg Pact, there were indications that something still remained to be done. Among the olive branches, the bayonet still gleamed – thorns we had forgotten to remove.
“I hate to suggest a doubt to my fellow-creatures,” he said, “but did the Governments that signed the Kellogg Pact really mean it when they signed it? Perhaps they did. The human mind is complex. Growing armaments are the dominant factors of the situation. For my own part I think the world is drifting very fast towards another great war, and I think it is doing so because we find extraordinary difficulty in turning our feet towards paths that lead to peace.” People, said Mr Wells, lulled themselves into a false sense of security by following easy paths that seemed to lead away from war, but in fact did nothing of the kind. They humbugged themselves by peace demonstrations that demonstrated nothing. Renunciations of war meant nothing of the slightest practical value until there was some alternative way of settling disputes, and that could only come when the nations were willing to submit themselves to some overruling authority in matters that led to jars between them. In November 1930, the Guardian looked at the practicalities of applying the Kellogg Pact.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2018/jun/14/kellogg-briand-pact-outlaw-war-paris-1928,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2018/jun/14/kellogg-briand-pact-outlaw-war-paris-1928
2018-06-14T15:14:33Z,world,World news,Merkel coalition at risk as talks on refugee policy falter,"Angela Merkel has come under under intense pressure to tighten Germany’s refugee policies or risk the collapse of her coalition government as an increasingly urgent argument over how to handle irregular migration rattles Europe. While the standoff between the chancellor and her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, continued on Thursday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Italy’s new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said they would discuss “new initiatives” on immigration this week in Paris. A day after the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, called on an “axis of the willing” to tackle the EU’s migration impasse, Pope Francis also weighed in to the debate, demanding more international cooperation on refugees and a “change of mindset” from politicians everywhere. Merkel and Seehofer spoke for two-and-a-half hours on Wednesday night without reaching agreement on the hardline interior minister’s demand that refugees who arrive at Germany’s borders should be turned back. The chancellor is said to have urged Seehofer to wait until a 28 June EU summit at which she would seek a Europe-wide agreement. But Seehofer reportedly told her the EU had failed to forge a common policy since the refugee crisis erupted in 2015 and it was hardly credible to think it would do so by the end of the month. A Bundestag session was interrupted for two hours on Thursday morning so Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party the CSU, to which Seehofer belongs, could hold separate emergency meetings. Merkel, the EU’s longest-serving leader, on Wednesday called immigration “a litmus test for Europe” requiring “a truly unified approach”, but amid signs that support for her within the CDU is dwindling on the issue, it has also become a flashpoint for mounting tensions within her own conservative bloc. Italy and France, meanwhile, sought to patch up a worsening diplomatic row over the same question, triggered by Macron’s description of a decision by the Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, to deny a migrant rescue ship access to Italy’s ports as “an act of cynicism and irresponsibility”. Rome summoned France’s ambassador on Wednesday and Salvini, leader of the far-right League party, demanded an apology, but the Elysée palace said on Thursday the French president had “not made any comment intended to offend Italy or the Italian people” and that Paris sought “constructive dialogue”. The row centred on the Aquarius, now on its way to Valencia in Spain with 629 migrants rescued off the coast of Libya last week. The ship, operated by the charity SOS Méditerranée, was turned away by both Italy and Malta. Salvini insisted on Thursday that ships “belonging to foreign organisations and flying foreign flags will not be allowed to dictate Italy’s immigration policy”. More than 1.8 million migrants have arrived in Europe since 2014 and Italy is currently sheltering 170,000 asylum seekers and an estimated 500,000 unregistered migrants. More than 1 million migrants arrived in Germany in the summer of 2015 after Merkel opened the country’s borders. The June summit in Brussels is due to discuss proposals to change the bloc’s asylum laws, which currently require refugees to apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter, generally Italy or Greece. But the bloc is bitterly divided over how to share the burden between southern “frontline” states, northern “destination” countries, and hardline central and east European governments like Hungary and Poland which want nothing to do with any compulsory quota system. In an interview with the Guardian, Spain’s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, a former president of the European parliament, said Europe had to find agreement over the way to take in asylum seekers. “The approach of people asking for asylum in the first country they reach is now manifestly an obsolete rule that doesn’t work.”
Borell warned that because people often do not want to stay in the country they first arrive in, “unless we can find a solution to these problems, Europe’s Schengen system that will collapse”. Speaking at a migration conference at the Vatican, Pope Francis urged countries to work together and “move from considering others as threats to our comfort to valuing them as persons ... who can contribute greatly to the enrichment of our society”. Fallout from the immigration argument could prove most dramatic in Germany, where Seehofer’s CSU faces a state election in October in which it is desperate to stave off the challenge of the anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Party leaders believe the CSU needs to be firm on the emotive immigration issue, opening a potentially damaging rift with Merkel’s CDU and provoking the worst crisis of the veteran chancellor’s fourth-term coalition, which took more than six months to build after inconclusive elections last year. The interior minister’s main demand is that asylum seekers be turned back at the German border if they entered the EU in another country, or have already applied for asylum in Germany and had their applications turned down. Merkel has said it would be illegal for Germany to take such a unilateral step, which would damage attempts to shape a comprehensive EU policy, but reportedly offered a compromise, proposing bilateral agreements with Italy and Greece. Merkel and Seehofer have been increasingly at loggerheads over the refugee issue. Political observers say Merkel may rue the day she gave the nod to Seehofer’s appointment as interior minister. Seehofer’s decision to back out of attending an integration summit in Berlin on Wednesday only increased the tension. He went instead to meet Kurz, after which the two announced a three-way “axis of the willing” between Austria, Germany and Italy to fight illegal immigration. The move was seen as a deliberate shunning of Merkel and an outright rejection of her ideas on migration policy. According to polls, 65% of Germans reject Merkel’s stance on migration and would like to see tighter controls at Germany’s borders.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/merkel-coalition-at-risk-as-talks-on-refugee-policy-falter,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/merkel-coalition-at-risk-as-talks-on-refugee-policy-falter
2018-06-14T14:57:09Z,world,World news,"'Have sex, make babies': Russian MP tells nation to welcome foreign fans","A Russian MP has encouraged Russians to have sex with visiting foreign football fans, a day after Russian authorities were embarrassed when one of his fellow parliamentarians warned against World Cup sexual liaisons. “The more love stories we have connected to the World Cup, the more people from different countries fall in love, the more children are born, the better,” MP Mikhail Degtyaryov said on Thursday, Tass reported. “Many years from now these children will remember that their parents’ love story began during the World Cup in Russia in 2018.” His comments come after MP Tamara Pletnyova, head of the Russian parliament’s committee for families, women and children, said on Wednesday that Russians should avoid sexual relations with foreigners, particularly if they were “of a different race”. “We must give birth to our own children. These [mixed-race] kids suffer and have suffered since Soviet times,” Pletnyova told Govorit Moskva radio station. She was responding to a question about children born after relationships between Russian women and men from Africa, Latin America or Asia formed during the Moscow Olympics in 1980. “It’s one thing if they’re of the same race but quite another if they’re of a different race. I’m not a nationalist, but nevertheless I know that children suffer,” she said. The comments are an embarrassment for Russian authorities, who are trying to present a welcoming and tolerant face to the world as hundreds of thousands of fans descend on the country for the tournament. President Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, distanced the Kremlin from the comments on Thursday. “As for our Russian women, they will make their own judgment,” he said. “They are the best women in the world.” Piara Powar, the head of Fare, an anti-discrimination and social inclusion network, said Pletnyova’s comments were an example of an “arrogant clumsiness” among Russian officials on matters of race and discrimination. Powar said the World Cup could be an opportunity for Russia to become more open to the world. The Russian Football Union’s anti-racism inspector, Alexei Smertin, refused to comment on Pletnyova’s comments, simply saying “No, no, no” and walking away when asked. Smertin, a former player for Chelsea and the Russian national side, was present at the opening of Diversity House, an initiative by Fare to promote diversity in football. “Fans who come here once come back again because they know there is no trouble,” said Smertin. Thousands of fans from across the globe have already arrived in Moscow, chanting and singing in national colours in the city’s central squares ahead of the opening ceremony and first game between Russia and Saudi Arabia. So far the atmosphere has been positive, with no violent incidents reported. Earlier on Thursday, the British rights campaigner Peter Tatchell was detained by police after launching a one-man protest outside Red Square. Tatchell, who was beaten up at a gay pride event in Moscow in 2007, held a placard saying “Putin fails to act against Chechnya torture of gay people.” He was approached by police, who escorted him to a nearby police car and said he was being taken to the nearest police station. “I’m here to protest against the persecution of LGBT people in Russia and also to protest against Fifa for awarding the World Cup to rights abusing countries like Russia and Qatar,” said Tatchell.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/have-sex-make-babies-russian-mp-tells-nation-to-welcome-foreign-fans,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/have-sex-make-babies-russian-mp-tells-nation-to-welcome-foreign-fans
2018-06-14T14:41:47Z,world,World news,"Doxxing, assault, death threats: the new dangers facing US journalists covering extremism","The truth business is becoming more dangerous for many American journalists. Two Sundays ago, the Portland Mercury reporter Kelly Kenoyer, 24, went downtown to cover a violent street protest. It was the first such protest she had worked as a journalist – Kenoyer didn’t begin her career until after the election of Donald Trump. Within minutes, she was being shoved and manhandled by a masked man aligned with the rightwing Patriot Prayer group.
“I got close to record the argument he was having with [a] counter-protester and he stuck his middle finger up in front of the camera,” Kenoyer says, “then shoved me sideways with the same arm.” A bystander intervened on Kenoyer’s behalf, and he in turn was threatened by another Patriot Prayer protester. Then “someone shoved him into me and I fell backwards”, Kenoyer says. Kenoyer was shaken by the incident, but after a few minutes she steeled herself to continue her coverage. Soon after, she narrowly dodged a rock during an exchange of missiles on Portland’s waterfront. Both sides – rightwing activists and leftwing counter-protesters – were hurling stones and bottles, but the rock that hurtled by her came from where the rightwing group was. Kenoyer’s encounters were part of a long afternoon of violent brawling in the streets of downtown Portland. Each side of the protest was mostly concerned with the other, but reporters were frequently caught in the crossfire or even, like Kenoyer, specifically targeted. Other journalists were seen with tears streaming down their faces from pepper spray, or narrowly dodging fists and flying objects. For the most part, they were not beat specialists, but local reporters. In Portland, contentious and violent street protests have become standard fare on local news.
This reflects a broader trend during the Trump era: rightwing groups stage incursions into liberal bastions like Portland, Berkeley and Charlottesville, and anti-fascist groups respond. The ensuing confrontations have resulted in violence, injury and, in Charlottesville, death. These situations are dangerous for everyone, including reporters. Last year, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) recorded 44 physical attacks on journalists in North America. Alexandra Ellerbeck, the CPJ’s North America Program Coordinator, says that “the vast majority” of these attacks occurred during protests. Ellerbeck sees it as part of a sea change in the relationship between political activists and the press in the digital media era.
“You used to be seen as neutral. You used to be seen as useful, because protesters were trying to get their message out. You used to be given some protection,” Ellerbeck says. “Now people can get their own message out through their own platforms. There’s less of an incentive to befriend the media. Journalists can be seen as a threat to protesters’ ability to control narratives,” she says. Ellerbeck also cites the “trickle-down effect” of rhetorical attacks on the media by politicians including Trump. She says that when CPJ counted Trump’s Twitter attacks on the media, they found more than 1,000 between his campaign announcement and January 2018. “There’s been a constant barrage of conspiracy-mongering and hate-mongering towards the press” by the president, Ellerbeck says. She says that harassment of journalists stepped up during Trump’s campaign, peaking just before the election, and has returned in waves ever since. Other politicians have been even more brazen – Republican congressman Greg Gianforte physically assaulted Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs in May of last year. Doxxing and death threats Last year, Kenoyer was also targeted by far-right threats on social media. In her first job at the Eugene Weekly, Kenoyer wrote a feature on antifascist activism in Oregon’s main college town. She sought to understand the impact of antifascist doxxing tactics on rightwing activists – in which private information is published online as part of an intimidation campaign – and tried to speak with a local far-right activist, Jacob Laskey. Laskey was imprisoned in 2007 after attacking a Eugene synagogue and planning violence against witnesses. He was released in 2015, bearing some fresh tattoos. In January 2018 he was jailed again, after an alleged stabbing for which he is now awaiting trial. In his brief time out, he was a prolific social media presence, tweeting, creating YouTube videos featuring far-right themes and billing himself as an “anti-Antifa supremacist”. Anti-fascist groups in Oregon monitored and exposed his activities, including burgeoning connections with other far-right figures and alleged organizing on behalf of the neo-Nazi group American Front. After an abortive interview with Kenoyer last October, Laskey dedicated a number of YouTube videos to attacking her and Eugene Weekly. In one, after ranting about antifa, Laskey says “Fuck Eugene Weekly, Kelly Kenoyers wrote this article”. A subsequent video showed copies of Eugene Weekly being burned by men who Laskey called “patriots”. Eugene Weekly beefed up its security arrangements in the wake of Laskey’s incoherent, but menacing, response. But the singling out of Kenoyer appears to be representative of an increasing tendency on the far right to mobilize online against any critical coverage.
Recently, a significant part of the HuffPost newsroom had their private details released by far-right trolls. This came in the wake of a story by the HuffPost beat reporter Luke O’Brien about a hyperactive Twitter account, @AmyMek, which offers its 231,000 followers a steady diet of anti-Islamic invective and conspiracy theories. The piece says that @AmyMek had been retweeted and promoted by a range of rightwing luminaries, including Trump. O’Brien’s story detailed @AmyMek’s promotion of Islamophobic memes and conspiracy theories. It also exposed the identity of the person behind the account, Amy Mekelburg. In seeking to confirm his story, O’Brien contacted the WWE, the then employer of Mekelburg’s husband, Salvatore Siino. WWE fired Siino before O’Brien’s story was published. Before O’Brien’s story dropped, Mekelburg asked followers to contact HuffPost, which she accused of “viciously harassing” her and “endangering me and my family”. The first tweet in her thread pre-empting the HuffPost story was retweeted 16,000 times. Various rightwingers online felt that O’Brien had “doxxed” Mekelburg by revealing her as @amymek’s author. What followed was a concerted harassment campaign against O’Brien and his colleagues, where he and other journalists were actually doxxed, with their addresses and phone numbers published for the use of far-right trolls. O’Brien’s and others’ details were disseminated on 4chan, Twitter and a neo-Nazi podcast. HuffPost journalists received threats, including death threats, on social media. O’Brien’s Twitter account was itself reported for abusive behavior, and he was briefly suspended. Some tweets were explicit – one of hundreds sent to O’Brien read: “You take my job, I’ll take your life.” Other users tweeted marginally more oblique messages, like images of the Islamic State’s execution of US journalist James Foley. Several HuffPo reporters also got threats over the phone. A voice message instructed a reporter to “kill yourself” before the callers could find them. Another threatened to send people to a reporter’s house so they could be “gang raped or gang murdered”. Meanwhile, writers with connections to mainstream conservatism also appeared to promote the campaign against O’Brien and HuffPost. On the anti-Islam website Jihad Watch, Robert Spencer wrote a column inviting O’Brien to compare his actions to those of Nazi brownshirts, who were part of a movement known for attacking and shutting down what they called the “lying press”. In Spencer’s comments, readers made veiled threats. One wrote, “His victims, perhaps, are better people than he is, but I feel confident that there is someone out there with O’Brien in his sights.” Though previously banned from entering Britain, Spencer is a bestselling author, a regular commentator in conservative media, and last year he delivered a speech at Stanford University. ‘Day of the brick’ The response to O’Brien’s story ballooned into a more generalized campaign of threats against journalists. The so-called “day of the brick” campaign, which ran for about a week from 2 June, mobilised far-right resentment at O’Brien’s reporting, and encouraged people to scale up the threats. First promoted on a rightwing podcast, which foreshadowed O’Brien’s doxxing, the meme was inspired by the racist novel The Turner Diaries, a key text of the far-right movement. The book, which inspired domestic terrorists including Timothy McVeigh, envisages a “day of the rope” where “race traitors”, including journalists, are publicly hanged from lampposts in American cities. On social media and rightwing forums, posts with the #dayofthebrick hashtag depicted shootings and other forms of violence.
As part of that campaign, a number of journalists received emails reading “all journalists will be hanged on the day of the rope”, accompanied by an identikit sketch of the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, altered with a half-face skull mask. The mask is the same kind favored by neo-Nazi groups like Atomwaffen Division. That group is associated with a range of violent crimes, including several murders. One of the reporters who received such an email was Kenoyer. It came just a day after her tangle with the protester in a Portland park. After she tweeted out a screenshot of the email, she says that other reporters got in touch about having received the same email, some from the same email account. As Kenoyer’s experience suggests, the vitriol and threats from the far right are disproportionately targeted at women, and anyone else whose identity departs from the alt-right’s ideal type – white men. Ellerbeck, the CPJ coordinator, says that gender identity, ethnicity and sexual orientation are all factors that affect a reporter’s “risk profile” for attacks. ‘Bullies choose particular targets’ David Neiwert has covered the far right since the 1990s, beginning at newspapers in the Pacific north-west, and continuing now with the Southern Poverty Law Center. He chronicled the long history of the radical right in a recent book. He says that in the rightwing upsurge of the 1990s, threats tended to be more isolated, and rightwing activists then were not staging confrontational protests in urban areas. “It was never like this in the 1990s,” Neiwert says, adding that protests like those in Portland are a more recent innovation. “A lot of the ethos of the current far right is taken from the Tea Party movement, who tried to disrupt anything they saw as a liberal proceeding.” The new willingness to engage in street protests is related to the changing demography of the radical right, Neiwert says.
“In the 1990s they were not recruiting young men, they were mostly going after middle-aged guys. This movement is very much geared towards young men, and the anger that comes with youth.” And young men, he says, are better at using the internet to further their goals and attack their enemies. “The big difference is social media,” Neiwert says. “It’s a tool for harassing people with, and they use it.” Neiwert says that the far right “are bullies, and bullies choose particular targets”. He adds that while he has had equipment interfered with by leftwing protesters in the heat of protests, nothing on the left corresponds with the right’s targeted harassment. He says that ameliorating the heightened danger for journalists might require the profession’s “lone wolves”, like beat journalists and freelance reporters accustomed to working alone, to find ways to ensure one another’s safety. At protests, he says, “it would be helpful for journalists to cooperate to make sure we have each other’s backs”. Kenoyer, meanwhile, says she will continue to cover protests. In the wake of her experience in Portland, her main questions are professional and ethical. “How do I write about being attacked without becoming part of the story?”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/doxxing-assault-death-threats-the-new-dangers-facing-us-journalists-covering-extremism,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/doxxing-assault-death-threats-the-new-dangers-facing-us-journalists-covering-extremism
2018-06-14T13:36:25Z,world,World news,'A victory ride': cyclists to retrace Holocaust evacuees' journey for 80th anniversary,"The last time Paul Alexander was at Harwich port in Essex, he was 19 months old and Europe was braced for war. In Leipzig, in eastern Germany, Alexander’s distraught mother had handed her precious child to a stranger on a train, desperate to save him from the horrors that lay ahead. The Kindertransport carrying young Jewish refugees from Nazi Europe began at the end of 1938. Alexander arrived in Harwich the following July, six weeks before the outbreak of the second world war. Now 80, he has no recollection of the journey. But next week he will retrace it by bicycle with his son and grandson, along with other descendants of Jews who arrived in the UK on a scheme that saved an estimated 10,000 lives.
Forty-two cyclists will leave Berlin on Sunday and arrive in Harwich on a ferry from the Hook of Holland next Friday. There they will begin the final leg of their 600-mile journey to Liverpool Street station in the city of London, where a ceremony will be held in front of a statue depicting young Jewish refugees. The bike ride, organised by World Jewish Relief, is to commemorate the 80th anniversary later this year of the first Kindertransport to arrive in the UK. In the days after Kristallnacht, a pogrom against Jews in Nazi Germany in November 1938, Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister, agreed to the temporary admission of unaccompanied, mostly Jewish, children from Germany and elsewhere. They were placed in foster homes, schools, hostels and farms, and many were the only members of their families to survive the Holocaust. Among those saved was Alf Dubs, later a Labour MP and now a peer, who in recent years has campaigned for the UK to admit unaccompanied refugees from Syria and other conflict zones.
Alexander said: “For me, this is a sort of victory ride. A victory in the sense that I survived and I’ve had a good life. I came out of the Nazi terror to freedom and safety, and to me this is a victory.” In 1938, his father was taken to Buchenwald concentration camp, and his mother – who had already lost two babies in childbirth – took the “terribly, terribly difficult decision” to send her only child to safety. “She must have thought, ‘I have to do whatever I can to save this boy’. She put me on a train not knowing if she’d ever see me again. It’s hard to imagine what was going through her head,” said Alexander. He was taken to a home for refugee children near London. Meanwhile, his father was released from Buchenwald on condition he left Germany. He went to the UK, where he was interned in a camp. His mother also made it to England, arriving destitute on 1 September 1939, the day war commenced. The family was reunited when Alexander was four or five, and eventually settled in Leeds. Alexander, who has three children and nine grandchildren, later moved to Israel. Later this month, he will meet the Duke of Cambridge on the first official visit by a member of the royal family to Israel and Palestine. The octogenarian will be cycling with his son, Nadav, and 14-year-old grandson, Daniel, with his wife travelling in a support vehicle. “I’m determined to do it. I’m very active – swimming, tennis, cycling – and I’ve been training. I think I’m capable, and it’s going to be an awesome experience.”
Ian Goldsmith, 56, another cyclist, only discovered his full family history when he applied for a German passport last year in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum. He found out his father Saloman, then 13, and uncle Bruno, 12, were on the first Kindertransport that arrived in Harwich in December 1938. The boys’ mother had died of breast cancer, and their father was later killed in a death camp. Saloman, who died in 1977, “never spoke about his background, and I never asked”, said Goldsmith. “The only inkling I had was that he made me watch a documentary about the Holocaust when I was about 10.” The brothers were the only ones of 14 cousins, aunts and uncles to survive the Nazi persecution.
Phil Harris is making the 600-mile ride in memory of his grandmother, Ilse, who arrived in Britain with one small suitcase at the age of 16 – one of the oldest children saved by the Kindertransport. “I guess [her parents] assumed it would only be a short time until they saw her again,” said Harris, 34. Both were killed in Auschwitz. “Granny never talked about it. My mum only knew the bare bones of the story.” The night before setting off, Harris will sleep in his grandmother’s former family home in Berlin, now marked with a stolpersteine, a brass plaque in the ground commemorating Nazi victims. “I thought it would be a nice touch to start this journey from the point where Granny started her journey,” he said. World Jewish Relief, set up in 1933, helped find homes in the UK for Jewish refugee children, and has continued to provide humanitarian relief around the world. The bike ride was “a tribute to the amazing life-saving work of our predecessors and to the people who they saved. Tens of thousands of people would not be alive today were it not for their heroism,” said Rafi Cooper of WJR.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/a-victory-ride-cyclists-to-retrace-holocaust-evacuees-journey-for-80th-anniversary,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/a-victory-ride-cyclists-to-retrace-holocaust-evacuees-journey-for-80th-anniversary
2018-06-14T12:41:13Z,world,World news,Canadian citizen held for months after border agents dismiss papers as fake,"A Canadian man is suing the country’s government after he was arrested by border agents and detained for eight months – despite producing evidence of his citizenship. Olajide Ogunye, 47, is seeking $10m in compensation from the Canadian government after he spent months incarcerated in what his lawyer has described as a “profoundly disturbing” case of mistaken identity. Ogunye was approached by border agents and detained outside his Toronto home in June 2016, even though he produced citizenship papers and a government-issued health card.
The agents disputed the validity of the documents and brought him to a detention facility near Toronto Pearson airport, where they fingerprinted him and alleged his prints matched those of a fraudulent refugee claimant who was deported to Nigeria in the 1990s. “It is shocking,” said Adam Hummel, Ogunye’s lawyer. “Even people who are having their citizenship revoked … are not detained like this.” The results of the fingerprint analysis – which Hummel says were never shown to his client – were contradicted by numerous sworn affidavits by friends and neighbours who had known Ogunye for years. Ogunye, who immigrated to Canada from Nigeria with his family and became a citizen in 1996, was moved between Maplehurst correctional facility and Central East correctional centre. Near-constant security lockdowns – a problem plaguing prisons and jails throughout the country – prevented him from making contact with family members. Traumatized by his detention, he was placed on suicide watch. “One time, for the whole month, I was crying nonstop. I was crying continuously,” he told the CBC. “The nurse had to give me depression pills to make me calm down.” Ogunye was released in February 2017. Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) alleged fraud and impersonation by Ogunye as justification for his detention. CBSA said in a statement that it had received Ogunye’s claim and was reviewing the matter, but that it would be “inappropriate” to comment further. Targeted arrests, like the one that ensnared Ogunye, are common for clearing a backlog of immigration violations, said a number of lawyers working in immigration and refugee law. But the arrest of a Canadian citizen by border guards was nearly unheard of, said Max Chaudhary, a Toronto-based immigration lawyer. “That’s simply not what [border] officers do. Their mandate is not with Canadian citizens.”
Chaudhary speculated that if border officials believed Ogunye was a foreign national or permanent resident violating immigration laws, it could explain the duration of the detention – and the slow pace in which investigation unfolded. “It seems quite incredible there could be a case of mistaken identity that could not have been cleared up in a faster amount of time, having this person deprived of his liberty for eight months,” he said. Ogunye’s case was indicative of a broken system, said Lorne Waldman, a professor of immigration law at Osgoode Hall. Despite years of lobbying for oversight of the agency’s conduct – and assurances from the public safety minister, Ralph Gooddale, that such mechanisms would be put in place – Wadlman said no progress has been made “Because there’s no oversight, there’s nobody who reviews the conduct of CBSA officers and this matter was allowed to drag on for months and months. It’s extremely unacceptable.” Hummel and his client charge that the government breached Ogunye’s constitutional rights; he filed the case in Ontario superior court on 30 May. “The very fact that this happened, someone who was approached and showed he was a Canadian citizen, means that it could happen to anyone if this is how [border agents] are operating,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/canadian-citizen-sues-government-detention,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/canadian-citizen-sues-government-detention
2018-06-14T11:04:10Z,world,World news,Italian groping case dropped because alleged victim was 'too old to be scared',"Italian prosecutors dropped a sexual harassment case against a former head of the country’s football federation in part because they thought the woman who made the complaint was old enough not to be intimidated, it can be revealed. A report by prosecutors in Rome, compiled earlier this year and obtained by the Guardian, said the allegations of harassment and groping against Carlo Tavecchio were likely to be accurate, but that the case was not pursued because it had been reported too late to authorities. However, the prosecutors outlined further reasons for their decision not to pursue the allegations against Tavecchio, made by Elisabetta Cortani, the president of the Lazio Women’s football club, who was 50 at the time. The report said that Cortani’s age and the fact she had dealt with Tavecchio in the past, meant she would not have been in a state of fear or subjugation. Tavecchio’s controversial tenure as head of Italy’s football federation ended in November. He resigned after the men’s national team – four-time winners of the World Cup – failed to qualify for this year’s tournament. Tavecchio had also been frequently criticised for a series of racist remarks. According to the prosecutors’ report, Cortani’s complaint, filed on 24 November 2017, was based on two incidents reported to authorities.. Tavecchio has denied that the incidents occurred. In one allegation, Cortani describes going to Tavecchio’s office in May 2015 to ask him about some sports clubs joining the football federation. According to Cortani, Tavecchio approached and began touching her breasts and said: ‘You look good! You have great tits there!’ while trying to kiss her on her lips. Cortani, the report alleged, said she was shocked by his behaviour, pretended to ignore him, and left the room. In August 2016, Cortani wore a hidden camera to a meeting with Tavecchio about a team’s application to a regional championship. According to the complaint, Tavecchio, closed the door behind him and began talking to her in a vulgar way, using an expletive to ask whether she had a lot of sex. He tried to push her on the couch and began kissing her, Cortani said, and began to grope her breasts; this action turned the camera off, though the audio continued. She wriggled away from him. Cortani told the Guardian: “Italian women are sometimes afraid to press charges, but I want tell all the women out there in Italy that it is always worth it. No matter if you are believed or not, we need to to demand respect. We need to fight! I hadn’t spoken until now because I believe in justice….Maybe I am old for them, and I could have defended myself. But I can assure that I felt in a position of inferiority, I felt afraid. Because being in that room meant being in the heart of Italian football. And in that room inferiority and fear have no age.” Her lawyer, Domenico Mariani, said he would file an objection to the prosecutor’s request to dismiss the complaint. “Too many things are not clear in the result of their investigation,’’ he said. Vittoria Pisa, Tavecchio’s lawyer, said Tavecchio knew about the prosecutor’s motion to dismiss the complaint and had always denied the accusations. In 2014, Tavecchio was suspended for six months by Uefa for a racist comment made during his election campaign; the comment referred to bananas when discussing the presence of foreign players in Italy. In 2017, Tavecchio floated the idea that football stadiums could be used as lap dancing venues.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/italy-groping-case-carlo-tavecchio-prosecutors-report,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/italy-groping-case-carlo-tavecchio-prosecutors-report
2018-06-14T09:47:43Z,world,World news,Donald Trump shrugs off Kim's human rights record: 'He's a tough guy',"Donald Trump has dismissed concerns about the widely condemned human rights record of the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, praising him as a “tough guy”, a “smart guy” and a “great negotiator”. In an interview with Bret Baier of Fox News as he was leaving Singapore following the denuclearization summit with the North Korean leader, Trump declined to condemn the record of his interlocutor. International bodies have accused Kim of crimes against humanity including assassinations of political rivals, public executions and holding captive tens of thousands of political prisoners. Speaking in a wood-paneled office aboard Air Force One, Baier put it to the US president that Kim was “a killer. He’s executing people.”
Trump replied by praising Kim as a “tough guy. Hey, when you take over a country, tough country, with tough people, and you take it over from your father, I don’t care who you are, what you are, how much of an advantage you have – if you can do that at 27 years old, that’s one in 10,000 could do that.” Trump went on: “So he’s a very smart guy, he’s a great negotiator and I think we understand each other.” Baier, sounding taken aback by the president’s flippant response, pressed Trump on the issue: “But he’s still done some really bad things.” To which Trump said: “Yeah, but so have a lot of other people done some really bad things. I could go through a lot of nations where a lot of bad things were done.” Trump’s failure to condemn one of the worst human rights records on the world stage is certain to inflame criticism that is already being leveled at him from both Democrats and Republicans in the wake of the summit. The presidential center of the former Republican president George W Bush has been tweeting about North Korea’s abuses, giving a clear indication of how he views the matter. Other public figures have been more directly critical. A Democratic senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said of the outcome of the Singapore summit: “Kim’s gulags, public executions, planned starvation, are legitimized on the world stage … What the hell?” The issue of human rights was notably absent from the joint statement signed by Trump and Kim at their five-hour summit on Tuesday. Nor has there been any mention of human rights in the early discussions about follow-up meetings between the Trump administration and the North Korean regime.
Among the outrages that could be put on the agenda are the up to 120,000 political prisoners that are thought to be held in four political prison camps in North Korea. A UN inquiry accused the regime of “systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations” rising frequently to the level of crimes against humanity. The UN added: “These are not mere excesses of the state; they are essential components of a political system that has moved far from the ideals on which it claims to be founded. The gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world.” North Korea under Kim amounted, the UN concluded, to a totalitarian regime that “seeks to dominate every aspect of its citizens’ lives and terrorizes them from within”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-fox-news-human-rights,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-fox-news-human-rights

2018-06-14T07:01:40Z,world,World news,Indigenous Chileans defend their land against loggers with radical tactics,"It is late autumn in southern Chile, and in the region of Araucanía, the leaves have turned copper and gold. But on the road to the mist-shrouded town of Lumaco, the hills are covered with rows of charred pines. “We burned these forests as an act of legitimate resistance against the extractive industries that have oppressed the Mapuche people,” says Hector Llaitul. “If we make their business unprofitable they move on, allowing us to recover our devastated lands and rebuild our world.”
This year has already turned out to have been a particularly combustible one in a decade of rising attacks by indigenous Mapuche activists against the Chilean state and big business. Over several few days in April, crops were burned, roads were blocked and 16 forestry vehicles were set ablaze outside of the regional capital, Temuco. Such actions have become more and more common. According to statistics published by a local business association, there were 43 attacks in the region in 2017, mainly arson attacks against logging firms. “Anyone who hasn’t been in the Chilean forest doesn’t know this planet,” wrote Pablo Neruda, who grew up in the region – and whose verse was inspired by its wild landscapes, and the indomitable spirit of its native people who were only conquered after Chilean military campaigns in the late 19th century. Today, however, much of the west of the region would be unrecognizable to Chile’s finest poet. In the last 50 years, monoculture pine and eucalyptus plantations have replaced the biodiversity of the original forests. Meanwhile, Mapuche groups have become increasingly aggressive in their efforts to reclaim ancestral lands and gain political autonomy. Llaitul is a spokesman for the Coordinadora Arauco-Malleco (CAM), an anti-capitalist organization that uses direct action and sabotage tactics. The group has also demanded the release of the shaman Celestino Cordova, who was convicted in February 2014 for an arson attack on a farmhouse north of Temuco that resulted in the deaths of an elderly couple, Werner Luchsinger and Vivianne Mackay.
Cordova began a hunger strike in January after officials denied his request to complete a religious ceremony outside of the prison. He temporarily suspended the strike in April to negotiate. “The government practices and respects Catholicism but it discriminates against Mapuche spiritual beliefs,” he said from a hospital bed, guarded by police officers. “The Mapuche have been impoverished spiritually, culturally and economically by Chile. I’m willing to sacrifice my life for my people.”
But Cordova’s conviction in the high-profile Luchsinger-Mackay case has made it tougher to win public sympathy for his cause, said Nicolas Rojas Pedemonte, a professor at Alberto Hurtado University in Santiago and author of a new book on the Mapuche conflict. “That case was an inflection point for the conflict,” he said. “It was the first fatal attack, it turned Chilean media against the Mapuche and was used by the state as a Trojan horse for a repressive response.” Police presence has since been heavily increased in Araucanía leading to the militarization of the region and increasingly indiscriminate targeting of indigenous people, according to Rojas. In January 2017, charges against several Mapuche – including Llaitul – were dropped after it was revealed that police had used manipulated WhatsApp messages as evidence in arson cases. “I don’t even use WhatsApp,” says Llaitul, brandishing a tiny Nokia. The Luchsinger-Mackay case was also the first sign of a split in Mapuche activist ranks. A new more radical group – know as the Weichan Auka Mapu (the Struggle of the Rebel Territory, WAM) – emerged, adopting an explicitly anti-Chilean stance and the tactic of burning churches – most recently during the Pope’s January visit to the region.
Llaitul says the CAM rejects the targeting of individuals and that direct action against forestry projects is the first stage towards reclaiming the land for Mapuche settlements. On a former timber reserve overlooking Lumaco, his vision is being put into action. The logging firm, Arauco, abandoned the project following repeated arson attacks and today, in a small clearing, a dozen young men and women are hammering timbers together on the construction of a house in the woods. A Mapuche red, blue and green flag flaps from the apex.
“When we recover lands we plant crops, breed animals and reconstruct our cultural world,” says Llaitul. “We will build houses but our first priority is a spiritual centre, the rewe.” The rightwing government of the current president, Sebastián Piñera, has a different vistion for the future of Araucanía, the region with the worst poverty and unemployment rates in the country. Ministers visited Temuco in April to finalize plans for a major growth plan for the region, focusing on tourism, agriculture and energy investments and training programs to allow the 150,000 hectares of land turned over to Mapuche groups in recent years to return to production.
The plan, to be launched in August, is also expected to increase the purchase of private lands by the national indigenous development agency. “People in Araucanía are calling out for peace and development. Over the years so much investment has been turned away due to security fears,” says Luis Mayol, the Santiago-appointed administrator of Araucanía. “Piñera won 63% of the vote in this region – the Mapuche people want growth like everyone else. However, there is a small number of terrorists with radical ideologies and the resources to generate fear.” While the development plan aims to win the support of Araucanías indigenous groups, accompanying amendments to the anti-terrorism law aim to make it easier to convict arsonists under terrorism charges. “Our current legislation is quite useless: too many violent acts are being processed as regular crimes,” says Mayol. “We need to bring our definition of terrorism in line with those of countries such as the UK and Spain. For me, the systematic burning of trucks and churches are terrorist acts.” Back at the reclaimed timber plantation, Llaitul remains defiant as two young Mapuche lift roof rafters into place on the new construction. “When there was no Mapuche struggle, the government did nothing for us” he says. “We’re not asking for palliative measures or integration, we want territory and autonomy for the Mapuche nation.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/chile-mapuche-indigenous-arson-radical-environmental-protest,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/chile-mapuche-indigenous-arson-radical-environmental-protest
2018-06-14T06:00:40Z,world,World news,Nicaragua protest leaders call 24-hour strike to oust Daniel Ortega,"Protest leaders have stepped up their campaign to force Nicaragua’s embattled president, Daniel Ortega, from office and halt a wave of deadly repression with a 24-hour nationwide strike designed to tighten the economic screws on the one-time revolutionary hero. Student leader Valeska Valle said the stoppage – which began at midnight on Wednesday and is being led by a “civil alliance” of Ortega critics including students, religious leaders and business people – was intended to hasten “the peaceful exit” of the president and his unpopular wife and vice-president, Rosario Murillo. “This strike is about our future and we know the people will support it,” said Valle, 22, who has emerged as one of Nicaragua’s most prominent student leaders since anti-government protests erupted on 18 April. “We know the national strike will not be decisive in overthrowing this regime,” Valle added. “But it is a way of applying pressure” to end the “massacre” she accused Ortega’s “oppressive” government of perpetrating on protesters.
Human rights activists say at least 148 people have been killed since the unrest began in April, many gunned down by security forces or masked members of shadowy paramilitary gangs. Campesino leader Medardo Mairena told the opposition news group Confidencial the strike would heap more pressure on Ortega: “The people no longer want him in power.” As the strike took hold on Thursday, the streets of Nicaragua’s capital Managua and other cities were all but deserted. Activists around the country tweeted pictures of empty streets.
The current unrest – which has prompted the British government to warn against all but essential travel to the country – started as a student-led protest against controversial pension reforms Ortega later scrapped. But it has since expanded into a nationwide revolt against the 72-year-old Sandinista. Nicaragua’s capital, Managua, is now decked in graffiti maligning a man once feted by the global left for his David versus Goliath cold war struggle with Washington. Several towns, including the one-time Sandinista stronghold of Masaya, are in a state of almost total paralysis, with masked rebels erecting roadblocks known as tranques and driving out authorities.
Ortega, who was democratically elected in 2006 but is accused of an increasingly authoritarian rule, has ignored calls to step down or bring forward elections scheduled for 2021. Enrique Bolaños, Ortega’s predecessor as president and a longstanding political rival, told the Guardian he suspected his successor was clinging to power for fear of being prosecuted for killings committed by security forces and paramilitary gangs. “So he must be like Ceaușescu in Romania or like Maduro in Venezuela and do everything to stay in power because the worst thing [he] can do is quit,” said Bolaños, Nicaragua’s president from 2002 to 2007. “Say you are Ortega, what would you do?” Bolaños added. “[Be] like Anne Boleyn [and] put [your] head on the guillotine? … He’s not an idiot.” Ortega’s government has refused to accept responsibility for the mounting body count blaming the bloodshed on “criminals”. On Tuesday Murillo conceded Nicaragua was experiencing “difficult times” and called on God to stop the violence, according to El 19, a state-controlled newspaper. Catholic leaders, who are part of the coalition to remove Ortega, said it was the president who now needed to act to prevent civil war. “He should now think about how he might go down in Nicaraguan history,” said Bishop Rolando Álvarez.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/nicaragua-strike-protest-ortega-latest,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/nicaragua-strike-protest-ortega-latest
2018-06-14T05:21:40Z,world,World news,Thursday briefing: Corbyn feels brunt of Brexit rebellion,"Top story: Amendments fall as EEA vote divides Labour Hello – it’s Warren Murray with you on this Thursday morning as World Cup fever takes hold. Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership has been rocked by dozens of Labour MPs breaking ranks to vote either for or against keeping Britain in the European economic area (EEA). Ninety voted, when all the party’s MPs had been whipped to abstain. One frontbencher and five parliamentary aides resigned from the shadow cabinet before the vote. Theresa May, meanwhile, largely succeeded in defeating a string of amendments to her Brexit bill. But she ended the day locked in negotiations with rebel Tories led by Dominic Grieve who want to guarantee that a hard, crash-out Brexit will be impossible without parliamentary approval. They thought they already had that commitment from the PM until No 10 appeared to backpedal. Here is how the votes stacked up on a pivotal day in the Commons. The government is expected to table a compromise amendment today on the “meaningful vote” for parliament, which peers will vote on when the bill returns to the Lords on Monday. In Brussels, a bitter row continues over the Galileo satellite navigation programme. EU member states have voted to shut British companies out of the project despite UK taxpayers having already contributed £1bn towards it. And there is more than a little irony to the news that Jacob Rees-Mogg’s investment firm Somerset Capital Management is warning prospective clients about the financial risks associated with Brexit – when he has repeatedly dismissed such concerns.

Over the next five weeks the greatest show on Earth will again demonstrate its power to enthral – kicking aside Fifa’s tarnished reputation and the murkiness of Putin’s regime, writes Barney Ronay. The build-up to tonight’s opening ceremony and first match has had its share of drama. Spain’s squad was plunged into crisis after the coach Julen Lopetegui was sacked two days before their opening game against Portugal, with director of football Fernando Hierro named as his replacement. A heady cocktail of anger and ethics was at the heart of the decision, writes Sid Lowe. And Travis Tygart, the US Anti-Doping Agency chief executive, has warned that it would be “naive” not to think that hosts Russia could violate the rules again during the tournament. Strap yourselves in for the kick-off … * * * ‘A tough, smart guy’ – He is not the first western leader to break bread with a tyrant but few could match Donald Trump in waving away the ethical qualms. “So have a lot of other people done some really bad things,” said the US president, when asked about Kim Jong-un’s human rights record. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has lost his temper when asked why the statement signed by Trump and Kim in Singapore about disarmament did not contain words such as “verifiable” and “irreversible” that the Trump administration had stuck to doggedly beforehand. “Don’t say silly things,” Pompeo snapped at reporters during a tirade against what he called “insulting and ridiculous and, frankly, ludicrous” questions, despite similar questions being raised by observers and analysts worldwide. * * * What’s in a name? Macedonia’s president has refused to endorse changing the country’s name to the Republic of North Macedonia. In Greece, the government is being threatened with a vote of no confidence after the plan to end a bitter geographical and cultural dispute was attacked on both sides of the border. Officials in Brussels, London and Washington had all enthusiastically welcomed the deal, but for the two parties concerned, any conciliation lasted only a day. Macedonians are supposed to vote on the name change in a referendum this year. * * * ‘Like coming back to life’ – An Italian politician forced to hide from the mafia for years has revealed her face publicly for the first time since 1993.
Piera Aiello went into witness protection after mafia hitmen killed her husband in 1991.

Lunchtime read: A year after Grenfell, where do we stand? It is a year today since the Grenfell Tower fire. Eleven housing blocks have new cladding, out of more than 300 that need their flammable panels replaced. Almost 1,000 adults have been screened for PTSD, while psychologists continue to work with affected children at seven state schools.
Fifteen Grenfell households are still living in hotels. The public inquiry continues. And, in perhaps the most startling fact rounded up by Robert Booth and Owen Bowcott, combustible cladding remains on sale in Britain. Sport England won the first one-day international against Australia by three wickets but they did so messily, in a manner hardly befitting the side ranked No 1 in the world. Afterwards, Australia’s former coach Darren Lehmann staked out the moral high ground after some wiseacre investment company tried to stoke things up by handing out squares of sandpaper outside the ground. In the women’s game, New Zealand’s Amelia Kerr hit a world record 232 not out in the third one-day international against Ireland and then took five wickets to complete a remarkable day for the 17-year-old. The US Open gets under way today with Americans seeking to maintain a run in which they hold every men’s major and significant transatlantic team trophy. Anthony Martial wants to leave Manchester United, according to his agent. And one of the most anticipated fights of the year appears to be back on after it was announced Canelo Álvarez will fight Gennady Golovkin on 15 September. Business The decision by the US Federal Reserve to raise its base rate to 2% helped send Asian shares down overnight. The move was telegraphed for several months so there was more concern among investors about chairman Jerome Powell’s concerns regarding deteriorating trade relations between the US and Europe and Asia. Closer to home the FTSE 100 is expected to slip 0.4% at the open. The pound is buying $1.339 and €1.134. The papers The Guardian has Brexit on the front page – “New fissure with EU as Britain blocked from security project” – as well as a feature about life a year after the Grenfell tragedy. The Mail wonders what Tory MP Dominic Grieve is doing addressing a meeting of people allegedly plotting to reverse Brexit, under the headline “Conspiracy in Smith Square”.
“Web giants ‘are fuelling child mental health crisis’,” says the Times, quoting the head of the NHS. By the Briefing’s count this is the third separate front-page story this week about the impact of the internet on children. The Telegraph also has the NHS chief’s comments on the front but leads with Sajid Javid relaxing the visa cap: “Doors open to thousands more skilled migrants.” The Sun splashes with “Brit held over jet secrets to China”, saying a former “Rolls-Royce boffin” has been arrested based on MI5 intelligence. “Trapped in hospital for six months” is the splash in the Express – it says the NHS will not allow a terminally ill pensioner home because it does not want to pay for carers.

2018-06-14T04:27:36Z,world,World news,"Credit cards, but no sake: Japan lowers age of adulthood from 20 to 18","Japan has lowered the age of adulthood from 20 to 18, but young people who reach the milestone when the change goes into effect in 2022 won’t be able to celebrate with a few glasses of sake. At least not legally. The revision to the civil code, the first of its kind for more than 140 years, will allow all 18-year-olds to marry without their parents’ consent. Currently, men aged 18 and women aged 16 can marry, but only with the permission of both sets of parents. They will also be able to apply for credit cards and loans, and obtain a passport valid for 10 years. Transgender men and women over 18 will be able to apply to courts to have their gender officially recognised.
But the newly recognised adults will indulge in some rites of passage at their own risk: they will still have to wait until they are 20 to drink, smoke and bet on Japan’s four legalised forms of gambling: horse, bicycle, motorcycle and motorboat races. The change has created confusion over the annual Coming of age day, when men and women who have turned 20 during the previous 12 months put on their finest kimono, attend ceremonies and celebrate with their first legal drink. Local media reported on concerns over the effect the new law could have on Japan’s already ailing kimono industry if ceremonies are held for those who have turned 18 rather than 20. The coming of age celebration, held on the second Monday of January, falls around the time that many 18-year-olds are cramming for university entrance exams. Hidemitsu Miyamoto, the president of a kimono shop, was among those who feared teenagers would be too preoccupied with their academic futures to attend the ceremony, meaning they won’t need to rent or buy one of the expensive garments. “The coming of age ceremony has been something of a final stronghold for our industry’s survival at a time when fewer and fewer people wear kimono, presenting what is perhaps the only opportunity for young people, especially women, to wear the attire,” Miyamoto told the Japan Times. The change in the law, first suggested by the justice ministry in 2009, is intended to encourage young people’s participation in society and the economy, especially in light of the growing number of people aged 65 and over. Japan lowered the voting age from 20 to 18 in 2015, giving 2.4 million teenagers the right to vote in upper house elections the following year.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/japan-lowers-age-adulthood-20-to-18,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/japan-lowers-age-adulthood-20-to-18
2018-06-14T04:00:37Z,world,World news,How the #MeToo movement came to Mongolia,"A year ago, Saranzaya Chambuu received a distressed phone call from her sister Naranzaya. Their roommate had brought a male friend home the night before. When she left for work, he stayed. Hours later, Naranzaya called her elder sister. “She was crying and asking: ‘Who was that man? He raped me and then he left.’” That man, they would soon learn, was a ruling party MP, Gantulga Dorjdugar, who is now under investigation. He says he has been wrongly accused and the two “mutually consented” to having sex.
It is one of the most high-profile political scandals in Mongolia in years, and highlights both the progress and the challenges in a nascent but growing women’s rights movement. Saranzaya, 32, is one of a small but increasingly bold group of women calling on their country to tackle pervasive sexual violence. For some, this is the beginning of Mongolia’s #MeToo movement, though weak laws and a culture of victim-blaming mean it has a long way to go. “Some people ask why don’t we stop and why are we fighting for this,” Saranzaya said. “We want to make a path for other women. If this can win in court and they can bring justice to victims, we can prove the system is just and that will help other victims.” According to Mongolia’s first nation-wide survey on gender-based violence, released on Thursday by the national statistics office and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), 31% of women say they have been subjected to sexual or physical violence by their partner. One in seven women (14%) say they have been subjected to sexual violence by someone who was not their partner – a figure twice as high as the estimated world average and higher than almost anywhere else in Asia, according to Henriette Jansen, a UNFPA adviser. “In Mongolia there is huge variation in proportions of women experiencing non-partner sexual violence throughout the country. It is everywhere and sexual abuse against women is quite alarming compared with the rest of the region,” said Jansen.
But a backlash is building. In March a group of women knitted hundreds of red pussyhats and wore them to a protest against violence in the capital on International Women’s Day. In May a women’s group held a performance of the Vagina Monologues, translated into Mongolian. In 2016, after years of lobbying by activists and female lawmakers, the country made domestic violence a crime for the first time. Now a consortium of NGOs is pushing for sexual harassment in the workplace to be included in the country’s labour laws. Sexual assault or abuse below the level of rape is handled by the country’s human rights commission, which can only make recommendations. Justice delayed While awareness is increasing, justice is still rare. Naranzaya’s case stalled at first when two doctors who first examined her took a leave of absence and then were replaced. The case was reopened in August after Naranzaya’s family provided items – underwear and a duvet – found to have traces of Gantulga’s semen. Gantulga, whose lawyer did not respond to requests for comment, has repeated his client’s assertion of innocence. The national survey found that only 10% of women who said they had experienced “severe sexual violence”, including rape, from someone who was not their partner, said they reported their case to the police. A separate survey of 300 rape victims by the Gender Equality Centre found that about 65% of reported assaults went to trial. Just 9.5% of victims polled said they had received compensation. Police data shows victims get on average 804,854 tugrik – about £250. Women who speak out are often blamed. Late last year Bolor Zaankhuu, 33, published her own #MeToo account. Fifteen years ago, while taking an elevator up to her fourth-floor apartment, a man grabbed her from behind and groped her, she wrote in a blog. She struggled until the elevator doors opened and she ran out and down the stairs to the ground floor. When she went to the police with her father, she recalled, she was reprimanded for wearing a tank top. It was the middle of summer.
“Immediately I was blamed,” she said. Bolor later identified her attacker, who spent one night at the police station before being let go. Now, she said, she waits to take elevators until no men are around and she doesn’t allow her 10-year-old daughter to go anywhere alone. A woman who lives and works in Ulaanbaatar said that on one occasion four years ago she woke up in a hotel to find a man raping her. Later when she filed a police report alleging she had been drugged and assaulted, the investigator said she was not likely to get compensation and encouraged her to drop the case. Eventually she did. “I don’t feel bad about it any more. At least, I want to shake that mindset. Women feel guilty. Because they got drunk or because they went to that party, they blame themselves … that if I hadn’t been wearing this or that, then this wouldn’t have happened,” she told the Guardian, asking that her name not be published. Women have contacted Saranzaya to say they too have been victims of sexual assault, but no one has joined her campaign. The sisters have been called prostitutes and liars. Others say Saranzaya is using her sister to try to extort money from the MP. Even women’s rights groups have stayed away after critics accused Saranzaya of being politically motivated. Hospital shelter Researchers and advocates are worried not just about the extent of sexual violence in Mongolia but the severity of it. The survey found 72% of women who said they had been injured by their partners reported “severe” harm such as broken bones, cuts to the head and in some cases miscarriages. Researchers found forms of abuse particular to Mongolia: hundreds of women reported being chased by their partners in cars, on motorcycles or horses, or being lashed with whips. The number of people reporting abuse is growing, a statistic that could mean more people are willing to do so, or abuse is on the rise, or some combination of the two. At the One Stop Service Centre, a small office and room with bunkbeds at Ulaanbaatar’s main trauma hospital, abused women can shelter with their children for up to 72 hours and seek medical help, therapy and legal advice. Deedentsetseg Chuluunbayar, a social worker at the centre, said that in 2008, the first year it was open, it received around 300 women. Last year the number was 960, despite the centre closing for a month, and now it gets at least eight women a day. On payday and public holidays, more women come to the hospital with injuries. On 18 March, Soldier’s Day in Mongolia, 15 women came to the centre.
Deedentsetseg said Mongolia’s new domestic violence law could lead to fewer women reporting abusive partners. In the past, women reported their husbands to the police to scare them, and then they would drop the case. Under the new law, domestic violence cases have to go forward to trial. “It’s really a difficult situation because most of the women who come here don’t want to disrupt the family and are dependent on their husbands,” Deedentsetseg said. ‘Reverse gender gap’ It is unclear why sexual violence is apparently so prevalent in Mongolia, a middle-income country that prides itself on its peaceful transition from a former Soviet satellite to a democracy in 1990. Some blame a macho culture, while others point to a “reverse gender gap”. For years after the transition, families invested more of their resources in sending their daughters to school and kept their sons home to herd. Mongolian women now outpace men in education, health and work. Men have higher rates of unemployment and alcoholism, and their average lifespan is 10 years shorter than that of women. “Men’s reputation has fallen. These things can be a reason why more men are angry with women, which leads to violence,” said Boldbaatar Tumur, head of the Men’s Association in Gobisumber province, which works on raising awareness of men’s issues. Others say Mongolia’s close-knit rural communities encourage a culture of silence. “Very few people can say ‘me too’,” said Oyungerel Tsedevdamba, a former MP who pushed for the law criminalising domestic violence. “In the countryside there is no anonymity, and because of that no one wants to speak out.” Gerelee Odonchimed, vice-director for education and advocacy at Women for Change, a women’s empowerment group, said Mongolia’s women rights movement needed more patience. “It can be slow but, yes, time is up,” she said. “We aren’t talking about changing the colours of the walls. We are talking about changing people’s minds.” Saranzaya and Naranzaya are also taking things slowly. They have moved into a new apartment and Naranzaya, 26, is back at school, studying to become a teacher. “She’s starting to feel OK again,” Saranzaya said of her sister. This week Gantulga, the accused MP, resigned from parliament. Saranzaya has noticed that when the case is in the news again, her sister slips back into a depression. She has wondered whether they ought to drop the case and move on with their lives. “I said if it’s too difficult we can stop, but she says no, we will fight together.” Additional reporting by Munkhchimeg Davaasharav • This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

2018-06-14T02:20:05Z,world,World news,New Zealand drug-driving deaths surpass drink-driving toll for first time,"More people died on New Zealand’s roads last year after collisions involving drug-drivers than drink-drivers, new research has shown. The Automobile Association (AA) has called the statistic proof of the “silent killer” of drug-driving and said police needed to be given saliva-based testing kits. Figures obtained by the association showed that last year 79 fatal crashes involved a driver who was impaired by drugs in their system, compared with 70 involving an intoxicated driver. In 2016, 59 fatal crashes involved a drug-affected driver and 67 involved alcohol. The figures come from testing that is done by authorities following a fatal crash. It is thought to be the first time that drugs have overtaken alcohol.
“These figures confirm how big a problem drugged driving is on our roads and why we have to give police saliva-based testing devices to catch impaired drivers,” said the AA’s Dylan Thomsen. “The AA has called drugged driving a silent killer on our roads for years and these latest figures confirm how prevalent drugs are in fatal crashes.” The AA is pushing for the government to give police more tools to test and catch drugged drivers on the roads. Excluding alcohol, the two most commonly detected individual drugs were cannabis and methamphetamine, also known as “P”, with the cases of P detection rising sharply in recent years.
“The number of drivers found to have drugs in their system is no surprise to the AA,” said Thomsen. “No one wants someone who is high driving towards their family at 100kph but right now the chances of being caught drugged driving is tiny. We have to change that.” The current system for police to test a driver for drugs requires an officer to have strong cause to suspect drug use and then to take the driver to a police station for a “walk-and-turn” sobriety test. Thomsen said the existing system almost needed “a driver to be sitting in the car with drugs on the seat next to them to get tested”. However, he said saliva testing devices, which were being used in many other countries, would be much faster and allow many more potentially drug-impaired drivers to be tested. “Random roadside drug testing would send a strong message that you’re endangering yourself and others if you drive impaired, and this doesn’t just apply to alcohol.” Such drug testing of drivers occurs in Australia, the UK, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Ireland.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/new-zealand-drug-driving-deaths-surpass-drink-driving-toll-for-first-time,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/new-zealand-drug-driving-deaths-surpass-drink-driving-toll-for-first-time

Three Haitian ministries said they were withdrawing Oxfam Great Britain’s status as a non-governmental organisation “for violation of Haitian law and serious violation of the principle of the dignity of the human beings.” Haiti had already temporarily suspended the right to operate.
The British aid organisation has been rocked by allegations that staff including a former Haiti country director used prostitutes during a relief mission after a devastating earthquake hit the island nation in 2010. In a statement, Oxfam GB said it was “disappointed but understands the Haiti Government’s decision”. “The behaviour of some former Oxfam staff working in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake was completely unacceptable.

2018-06-13T18:31:50Z,world,World news,Raccoon released into wild after successful skyscraper climb,"A daredevil raccoon that became an online sensation when it spent almost 20 nail-biting hours scaling a 25-storey office tower in Minnesota has been safely rescued and released back into the wild after making it to the top of the building unscathed. The animal’s ascent on the outside of the UBS building in downtown St Paul city was watched across the world on social media on Tuesday, with updates on its progress posted regularly by the Minnesota Public Radio under the hashtag #MPRraccoon. Crowds also gathered at the scene to watch.
Despite widespread concern for its safety – as well as Spider-Man and Mission Impossible jokes – it reportedly reached the roof at 3am local time yesterday, where cat food was waiting inside a humane trap. “It was heartbreaking to see yesterday,” MPR journalist Tim Nelson told the BBC after the racoon made it to safety. “We couldn’t imagine how this would end well for him.” The animal’s brush with international fame began on Monday, when it was originally spotted on the roof of a nearby two-storey office block. It is believed to have been there for two days without food or water, before being removed by maintenance workers. Rather than find safety on street level, however, it jumped over to the UBS Tower, one of the largest skyscrapers in the city, where it apparently began climbing the outside of the building – moving up, down, and sometimes sideways.
The raccoon’s climb seemed gravity-defying to onlookers who gathered below, as it scaled the walls with seemingly little to grip to. As it reached the window ledge of each storey, it would often pause to take a break, and have a nap, delighting workers inside the building who posted video footage of it stretching and grooming itself. James Gunn, director of the Hollywood film Guardians of the Galaxy, offered to donate $1,000 (£750) to charity if anyone could save the animal.
But social media celebrated in the early hours of yesterday morning when the animal, which had been nicknamed “spider-raccoon”, finally reached the top of the building, where the city’s department of safety inspections set live traps for the raccoon on the roof of the building so it could be safely returned to ground level. “Here’s the #mprraccoon taking the easy way down, in a UBS Plaza freight elevator,” Nelson tweeted yesterday, alongside a picture of it in a cage. At lunchtime on Wednesday, a private contractor hired to catch it told Nelson they released it “on private property at an undisclosed location, after consultation with the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center”. They posted a video of the release on their Facebook page:
Such positive attention for a raccoon is rare in the US, where they are largely viewed as pests. Emergency services receive hundreds of calls each year about aggressive raccoons breaking into apartments or preventing people from walking down the street. In May, a man in Michigan called the police after a family of raccoons crashed through the ceiling into his living room. In April, the NYPD received a number of calls from scared residents who believed they’d seen an escaped tiger wandering the streets of New York. It turned out to be a large raccoon. “I was talking to a wildlife expert yesterday who said there might be a dozen or two dozen of these raccoons in every square mile here in Minnesota – they’re everywhere. But you don’t see them scaling office towers,” Nelson said, adding that him and his colleagues had been overwhelmed by the international reaction to their tweets about the raccoon. “It’s kind of absurd that I took a couple of pictures of an animal that people usually hate and think is disgusting, and all of a sudden it has thousands of retweets and likes.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/raccoon-climbs-building-skyscraper-st-louis-minnesota-twitter,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/raccoon-climbs-building-skyscraper-st-louis-minnesota-twitter
2018-06-13T16:51:44Z,world,World news,North Koreans in Canada outraged at Donald Trump's praise of Kim Jong-un,"In an unprecedented week for international geopolitics – during which Donald Trump praised the North Korean leader shortly after disparaging Canada’s prime minister – one group of people has been particularly shocked by the US president’s upending of diplomatic norms. Canada’s small community of North Korean defectors has been shocked and infuriated by Trump’s contrasting treatment of the two leaders: insults for Justin Trudeau after the G7 meeting in Quebec and flattery for Kim Jong-un at the summit in Singapore. Julie and David – who both asked to use pseudonyms for fear of retaliation– are a married couple who escaped from North Korea in 2005 and now live in Toronto. Speaking through a translator, Julie could not contain her anger at Trump’s behaviour. “Attacking Prime Minister Trudeau but then, 24 hours later, going to Singapore and praising a dictator who is a murderer – it was unbearable to watch,” she said. She was particularly incensed by Trump’s failure to raise the subject of human rights abuses during his meetings with the Kim, who he described as a “very talented man” with a “great personality”.
“They didn’t address what was happening to the people in North Korea – all he did was praise Kim Jong-un. Unbelievable,” said Julie. Between 80,000 and 120,000 political prisoners are held in North Korean prisons, according to a UN commission of inquiry, which found that the regime’s crimes included “extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation”. Julie, 44, worked in a fishery company but defected in 2005 after being imprisoned for her political beliefs. She escaped through China, but was forced to leave her 10-year-old son behind. (He was finally reunited with her four years later). She met her husband David, 43, in a refugee settlement in South Korea, and the couple emigrated to Canada in 2008. Their sentiments over Trump’s treatment of Kim were shared by many defectors and their supporters in Canada. Jacqueline An, a Toronto lawyer, has represented many exiles over the years – and helped win the release last year of Hyeon Soo Lim, a Canadian pastor who was given a life sentence with hard labour for allegedly “meddling” in North Korean state affairs. She described Trump’s actions as “a complete mockery of democracy and celebration and admiration of a dictatorship. It’s absolutely deplorable.” An said many North Koreans see Canada as a safe haven far from the the reach of Kim’s regime. Trump, in contrast, has grown increasingly impatient with Canada in a growing row over trade rules.
“Canada is the most compassionate country in the world,” said An. “Trump should apologize to Trudeau. He wants to get into a trade war with Canada and then fly off to be with this dictator, the worst in the world.” Rocky Kim, 38, fled North Korea in his early 20s in 2003, and made his way to Canada, where he now runs a heating and ventilation company in Toronto. In North Korea, he spent time in the labour camps, and recalls seeing people die of hunger. “It’s not a normal country,” he insists in a phone interview. “It’s a dynasty, with the people living in slavery.” Kim said he thought the US president was blinded by his desire to land a historic deal with the Pyongyang regime, but came away empty-handed. “He got nothing. Kim did not promise to agree to denuclearisation.” In Singapore, Kim Jong-un signed a joint statement committing to “denuclearisation”, but it was a vaguely worded commitment that the regime has made several times before, and Rocky Kim said he thought that North Korea will never give up its nuclear weapons. “For North Korea’s leaders, it’s very important to have nuclear weapons to protect themselves,” he explains. “I don’t think Kim Jong-un will give them up. Never, ever. Trump has fallen into a trap.” North Korean refugee claim numbers to Canada have varied in recent years. There were 720 claims in 2012. The numbers then dropped to 150 claims in 2013, less than five in 2014 – and none at all in 2015. Canada’s government has itself been criticised for its treatment of North Koreans after 150 defectors – some of whom have lived in the country for years – received letters last year saying that they could face deportation.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/north-koreans-trump-trudeau-reactions-canada,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/north-koreans-trump-trudeau-reactions-canada
2018-06-13T16:49:31Z,world,World news,EU migration row boils over as Italy and France trade insults,"France and Italy have traded insults, rifts have widened in Germany’s ruling coalition and Austria has called for an “axis of the willing” to take action as a simmering row over how Europe should handle irregular migration finally boiled over. Rejecting French criticism of its immigration policies, Italy summoned the French ambassador on Wednesday and cancelled a planned meeting between the Italian economy minister and his counterpart in Paris. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, was reportedly considering postponing a visit to Paris on Friday for talks with Emmanuel Macron after the French president said Rome had acted with “cynicism and irresponsibility” in turning away a migrant rescue ship. Italy’s hardline new interior minister, Matteo Salvini, said the country had “nothing to learn from anyone about generosity, voluntarism, welcoming and solidarity” and demanded a formal apology.
Salvini, the leader of the far-right, anti-immigration League party, blocked the Aquarius from entering Italian ports this weekend, prompting an international outcry. The rescue vessel, which is carrying 629 migrants, was also refused by Malta and is now heading to Spain escorted by two Italian ships. The case has reopened one of the main unresolved faultlines in European politics: how to share responsibility for migrants trying to enter the bloc from conflict zones and poor countries, mainly across Africa and the Middle East. More than 1.8 million people have entered Europe irregularly since 2014 and Italy is currently sheltering 170,000 asylum seekers. Salvini’s League scored its best election result in March elections after pledging to deport an estimated 500,000 unregistered migrants. In Germany, the hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, pulled out of an integration summit hosted by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, saying Berlin should cooperate with Vienna and Rome in combating illegal immigration. Seehofer, of the Bavarian conservative CSU party, met Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz. He declared his support for Kurz’s proposal for a three-way “axis of the willing” with Italy to fight illegal migration. Kurz, who leads a coalition government with the far-right Freedom party, said a growing number of European governments were now agreed on the need to curb uncontrolled migration and crack down on people trafficking.
Seehofer told reporters he had spoken to Salvini, who also supported the proposed alliance. “Rome, Vienna and Berlin should work together at the interior minister level in the areas of security, fighting terrorism – and the core issue of immigration,” he said. “I accepted that … and we will push ahead with it.” Seehofer has put himself on a collision course with Merkel, his coalition ally, by pushing a tougher line on immigration, including a proposal as part of a new draft national “migrant masterplan” that Germany should turn away at the border migrants registered in other EU states. Merkel, who is working to pull together a Europe-wide deal on redistributing asylum seekers and find a more lasting solution to illegal migration involving enhanced controls along the European Union’s external border, has dismissed the plan as in breach of EU law. It would also represent a complete reversal of the open-doors migrant policy she adopted in 2015, which saw more than 1 million migrants enter Germany and which is seen as having fuelled a sharp rise in support for the rightwing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and caused deep rifts within her conservative bloc. With xenophobia on the rise across the continent, and hard-right parties either in government or riding high in the polls in countries from Italy in the south to Sweden on the north, immigration has become an issue of existential importance for the bloc. But member states remain deeply divided over burden-sharing plans aimed at warding off any repeat of the 2015-16 migration crisis, with “frontline” states like Italy, Greece and Spain complaining they are shouldering an unfair share of arrivals, wealthier destination countries such as Germany and the Netherlands arguing they have done enough, and hardline central European governments including Hungary and Poland flatly rejecting all compulsory refugee distribution schemes. Salvini, who said last week he would not allow Italy to become Europe’s “refugee camp”, told the Italian senate he was open to a possible “axis” with Germany and Austria, ahead of a key EU summit at the end of June that will consider possible changes to asylum law to better share the burden. “With my German and Austrian colleagues … we will propose a new [immigration] initiative,” Salvini said, adding that it would apply both to the EU’s external borders and to how member states manage migrants internally. But he demanded an apology from France, challenging Paris to take in the migrants it had promised to accept under an EU agreement and accusing it of turning back 10,000 at Italy’s northern border. He said France had committed to accepting 9,816 migrants under a 2015 EU redistribution scheme to relieve pressure on frontline countries, but in three years had accepted only 640 people.
“So I ask President Macron to pass from words to action and tomorrow morning welcome the 9,816 France promised to welcome as a sign of concrete generosity and not just words,” he said. Conte called France’s approach to the migrant crisis hypocritical. Macron later appealed for the two sides not to “give in to emotions that certain people are manipulating”, insisting that France was “working hand in hand with Italy” to handle migration. A French foreign ministry spokeswoman said Paris was “fully aware of the burden migration pressure is placing on Italy”. Filippo Grandi, the head of the United Nations refugee agency, said the bitter dispute over which European country should take in the Aquarius vessel was “profoundly shameful”, but said more such incidents could be expected in the coming weeks as long as the bloc remained divided on its policies toward migrants and refugees. Aloys Vimard, the Médecins Sans Frontières project coordinator onboard the rescue ship, said there was an urgent need for “politicians to discuss this, and for the EU to find a dignified solution for these vulnerable people. We are very, very concerned because political considerations are being prioritised over the safety of vulnerable people.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/italy-france-trade-insults-migration-row-boils-over,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/italy-france-trade-insults-migration-row-boils-over
2018-06-13T15:16:10Z,world,World news,Daphne Caruana Galizia murder: officials 'seeking to stall' inquiry,"The EU’s top justice official is to fly to Malta this week to meet officers investigating the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia after a report accused the authorities of seeking to delay and stall attempts to find those who wanted the journalist dead. Věra Jourová, the commissioner for justice, is to seek assurances and ask “difficult questions” about the criminal investigation, which has been criticised by members of the European parliament.
A report from MEPs, on an “ad hoc mission” led by the German MEP Sven Giegold, has highlighted a series of concerns about the investigation, warning that the hunt for the journalist’s killers appears to be in jeopardy. Caruana Galizia’s son, Matthew, tweeted on Wednesday in response to the findings: “This is outrageous.” Jourová, the Czech Republic’s representative in the commission, told the Guardian: “The issues in Malta go beyond this island, they concern the whole of the EU. My role, as a European justice commissioner, is to sometimes ask difficult and honest questions, especially on the issues that affect all of us. “The commission expects an independent and thorough investigation to uncover who is really responsible for Daphne’s murder, we want the full truth. There is no place in the EU for the murder of journalists.” The delegation of MEPs have warned in their report that the magistrate in charge of the investigation is being promoted and moved off the case, in a development that could slow down its progress. They claim police are not following leads to discover the identity of those who ordered the car bombing that killed Caruana Galizia in 2017. It is further claimed by the three MEPs sent to Malta on behalf of the parliament’s political groups that officers have failed to “fully investigate” the witnesses who claim they saw Malta’s minister of economy, Chris Cardona, drinking with one of three suspects being held on suspicion of detonating the bomb. Cardona and his aide Joseph Gerada were suing Caruana Galizia for defamation over her claims that the pair had visited a brothel in Germany while on official government business. Her reports have been described by Cardona as “fabrications and lies”. Cardona has said that he only knew the suspects in her murder through his work as a criminal lawyer, but that he did not “recall having any discussions with any of these individuals, and have definitely never had any meetings with them”. Last year, a pre-trial hearing of evidence against the suspects, brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and Vince Muscat, heard that the powerful car bomb used to kill Caruana Galizia was detonated by a mobile phone signal sent from a boat off the island’s coast as part of a carefully planned operation lasting several months. The three have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, the criminal use of explosives, involvement in organised crime, and criminal conspiracy. However, there appears to have been little progress in discovering who ordered the crime. The MEPs write: “The investigation on the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia is stalling. People we spoke to suspect that the plan may be to ensure the blame rests with the three suspected bombers and to eventually let them go free, after 20 months of detention.” “Magistrate Vella, who has been in charge of the murder investigation, has been offered a promotion to become a judge and should, in a few weeks, leave the case. This is interpreted by many as a way to delay and stall the investigation
“The police is ostensibly not following all relevant leads to find out who ordered the assassination. Excuses provided go from lack of resources to impossibility to investigate all people exposed by the deceased who might have had a motive to silence her. “Quite shockingly, the police appeared not to have thoroughly investigated witness accounts – published by international media – that minister of economy Chris Cardona had been seen drinking with one of the suspects prior to their arrest.” A spokesman for the Maltese government said the report had been drafted “by three MEPs after a visit to Malta in a private and political capacity, and not on behalf of the European Parliament or any of its committees”. He accused the parliamentarians of making “wild allegations” which are “absolutely and completely false”. The spokesman said: “There is no evidence to support the theory that the investigation is ‘stalling’. Three people have been arrested and charged with the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia, and the investigation in to who ordered her murder carries on at pace. “Significant Police and Security Service resources are still deployed on the case.” It is understood that Jourová is to speak to Malta’s minister for justice, Owen Bonnici, and the country’s leading judge on Thursday, before meeting the officers investigating Caruana Galizia’s murder. She is also due to lay flowers on the journalist’s tomb. Jourová said would also raise issues over Malta’s offer of passports for cash and its flailing attempts to clamp down on organised crime and money laundering. Jourová said: “I think the murder of a journalist was a wake-up call for many of us and a clear realisation that many things are related to one another. Money laundering, citizenship for sale, security, corruption are all part of the systemic threats to the rule of law and democracy as such.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/daphne-caruana-galizia-top-eu-official-flies-to-malta,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/daphne-caruana-galizia-top-eu-official-flies-to-malta
2018-06-13T14:00:20Z,world,World news,Young more religious than old in only two countries in world,"Young people are more religious than their elders in only two countries – Ghana, and the former Soviet republic of Georgia – according to a global analysis. In 46 out of 106 countries surveyed by the Washington-based Pew Research Center, people between the ages of 18 and 39 are less likely to say religion is very important to them than adults over the age of 40. Countries where the age gap is most marked are Poland, Greece, Chile, Romania and Portugal – all predominantly Christian countries, and all with a percentage point difference between the two age groups of 20 or higher. The US has a 17-point difference, and Ireland a nine-point gap. The UK is among 58 countries in which there is no significant difference between younger and older adults. In Lebanon, a majority Muslim country but with a large Christian population, there is a 20-point age gap. In Iran, ruled by an Islamic theocracy, there is a nine-point difference. There is an age gap in a majority of Latin American and Caribbean countries, about half of European countries, and in North America. It is more likely to be a feature of Christian-majority countries than Muslim-majority ones. According to Pew: “Although the age gap in religious commitment is larger in some nations than in others, it occurs in many different economic and social contexts – in developing countries as well as advanced industrial countries, in Muslim-majority nations as well as predominantly Christian states, and in societies that are, overall, highly religious as well as those that are comparatively secular.” The report, The Age Gap in Religion Around the World, says that a common explanation is that “new generations become less religious in tandem with economic development – as collective worries about day-to-day survival become less pervasive and tragic events become less frequent. “According to this line of thinking, each generation in a steadily developing society would be less religious than the last, which would explain why young adults are less religious than their elders at any given time.” Better education, and a trend towards religious belief as one gets older and faces mortality, could also help explain the gap. The report notes that the most religious areas of the world are experiencing the fastest population growth, due to high fertility rates and relatively young populations.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/young-more-religious-than-old-in-only-two-countries-in-world,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/young-more-religious-than-old-in-only-two-countries-in-world
2018-06-13T12:15:57Z,world,World news,German interior minister pulls out of Merkel's integration summit,"Germany’s interior minister, Horst Seehofer, has cancelled his participation in an integration summit hosted by Angela Merkel amid increasing signs of major disagreements between them over the country’s asylum policy. The absence follows his decision on Tuesday to drop the launch of an “immigration masterplan” after the German chancellor refused to back a crucial point of the plan that would allow migrants deemed to be trying to enter the country illegally to be turned back at the German border, arguing that it would breach European law. She insisted the masterplan was still being discussed in detail. Merkel has attracted criticism particularly within her CDU party for failing to back Seehofer’s push for stricter immigration rules amid cross-party concern that German asylum policy is in disarray. Instead of attending the summit, Seehofer said he was meeting the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, who on Wednesday said hardline interior ministers from Italy, Austria and Germany had formed an “axis of the willing” to combat illegal immigration. The claim marks a shot across the bow for Merkel, who is trying to pull together a deal for EU cooperation on placing asylum seekers. Kurz has been pushing for more stringent immigration rules across the EU, but is not fully behind Seehofer’s plan to return people to the country in which they were first registered. Merkel has steadfastly refused to sanction Seehofer’s plan, insisting on finding a European solution to illegal migration that would require enhanced controls along the external border of the EU. Before her meeting with Kurz on Tuesday, Merkel said the issue was crucial and had the potential to seriously damage Europe if a remedy was not found soon. Seehofer also made clear his anger that his speech at Wednesday’s summit was to be preceded by a speech by the Turkish-German author Ferda Ataman, who has accused the interior minister of adopting Nazi tendencies by choosing to rename his department the Heimat, or homeland, ministry. She has argued that the word “Heimat” in the context in which Seehofer has chosen to use it – namely to protect Germany – is a response to “rampant xenophobia” and plays to the “blood and soil” politics of Nazism. Seehofer has vehemently rejected the Nazi comparison. The issue is expected to continue to reveal ever deeper rifts in the young coalition government. Seehofer, the leader of Merkel’s coalition allies, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), has been on a collision course with the chancellor ever since her decision to allow an influx of more than a million migrants in 2015 and 2016. Most of the newcomers arrived in Germany via Bavaria. Seehofer’s “immigration masterplan” also involves so-called anchor centres, where immigrants’ details would be registered, and huge accommodation shelters where asylum seekers could stay while awaiting news on their applications. The CSU is keen to demonstrate its toughness on the issue in the run-up to a state election in October in which it will seek to claw back support it has lost to the anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland. This month the CSU introduced a law in Bavaria requiring all public buildings, including schools and universities, to hang a crucifix in their entrances.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/german-interior-minister-pulls-out-of-integration-summit,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/german-interior-minister-pulls-out-of-integration-summit
2018-06-13T11:32:21Z,world,World news,Italy summons French ambassador in row over migrant rescue boat,"Italy has summoned the French ambassador after Emmanuel Macron criticised what he called Italy’s “cynicism and irresponsibility” in turning away a migrant rescue ship with more than 600 people on board. Matteo Salvini, Italy’s new anti-migrant interior minister, blocked the Aquarius rescue ship carrying 629 people from docking in its ports at the weekend, prompting international outcry. In a speech to parliament on Wednesday he demanded an apology from the French president and challenged France to take in the migrants it had promised to take under an EU agreement, accusing it of turning back 10,000 migrants at Italy’s northern border. Salvini said France had committed to accepting 9,816 migrants under a 2015 EU redistribution scheme to relieve frontline countries of the pressure of asylum-seekers. The scheme never got off the ground. Salvini said in three years France had accepted only 640 people. “So I ask President Macron to pass from words to action and tomorrow morning welcome the 9,816 France promised to welcome as a sign of concrete generosity and not just words.”
Giuseppe Conte, the new Italian prime minister, also hit back at France’s criticism, calling its approach to the migrant crisis “hypocritical”. “Following the statements made in Paris yesterday about the Aquarius case, the minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, Enzo Moavero Milanese, has summoned the ambassador of France to Italy this morning,” the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. The summons came as the migrants, who were pulled from the sea in rescue operations on Saturday night, make their way to Spain on Italian naval vessels, after Spain’s new prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, stepped in on Monday and said they would be welcome in the port of Valencia. The Aquarius, which had been on its way to Sicily, got caught in a standoff between Italy and Malta after both countries refused to allow it to dock. It was the first major anti-migrant move made by Salvini, the hardline leader of the far-right League party. A week earlier he called for an end to Sicily being Europe’s “refugee camp”. Amid the diplomatic tensions, an Italian coastguard ship, Diciotti, carrying 900 migrants and two bodies, arrived in Catania, Sicily, on Wednesday morning. More than 600,000 migrants have landed on Italy’s southern shores over the last five years and the country has long urged its EU partners to share the burden. A controversial pact between Italy and Libya has led to a 70% decrease in arrivals since last summer. But the deal is facing a legal challenge at the European court of human rights (ECHR) amid allegations that it prompted serious human rights violations, including torture and slavery, against those who make the treacherous Mediterranean crossing. Many who arrive in Italy venture north in an attempt to cross into France, Austria or Switzerland. But border controls make this nearly impossible. A cat-and-mouse situation has played out between Italy and France at the Italian border town of Ventimiglia since 2011, with French police sending back thousands who have tried to cross the border, either by train or a dangerous mountain path. A report in the French newspaper Le Monde last week said a hunter had discovered the body of a migrant who attempted the mountain route over the winter. The global medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has also criticised the Italian government’s response, accusing it of risking people’s safety and putting politics before lives. Aloys Vimard, MSF’s project coordinator on board the Aquarius, said the Italian coastguard had dropped 900 migrants off in Sicily on Wednesday morning, while those on the NGO rescue ship had been turned away from Italian ports. “This should not be a precedent: rescued people should be taken to the nearest available port,” he told the Guardian. “More than 900 people are disembarking in Catania, Sicily, and we’re a bit concerned that Italy has been toying with the lives of 629 rescued people by denying them disembarkation at the closest safe port. There’s a need for politicians to discuss this and for the European Union to find a dignified solution for these vulnerable people. “We are very, very concerned about the situation because political considerations are being prioritised over the safety over hundreds of vulnerable people.” Vimard said the situation on the Aquarius had improved significantly after more than 500 people were transferred to Italian vessels on Tuesday afternoon, leaving 106 people on the rescue ship. “The conditions very difficult when there were 629 people on board; they couldn’t lie down and the ship was overcrowded for four days,” he said. Vimard said the crew and passengers were hoping to reach Valencia on Saturday evening, though much would depend on the weather. “The weather is deteriorating and we’re making sure that people are safe – we’ve put ropes across the deck so people can move to the toilet without falling over. It’s going to be tough.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/italy-hits-back-at-french-criticism-over-turning-away-migrants-ship-aquarius,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/italy-hits-back-at-french-criticism-over-turning-away-migrants-ship-aquarius
2018-06-13T09:59:38Z,world,World news,'It’s like coming back to life': Italian MP reveals her face to public for first time,"Italy’s “ghost” politician – who was forced to run for office anonymously due to threats from the mafia – has finally revealed her face to the public after winning her parliamentary seat. “After all these years spent behind the scenes, today I can finally look at the world in the face without fear of showing mine,” Piera Aiello, 51, told the Guardian, while posing for pictures for the first time since 1993. “It’s like coming back to life,” she said, smiling at the camera lens. “At this precise moment, I feel completely free.” Aiello’s life has been in danger since she witnessed two mafia hitmen kill her husband in 1991, forcing her to enter witness protection two years later. In March, she stood as an anti-mafia candidate for the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) in Sicily, and won her seat despite having to campaign anonymously, and under security escort. As an anti-mafia witness, Aiello could not show her face in public, could not be photographed, or freely hold campaign events in city squares. She often wore a veil to cover her face, and became known as the “faceless candidate”. Aiello was born in Partanna, in western Sicily. At the age of 14, she was forced to marry the son of Sicilian mafia boss Vito Atria. In 1991 a rival mafia clan decided to kill her husband. “We had a pizzeria,” says Aiello. “One evening, two men entered the room. They looked at my husband and fired. He fell before me, covered in blood.” After deciding to testify against the assailants, she became a mafia informant, with her testimony leading to the arrest of several mobsters. But while other mafiosi remained free, she said she was forced to live like a prisoner while in witness protection. She had to change her name and leave Sicily. Last year, she said she decided to take back control of her life and run for office in the election as a candidate for the anti-establishment M5S. “I had a goal: bring to the parliament the dramatic conditions in which those who decide to testify against the mafia are forced to live,” she said. Despite successful campaigns to curtail the influence of Cosa Nostra in Sicily and the Camorra in Naples, organised crime remains a serious problem in Italy and abroad. The Calabrian mafia, known as the ‘Ndrangheta, is believed to be the leading cocaine trafficker in Europe. As a member of parliament, Aiello said it had become too complicated to avoid photographers and cameras in Rome, and she now felt ready to show her face in public. But she will continue to live under police escort. She is still regarded as a mafia target, especially since she became a prominent anti-mafia campaigner in parliament, encouraging witnesses to speak out. On Wednesday, Piera was back in Sicily to meet other witnesses who rebelled against the mafia, who also live in fear. One was Alessandro Marsicano, 48, a pastry chef from Palermo and victim of mafia extortion. Since becoming an informant, his testimony had led to arrests, but he said his life had become a nightmare. “I had decided to leave Sicily and move to London, where I opened a pastry shop near Soho,” he says. “But the bosses reached me there too, and one evening they beat me up in the streets of Tottenham. Since I met Piera, I can see a brighter future for my family.” Several state witnesses have celebrated her victory in parliament, and some have even called for her to be appointed deputy minister of the interior in Italy’s new coalition government. “I have decided to stand so those who rebel against mafia are not marginalised,” she said. “I decided to become a candidate because I, Piera Aiello, wanted my face back. And I have got it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/italian-mp-piera-aiello-mafia-threat-reveals-her-face-for-first-time,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/italian-mp-piera-aiello-mafia-threat-reveals-her-face-for-first-time
2018-06-13T08:00:13Z,world,World news,Mexicans can now vote using presidential candidates' nicknames,"When Mexican voters go to the polls on 1 July to pick a new president, they will able to choose between candidates including Richie Rich, Alligatorfish, and the Untamed One thanks to a ruling by the country’s electoral institute. Voters will now be allowed to scribble a candidate’s nickname, initials or campaign slogan anywhere on the ballot – rather than mark an X over their names – and have it count as valid.
The National Electoral Institute (INE) – which organises the election and referees all partisan political activities in Mexico – changed the rules barely three weeks ahead of the vote that will also renew congress, elect nine governors and hundreds of mayors. Nicknames abound in Mexican politics: the current front-runner Andrés Manuel López Obrador is often referred to by his initials: “Amlo”. But he is equally well-known as “El Peje” for pejelegarto, a fish from his native Tabasco state, whose name translates literally as Alligatorfish. His closest rival – Ricardo Anaya Cortés of the rightwing National Action Party – is sometimes referred to as “RAC” in print, but on social media he is increasingly called Ricky Riquín Canallín – the Spanish equivalent of “Richie Rich”, which was coined by López Obrador in a recent candidates’ debate.
The lone independent candidate on the ballot, cowboy-turned-governor Jaime Rodríguez, is better known as “El Bronco” – or the Untamed One. The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate José Antonio Meade, whose sedate speaking style and lacklustre campaign has failed to capture the public imagination, lacks a nickname, beyond the perfunctory “Pepe” or “Pepe Toño” – the diminutive form of his first names. Dissenters on the INE board warned that allowing voters to use nicknames could cause confusion during the vote count. A blank box on the ballot already allows for write-in candidates.
López Obrador has a history of tagging his critics with unflattering nicknames. As Mexico City mayor, he called anti-crime protesters pirruris (spoiled rich kids) and dismissed civil society organisations which disagreed with him as fifis (posh). López Obrador labelled Anaya with the “Ricky Riquín Canallín” during the second presidential debate. The name stuck and remained the debate’s most memorable moment. “It shows how good López Obrador is at branding people,” said Federico Estévez, a political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. “He’s almost as good as Trump.” All polls show López Obrador ahead of his rivals by around 20 percentage points, amid a broad desire for change in a country beset by drug cartel violence and political corruption scandals.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/mexico-presidential-election-write-in-candidate-nicknames,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/mexico-presidential-election-write-in-candidate-nicknames
2018-06-13T07:36:58Z,world,World news,British overseas territories in talks to keep tax haven secrecy,"Leaders of British overseas territories are to hold two days of showdown talks with ministers in an attempt to reverse the UK government’s decision to end secrecy for offshore tax havens. An unexpected vote by MPs at the beginning of May to impose public registers of share ownership in all the BOTs has triggered angry resistance including street protests, boycotts of the Queen’s birthday celebrations, and even demands for constitutional separation.
The disagreements have the potential to create the biggest constitutional crisis between London and the territories for decades, which an apologetic 35-minute phone call from Theresa May and visits to some of the BOTs by the Foreign Office minister Lord Ahmad has so far failed to soothe. The territories, which include the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Bermuda, Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands, fear an end to tax secrecy will undermine the financial services industries on which local economies depend since privacy-seeking investors will simply move their portfolios to other secretive regimes. They also claim the Commons vote infringes the constitutional right of the islands to oversee their own domestic legislation. More than 1,000 people marched in the BVI to protest against the enforced change in the law. After the Panama Papers exposed widespread money-laundering, MPs ignored government pleas and backed an amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill to require BOTs to set up public registers of beneficial ownership by the end of 2020.
Andrew Mitchell, the former Conservative international development secretary and a leading MP behind the rebellion, was unrepentant, saying on Tuesday: “The overseas territories share our queen, they travel under our flag and they must also share our values.” He intends, with the former chair of the public accounts committee Margaret Hodge, to press crown dependencies including Jersey and the Isle of Man to accept the same regime as the BOTs. Treasury ministers had been desperate to exclude the jurisdictions, already in the process of reluctantly establishing registers that could be accessed on request by law enforcement bodies, from the legislation passed last month – but the move only fuelled the anger of the overseas territories. The BVI delegation to London, one of the groups from the BOTs, is being led by its pro-independence deputy premier, Dr Kedrick Pickering, and has hired the law firm Withers and instructed counsel to prepare a legal challenge on the basis that the UK parliament has overreached itself.
Hussein Haeri, partner and head of Withers’ public international law team, said: ‘We are confident that there are constitutional grounds for challenging the imposition of a public register of the beneficial ownership of companies and human rights issues raised by public access to the register. “The BVI’s consistent position is that it will not introduce public registers unless and until they become a global standard.” The Cayman Islands is considering whether to join the action or to instruct a different firm of lawyers. Its premier, Alden McLaughlin, said he would try to change the islands’ constitutional relationship with the UK, describing the Commons vote as “reminiscent of the worst injustices of a bygone era of colonial despotism”. He added: “We want to remove that ability for the UK to be able to randomly legislate for us.” “This matter extends well beyond the issue of beneficial ownership registers or the broader financial services sector. “If the UK feels emboldened by what it has just done and believes it can do it any time it doesn’t like something here or it wants to impose something on us, it is not just the financial services industry at risk but our very existence.” David Burt, the premier of Bermuda, has already warned May that he will not implement the laws, saying: “This country does not recognise the right of the United Kingdom parliament to legislate on matters which are internal affairs reserved to Bermuda under its constitution.” He said that in his call with May he had reiterated Bermuda’s position that it would implement a public register of beneficial ownership only when that was a global standard. The meetings with UK ministers this week were also due to discuss the consequences of Brexit for the territories, and UK government aid to relieve the impact of last year’s hurricanes.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/british-overseas-territories-in-talks-to-keep-tax-haven-secrecy,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/british-overseas-territories-in-talks-to-keep-tax-haven-secrecy
2018-06-13T06:17:50Z,world,World news,Kim Jong-un hailed victor in 'meeting of century' by North Korean media,"North Korea has hailed Tuesday’s summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un as marking the end to hostile relations with the US, with state media depicting the meeting as a diplomatic victory for its leader. Trump offered his own assessment as he landed back on US soil, tweeting that Pyongyang no longer posed a nuclear threat.
In its first report on the summit, North Korea’s official KCNA news agency offered a glowing account of the talks, name-checking Kim 16 times. The front page of the ruling workers’ party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, meanwhile, ran photographs of Kim warmly shaking hands with Trump. It said the “meeting of the century” was held to bring an end to “extreme, hostile relations” between the countries. KCNA said the talks were “epoch-making” and would help foster “a radical switchover in the most hostile [North Korea]-US relations”. It credited Kim with creating the conditions for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.
Trump, KCNA said, “appreciated that an atmosphere of peace and stability was created on the Korean peninsula and in the region, although distressed with the extreme danger of armed clash only a few months ago, thanks to the proactive peace-loving measures taken by the respected Supreme Leader from the outset of this year”. It also celebrated what some have described as Kim’s rapid transformation from reviled dictator to statesman following the positive reception he received in Singapore. “Singapore, the country of the epoch-making meeting much awaited by the whole world, was awash with thousands of domestic and foreign journalists and a large crowd of masses to see this day’s moment which will remain long in history,” it said.
The agency added that Kim and Trump had accepted invitations to visit their respective countries. “Kim Jong-un invited Trump to visit Pyongyang at a convenient time and Trump invited Kim Jong-un to visit the US. “The two top leaders gladly accepted each other’s invitation, convinced that it would serve as another important occasion for improved DPRK-US relations,” it said, referencing the country’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The summit has been widely regarded as a diplomatic coup for North Korea, which repeated its commitment towards denuclearisation in a joint statement that offered no details of how that would be achieved.
In return, Trump, to the surprise of US ally South Korea and his own military, said he would end joint US-South Korea military exercises. Pyongyang considers the annual drills as a rehearsal for invasion. Trump said the drills would not be held while North Korea was still talking. “We’re not going to be doing the war games as long as we’re negotiating in good faith,” he told Fox News Channel. South Korean officials and US military commanders said they had had no advance knowledge of Trump’s announcement. Japan’s defence minister said the US military presence in South Korea and joint military exercises were “vital” for east Asian security. “We would like to seek an understanding of this between Japan, the US and South Korea,” Itsunori Onodera told reporters. Onodera said Japan would continue joint military exercises with the US and continue to improve its defences against a possible North Korean ballistic missile strike. Some analysts said Trump had made an unnecessary concession. Ending the drills “is in excess of all expert consensus, South Korean requests, and even a close reading of North Korean demands”, said Adam Mount of the Federation of American Scientists. Melissa Hanham of the US-based Center for Nonproliferation Studies pointed out that Pyongyang’s commitment towards denuclearisation was nothing new. The regime had “already promised to do this many times,” she said on Twitter, adding the two sides “still don’t agree on what ‘denuclearisation’ means”. On Wednesday, Trump again hailed the summit as historic.
The release last month of three Americans being held by North Korea was secured during a surprise visit to Pyongyang by the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. The date for Tuesday’s summit was set just hours after Tony Kim, Kim Hak-song and Kim Dong Chul arrived back in the US. In another tweet on Wednesday, Trump thanked Kim for taking “the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people”, adding, “Our unprecedented meeting ... proves that real change is possible!” Just before Air Force One took of from Singapore on Tuesday evening, Trump said he believed that Kim – whom he referred to as “little rocket man” last year – was a leader with whom he could do business. “I can only tell you that from the time I’ve dealt with him, which is really starting 90 days ago ... I think he wants to get it done,” Trump said when asked if he had any doubts about Kim’s sincerity. The president said Kim had immediately agreed to his request to return the remains of American prisoners of war and those who went missing in action during the 1950-53 Korean war. “As soon as I had my first opportunity, which was toward the end, I said could you do it. He said we will do it.” But he was still vague on how Washington intended to verify denuclearisation. “We’re going to have to check it and we will check it. We’ll check it very strongly.” Asked if he trusted Kim, Trump said: “I do.” During Tuesday’s summit, Kim said it was “urgent” for North Korea and the US to halt “irritating and hostile military actions against each other”, KCNA reported. “Kim Jong-un and Trump had the shared recognition to the effect that it is important to abide by the principle of step-by-step and simultaneous action in achieving peace, stability and denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,” it reported. The North Korean leader was quoted as saying the regime could take more goodwill measures if the US reciprocated with genuine measures to build trust, and that the two countries should take legal and institutional steps to avoid antagonising each other. The report added that Trump said he “understood”.
South Korean media were generally positive about the talks, but pointed out that important questions remained over the process and timing of North Korean denuclearisation. “The summit fell short of expectations of a road map for denuclearisation, but the issue of dismantling the North Korean nuclear programme and assuring the security of its regime – two key agenda items of the summit – are as difficult to solve as a tangled knot,” the Korea Herald said in an editorial. The paper cautioned against any reduction in US forces based in South Korea, saying the bilateral alliance was key to South Korean president Moon Jae-in’s ability to foster further cross-border detente and implement the agreement. “For Moon to perform the role well, it is important to uphold a solid Korea-US alliance. The alliance is the basis of South Korea’s diplomacy and security. At its core are the US forces stationed in Korea”, it said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/kim-jong-un-north-korea-summit-trump-visit-kcna,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/kim-jong-un-north-korea-summit-trump-visit-kcna
2018-06-13T06:08:50Z,world,World news,China hails its 'indisputable' role in outcome of Trump-Kim summit,"Chinese officials have been quick to take credit for some of the outcomes of a historic summit between the US and North Korea on Tuesday. Following the meeting between US president Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, China’s foreign minister Wang Yi hailed China’s “indisputable” role in the process.
“It is fair to say that the relevant approach and initiative proposed by China and its endeavours … have played a positive and constructive role in getting the situation on the peninsula to where it is now.” China’s state-run media called the summit a “success” and something China had long been “working toward.” China, North Korea’s largest trading partner and most powerful ally, was not present at the summit in Singapore but Beijing has emerged as a clear winner. Trump surprised allies by announcing the US would stop holding military exercises with South Korea, a measure China first proposed to Washington last year, known as the “freeze for freeze” initiative. Trump initially rejected the proposal, in which North Korea would stop conducting nuclear and missile tests in exchange for a halt in military exercise between the US and South Korea. “The China-proposed ‘suspension for suspension’ initiative has been materialised and now the situation is moving forward,” Wang said, in comments to reporters in Beijing.
Trump also called the war games “provocative” and “inappropriate,” echoing language both Beijing and Pyongyang have used to characterise the annual war games that have been conducted for decades. “Trump suspending joint drill between the US and South Korea shows sincerity,” said Lu Chao, an expert in North and South Korea relations at the Liaoning Academy of Social Science. China may benefit in other ways. Soon after the summit’s conclusion, Beijing called for lifting international sanctions on Pyongyang, a move that would give trade in China’s northeastern regions across the border from North Korea a needed boost. “As a neighbour, China’s role is to take more responsibility as a regional power. China is an important mediator between the US and North Korea, and China will maintain this role,” Lu said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/china-hails-its-indisputable-role-in-outcome-of-trump-kim-summit,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/china-hails-its-indisputable-role-in-outcome-of-trump-kim-summit
2018-06-13T05:29:29Z,world,World news,Wednesday briefing: 'The general public has a right to know',"Top story: Push to broaden FoI laws Hello – Warren Murray with you at the halfway point of the week. The government is being urged to adopt changes to freedom of information laws that might have exposed fire safety failings before the Grenfell Tower disaster. Housing associations including the body that managed Grenfell would be made subject to FoI requests under a private member’s bill going before parliament. It would also place firms like Carillion, G4S and Serco under greater public scrutiny. “The general public has a right to know as much about Carillion or Serco when they are given public contracts or providing public services as we do about public authorities doing the same work,” says the Labour MP Andy Slaughter, who is proposing the bill. When Carillion collapsed with the loss of thousands of jobs, there had been little advance notice of its financial vulnerability. And Grenfell residents had tried before the fire to get information but the building’s managers were able to claim exemption as a non-public body. Slaughter, the MP for Hammersmith, has campaigned about high-rise fire risks since a 2016 blaze in a Shepherd’s Bush tower block not far from Grenfell. Other areas that would be subject to FoIs under Slaughter’s bill include local safeguarding children boards, electoral registration officers, returning officers and the housing ombudsman. * * * Quick catch-up - Here is the latest on some developing stories. > In news just breaking this morning, Saudi-led forces have launched their threatened assault to reclaim Yemen’s port city of Hodeidah from Houthi rebels.

Lunchtime read: Why don’t more women ride bicycles? “Fifty-one per cent of the UK population is female, yet most of our cities are failing to design roads and streets for women to cycle.” So says Xavier Brice, from Sustrans, which campaigns to get people out of their cars. Is he right that metropolitan planners are to blame for half as many women as men getting around on bicycles?
“The main reason most women don’t cycle in the UK is because they think it is dangerous,” writes north of England editor and avid cyclist Helen Pidd. “When they sit on the top deck of a bus and look down to see a cyclist squashed up against the kerb they feel no compulsion whatsoever to join them … 10 out of 13 cyclists killed in London in 2009 were women, and eight of them were killed by left-turning HGVs.” Seventy-six percent of women say segregated lanes would persuade them to cycle. Until there are more, Pidd writes, “when women tell me cycling is too dangerous I can’t, in good conscience, persuade them otherwise”.

The Guardian, FT and Telegraph have photographs and stories about the Singapore talks but give Brexit top billing. “May escapes Brexit bill defeat as Tory rebels accept concession” is the Guardian splash. The FT leads with: “Tory rebels force May into Brexit climbdown”, and the Telegraph says: “Three ministers ‘meet anti-Brexit group over second referendum’”. The Express splits the front page evenly between the two stories – its headlines are: “May fights off Brexit rebels” and “Taming of the tyrant”.
The Times has Brexit on the front, but splashes with “No more games: Trump gives path to peace”. There’s nothing of North Korea on the front of the Sun, which is so furious about the Brexit bill that it opts for a Theresa May/Star Wars pun: “May the farce be with you”. Marching to the beat of its own drum, the Mirror has a story on headteachers demanding: “Teach our kids web safety”. Sign up

2018-06-13T04:09:44Z,world,World news,Australia supplants China to build undersea cable for Solomon Islands,"The Australian government has stepped in to help build a key piece of infrastructure for the Solomon Islands, as concerns about Beijing’s attempts at “soft diplomacy” continue to grow. Malcolm Turnbull announced that Australia would jointly fund construction of an underwater telecommunication cable network, which will link remote Solomon Islands communities to Honiara. Huawei had been earmarked to build the cable, after the Solomons originally awarded the contract to the Chinese company – a move that prompted Australian intelligence and security chiefs to warn against the deal. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
The cable is to have an Australian link point, to allow the Solomons and Papua New Guinea to connect to Australia’s fibre optic cable infrastructure. Sydney, Townsville and the Sunshine Coast are all being considered as connection points. Huawei has been banned from government contracts to build Australian infrastructure over concerns that its links to the ruling Chinese communist government could jeopardise Australia’s security. Last year Nick Warner, who heads the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the agency which deals with foreign intelligence, was reported to have warned the former Solomons prime minister Manasseh Sogavare against Huawei’s involvement. Australia stepped in to fill the gap, with funding put aside for the 4,000km cable in the budget. While foreign aid funding was frozen, Australia has concentrated its efforts on the Pacific, after reports about the concessional loans Beijing has been providing countries in the region have concerns that China is seeking to increase its influence in the region. Of the $4.2bn Australia will spend on foreign aid in the next year, $1.3bn is earmarked for the Pacific. Julie Bishop said the Solomon Islands accepting the Australian offer made sense, as it was “cheaper” and “likely to be faster results for them, and technically superior”. “We put up an alternative, and that’s what I believe Australia should continue to do,” Bishop said. “We are the largest aid donor in the Pacific. “We are a longstanding partner of the Solomon Islands and I want to ensure that countries in the Pacific have alternatives, that they don’t only have one option and no others, and so in this case, we are in a position to be able to offer a more attractive deal for Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea and they accepted it.” Turnbull attempted to play down the security concerns about the cable, saying instead Australia was happy to see the Solomons and PNG grow.
“There have been a number of cable projects that have been contemplated, with respect to the Solomon Islands over the years,” he said. “You’ve referred to one of them. What we are doing is providing very practical and substantial support and aid as part of our foreign aid program, to provide that telecommunications infrastructure which will ensure that the Solomons Island has access to 21st century telecommunications, which, as I was discussing with the prime minister [Rick Houenipwela] today, it is going to be vital for education, for commerce, for economic development, in every aspect of their society, just as it is in ours.” Houenipwela will spend time in Queensland, a key trading partner with the Solomons, as well as Sydney and Canberra during his trip, which follows the official end of the Australian-led peacekeeping mission in his nation, which began in 2003 and ended last June. with Australian Associated Press",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/australia-supplants-china-to-build-undersea-cable-for-solomon-islands,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/australia-supplants-china-to-build-undersea-cable-for-solomon-islands
2018-06-13T04:00:08Z,world,World news,"Populist talkshows fuel rise of far right, German TV bosses told","The head of Germany’s most powerful cultural body has called for the plug to be pulled on the nation’s multitude of political talkshows for a year, arguing that their populist agenda has helped fuel the rise of the far right. Olaf Zimmermann, who heads the German cultural council, an umbrella group for organisations from art galleries to television companies, said public broadcasters needed to step back and rethink a format that has helped cement gloom-ridden public attitudes towards refugees and Islam, and propelled the Alternative für Deutschland party into parliament at last September’s election. “I’d suggest for them, take a break for a year ... though the length of the intermission isn’t the decisive factor. What is crucial is that they return with new talkshow concepts and try to come up with more suitable contents with regards to social cohesion in our society,” Zimmermann said, arguing that the public broadcasters ARD and ZDF were obsessed with refugee-related issues, often framing them negatively. The cultural council, which is taxpayer funded, has pointed out that since 2015, at the height of the refugee crisis when almost a million refugees and migrants entered Germany, more than 100 political talk shows have put a topic related to migration at the centre of their discussion. Since September’s election, which saw the AfD enter the Bundestag for the first time, much debate has surrounded the extent to which framing an issue, or lending a topic a certain perspective, might have helped their cause. Television analysts have argued that the issue of refugees has been dealt with in a mostly negative way. TV bosses have defended their formats, admitting the intensity of the refugee debate led to the topic being far more widely discussed in 2015 and 2016 than ever before, but arguing that it was no longer a dominant theme. Even last week, however, ARD’s main talkshow Hart Aber Fair - Hard But Fair - led with the question: “To what extent is it possible to integrate young men who have fled from war and archaic societies? How unsafe is Germany as a result of them?” The programme was triggered by the murder of a 14-year-old German girl whose body was discovered in Wiesbaden last week. The 20-year-old Iraqi man suspected of her rape and murder was extradited from Iraq to Germany this week to face trial. Zimmermann said in too many cases refugees were unfairly presented as a threat to German society. The production team of Hart Aber Fair said it rejected the accusation that they had unfairly labelled all refugees as dangerous. “As journalists we find the concept of framing alien to us. We are simply trying to represent the issues which are occupying people, for what they are,” they said. A recent talkshow moderated by the veteran host Sandra Maischberger was advertised in TV listings with the title: “Are we too tolerant towards Islam?” Critics were quick to pounce on the word “we” as being problematic because it suggested “them and us”. The programme’s title was swiftly changed to: The Islam debate: where does our tolerance end? Other recent talkshow topics included ones entitled Refugees and criminality, and Beethoven or Burka? Kai Hafez, a media analyst, said that immigration was rarely presented in talkshows as anything other than negative. “The viewers get used to these negative expressions, and long-term that way the rightwing populists manage to press their points home,” he told Der Spiegel. For their part, the AfD – whose representatives are relative newcomers on the talkshow circuit, the party only having been founded in 2014 – have been deeply critical of the extent to which they are excluded from TV debates. Last week that impression was only intensified after Alexander Gauland, the party’s leader, had his invitation to appear on Hart Aber Fair withdrawn in protest at his description of the Nazi era as the equivalent of “a bird shit” in the context of “more than 1,000 years of successful German history”. AfD supporters reacted to the ban with fury on social media, calling it part of a campaign to squeeze the party off the airwaves. Typically a German talkshow concentrates on a single topic for 60 to 90 minutes. Guests invariably include media representatives, at least one member of the cabinet and opposition politicians. Many media watchers have long been critical of the extent to which the arguably tired and unimaginative format dominates German television, accusing programme makers of choosing it because it is cheap – despite Germany having one of the highest licence fees in the world – and blaming it in part for the dramatic fall in viewers in recent years. Controllers of the broadcasters have hit back. “We believe the talk shows are an enriching part of our programming,” Rainald Becker, the editor-in-chief of the ARD told Die Welt. “Of course we discuss Islam now and then, but we also have other topics such as housing, the collapse of bee colonies or the shortage of carers. “And to those who want to complain, I say to them: you know that there’s an off switch.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/populist-talkshows-fuel-rise-of-far-right-german-tv-bosses-told,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/populist-talkshows-fuel-rise-of-far-right-german-tv-bosses-told
2018-06-13T04:00:08Z,world,World news,'Much nicer than expected': World Cup fans size up modern Moscow,"On Tuesday as Moscow was bathed in warm sunshine, the streets around Red Square gave a hint as to what is in store over the next few weeks as the World Cup comes to town. A dozen flag-waving Moroccans walked through the cavernous interiors of the GUM department store, singing in perfect harmony; a Russian family posed for photographs with a quartet of Mexicans in oversized sombreros behind the domes of St Basil’s Cathedral; and three Peruvians clad in their team’s colours joined thousands of locals strolling around the newly landscaped Zaryadye Park in central Moscow.
“It’s much easier to get around than we expected and a much nicer city,” said Carlos, 39, who had travelled from New York to see Peru play in their first World Cup since 1982. He will travel to Peru’s first game, in the city of Saransk, by overnight bus because there were no train or plane tickets available. But he said getting around Moscow, using a combination of Uber and the metro, had been surprisingly straightforward. Moscow’s Luzhniki stadium will host both Thursday’s opening match and the final on 15 July. In between, there will be 10 further games played in the capital, shared between Luzhniki and the Spartak stadium. It is the biggest event hosted in the Russian capital since the 1980 Olympics. During the coming month, much of the spotlight will be on smaller Russian cities not used to hosting major events and unknown to most foreign visitors. But Moscow also has a chance to project a new image as a modern European capital, crafted through extensive renovations and urban planning programmes over the past few years.
“It’s a chance to show everyone that Moscow is not bears on the streets and balalaikas,” said Alexander Polyakov, director of the government institute that oversees the Moscow transport network, voicing a widely held belief that foreign concerns about Russia are due to unfair prejudice and ignorance rather than Russia’s behaviour on the world stage. Some of those visiting may not expect to find a modern metropolis with a pleasant city centre. But under the mayor Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow has changed perhaps more than any other city in Europe over the past few years. Dozens of streets have been fully pedestrianised, pavements have been widened to include bike lanes and more space for those on foot, and a number of parks have been renovated and spruced up. Much of the renovation has been carried out without public consultation, amid allegations of corruption and, in the case of the pavement renovations, often at the cost of extreme inconvenience to Muscovites. But there is little doubt that the result is a city centre that is unrecognisable from a decade ago. Stalinist architecture and monuments still give the city an imposing feel, but at ground level everything has become more humane. “The atmosphere in Moscow is different; the streets have a different rhythm. Now it’s pleasant and convenient to walk in Moscow,” said the deputy mayor, Maxim Liksutov. The cafe and restaurant scene has been transformed, with hipster eateries and artisan coffee now more in evidence than Soviet-style canteens.
Officials are at pains to stress just how welcoming the city will be for foreign visitors during the World Cup. Liksutov pointed out work on the metro and other transport systems in recent months to ensure all signs and announcements are bilingual. Public transport will be free on match days for those with tickets, and the entire metro system will run until 3am after late games. The city government has launched an app in six languages to help visitors and has provided free English-language lessons to 5,000 of the city’s 50,000 licensed taxi drivers. A number of taxi apps work in Moscow, but the city lacks a centralised system of taxis that run on meters. Liksutov said “We’ve asked taxi drivers not to raise their prices for the World Cup and are counting on their cooperation.” However, a yellow taxi on Moscow’s central Tverskaya street, approached on Tuesday and asked in English how much a ride to Sheremetevo airport would cost, quoted a price of 5,000 roubles (£60), about 400% higher than the standard fare. There are other potential pitfalls for visitors, despite the good intentions. While Russian authorities have reduced visa requirements for those with tickets, they have not waived the cumbersome requirement to register with police, a formality for those staying in hotels but a potential nightmare for the hundreds of thousands of fans who will stay in rented apartments. There also remain concerns over potential racism or hooliganism, though the early fan experience suggests problems of an altogether more benign kind. “Everyone is really friendly and I can’t go anywhere without people trying to have their photo taken with me,” said Carlos, the Peru fan. “I’m thinking I should start charging for it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/much-nicer-than-expected-world-cup-fans-size-up-modern-moscow,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/much-nicer-than-expected-world-cup-fans-size-up-modern-moscow
2018-06-13T02:54:21Z,world,World news,Australia says end to South Korea-US war games not a certainty,"The Australian government has cast doubt over whether Donald Trump has suspended military exercises with South Korea, noting that was not part of the joint declaration between the United States and North Korea. On Wednesday the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said the suspension of war games – a surprise concession offered by the US president on Tuesday night that caught South Korea by surprise – was not in the official declaration but “the president spoke about it in answer to a question at a press conference”. “It was not part of the declaration, so we have to take the declaration as being the areas of agreement and build on that,” she said. The US had previously ruled out suspending military exercises because they have been a big part of its military alliance with South Korea and a deterrent against the north. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon
In return for the US commitments, Kim Jong-un signed a joint statement committing to denuclearisation, but analysts say it was vaguely worded and included commitments Pyongyang had made several times. Bishop said: “I don’t believe that suspension for suspension has actually been agreed. The declaration sets up the four points of agreement. “The president has raised a whole range of other issues in his press conference but I think it is too early to say that anything like suspension for suspension has occurred.” Speaking later, the prime minister struck a noticeably more upbeat tone. Malcolm Turnbull declined to answer a question about whether Bishop’s remarks reflected a briefing provided by US officials on Wednesday morning. He instead suggested Trump’s comment about suspending military exercises was “part of the negotiating”. Trump was giving denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula “a red-hot go”.
“Look, president Trump is a deal-maker,” he said. “He is a businessman who has brought a lifetime’s experience of doing deals, of getting to know people, of being able to persuade them to come to an agreement. “And he has chosen to take a very dynamic, very personal approach to this that none of his predecessors have done in the past. “It’s not one that’s been undertaken before. But, you know what? The other approaches haven’t worked.” Bishop made it clear that agreement between Trump and the North Korean dictator had to involve “complete, verifiable, irreversible” denuclearisation. Those conditions were absent from the wording of the joint declaration. When asked why, Trump said on Tuesday: “Because there’s no time. I’m here one day. It wasn’t a big point today because really … this has been taken care of before we got here.” Bishop said Australia had already offered its services with regards to denuclearisation “because we have expertise in that regard”. While expressing cautious optimism about events of the past 48 hours, Bishop stressed the strength of the agreement between Trump and Kim Jong-un “will only be as good as the verification process that North Korea allows”. “We can only determine the success of this meeting by the outcomes, and that will take some time,” she said. “North Korea has committed to a complete denuclearisation. We are yet to understand what North Korea means by denuclearisation.
“We understand what the United States and its allies mean. That is, the complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of the nuclear weapons program that is in defiance of numerous UN security council resolutions.” Bishop said the sanctions against North Korea remained in place and would not be removed until such time as North Korea had proven it has dismantled its nuclear weapons program. She said the global community was at the beginning of a very long process: “The detail is still to be worked through. There will be many more meetings, much more dialogue, a lot of diplomatic work to be done.” On Wednesday Japan’s defence chief said the US military’s presence in South Korea and joint military exercises were “vital” for east Asian security. “We would like to seek an understanding of this between Japan, the US and South Korea,” Japan’s defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, said. Japan would continue joint military exercises with the US and would stick to plans to bolster its defences against a possible ballistic missile strike from North Korea. Although Trump claimed credit on Tuesday evening for the breakthrough – saying “a different president” had put relations on a more productive course – Bishop said on Wednesday morning that the sanctions had been an important catalyst in drawing Kim to the table. Turnbull echoed that line: “I want to say that I do not believe that summit would have occurred had it not been for the absolute solidarity on the very tough economic sanctions on North Korea that have been imposed by the UN security council, that’s had the support, obviously, of the United States and Japan and Australia and other countries, but also China. “I share president Trump’s assessment of that when he thanked the leaders of Japan and South Korea and China for the solidarity they’ve shown.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/australia-says-end-to-south-korea-us-war-games-not-a-certainty,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/australia-says-end-to-south-korea-us-war-games-not-a-certainty
2018-06-13T00:27:59Z,world,World news,Three Rohingya refugees killed as monsoon rains hit Cox's Bazar,"At least three three Rohingya refugees have died in Cox’s Bazar after extreme monsoon rains hit the refugee camps causing lethal mudslides. A 3-year-old Rohingya boy died and his mother was injured when the mud walls of their house in Kutupalong settlement collapsed while they were sleeping. Two Rohingya refugees were killed in Balukhali camp. Mohammad Ali, 20, died after he was crushed by an uprooted tree on Tuesday morning, while a Rohingya woman died after she was crushed in her shack when the rain triggered a landslide. Over the weekend the Bangladeshi region received more than a third of the rainfall it typically receives during the entire monsoon period, damaging thousands of tents and leaving several refugees homeless. After his shack at the bottom of a hill in Balukhali camp was destroyed on Monday, Jafor Alom was living under a makeshift tarpaulin, along with his wife and three children. “It’s only the beginning of the monsoon,” said Alom. “I cannot understand how we will live in this tent-like place for next two or three months when it is likely to rain heavily again. It’s a very bad timing with the Eid [Eid al-Fitr] being a few days away. We are in dire miseries. We cannot celebrate the biggest [Muslim] festival this time at all.”
Rohingya refugee Jamal Hossain said that he has been homeless since a landslide destroyed his house in Balukhali camp on Monday. Having arrived in Cox’s Bazar from Myanmar last September when most land had been taken, his family had been no choice but to erect their tent on a hill. “With my four children and wife now I have taken shelter in a relative’s hut in a neighbouring camp. I don’t know where and how I will build my next shack,” said Hossain. “I have no money to build a new shack. I also don’t know where I will get land. I am really anxious after turning homeless this way.” Noor Hossain, a local Rohingya reporter, told the Guardian at least 500 refugees had been injured after their shacks collapsed in the heavy rain. Over the past few months there has been mounting apprehension about the impact the rains would have on the makeshift camps, which are home to almost a million refugees. There have been 37 landslides so far and agencies are scrambling to move those families in vulnerable areas before there are more casualties. In the Kutapalong settlement, 22 families, totalling 81 people, have been relocated in the past few days. Bangladesh’s refugee relief and rehabilitation commissioner, Mohammad Abul Kalam, said that 30,000 of the 55,000 vulnerable refugees had been relocated and that monsoon preparations in the past weeks had already prevented a much bigger death toll. Caroline Gluck, a UNHCR spokeswoman on the ground in Cox’s Bazar, said that almost nonstop rain for the past few days had been challenging for the refugees and humanitarian agencies. “Before the rains, we have all been working flat out to make the settlements as safe as possible – stabilising slopes, reinforcing pathways, building bridges, and providing stronger, waterproof shelters for refugees,” said Gluck. However, she said more flat land was “urgently needed” to relocate families who were in danger from the impact of the rains. “Our work has helped to prevent many accidents in the settlements, but we really don’t know what will happen in the future if there is massive and sustained rainfall.” she said. “Our fear is more extreme weather will cause further damage, destruction and potential loss of life.” More than 700,000 Rohingya refugees live in Cox’s Bazar, having fled neighbouring Myanmar over the last year following a campaign of violence – described by the UN as having “all the hallmarks of genocide” – which saw tens of thousands killed, houses razed to the ground and women sexually abused. Most of the temporary housing in the camps in Cox’s Bazar is brittle, made from bamboo and tarpaulin, and many of the tents erected on steep inclines are vulnerable to mudslides.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/three-rohingya-refugees-killed-as-monsoon-rains-hit-coxs-bazar,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/three-rohingya-refugees-killed-as-monsoon-rains-hit-coxs-bazar
2018-06-12T21:14:14Z,world,World news,Mexican candidate shot while posing for selfie in latest murder of politician,"Fernando Purón had just finished an election debate with his rival congressional candidates in the Mexican border city of Piedras Negras, when a well-wisher asked to join him for a selfie. But as he posed for the photograph outside the auditorium, a bearded gunman stepped up behind the pair and shot Purón in the head.
The cold-blooded murder on Friday – captured by a CCTV camera – has cast a harsh light on the stunning levels of violence in Mexico and the risk taken by those who run for elected office in the country. Purón was the 112th politician murdered in Mexico since September 2017 when the election process began, according to Etellekt, a risk analysis consultancy. And the country is bracing for more bloodshed before 1 July elections, when voters will pick a new president, renew congress and fill hundreds of state and local positions. The motives for the murder remain uncertain, although Purón had received death threats during his stint as mayor of Piedras Negras, where he had 10 bodyguards and was said to have incurred the displeasure of the city’s dominant crime group, the notoriously ruthless Zetas. During the debate just before his death, Purón had pledged again to defy organised crime, according to the newspaper Vanguardia. “You take on crime head-on – you don’t fear it, you call it for what it is,” he said. “Unfortunately, not all those in power do their job – some are even in cahoots with criminals.” Mexico registered a record number of homicides in 2017 – the 11th year of a militarised crackdown on organised crime.
That the violence is now claiming the lives of candidates and members of the political class is prompting uncomfortable questions in Mexico, where well-paid public servants are often able to protect themselves against crimes such as kidnapping – but have showed a crushing lack of interest in cleaning up corrupt and incompetent police forces. Late on Monday, Rosely Magaña a town council candidate for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in Isla Mujeres, near Cancún, died after a gun attack on her home on Sunday. “[Politicians] can only protect themselves to a certain point,” said Esteban Illades, publisher of the Mexican magazine Nexos. “Violence is so widespread and so vicious that it doesn’t matter how many bodyguards you have.” Drug cartels are suspected in many political murders, which overwhelmingly take place in regions already plagued with violence. Politicians from all parties – and at all levels of government – have been attacked. Earlier this month, three female candidates were murdered within 24 hours. Pamela Terán, a PRI candidate in Oaxaca state, was murdered with a photographer and her driver as she left a restaurant on 2 June. Mexican media reported that Terán’s father had links to organised crime. That same day, a Green party candidate in Puebla, Iraís Maldonado, and the city councilor Erika Cazares were found dead in their car after a campaign rally. Authorities ruled out theft as a motive.
Candidates have also been targeted in regions that have previously escaped the violence. Analysts offer varying theories to explain the growing number of attacks on politicians, including efforts by organised crime to infiltrate local institutions and the growing amount of cash in local government. Federico Estévez, political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, said such attacks reflected the Mexico’s inability to uphold the rule of law. The murder of candidates “creates enormous insecurity, which is felt and bemoaned by the public – and it’s held up in the faces of the politicians for their incapacity to do anything about it. “There’s no bigger example of failure out there today than that.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/mexico-election-politicians-killed-fernando-puron-selfie,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/mexico-election-politicians-killed-fernando-puron-selfie

Trump has ordered the suspension of US military exercises with South Korea, in a surprise concession to Kim. In return, Kim signed a joint statement committing to denuclearisation, but it was a vaguely worded commitment that the regime has made several times before over the past three decades.

2018-06-12T18:52:32Z,world,World news,Paris incident ends with man arrested and hostages released,"A four-hour stand-off between an armed man who took hostages at a building in a northern district of Paris and police has ended without bloodshed. French special forces negotiated with the man, who claimed to have a handgun and a bomb and demanded to be put in contact with the Iranian embassy in Paris, throughout the siege. The man, described by police as “determined and violent”, claimed to have an accomplice outside the building. First indications were that the incident was not terror-related. The hostage-taker reportedly entered the building at 45 Rue des Petites Écuries at around 4pm local time on Tuesday, pretending to be a food delivery courier. He hit one man, who managed to flee. A pregnant woman also managed to escape and was being treated for shock by ambulance services on the scene. The hostages were reportedly held in the internal courtyard of the building, which contains a mix of offices and residential apartments. Within minutes of being alerted, police, French special forces with anti-explosive robots, the fire brigade and ambulance services had surrounded the building.
Police sealed off the area and evacuated the Rue des Petites Écuries. The man who escaped confirmed to police that the hostage-taker had punched him in the face. The assailant reportedly told police negotiators he had a letter that he wished to give to the Iranian ambassador with the request that the ambassador handed it over to the French authorities. Around 8pm local time, Paris police officials confirmed the man had been arrested and the hostages released “safe and sound” but shocked. The suspect had reportedly drenched one of the hostages and the room he was holding them in with petrol. Shortly before 8pm, the French interior minister Gérard Collomb tweeted: “The individual has been arrested and the hostages are out of danger. I salute the professionalism and reaction of the police and emergency services and in particular the BRI of the police prefecture and the Paris fire service whose support was decisive.” A witness living in the building confirmed police had taken away the suspected hostage-taker, wearing a mask and black clothing. According to BFM TV, police officials said the hostage-taker’s claims were “confused” and that he had evoked Iran, Islam, 11 September and the recent murder of a young girl. The channel reported that he is a 27-year-old with no known terrorist links who is unknown to the police and intelligence services and is not on the Fiché S list of potential security threats.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/paris-hostage-situation-special-forces-on-scene-as-man-holds-people-in-building,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/paris-hostage-situation-special-forces-on-scene-as-man-holds-people-in-building
2018-06-12T18:04:52Z,world,World news,Macedonia agrees to new name after 27-year dispute with Greece,"It has taken more than 25 years, divided two nations and been cause for protests great and small, but on Tuesday Greece and Macedonia finally declared peace. After countless rounds of UN-mediated talks, the two Balkan neighbours announced that they had agreed to end the row over what to call the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The tiny state will henceforth be known neither by its acronym, FYROM, nor simply as Macedonia but as the Republic of North Macedonia – a geographical qualifier that ends any fear in Athens of territorial ambition against the neighbouring Greek province of the same name. “After months of negotiation we have managed to reach a deal that will solve our longstanding difference over the name of our neighbour,” said the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras. “They have agreed to rename their country the Republic of North Macedonia, a change that will apply in their international and bilateral relations and domestically.” The new name not only made a clear distinction between Greek Macedonia and the country’s northern neighbour, but put a decisive end to the irredentism the country’s erstwhile title had conveyed, he said. “The deal that we have reached for the first time ensures that they do not have, and in the future can never claim, any relationship to the ancient Greek civilisation of Macedonia. I am deeply convinced that this agreement is a great diplomatic victory, but also a historic opportunity ... a historic moment for the Balkans and our peoples.” The two neighbours have been at loggerheads ever since the former republic seceded from Yugoslavia and declared independence as the Republic of Macedonia. Fuelling fury in Athens, the new Slavic nation had laid claim to ancient Greek figures, not least the warrior king Alexander the Great. Tsipras, whose left-led administration came to power in 2015, had made settlement of the issue a priority. Negotiations brokered by the US mediator Matthew Nimetz accelerated this year following the ascent to power of the Social Democrat Zoran Zaev in Skopje. Zaev told a news conference timed to coincide with Tsipras’ address that the deal preserved the Macedonian ethnic and cultural identity. Both its language and people would continue to be known as Macedonian. The agreement would be put to popular vote in a referendum later this year, he said. Tsipras and Zaev, both in their early forties with instinctively anti-nationalist reflexes, had long taken a progressive view on a dispute that had not only harmed bilateral ties but also held up Macedonia’s membership of the EU and Nato. As evidence mounted of Russian mischief-making in the Balkans, the dispute had also fuelled growing fears of destabilisation in the region. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, was among the first to welcome what he described as a historic agreement and urged both sides to finalise it. “This will set Skopje on its path to Nato membership, and it will help to consolidate peace and stability across the wider western Balkans,” he said in a statement. In what will be seen as a moment of success for Europe, Zaev is expected to present the agreed settlement to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, during talks in Berlin on Wednesday. The European council president, Donald Tusk, tweeted: “Sincere congratulations to PM @tsipras_eu and PM @Zoran_Zaev. I am keeping my fingers crossed. Thanks to you the impossible is becoming possible.” The two countries had been in a race to secure a solution before an EU summit in late June. For both Tsipras and Zaev it has taken political courage to get this far. The nationalist backlash in both countries is likely to be fierce with opponents already deriding the accord as an act of treachery. Greece’s main opposition leader, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, denounced the deal, arguing that it amounted to Athens accepting the existence of a Macedonian language and nation. Officials on both sides, however, insisted that boldness was required if one of the most obdurate, if abstruse diplomatic rows was to be put to rest. Stelios Koulouglou, an MEP with Tsipras’ Syriza party, said: “For far too long Greece had been ridiculed because of this dispute. In the future this will be a lesson in diplomacy in how to avoid turning a minor feud into a major international issue because of nationalism and its poisonous rhetoric.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/macedonia-agrees-to-new-name-after-27-year-dispute-with-greece,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/macedonia-agrees-to-new-name-after-27-year-dispute-with-greece
2018-06-12T16:56:44Z,world,World news,EU to triple spending to €5bn a year targeting illegal migration,"The EU will establish a 10,000-strong standing corp of guards to patrol its land and sea borders under plans that will see the bloc triple its spending to €5bn (£4.4bn) a year on targeting illegal migration into the bloc, it has announced. The building of new border infrastructure including scanners, automated number plate recognition systems, and mobile laboratories for sample analysis, will also be prioritised, along with the establishment of teams of sniffer dogs.
Announcing its €34.9bn spending plan for 2021 to 2027, the European commission insisted, however, that it would not fund the installation of fences on the EU’s borders. Hungary’s right-wing prime minister Viktor Orbán, last year called on the EU to co-finance fences along its shared borders with Serbia and Croatia. A commission statement said its funding was “aimed at ensuring proper control of borders, not closing them. The commission has never financed fences and will not do so under the new EU budget either.” Frans Timmermans, the commission’s first vice-president, said: “Based on past experience and the knowledge that migration will remain a challenge in the future, we are proposing an unprecedented increase in funding. Strengthening our common EU borders, in particular with our European Border and Coast Guard, will continue to be a big priority.” While the earmarking of extra funding is widely approved by the EU’s member states, they remain deeply fractured over their migration and asylum policies after two years of disputes. The commission is taking Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to the European court of justice over their failure to respect a mandatory quota system that was designed to relocate about 120,000 largely Syrian refugees. Hungary has not relocated any refugees since the quotas were introduced while Poland has not done so since 2016. The Czech Republic has not relocated anyone since August. Another faultline is the Dublin mechanism under which the member state first receiving a refugee must take responsibility for them. It has been proposed that this rule could be time-limited, so that refugees finding a home over a number of years in one country could not then be sent to another, but the EU cannot agree on the length of the time limit. A failure to reach a consensus on the reform of the system has led to Austria, Belgian and Denmark proposing radical plans for shutting the borders and establishing camps in non-EU states. Herbert Kickl, Austria’s interior minister and a member of the far-right Freedom party, recently suggested the EU requires a “small Copernican revolution” on migration. Austria is taking over the rolling presidency of the European council in July. The parties in the new Italian government, the far-right League and the populist Five Star Movement, are exploiting the potency of the issue. On Monday, Matteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right interior minister, declared victory after a standoff over the fate of 629 people on a humanitarian rescue boat. Italy had refused to allow the MS Aquarius to dock at the weekend. The Spanish government stepped in to allow the boat to disembark on their territory, although the offer required an additional two days at sea for those on board, including the 100 children. During a press conference in Strasbourg to announce the new spending, Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner for migration, home affairs and citizenship, said: “This is only one vessel and incident. Another 937 people have been saved by the Italian coastguard and are being transported to Catania as we speak.” The commission wants its proposed budget to be agreed by member states and MEPs before the next European parliament elections in May 2019, two months after the UK leaves the EU.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/eu-5bn-a-year-targeting-illegal-migration-border-infrastructure,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/eu-5bn-a-year-targeting-illegal-migration-border-infrastructure
2018-06-12T16:49:12Z,world,World news,Solidarity of heirs on the Trump and Kim surreality show,"The Singapore summit was destined for success. Donald Trump had predicted as much on waking at the Shangri-La hotel, and by his own account the president was not disappointed. Trump had primed the world for a triumph. Like a dawn artillery barrage, softening up enemy lines and setting conditions for victory, Trump had fired off a string of tweets at 6am hitting out at his critics, the naysayers, and promising his followers: “We will be fine!” His hunch was proved right and his meeting with Kim Jong-un turned out to be as successful as he had foretold, something he was able to confirm within the first 10 minutes of meeting Kim. “I feel really great. I think it’s gonna be really successful and I think we will have a terrific relationship,” Trump said, sitting alongside Kim in the first session of a summit he had earlier described as “getting-to-know-you plus”. The hotel where the two men met, the Capella, is a former British barracks and a reminder of the pleasant life of colonial officers, spotless in white paint with wide verandahs behind rows of grand arches. The colonnades, an echo of the White House, provided a photogenic backdrop for the two leaders to stroll up and down in conversation.
The personal warmth only got deeper as they day went on. By the end of five hours, after Kim had signed the joint statement and flow back to Pyongyang, Trump was talking about a special bond between them, and appeared ready to defend Kim to the bitter end. Asked about the North Korean leader’s penchant for killing his own relatives and starving his own people, Trump replied: “Well he is very talented. Anybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and is able to run it and run it tough.” “I don’t say he was nice,” the president cautioned unless anyone had got the wrong idea. “He ran it, few people at that age. You can take 1 out of 10,000 could not do it.” The remarks added ballast to a hitherto speculative notion that Trump identified with Kim’s backstory. They both took over the family business at a young age from unscrupulous but idolised fathers. It was solidarity among heirs. At his side Kim said little, apparently content to allow Trump to act as a master of ceremonies and cheerleader. With his perpetual flow of honeyed adjectives and careful stage-management, the US president, a former reality show host, conducted the summit as if it were a TV dating show – one in which Trump was both compère and suitor. As the two delegations sat down for a working lunch, Trump called out to the waiting Singaporean photographers: “Getting a good picture everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin? Perfect.” Kim, who probably does not hear too many fat guy jokes back in Pyongyang, looked astonished.
There are no pictures to record the look on the North Korean leader’s face when Trump produced an iPad and showed Kim and his aides a specially commissioned advertorial video on the benefits of complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement. Produced in the style of the trailer for a straight-to-video 1980s action movie, it cast Kim and Trump as a pair of heroes struggling to save the world and its 7 billion people. “There comes a time when only a few are called upon to make a difference, but the question is what difference will the few make?” the portentous narrator asked. “One moment. One choice. What if? The future remains to be written.”
Trump was so delighted with the video that he had it shown to the press while they waited for his arrival. “We had it made up,” he declared. “I showed it to [Kim] today. Actually during the meeting. Toward the end of the meeting. I think he loved it.” It has been a long time since Trump has been this ebullient. He claimed to have tried to persuade Kim to look at his country from a “real estate perspective”, speculating on what the beaches currently used for war games might fetch on the open market. “I said look at that view. That would make a great condo,” Trump said. He joshed with almost every reporter he called on to ask a question, and even pleaded with his spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, allow the session to run overtime. “I don’t care,” Trump said. “Hey, you know, it just means we get home later in the evening, right?”
No amount of scepticism or snarkiness from the press was going to dent Trump’s mood. He seemed genuinely unaware that the promises he had received about North Korean denuclearisation had been made, in somewhat firmer language, by Kim’s father and grandfather in earlier decades. This time it would be different, Trump promised, because this time there was “a different administration and different president and a different secretary of state”. It was, in a way, a statement of the Trump doctrine. The ethereal, somewhat quirky nature of the venue helped the atmospherics. From early in the morning, the streets of central Singapore were blocked off and lined by police as the two leaders set off in their motorcades from their separate hotels for the island of Sentosa, a name apparently derived from the Sanskrit for peace and contentment. It was an improvement on the old Malay name, Pulau Belakang Mati, which meant “the island where danger lurks behind your back”, reflecting a dark past as a pirates’ lair. The Singapore tourist industry had gone one step further in the island’s rebranding, dubbing it the State of Fun, a place to escape the realities of everyday life.
Along the way to their meeting, the two leaders drove past a turreted Disney-inspired castle and a rollercoaster, both set in lush foliage. The whimsical backdrop was not lost on Kim, whose father was a film fanatic and whose family has stayed in power in part because of their ability to create an alternate reality for their population. At one point within the first few minutes, as they were strolling down the white-arched colonnade, Kim turned to Trump and said: “Many people in the world will think of this as a ... form of fantasy ... from a science-fiction movie.” He could have had no way of knowing that Trump had actually had a science fiction movie made, starring the two of them as messianic saviours of the planet. But judging from the outcome of the summit, it is just possible that his instinct for handling Trump was far better than the American’s much vaunted intuition about dealing with Kim.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/solidarity-of-heirs-on-the-trump-and-kim-surreality-show,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/solidarity-of-heirs-on-the-trump-and-kim-surreality-show
2018-06-12T12:37:40Z,world,World news,Optimism and confusion in Seoul over Trump-Kim summit,"Seoul has reacted with a mixture of optimism and confusion to the historic summit between Donald Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, after the US president announced an end to joint military exercises with South Korea. Leaders from around the region sought to capitalise on the momentum of the meeting, which resulted in a signed agreement that was light on substance but held up by Trump as a victory. The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, welcomed the outcome of the summit and praised the “courage and determination of the two leaders”. “This is just a beginning and there may be many difficulties ahead but we will never go back to the ways of the past and never give up on this bold journey,” Moon said in a statement. “It is a great victory achieved by both the United States and the two Koreas, and a huge step forward for people across the world who long for peace.” But Trump’s pledge to halt longstanding military drills with South Korea sparked widespread confusion. The exercises have been repeatedly criticised by Pyongyang, which in the past has responded with missile tests. The South Korean military issued a statement to NBC News saying: “Regarding President Trump’s comment regarding ending of the combined military drills … we need to find out the exact meaning or intention behind his comments at this point.” For its part, North Korea agreed to “work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, language which was open to interpretation and fell short of Washington’s long-stated goal of complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. No report of the summit was broadcast on North Korean television, where it is not uncommon for news to be delayed or even ignored. Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, praised the agreement’s references to denuclearisation and said he was willing to engage with Pyongyang to resolve the cold war abductions of Japanese citizens by North Korean spies. “I’m determined that Japan will have to directly face North Korea and resolve [the abductions] bilaterally,” Abe said. China also appeared to want to seize on the positive atmosphere. “The United States and North Korea have been in a state of antagonism for more than half a century,” said the foreign minister, Wang Yi. “Today, that the two countries’ highest leaders can sit together and have equal talks has important and positive meaning and is creating a new history.” China suggested the international community could consider lifting economic sanctions on North Korea. “Sanctions are a means, not an end,” said Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China’s ministry of foreign affairs. “The [UN] security council’s actions should support and conform to the efforts of current diplomatic talks towards denuclearising the Korean peninsula.” The comment by Chinese officials suggests the US policy of “maximum pressure” on Pyongyang until it relinquishes nuclear weapons is already showing signs of cracking. There have been reports that Kim’s charm offensive over recent months has led China to relax restrictions on trade with North Korea, violating UN sanctions. Trump alluded to relaxed Chinese restrictions, which have come without substantial concessions from Pyongyang, in a press conference in which he also praised the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, for implementing sanctions. “He really closed up that border … but maybe not in the last couple of months but that’s OK,” the president said. At a train station in Seoul, people cheered and applauded as televisions screens broadcast the Trump-Kim handshake live. But the reaction among many South Koreans was disappointment, and in the community of North Korean refugees now living south of the border there was a feeling of betrayal.
Choi Jung-hoon, a member of the North Korean Liberation Front, a quasi-military group that advocates for the overthrow of the regime in Pyongyang, said he was furious at the outcome of the summit, which had led to “only good things for Kim Jong-un”. Choi was an army officer in North Korea’s cyber-hacking unit for almost 20 years before he escaped in 2006. “Trump completely lost to Kim, he was dragged around by Kim,” Choi said. “This has all been a political show by Trump, North Korea got away with everything they wanted. They said they will ‘denuclearise’, nothing has been said in detail.” Choi was dismayed that the US demand for complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement was absent from the agreement, and he was particularly disappointed human rights were not prominently featured. The UN estimates North Korea is holding up to 120,000 political prisoners and says the regime is guilty of crimes against humanity. Another refugee, Jung Gwang-il, who works to smuggle information into North Korea, said he was “moderately disappointed”. He previously worked at state-run trading companies but was later sent to a labour camp and tortured. He arrived in South Korea in 2004. “Promising security for Kim’s regime will mean he can stay in power and will just keep on oppressing the North Korean people,” Jung said. “If denuclearisation happens while people in North Korea are dying, it’s pointless.” Many North Koreans who have fled over the border are deeply suspicious of the Kim family, with many having suffered physical or mental abuse at the hands of the regime. Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said the summit proved that diplomacy was the right path to follow, as the bloc had done on the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which Trump derided and abandoned last month.

2018-06-12T11:33:18Z,world,World news,French photographer at centre of Nobel row charged with rape,"The French photographer at the centre of allegations of sexual assault, which contributed to the postponement of this year’s Nobel prize in literature, has been charged with two cases of rape by prosecutors in Stockholm. Jean-Claude Arnault, who is married to a member of the body that awards the prize, faces up to six years in prison if found guilty. “I think the supporting evidence is robust and strong enough to indict him,” prosecutor Christina Voigt said on Tuesday. The plaintiff accuses Arnault, who ran Forum, a literary venue in Stockholm, of raping her in October 2011 and again in December 2011. “In one of the suspected rapes there was violence,” Voigt said. “And in the other she was asleep.” To support the prosecution, police have over the past six months held interviews with the alleged victim, with several witnesses, and with Arnault himself. Arnault denies the allegations. “He is both disturbed and resigned,” his lawyer, Björn Hurtig, told Expressen. “He says this is totally wrong and he is completely innocent of the allegations.” Eighteen women came forward in November in an article in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper to accuse Arnault of sexually harassing or assaulting them. The accusations led to a split in the Swedish Academy, the institution that awards the Nobel prize in literature, over its handling of the allegations, and in particular over whether Arnault’s wife, the poet Katarina Frostenson, should continue to be a member. Arnault has also been suspected of leaking the names of winners of the prestigious award seven times since 1996, which he denies. Three members of the 18-strong academy vacated their seats in April in protest at a decision not to expel Frostenson, followed days later by the permanent secretary, Sara Danius, and by Frostenson herself. The academy announced in May it would postpone the award of the 2018 prize, the first time the award has been delayed since 1949. The trial, which Voigt said would probably take place in the autumn, will be held behind closed doors and the plaintiff will remain anonymous. Elizabeth Massi Fritz, the plaintiff’s lawyer, said her client was “relieved and pleased” by the prosecutor’s decision. “There is extensive supporting evidence which will be tested in court,” she said in a text message sent to the Expressen newspaper. “My client has felt very bad as a result of the events, and she has been violated and humiliated in a very serious way.” The novelist Gabriella Håkansson, one of the women who spoke in the Dagens Nyheter article, told the Guardian she was “very pleased” about the prosecution. “This is what we have been striving for the whole time, and now it will finally be tested in court,” she said. “This woman will stand symbolically for everyone who has come forward as witness to what he has done.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/french-photographer-jean-claude-arnault-nobel-row-charged-rape,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/french-photographer-jean-claude-arnault-nobel-row-charged-rape
2018-06-12T08:27:38Z,world,World news,What have Trump and Kim signed? We read between the lines,"The wording of the document signed by Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un on Tuesday falls some way short of the dramatic billing the president gave it at the end of the leaders’ historic summit in Singapore. Trump described it as a “very comprehensive” agreement that would “take care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world”. There is significance, of course, in the fact that the two men met at all, and ended their five hours together with the genesis of what could lead to more substantive moves towards denuclearisation. But as it stands, the document does not differ greatly from the agreement issued by Kim and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, after their meeting on the southern side of the demilitarised zone at the end of April. The Trump-Kim document contains four main points: The United States and the DPRK [the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] commit to establish new US-DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity. That represents a departure from the fiery rhetoric that has traditionally characterised relations between Washington and Pyongyang, the latter of which routinely uses state propaganda to depict the US as an enemy power intent on destroying the regime and its people. It also reflects Kim’s desire to focus on economic progress – now possibly with American assistance – having achieved his aim of developing nuclear weapons capable of threatening the mainland US and bringing the president to the negotiating table. The United States and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. There is no direct commitment here to formalise those sentiments with a peace treaty to replace the armistice signed at the end of the Korean war in 1953. That would require the involvement of China and other countries that took part in the conflict. As expected, Trump offered “unspecified” security guarantees to North Korea, a gesture whose vagueness matches that of Kim’s commitment to denuclearise. Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. This is the most critical, and easily the most problematic, of the leaders’ statements. It does not meet Washington’s long-stated goal of complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, but simply restates Kim’s position after his summit with Moon. No serious analysts expected the North Korean leader to commit to CVID in his first meeting with Trump. That process – if it happens at all – could take years and cost billions of dollars. It also fails to define what is meant by denuclearisation. In Washington, it requires Kim to abandon his nuclear ambitions. But the North Korean interpretation is more complicated. The regime believes it should include the withdrawal of the US nuclear umbrella from South Korea, possibly including the withdrawal of all 28,500 US troops ranged along the South’s border with the North. As the Atlantic Council’s Alexander Vershbow said, it comes down to the difference between the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and the denuclearisation of North Korea. The United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified. One of the many legacies of the 1950-53 Korean war is the recovery and repatriation of the remains of prisoners of war and soldiers who went missing in action. “Remains of an estimated 5,300 missing American service members are in North Korea and potentially recoverable,” according to Stars and Stripes. “Because of an intensely strained relationship between the two countries, there’s been no successful effort to collect the remains since 2005.” This is probably the most risk-averse gesture Kim could have agreed to at the summit. Japan, however, will be disappointed that the text makes no mention of Japanese nationals who were abducted by North Korean agents during the cold war. It remains to be seen if Trump raised those abductions during his talks with Kim, having promised to do so in a phone call with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, on Monday.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/jun/12/trump-and-kim-document-analysis-singapore-agreement-denuclearisation,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/jun/12/trump-and-kim-document-analysis-singapore-agreement-denuclearisation
2018-06-12T08:15:02Z,world,World news,Singapore summit: what we learned from the Trump-Kim meeting,"The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has committed Pyongyang to “work towards” the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula in an agreement signed with the US president, Donald Trump, in Singapore. It also commits the two countries “peace and prosperity”. The US and North Korea also agreed to recover the remains of prisoners of war from the conflict between North and South Korea, and the immediate repatriation of those already identified. The vague nature of the agreement and the lack of other specific details were greeted with disappointment by analysts. Robert Kelly, professor of political science at Pusan National University, says the text is “even thinner than most sceptics anticipated”. Trump said the US would halt joint military drills with longtime ally South Korea. The exercises have infuriated North Korea for years and if Trump follows through with this pledge, which was announced at a press conference and not in signed documents, it would be a big concession to Pyongyang. North Korea will be dismantling a missile facility, according to Trump. This was another item not detailed in the signed documents, but Trump said at a briefing Kim had pledged to begin winding down some facilities. This claim could not be immediately confirmed. South Korea praised the outcome and both Trump and Kim. But President Moon Jae-in acknowledged there could be difficulties ahead, and most experts agree there will need to be many more meetings to hammer out the details. China welcomed the summit as historic. The fact that the two leaders “can sit together and have equal talks has important and positive meaning, and is creating a new history,” the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, told reporters. He also talked of the need for a peace mechanism for the peninsula. Trump has said his talks with Kim Jong-un were “better than anybody could imagine”. The two leaders initially met in private for 38 minutes accompanied only by translators. They later held a working lunch with top aides. The talks were the first time a sitting US president has had a meeting with a leader of North Korea. Trump and Kim met on the steps of the Capella hotel on Sentosa island in Singapore and shook hands in front of a display of US and North Korean flags. The handshake lasted about 12 seconds. Speaking through an interpreter Kim said: “Many people in the world will think of this as a form of fantasy from a science fiction movie.” After the signing ceremony Kim’s motorcade headed for the airport. Sitting together for a brief photo call before officials talks, Trump said it was an “honour” to be there with the North Korean leader. Kim said the pair had overcome many “obstacles” to make it to the summit. The leaders’ mutual friend Dennis Rodman appeared on TV during the summit in an emotional sideshow, saying: “It’s a great day. I’m here to see it. I’m so happy.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/singapore-meeting-what-we-know-so-far,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/singapore-meeting-what-we-know-so-far
2018-06-12T07:53:46Z,world,World news,The most bizarre moments from the Kim-Trump summit,"Here are the oddities that stood out from Tuesday’s historic meeting between the US and North Korean leaders: 1. Welcome to the matrix Even Kim recognised how bizarre a meeting it was; a meeting of equals between the leader of an impoverished rogue nation and the president of the most powerful country in the world. “Many people in the world will think of this as a ... form of fantasy ... from a science-fiction movie,” Kim said, through an interpreter. Just months ago the two were trading threats of nuclear war and calling each other “fat” and a “dotard”.
2. Raw emotion The former basketball star Dennis Rodman, the American who has spent the most time with Kim, was interviewed by CNN about the summit and broke down in tears. In a rambling interview, he claimed credit for the summit taking place and described how he had received death threats when he first met Kim. “But I took all those bullets, I took all at that … but I’m still standing. Today is a great day for everybody: Singapore, Tokyo, China, everybody … it’s a great day. I’m here to see it. I’m so happy.”
3. Inside ‘the Beast’ During a brief walk, Trump guided Kim over to his custom Cadillac limousine and gave him a peek inside. The car, nicknamed “the Beast”, is armour-plated and has its own oxygen supply in case of a chemical attack. Given Kim’s reported fear of being assassinated, he may want to buy one for himself if relations warm.
4. Custom pen Trump and Kim signed three documents with a black pen emblazoned in gold with the US president’s signature. Photographs of the document emerged online, showing that Kim committed to “complete denuclearisation” and Trump to providing “security guarantees”. It was the icing on the cake of a day that was largely about photo ops and symbolism, and light on substance in dealing with North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.
5. ‘Nice and handsome and thin’
Trump joked with press photographers before he sat down to lunch with Kim, asking them to ensure their pictures made the two leaders look “nice and handsome and thin”. Kim’s blank reaction has been mocked online, although he may not have understood the president’s remark because it was not translated in full by Trump’s Korean interpreter. • This article was amended on 13 June 2018 because an earlier version referred to a translator, when an interpreter was meant.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/the-most-bizarre-moments-from-kim-trump-summit,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/the-most-bizarre-moments-from-kim-trump-summit
2018-06-12T07:00:43Z,world,World news,Colombians who once fled war now forced to run from catastrophic flooding,"It is nearly 20 years since Eva Celdi Higuita was forced to run from her home on the banks of the river Cauca in western Colombia by leftwing rebels. Now, she has been forced to flee the same patch of land once more, after floods caused by a massive new dam project left her home underwater. “It happened from one moment to another,” Higuita said, wringing her frail hands with agitation. She and 14 family members are now sharing a tiny house in the town of Sabanalarga, about an hour’s walk from the muddy waters of the rising river. “We had to run like we were running from an armed group.”
The Bajo Cauca region in the western province of Antioquia was once a battleground as the rival factions in Colombia’s multi-sided civil war jostled for control. Massacres and pitched battles were commonplace – and all too often civilians were caught in the middle. But following a peace deal with Colombia’s largest rebel group, the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces Colombia (Farc), another conflict has come into focus: one unleashed by massive development projects that upend livelihoods and displace thousands of the people they purport to help. After a tunnel collapsed last month at Colombia’s largest hydroelectric dam project, heavy floods displaced hundreds and led authorities to evacuate thousands more. Since then, torrential downpours and a spate of landslides have caused water levels along the river to rise, putting up to 120,000 more people at risk should the Hidroituango dam breach. If that happens, or should water cascade over its wall – both risks that the United Nations Environment Programme has highlighted – the consequences could be catastrophic both for those living nearby – and for EPM, the state-owned company behind the project. EPM workers are rushing to repair and complete the dam, but they have occasionally been evacuated as geological conditions worsen. Meanwhile, in Sabanalarga, about 200 people are sleeping rough in the public square without any aid from the government. Others have taken refuge in an EPM office and the town’s school. Higuita, who is illiterate, used to pan for gold at the riverside, and has no work prospects in Sabanalarga. “What can we do now? Where will we work?”
Before running from the floodwaters, Higuita – a member of the Nutabe indigenous group – had already been displaced three times by violence. This region, about 100 miles north of the city of Medellín, was for decades the setting for conflict between leftwing rebels and paramilitary militias allied with state forces. In the 12 municipalities close to the dam, local activists have documented 73 massacres since the 1980s. A 2016 peace deal with the Farc formally ended five decades of civil war, but for the communities around Hidroituango, however, peace still seems distant. “We haven’t seen anything of the peace process here,” said Fredy García, a fisherman who used to supplement his income by panning for gold.
García’s brother disappeared in 1999 after a skirmish between guerrilla fighters and paramilitaries. His body was never found, and García suspects that his unmarked grave – like many others – is now under flood water. Ríos Vivos, a local campaign group opposed to the Hidroituango project, claims that about 700 bodies may already be lost to the flooding, some in civil war mass graves and others in indigenous cemeteries. EPM says it has worked to exhume and relocate about 300 cadavers from gravesites at risk of flooding, though the majority have decomposed so much they can no longer be identified. And many in Sabanalarga say that this latest displacement has been the most distressing. “This is way worse than being forced out by armed groups,” said Guillermo González, another refugee. “Now we can’t go back because the river is too high – and nature didn’t cause this.” Locals say that EPM has effectively supplanted the state in the region. The company has deployed riot police to force nomadic indigenous communities from land assigned to the megaproject – something permitted by law as the dam is considered to be of public use. It has also contracted four private security companies and a handful of military and police battalions. Unlike victims of conflict, those displaced by development projects have no access to compensation from the Colombian state, and find themselves in an even more precarious situation. Those who give up their lands to Hidroituango – or any of a plethora of mining and palm oil projects across the country – rely on handouts from the corporations working the land. EPM did not respond to requests for comment, while representatives from Colombia’s environment ministry were not available for interview. Colombian authorities do not keep track of how many have been affected by development projects, though 15 million people worldwide are forced to leave their homes every year for such schemes, according to a recent study. In stark contrast to the scenes at Sabanalarga, humanitarian assistance is plentiful in Valdivia, a town 25 miles downstream from the dam: pickup trucks emblazoned with Red Cross logos carry food parcels around the town and the school and public football pitch have been repurposed as shelters, with about 700 people in temporarily accommodated. William Gutiérrez, a fisherman and gold prospector, now shares a tent with his brother and a stranger after escaping the floods last month, with nothing but the clothes he was wearing. It wasn’t the first time he had fled. In 1997, rightwing paramilitaries arrived at his home in the remote hamlet of El Aro, hunting for Farc collaborators. One of his younger brothers was accused of being a rebel supporter and was murdered along with 14 others. Gutiérrez claims the militiamen told him they were there to clear land for the nascent hydroelectric dam project. “They said that we were on land that would be used [for the dam],” said Gutiérrez. “When we refused to leave, that’s when they started shooting.” In his eyes, the flood was a tragedy foretold. “We’ve always said this river could not be dammed,” he said as vultures circled overhead. “But the dam is more important to those in power than our lives.”
At the dam site, locals now wait for hours to cross the new reservoir on a boat service provided by the company. The road they used to take is now at the bottom of the reservoir, while a tunnel through the mountains was recently blocked by a landslide. Despite the controversies, the Hidroituango dam is being touted as a landmark project by the government and EPM. At full capacity the dam should be capable of generating an annual average of 13,930 gigawatt hours through its eight massive turbines. The project has received funding from IDB Invest, the private-sector branch of the Inter-American Development Bank and a number of private banks. Locals filed a complaint to the IDB to investigate whether its investment wing broke environmental and social standards.
Isabel Zuleta, a vocal Ríos Vivos activist, questions the necessity of the project. “Colombia’s current energy production is sufficient for the nation, but international markets are already buying energy from here,” she said. Zuleta also worries about the security of those who campaign against the dam: two other Ríos Vivos members in Antioquia were murdered last month, part of a worrying trend in Colombia. In the first, after the peace deal was signed, 121 human rights defenders were killed. “Our main concern is getting through this alive,” Zuleta said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/colombia-river-cauca-breach-flooding-farc,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/colombia-river-cauca-breach-flooding-farc
2018-06-12T06:13:26Z,world,World news,US de facto embassy in Taiwan reopens as 'symbol of strength' of ties,"America’s de facto embassy in Taiwan has reopened after a $250m renovation, with an attending US official hailing the new building as “a symbol of strength and vibrancy” of the relationship between the US and Taiwan.
A ceremony at the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) on Tuesday, which took place while the landmark summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore had the world’s attention, was attended by a delegation from Washington that included Marie Royce, the US assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs. Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, several Taiwanese government officials as well as legislators were also present. During the ceremony, US ambassador James Moriarty and Royce reiterated Washington’s commitment to uphold the relationship with Taiwan, calling the new facility “a symbol of strength and vibrancy of the US and Taiwan partnership in the 21st century”.
“AIT’s new home is a tangible symbol that reflects the strength of our ties,” said Royce. “It’s a state-of-the-art facility that will make possible even greater cooperation for many years to come.” The ceremony comes at a time when bilateral relations between Beijing and Washington have been severely tested over ongoing trade negotiations and rising tensions in the disputed South China Sea. China has been ramping up pressure on Taiwan since the election in 2016, blocking the self-ruled island from participating in international organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and poaching its diplomatic allies.
Beijing has also increased the frequency of military exercises in the last few months, including deploying its own aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, in the Taiwan Strait. On Monday night, China’s state-run tabloid Global Times published an editorial, suggesting Beijing should warn the US and Taiwan of possible consequences for any provocative move. “We must draw a red line for the US and Taiwan,” Global Times said through the editorial. “Once crossed, a serious Taiwan Straits crisis will be triggered.” Despite media speculation that Trump would send the new national security advisor John Bolton to the ceremony, the US president exercised restrain. Kharis Templeman, a social science research associate at Stanford University’s Walter H. Shorenstein Asia Pacific research center, said that given the delicate nature of the summit in Singapore, the Trump administration may have chosen not to use the occasion to make a strong symbolic statement. However, Templeman suggested the ceremony should not be interpreted as revealing the Trump administration’s Taiwan policy in general. “High-level visits can be arranged at any time, not just when AIT inaugurates a new building,” Templeman told the Guardian. “Any US administration would have made a similar set of statements at the official opening.” The American Institute in Taiwan is not an official embassy, but a non-profit institution established by the US government to represent its interests since Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979 under the One China policy.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/us-de-facto-embassy-in-taiwan-reopens-as-symbol-of-strength-of-ties,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/us-de-facto-embassy-in-taiwan-reopens-as-symbol-of-strength-of-ties
2018-06-12T05:24:23Z,world,World news,Tuesday briefing: Trump and Kim embark on 'terrific relationship',"Top story: It happened – Donald Trump meets Kim Jong-un Hello, it’s Warren Murray with the news this morning. There were remarkable scenes in Singapore overnight where Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have been holding their historic summit. We are continuing our live coverage after the two leaders came face to face at the Capella hotel on Sentosa island. Kim arrived first and met Trump on the steps of the hotel, where they shook hands for about 12 seconds in front of a display of US and North Korean flags. It is the first time a sitting US president has met with a leader of North Korea. Here are some picture highlights from the unfolding events.
In latest developments: after a working lunch with their teams of aides, Trump in typically superlative terms said talks had gone “better than anybody could imagine”, and that he and the North Korean leader were on the way to “a signing”, indicating they will release a joint statement about the summit. Earlier, heading into the first of several meetings, Trump said he was confident of “tremendous success”. Kim said “it has not been easy to get here” and that “the old prejudices and practices worked as obstacles, but we have overcome them and we are here today”. Speaking in unprecedented fashion in front of the world’s press, the North Korean dictator said the summit was “a big prelude to peace”. “I believe so too,” said Trump. Korea’s state-run media has hailed the “wide-ranging and profound talks” being held “under the great attention and expectation of the whole world”. The relative speed with which state media reported on Kim’s arrival suggests the regime’s degree of confidence about the meeting. Han Il-gwang, a Pyongyang resident, said: “When I woke up this morning, I saw the news in the newspaper that our respected marshal went to Singapore for the North Korea-US summit. I know Singapore is a very hot country, so I wish that our respected marshal stays healthy and comes back in good health.” Richard Wolffe reminds us that even as Trump appears as peacemaker in Singapore, he has been busy waging metaphorical war against Canada and the G7. And for his part, Kim’s old friend Dennis Rodman was reduced to tears on CNN as he watched the scenes of rapprochement unfold. The former basketballer, who has visited North Korea several times, said he had been damned for his own attempts to conciliate between the two sides. “I couldn’t even go home. I had to hide out for 30 days. But I kept my head up high, brother. I knew things were going to change.” * * * ‘Back me on the bill’ – Theresa May has appealed directly to rebel Tory MPs to back her on the Brexit bill, which returns to the House of Commons today. The House of Lords sent 15 changes to the EU withdrawal bill back to MPs, and the cliff-hanger is an amendment to give parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal to withdraw from the EU. The sticking point is what happens next if parliament ultimately rejects the deal. The government is trying to broker a compromise – Labour is petitioning rebel Tories to stay the course and help defeat the government, though Labour has its own leave-remain divisions to deal with. For now at least, May has avoided a damaging potential defeat over a customs union with the EU – that appears to have been set aside until July. * * * Out the trolls, says MP – Labour’s Jess Phillips is calling for an end to absolute online anonymity, saying she has been bombarded with more than 600 rape threats in a single night. Facebook, Twitter and other social networks should be made to record people’s real identities, said Phillips. The security minister, Ben Wallace, has called for digital IDs to end online anonymity; while Theresa May has used the G7 summit to call for tech companies to tackle attacks against women. * * * Hands on the wheel – Carmakers are being criticised for letting buyers think their vehicles can drive themselves. Fatal accidents involving Tesla’s Autopilot system have highlighted the need for drivers to be much more aware of the need to stay in charge. In the UK, a man was banned from driving for 18 months after switching on the Autopilot feature in his Tesla on the M1 and switching to the passenger’s seat. “The capability of current road vehicle technologies must not be oversold,” said Matthew Avery from Thatcham Research. “Names like Autopilot or ProPilot are deeply unhelpful, as they infer the car can do a lot more than it can.” * * * Students hit books, not drugs – A survey of illegal drug use among students has turned up some surprises. Of 1,000 undergraduates who took part, 71% said they had not taken drugs. The small-scale survey conducted on behalf of the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi), a thinktank, contrasts with one by the National Union of Students where 56% of respondents said they had used drugs at some point. Nick Hillman, the Hepi director, said its survey was “an important corrective to some of the wilder ideas about today’s students. They are more hardworking and less hedonistic than is often supposed.” * * * Still batting on: “The greater mouse-eared bat is so large that observers who first discovered it in Britain likened one to a young rabbit hanging from a wall. In flight, its wings can stretch to nearly half a metre.” And, to the best of anyone’s knowledge, there is only one of them left in the UK. He lives in a secret tunnel in West Sussex, and Patrick Barkham was desperate to meet him. Lunchtime read: Astronaut sets course for the Moon Chris Hadfield knows how to draw attention to himself – he was the guitar-playing, Bowie-warbling astronaut floating around the international space station. Now he wants Earth’s governments to harmonise in efforts to establish settlements on the moon, as a stepping stone to Mars. “We still don’t even know what we don’t know about exploring Mars,” says the Canadian spaceman, who argues bringing in privateers like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos is the right thing to do in pushing forward with our exploration of the solar system.
The challenges of going to Mars are immense, says Hadfield, but “the moon is now within our grasp. Not just to explore but actually to settle. And so the real question is this: can we build an environment where people can be healthy and happy and, most importantly, live? And I think the answer is yes.” Sport Gareth Southgate will board the England flight to Russia today with the increasingly firm conviction that his players have recovered from one of the lowest points in the team’s history. Harry Kane has vowed England will tackle the World Cup “head on” as the national side’s new captain seeks to break his goalscoring duck at major tournaments. In rugby union, England’s list of concerns also now includes the Saracens hooker Schalk Brits, who has interrupted his South African holiday to join the Springbok squad before the second Test in Bloemfontein. Lizzie Deignan claims Chris Froome has been denied fair process in his anti-doping case and criticised the testing authorities for not doing more to protect her reputation after three whereabouts failings. A metabolite of cocaine was the substance found in a test taken from the unbeaten $1.4m horse Walk In The Sun after he won at Lingfield in February. Business Asian shares have been just slightly higher during the summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. The Federal Reserve will start a two-day meeting on interest rates today. Investors expect interest rates to rise from 1.75% to 2% and will be looking for an indication of how many rate hikes Fed officials are considering this year. On the currency markets, the pound has been trading at $1.336 and €1.135 overnight. The papers “Trump-Kim meeting is summit of the century” enthuses the Times, while the Metro goes with “Despot hits the night spots”, showing Kim Jong-un out and about in Singapore. It’s not the recently mellowed North Korean tyrant, though, who concerns other front pages. In the Mail, it is “End of breast feeding tyranny” as midwives (tyrants, all!) are told not to shame mothers who choose to bottle feed.
The tyranny of … umm, parliamentary process is the concern of the Sun and the Express, which are furious about amendments to the EU withdrawal bill being foisted on MPs by the Lords. “Great Britain or Great Betrayal” – the Sun’s headline feels a bit flat, to be honest. “Ignore the will of the people at your peril” – that’s more thunderous, from the Express. “May’s last-ditch plea to rebels to support Brexit withdrawal bill” is the Guardian’s splash as the legislation returns to the Commons. The Mirror hails the “Prostate cancer saliva test revolution” that could make predicting the disease as simple as spit. “More than 2,300 doctors denied visas in five months” says the FT, reporting that the immigration system for non-EU skilled workers appears to be swamped. The Telegraph reports on “Calls to block social media ‘hooks’ for children” – it says the children’s commissioner wants algorithms that target youngsters shut down. Sign up

2018-06-12T05:00:40Z,world,World news,Former Irish prime minister 'appalled' at state of British politics,"The former Irish prime minister, toasted by leading Brexiters as a man who they could have done business with, has said he is “appalled” by what is happening in politics in Britain. Enda Kenny, who gave way to Leo Varadkar last summer, said the British government’s position on Ireland “lacks credibility” and is “riven by dissent”. At a ceremony in Dublin, where he received an award for making an outstanding contribution to Europe, Kenny also lamented British business’s silence on the matter.
“The [British] government is riven by internal dissent, lacks credibility and clarity on the most serious issue in decades. Six months on from an agreement being reached in December last year, very little progress has been made,” he said. “The EU continues to negotiate from a unified position. British business is afraid to speak out because of the spectre of a Labour government,” he added. His words will come as a sharp rebuke to Brexiters including members of the DUP who have said that if Kenny were still in power there would not be the problems with the Irish border. In March, Jacob Rees-Mogg said “mature” and “responsible” Kenny’s “common sense approach” had been replaced by a “irresponsible vote-catching” Varadkar. His remarks came as Varadkar suggested there could be an extension to article 50 if it looked as if there was no deal in sight. “You’ll know that there are a number of different scenarios that could arise if we’re in a ‘no-deal’ situation. For example, it is possible to extend article 50 to allow more time for negotiations to take place. There is the possibility of an interim deal, or a transition period, pending an outcome or final negotiations over the transition period,” he told TV3. The Irish prime minister said suggestions that the talks go to the wire with a deal sealed in the small hours of the morning were wide of the mark. “I’ve heard some people talking about the possibility of a crunch late-night meeting in Brussels in late October, something akin to a last-minute budget compromise or a fisheries council,” Varadkar added. “That of course, as [Kenny] pointed out, will not be the case – because when the EU member states, the 27 of us, discuss Brexit, we discuss it without the UK in the room. So this won’t be a drafting session – we’ll have to have agreement in advance of the summit in October.” He said Kenny’s suggestion that there could be an extra summit, perhaps in September, October or even November, to help seal a deal was “helpful”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/former-irish-prime-minister-appalled-at-state-of-british-politics,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/former-irish-prime-minister-appalled-at-state-of-british-politics
2018-06-12T04:00:38Z,world,World news,'We no longer die in childbirth': how Indian villages saved their mothers,"The message is written on a poster, hung between trees that offer shade but little relief from the blazing sun. It spells out what has been achieved in this rural Indian village: “We no longer die in childbirth.” For the women of Purabgaon, in the Amethi district of Uttar Pradesh, expectations had always been clear. Get married young, then have back-to-back pregnancies. Those babies would be delivered in unsanitary conditions at home by a dai, a village midwife with no training and many superstitions. “Even if a woman was taken to hospital for the birth, half an hour later she would be bundled home to do the chores, feed the cattle and cook,” said Gulab Yadav, a project manager in Amethi for Save a Mother. The maternal mortality rate (MMR) in Amethi has been one of the highest in the world – 451 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to a 2008 government survey. Anaemia is one key problem: around 55% of Indian women are anaemic, and rural women’s diets are often poor. Save a Mother aims to educate rural women about pregnancy, nutrition, immunisation, delivery and care of the child. “We told them to delay having the first baby and leave a three-year gap between pregnancies to keep mother and child safe and healthy. And they understand that delivery in hospital is safest because complications such as heavy bleeding can be treated,” said Gita Gupta, a Save a Mother team leader. Gupta leads a group of 20 female “change agents” in Purabgaon. Each of the 360 villages in Amethi covered by the scheme has a team of 20 agents – local women trained to educate other women. Gupta sometimes changes the lyrics of romantic folk songs to refer to iron supplements, intrauterine devices (IUDs) and breastfeeding. “They find it easier to remember what I’ve told them if they sing it,” she said.
Beginning with 20 villages in Amethi 10 years ago, Save a Mother has expanded to 1,100 villages in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana. The maternal mortality rate for those villages has been reduced by 90% and infant mortality is down by 60%. Last year in Purabgaon, not a single mother died in childbirth. Nationwide there are five maternal deaths in childbirth every hour, but the mortality rate has been falling steadily, from 280 per 100,000 live births in 2005 to 174 in 2015 and 130 in 2016. Shiban Ganju, a Chicago-based doctor, founded Save a Mother after a visit to rural Uttar Pradesh. “As a physician I knew [the high mortality rate] could be solved by a dedicated group working with the community,” he said. Ten years on, he said he had learned two key things. Firstly, that changing social behaviour is the most effective and least expensive way to reduce the impact of disease. And secondly, that the Indian government should increase its public health spending from the current 1.1% of GDP – one of the lowest proportions in the world – to 2.5%. Some of the older women in Purabgaon talked candidly about the relentless pressure they were put under to give birth. “I had five children in quick succession, my mother-in-law kept saying she wanted a grandson. Then I married off my eldest daughter at 15. That was wrong,” said Urmila Devi. “I know better now. My youngest girl won’t get married before 20 and I will tell her to control her pregnancies.” The village remains highly conservative, but the project has had an impact: many women can now leave the house and attend meetings without needing the permission of their husband or mother-in-law. Moreover, empowered by the information they have absorbed about pregnancy and childbirth, they have some leverage in family discussions. “They tell their husbands that if they want a healthy baby … the mother has to eat well. If they aren’t given fish or meat, they drink two glasses of milk instead. And they insist on a hospital delivery,” said Gupta. In the past, tradition has dictated that women wait for a priest to announce an auspicious moment to start breast-feeding the newborn. While waiting, often for up to three days, they fed goat or cow milk to the baby, causing diarrhoea. “Now we breastfeed at once. We don’t wait for the priest,” said one of the mothers, Kanti Devi. Seema Agrahari’s three children, now six, three and one, were all delivered in hospital. “I had an IUD for my family planning. It’s the best thing I did. I felt well during each pregnancy,” she said. “But I could have been one of those who died in childbirth. Information saved me.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

2018-06-12T03:41:28Z,world,World news,A meeting of equals: what we learned from the Trump and Kim handshake,"Donald Trump has met the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in a highly choreographed setting in Singapore. Here are five things we learned from the first moments of the first ever meeting between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader.
1. Flags The US and North Korean flags were lined up in an alternating pattern as the world waited for the two men to shake hands and pose for the cameras. The imagery was striking and a big win for Kim, who has worked to appear as an equal to the US president. 2. Choreography Trump left his hotel first but arrived about seven minutes after Kim. The North Korean leader’s earlier arrival was reportedly a sign of respect to the older US president. The two men walked out together, with Trump extending his hand first. 3. The handshake In what will surely be on the front pages of newspapers around the world, Trump and Kim shook hands in front of the flags of the two countries. The two men tried to speak to each other, but it ended awkwardly. Kim greeted Trump by saying “Nice to meet you, Mr. President” in English, according to South Korean media and based on reading his lips. The shake lasted 12 seconds, not nearly as long as Trump’s epic 26-second handshake with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe. Trump was restrained in his grip, declining to do his signature arm yank, and tenderly gripped Kim’s elbow during the 12-second handshake.
4. Language Trump described meeting Kim as an “honour” and said he had no doubt the two would have “a tremendous relationship”. At the same time, Kim acknowledged “old prejudices and practices” that kept US-North Korea relations frozen for decades. 5. Alone Time Trump and Kim emerged from about 40 minutes of discussions between the two of them and their translators, with the US president describing the pair as having an “excellent relationship”. Trump previously said he would be able to tell in one minute if Kim was sincere about giving up his nuclear weapons.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/a-meeting-of-equals-what-we-learned-from-the-trump-and-kim-handshake,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/a-meeting-of-equals-what-we-learned-from-the-trump-and-kim-handshake
2018-06-12T02:52:04Z,world,World news,New Zealand coalition under strain as Jacinda Ardern prepares for maternity leave,"New Zealand’s ruling coalition has come under pressure after the soon-to-be acting prime minister, Winston Peters, backed away from a hallmark crime and justice policy while also revealing he is suing one of his government’s own ministries.
Prime minister Jacinda Ardern had her final day in the capital on Monday before heading home to Auckland in preparation for the birth of her first child on Sunday. She has said she will not hand over power to Peters until she heads to hospital. However, tensions have arisen as Peters, the head of the conservative NZ First party, refused to back a repeal of a controversial “three strikes” policy. The law, enacted in 2010, set up a three-stage system of increasing consequences for repeat serious violent offenders. On a third offence, a judge must issue the maximum possible sentence unless the court considers it would be manifestly unjust. Justice minister Andrew Little called the law the “high watermark of policy stupidity” and many academics and public policy experts have denounced it as ineffective. Little was due to announce the repeal on Monday but instead said NZ First did not back it. “They didn’t want that to be seen as separate from a broader programme of criminal justice reform,” he said. The leader of the opposition, Simon Bridges, said Little’s backtrack had “underlined cracks in the coalition”. “We’ll see the power dynamics of that and who’s really in charge,” Bridges told Radio New Zealand (RNZ). The reversal also comes as Peters files a court case against the heads of the Ministry of Social Development and State Services Commission and the attorney general on behalf of former ministers under the previous administration. Peters confirmed on Monday night that he was seeking NZ$400,000 in damages for breach of privacy after details about overpayments of his superannuation were leaked to the media last year. During last year’s election campaign Peters was found to have been mistakenly overpaid superannuation for seven years. The 73-year-old veteran politician repaid the money when the error was found. Ardern told RNZ Peters would recuse himself from any cabinet decisions to do with his lawsuit and said there were processes for dealing with the issue. “It hasn’t affected the ability of the deputy prime minister to do his job thus far … it’s a private matter not a political matter.” Ardern told the AM Show this morning that if her pregnancy ran over time she would likely induce labour.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/new-zealand-coalition-under-strain-as-jacinda-ardern-prepares-for-maternity-leave,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/new-zealand-coalition-under-strain-as-jacinda-ardern-prepares-for-maternity-leave
2018-06-11T23:29:23Z,world,World news,North Korea summit: US president says 'we will be fine' as meeting nears,"North Korea is to be offered unprecedented security guarantees when Kim Jong-un meets Donald Trump in Singapore, the US secretary of state has said on the eve of the summit. Mike Pompeo did not specify what security assurances Trump would offer Kim but made clear they would go even further than a 2005 agreement in which the US pledged not to attack North Korea with nuclear or conventional weapons. The White House said Trump would begin his meeting with Kim, the first US summit with North Korea, at 9am on Tuesday (2am UK time; 9pm on Monday in Washington) with a one-on-one meeting with translators but no advisers or aides. Only after that initial personal session will national security officials join the meeting. The president tweeted on Tuesday morning, hours before the summit was due to begin, that meetings between staff and representatives were going well but “that doesn’t matter”. “We will all know soon if a real deal, unlike those of the past, can happen!” he wrote. In another tweet he said detractors had been proved wrong after he stopped North Korea firing missiles and secured the release of American hostages. “We will be fine!” he wrote. However, there are doubts over whether Trump can persuade Kim to make a clear statement on his intention to dismantle and surrender his nuclear weapons programme. If an effort to close the gap, Pompeo said the US could give Pyongyang more guarantees of security than had hitherto been offered. “It is the case we are prepared to give security assurances necessary for the North Koreans to engage in ... denuclearisation,” Pompeo told reporters. “We are prepared to take actions that will provide them sufficient certainty that they can be comfortable that denuclearisation isn’t something that ends badly for them.” He added: “We are prepared to make ... security assurances that are different, [more] unique than, what America has been willing to provide previously. We think this is both necessary and appropriate.” US and North Korean officials met in Singapore on Monday to prepare for the historic summit, which will take place at a luxury hotel on an island close to central Singapore. While North Korea spoke of establishing a new “permanent peace-keeping mechanism” and its state-run news agency hailed a “new era” in relations with the US, Trump tweeted on Monday about how pleased he was to be in Singapore. “Excitement in the air!” he tweeted.
The format for the talks is aimed at establishing a personal rapport between the two leaders. A US official said that the first session on Tuesday morning would be between the two alone apart from translators – with no advisers or aides. They will enter the negotiating room only after the one-on-one session is over. Pompeo said he was optimistic that the summit would be a success, but defined success as an agreement that the negotiations should continue. He said the US was “hopeful that this summit will set the conditions for future talks”. It was reported that Kim planned to fly back to North Korea in the early afternoon on Tuesday, leaving very little time for actual negotiations. There is still considerable uncertainty about what a deal between the leaders would look like.
The Pyongyang regime envisages denuclearisation as a gradual and somewhat amorphous process, in which both sides take phased reciprocal steps to defuse tensions with the ultimate but distant goal of nuclear disarmament. The Trump administration has previously insisted on “complete, verifiable, irreversible disarmament” (CVID) of North Korea, with the emphasis on unilateral steps by Pyongyang rewarded by US security assurances. But the president has significantly softened the US negotiating stance in the immediate run-up to the summit, accepting the prospect of open-ended negotiations involving multiple future summits.
Pompeo muddied the picture further on Monday by melding the two concepts in a tweet showing him at breakfast with US negotiators, saying the US remained “committed to the complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”. The North Korean state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun said the meeting would discuss “wide-ranging and profound views on the issue of establishing new DPRK-US relations, the issue of building a permanent and durable peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean peninsula.” The KCNA news agency heralded the summit as part of a “changed era”.
Most observers predict the outcome will be a short and vague statement built around the ambiguous aim of the “denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, leaving it to later bilateral meetings to negotiate what that would mean in practice. Kim was the first to arrive in Singapore, landing at Changi airport on a commercial Air China plane. It is the farthest Kim has travelled since inheriting power in 2011, and only his third known trip outside the country since then, with the use of a Chinese plane raising questions over the state of North Korea’s ageing fleet of Soviet-built aircraft. As Kim’s black Mercedes arrived at the St Regis hotel in downtown Singapore, it was flanked by bodyguards in black suits jogging alongside the car. Kim met the Singaporean prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, briefly on Sunday, smiling broadly as the two posed for photographs. “The entire world is watching the historic summit between [North Korea] and the United States of America, and thanks to your sincere efforts ... we were able to complete the preparations for the historic summit,” Kim told Lee through an interpreter.
Kim later departed with his entourage on a night-time tour of Singapore accompanied by local government officials. Singapore’s foreign minister tweeted a selfie with Kim and the education minister, Ong Ye Kung, during the tour. Members of the media were held at bay as they tried to sneak a glimpse of the North Korean leader. There were rumours in the afternoon that Kim would tour several economic projects in the city state and his staff and cars were on call from about 2pm local time. The US president arrived on Air Force One a few hours after Kim, coming directly from a tumultuous G7 summit in Quebec, which ended with a bitter personal exchange between the US president and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. Even after touching down in Singapore, it was clear that trade disputes with US allies in Quebec continued to rankle Trump. “Sorry, we cannot let our friends, or enemies, take advantage of us on trade any more,” Trump tweeted. “We must put the American worker first!” Trump and his entourage met the Singaporean prime minister for lunch on Monday. He told Lee: “We’ve got a very interesting meeting in particular tomorrow, and I just think it’s going to work out very nicely.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/trump-kim-summit-north-korea-hails-new-era-of-relations-with-the-us,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/trump-kim-summit-north-korea-hails-new-era-of-relations-with-the-us
2018-06-11T21:45:44Z,world,World news,UN seeks urgent ceasefire to stop UAE assault on Yemeni port,"The United Arab Emirates has given the UN less than 48 hours to try to negotiate a Houthi ceasefire at the strategic Red Sea port of Hodeidah before it mounts an attack on the port through which the bulk of food, medicine and gas to the rest of Yemen is distributed. Urgent British-led efforts at the UN were under way to dissuade the United Arab Emirates and the Saudis from pressing ahead with the attack – or at least to give undertakings that it will not seek to starve Hodeidah into submission. Aid agencies have warned that an attack would have catastrophic consequences. The UN security council met behind closed doors on Monday at the request of Britain to be briefed on the situation after heavy fighting erupted near the city on Friday and Saturday. The UAE has vowed it will take the port saying it is being used by Houthi rebels to smuggle in arms including missiles used to attack Saudi Arabia itself. “We are, at the present moment, in intense consultation,” the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, told reporters. “I hope that it will be possible to avoid a battle for Hodeidah.” He said the UN’s Yemen envoy, Martin Griffiths, was shuttling between the capital of Yemen Sanaa and also the UAE and Saudi Arabia. One proposal is for the UN to take control of the port or the city. After briefing the security council on Monday, UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock told reporters that “if for any period Hodeidah were not to operate effectively the consequences in humanitarian terms would be catastrophic”. “While the UN and other humanitarian agencies are reconfiguring their presence it’s also our planned intention though to stay and deliver. We have dozens of UN staff still in Hodeidah,” Lowcock added. The UK’s Middle East minister, Alistair Burt, repeatedly urged the UAE not to mount an attack, but he told MPs in the Commons that it would only be a breach of international law if the attack was used as a matter of policy to attempt to starve the population. Burt said: “The UN special envoy has previously expressed concern that conflicts in Hodeidah could take peace off the table ‘in a single stroke’. It is essential for him to be given the time that he needs to facilitate a negotiated solution that avoids conflict in the city and we support his efforts to do so.”
He urged the Houthis to respond to the entreaties in the next 48 hours saying “this will make a significant difference”. But there was little sign that either the British or the Americans were willing to announce a halt to arms sales to Saudi or any other similar mark of disapproval of the Saudi assault. Burt argued that the Saudis saw the threat of an assault as a way of pressuring the Houthis to negotiate a peace deal. The UN has warned the Saudi-led coalition that a military attack or siege on the city, long a target in the war, could lead to the displacement of 250,000 people. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, at the weekend spoke to the Saudi foreign minister, al-Jubeir, the UAE foreign minister, Abdullah bin Zayed, as well as to Griffiths. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, made a similar round of calls, but Pompeo did not call for the attack not to go ahead. He simply said all sides should honour their commitments to the UN adding he had “made clear our desire to address their security concerns while preserving the free flow of humanitarian aid and life-saving commercial imports.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/un-seeks-urgent-ceasefire-to-stop-uae-assault-on-yemeni-port,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/un-seeks-urgent-ceasefire-to-stop-uae-assault-on-yemeni-port
2018-06-11T20:11:35Z,world,World news,Swarm of angry bees attacks Colombian presidential election rally,"Campaign managers for Colombia’s rightwing presidential candidate Iván Duque were probably hoping to create a bit of a buzz with a campaign rally ahead of next week’s election, but the event turned into fiasco after it was attacked by a swarm of angry killer bees. Scores of people were caught up in the bizarre incident on Saturday, including former president Álvaro Uribe, who was stumping on behalf of his protege Duque. Uribe had been scheduled to address supporters in La Loma, a small town in the northern Cesar province, but was forced to run for cover before he could give his speech. Fifteen people were taken to hospital, but were later discharged. Videos circulated in local media showed rally attendees hurrying to escape the swarm, some covering their faces with T-shirts.
The attack took place a week before the second round of a presidential election in which Duque – a conservative hardliner – will face off against leftist former rebel Gustavo Petro. Neither candidate secured enough of the vote to win outright in a first round last month, so both men and their surrogates are back on the campaign trail. At stake in the vote is a fragile peace process with guerrilla group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (or Farc). The deal – which Petro supports – has been strongly opposed by Duque. Fernando Araújo, a senator from Duque and Uribe’s party, the Democratic Centre, alleged Petro was behind Saturday’s attack, accusing the candidate of “bioterrorism” on Twitter. Petro responded: “So it turns out that african bees are Petro supporters,” he tweeted. “Could it be because they are workers?” Memes showing images of bees with Petro’s face superimposed made the rounds on social media, injecting some levity to what has so far been a bitter race fraught with personal attacks.
Some even suggested that the Farc had a hand in the incident, though experts say the mostly likely explanation is that the gust generated by Uribe’s helicopter upset a nest in a nearby tree.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/colombia-bees-attack-rally-presidential-election,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/colombia-bees-attack-rally-presidential-election
2018-06-11T19:04:20Z,world,World news,'Prepare for the worst': souring Canada-US relations fuel worries of trade war,"Canadian diplomats are scrambling to mend a deteriorating relationship with its largest trading partner after senior US officials maintained the rhetorical barrage first unleashed by Donald Trump at the G7 meeting in Quebec. Foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland will travel to Washington this week for a visit which will focus on trade talks – but also attempt to reset relations between the two countries, which have been pushed to their lowest point in recent memory amid an increasingly bitter row over trade. In television appearances over the weekend, two senior Trump advisors said that Justin Trudeau “stabbed the US in the back” after the prime minister spoke out against the US president’s aggressive trade policies. In an appearance on Fox News on Sunday, White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said: “There’s a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door.”
The sharp escalation has shocked experts and fuelled worries of a devastating trade war, one which Canada, a middling economic power, would likely lose. “There have been moments of tension in various times in the history of Canada-US relations, but I’ve never seen or heard of anything like the type of language the US administration has used towards Canada,” said Roland Paris, an international affairs scholar and former advisor to Trudeau. Canadian officials hoped the G7 summit in Quebec over the weekend would be an opportunity to reset discussions around trade after Trump imposed punitive tariffs on the EU and Canada. But the gathering concluded on a sour note after Trudeau told reporters Canada “will not be pushed around”. Trump responded via social media calling the prime minister “very dishonest and weak”. “We have to prepare for the worst now,” said Colin Robertson, a former diplomat and head of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. “There’s a lot of damage control going on today and for the next few days,” he said. The US remains Canada’s largest trading partner, a relationship valued at $673.9bn, but Trump has claimed Canada has a trade surplus with the US, a statement not backed up by any evidence. A recent report from the CD Howe Institute finds that the tariffs will cause significant economic pain in both countries: Canada could lose as many as 6,000 jobs and a 0.33% GDP reduction, whereas the US would lose 22,700 jobs, but only a 0.02% disruption to the GDP. Last week, Canada introduced more than $16bn in retaliatory tariffs against the United States, meant to inflict targeted pain on politically vulnerable industries, such as whisky, orange juice, frozen pizzas and soy beans. “There are plenty of people in the United States, including in positions of influence, who were just as outraged at those remarks as Canadians were,” said Paris. Although there is little to suggest that his aggressive trade policy has spirited support within his party, analysts say Trump has seized on the duties as a weapon he can wield without needing congressional approval. “He’s discovered these weapons and he’s using them for maximum effect to further his ‘American First’ bellicose trade and political agenda,” said Lawrence Herman, a former diplomat and international trade lawyer. “I think the lesson has come home that as a strategic objective: be less dependent on the unreliability of the United States … What Trump is showing is that the United States is an unreliable treaty partner.” The recent spat has backed Canada into an uncomfortable position: while attempting to remain steadfast against a belligerent trade partner, it must also reckon with the fact that much of its economic productivity is tied to seamless free trade with its southern neighbour. Trudeau’s father, Pierre Trudeau, famously likened the relationship with the United States to a mouse next to a sleeping elephant. “No matter how friendly and even-tempered is the beast, one is affected by every twitch and grunt,” the former prime minister said.
Justin Trudeau amended his father’s metaphor at a gathering of American governors last year. “While you, my American friends, may be an elephant, Canada is no mouse. More like a moose: strong and peaceable – but still massively outweighed.” Trudeau’s firm stance towards the US administration has resulted in a rare unified front amongst current and former political leaders. Over the weekend, his conservative predecessor Stephen Harper appeared on Fox News to appeal for calm. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer tweeted his support for the prime minister.
Even Doug Ford, the newly-elected populist premier of Ontario – who has pledged to fight Trudeau on a number of policy initiatives – backed the prime minister’s position. That support reflects a cold economic reality: Ontario is particularly vulnerable to America’s protectionist policies as more than 80% of the province’s exports are sent south of the border, said Robertson. More recently, Trump has reiterated his threat to impose a 25% tariff on Canadian-made automobiles – a move that would devastate the $80bn industry. Experts say that as discussions enter uncharted territory, it’s critical that the issues of trade remain the central of focus. “Trudeau will not personalize this with Trump – and he will not let any of his cabinet or caucus do so. He’ll let public opinion do that for him,” added Robertson. Meanwhile, Canada should push to ensure two large trade deals – the Trans Pacific Partnership and the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement – are finalized in the coming months to hedge against further uncertainty. “We’ve got these open doors to Europe and the Trans Pacific Partnership. We’ve some housekeeping to do to show we’re serious,” said Robertson.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/trump-canada-latest-trade-war-trudeau-relationship-fears,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/trump-canada-latest-trade-war-trudeau-relationship-fears
2018-06-11T18:22:21Z,world,World news,Italian minister declares victory as Spain accepts rescue boat,"Matteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right interior minister, has declared victory after a standoff over the fate of 629 people on a humanitarian rescue boat prompted Spain to agree to accept them. The impasse, after the populist and far-right government in Italy refused to allow the MS Aquarius to dock over the weekend, suggested that Europe could face a humanitarian crisis this summer as it comes to grips with the new Italian government’s hardline approach to refugees and migrants.
Salvini blocked the ship from Italian ports and said it should go to Malta instead. Malta refused, saying it had nothing to do with a rescue mission overseen by the Italian coastguard in waters off Libya. “We have opened a front in Brussels,” said Salvini, who became interior minister last week. “We are contacting the European commission so that it can fulfil its duties towards Italy that have never been respected.”
With the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, urging the urgent disembarkation of all 629 people on board, including 100 children, as provisions ran out, Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s new prime minister, gave permission for the MS Aquarius to dock in Valencia. He said his country would welcome those on board. Italy’s new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, thanked Spain for its “gesture of solidarity”. Rome’s new position did not mean every ship would be denied entry. The Italian coastguard vessel the Ubaldo Diciotti, with 937 migrants on board – and two of whom have died, was heading to the port of Catania on Monday evening, signalling that ports are still open to Italy’s own rescue boats. They are expected to be closed to all NGOs, however.
While it appeared on Monday that an immediate crisis had been averted by Spain, Salvini’s response, and a statement indicating he would block more ships carrying refugees and migrants, promised that there would be more of such confrontations in the future. The new Italian approach by the ruling coalition of Salvini’s far-right League and the populist Five Star Movement followed an election campaign this year in which Salvini vowed to adopt tough polices on migrants. The standoff over the Aquarius marks the first time thathis rhetoric has translated into action as interior minister, a role in which he will have oversight of migration and domestic security.
It has also left the NGOs on the frontlines of rescuing migrants at sea – and who sometimes have faced direct confrontations with Libyan coastguard officials seeking to take the migrants back to Libya – in uncertain territory about what comes next. “’We don’t know if Italy will continue blocking us, we don’t know if they will close again the seaports. What we know is that we will continue coordinating the rescue operation with [rescue officials],” said Mathilde Auvillain of SOS Méditerranée, which operates the Aquarius.” She added: “We’ll wait for the instructions as we always did. If it is not Italy it will be another country. As I said, our rescue operation will continue, regardless.” There were also questions about how long it would take the Aquarius to make it to Valencia, and whether the political and diplomatic fracas had put some of tose on board in harm’s way. “People are in distress, are running out of provisions and need help quickly. Broader issues such as who has responsibility and how these responsibilities can best be shared between states should be looked at later,” said Vincent Cochetel, the UNHCR’s special envoy for the central Mediterranean, before Spain made its offer. Auvillain said the voyage to Spain would take almost two more days at sea. More than 600,000 people have reached Italy by boat from Africa in the past five years, and it is estimated as many as 500,000 are still in the country. Salvini’s League, formerly the Northern League, campaigned in the last election on an anti-immigration platform, even though the previous government had overseen a big drop in the numbers coming from Libya over the past 12 months.
The European commission, anxious to avoid feeding the new Italian government’s anti-EU narrative, had earlier called on Italy and Malta to consider the humanitarian needs of those on board. “France pushes people back at the border, Spain defends its frontier with weapons. From today, Italy will also start to say no to human trafficking, no to the business of illegal immigration,” said Salvini said on Sunday, adding that Malta “takes in nobody”. The Maltese government rejected a request to take in the boat, saying international law required that the refugees and migrants be taken to Italian ports. Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, thanked Spain on Twitter for taking in the Aquarius “after Italy broke international rules and caused a standoff”. He said his country would be “sending fresh supplies to the vessel. We will have to sit down and discuss how to prevent this from happening again. This is a European issue.” Fulvio Vassallo, an expert on asylum and international law from the University of Palermo, said the episode “could be the end of humanitarian rescue operations at sea. Salvini won and his victory will have a serious impact in the migrant crisis,.” Italy’s new approach was met with resistance by the Vatican and mayors across the south of Italy, including by Palermo’s Leoluca Orlando, who had said he was ready to open the city’s seaport to the ship. “Palermo in ancient Greek meant ‘complete port’. We have always welcomed rescue boats and vessels who saved lives at sea. We will not stop now,” he said. “Salvini is violating international law. He has once again shown that we are under an extreme far-right government.’’ Other mayors in southern Italy, including those in Naples, Messina and Reggio Calabria, also said they were ready to disobey Salvini’s order and allow the Aquarius to dock in their seaports. SOS Méditerranée said the people on board, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, were picked up in six different rescue operations off the coast of Libya and included hundreds plucked from the sea by Italian naval units. Although Sánchez’s offer was swiftly praised at home and abroad, the UNHCR has warned that Spain lacks the resources and infrastructure to cope with the migration crisis.

2018-06-11T16:58:13Z,world,World news,Theresa May says G7 summit with Donald Trump was 'difficult',"Theresa May has said the G7 summit where leaders clashed repeatedly with Donald Trump was “difficult”, but the UK intended to fully honour its commitment to the joint statement that the US has since disavowed. Speaking in the House of Commons, the prime minister said Britain would abide by the final communique signed by leaders in Quebec, which was dramatically abandoned by the president after the summit. “This was a difficult summit, with at times some very candid discussions,” May told MPs. “But the conclusion I draw is that it is only through continued dialogue that we can find ways to work together to resolve the challenges we face. “The countries round the G7 table have been pillars of the rules-based international order, which has benefited all our citizens and, I believe, the world as a whole. The United Kingdom, with our allies and partners, will continue to play our part in promoting that order to the benefit of all.”
Trump disowned the agreement hours after leaving the gathering, launching a personal attack on the Canadian prime minister and accusing other countries of “robbing” the US. Speaking in the House of Commons, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the White House was “inhabited by a president committed to his slogan – America first”, who was set on dismantling multilateral agreements. Angela Merkel described Trump’s behaviour as “sobering and slightly depressing”, and suggested international leaders should be more polite to each other. “The situation is not pleasant,” the chancellor told German television in a rare and lengthy interview. “I don’t think that taking the rhetoric up a few notches is going to make things much better.” World leaders at the summit believed they had a deal until the US president pulled out of the previously agreed communique, which represented a minimal show of unity with deep disagreements between Trump and the other leaders about trade. Frustrations had been mounting over Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement, and most recently to change the rules for trade tariffs on steel and aluminium. The US nevertheless appeared to have agreed to a form of words on contentious issues after an all-night negotiating session by officials from all sides. US reporters travelling on Air Force One to south-east Asia only discovered when the plane landed at Crete to refuel that the president had changed his mind. The communique said the leaders of the US, Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Japan agreed on the need for “free, fair and mutually beneficial trade”, and the importance of fighting protectionism. “We strive to reduce tariff barriers, non-tariff barriers and subsidies,” the statement said. Like last year, the communique made it clear the US had a different view on climate change and how to tackle it from that of the other six countries, increasingly being referred to informally as the G6. No 10 sources said although the prime minister did not have a bilateral meeting with Trump in Quebec, the pair had spoken “in the margins” of the summit about the president’s visit to Britain in July. The trip will follow a Nato summit in Brussels, at which Trump is expected to increase pressure on other countries in the alliance to join the US and UK in committing at least 2% of GDP to defence spending. Trump is believed to have his eye on Germany in particular. Merkel admitted he “has a point” over the comparatively low German defence budget, which is 1.1% of GDP and not due to reach 2% before 2030.
The German chancellor, who has been increasingly frank over her frustrations with Trump, did not hide her disappointment at having failed to persuade him to change his mind, particularly over trade tariffs. “Sometimes, I have the impression that the US president believes that only one side wins while the other loses,” Merkel said, adding that she preferred to see situations as “win-win”. Merkel said she would continue to engage with Trump in the hope of winning him round. She said the tensions that dominated the summit did not make her any less committed to the transatlantic relationship, but it was no longer something Germany could rely on. The US president would not be allowed to have the upper hand, she said, particularly regarding the trade tariffs. The EU’s decision to impose retaliatory tariffs showed “[we] won’t let ourselves be repeatedly taken advantage of”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/theresa-may-calls-on-trump-to-honour-g7-commitments,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/theresa-may-calls-on-trump-to-honour-g7-commitments
2018-06-11T16:07:09Z,world,World news,Football in Crimea: the club split in two by Russia's invasion,"When Russia won the right to host this year’s World Cup in 2010, Tavria Simferopol were in Ukraine’s top division. The club’s “ultras” – hardcore fans – sang patriotic songs, and nursed fond memories of Tavria’s biggest triumph: when the club won independent Ukraine’s first Premier League title in 1992. Eight years later, as the World Cup gets under way, there are two teams called Tavria: one still plays in Simferopol, the capital of Russian-annexed Crimea, and one plays across the newly drawn border in mainland Ukraine.Russia is hosting the world’s biggest sporting event with relations between Moscow and the west at their lowest point since the cold war. Its annexation of Crimea in 2014 led to sanctions, counter-sanctions and a reappraisal of the threat from Russia in the west. For Tavria, the annexation split the fanbase along political lines: many of Tavria’s ultras fled to Ukraine, while pro-Russian fans stayed behind to support the newly named TSK-Tavria. But due to international sanctions, the team has been banned from playing in the Russian league. It now plies its trade in an eight-team local Crimean league.
Football in Crimea is a reflection of the broader situation in the peninsula, which has been fully severed from Ukraine but not fully integrated with Russia due to international sanctions. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, opened a bridge joining Crimea to mainland Russia last month amid much fanfare, and a huge, modern new airport has recently replaced the boxy Soviet terminal that had previously served the region. But the only planes landing at Simferopol international airport come from Russia, because only a handful of nations, including North Korea and Syria, recognise the Russian takeover as legitimate. International sim cards and credit cards do not work, and almost all foreign business is banned due to sanctions.
After the annexation, the Russian Football Union admitted Tavria, as well as two other Crimean clubs, into the Russian league for the 2014-15 season, but Uefa, European football’s governing body, said it would not allow the situation after the Ukrainian football authorities complained Russia had “stolen” three clubs. “I don’t know how sport can be affected by sanctions, it’s absolute nonsense,” complained Sergei Borodkin, the president of TSK-Tavria, the new Simferopol-based club, and also the vice-president of Crimea’s football governing body. “Crimean Football Union (with special status)” is embossed on the sign outside the union’s headquarters in Simferopol, reflecting the uneasy compromise between Russian football and Uefa over the status of the region. After Kosovo and Gibraltar were granted full Uefa member status in 2016, Crimea is now the only football federation with this special status. This gives the Crimean league recognition, but bans its teams from taking part in Russia-wide competitions. “Professional football has basically died in Crimea,” said Sergei Portnykh, a 31-year-old Tavria fan who has set up after-school football training for three- to seven-year-olds. “With the younger kids it’s more about physical and psychological development than actual football, but when they get to nine or 10 it’s important for them to have role models.” Younger children who were not registered in any youth setup prior to 2014 may still be able to join the youth academies of Russian teams. Older players have Uefa registration documents marking them as Ukrainian players, which makes transfers to other countries tricky, though Borodkin said a compromise has been found. That still leaves the problem of the dubious standards in the Crimea-only league.
“It’s just not the same any more. You go to the stadium, and there’s such a small crowd, and there are just empty feelings and sadness instead of all the old emotions,” said one Tavria fan who went to every game before the Russian takeover. He asked to remain anonymous because he said the Russian security service, the FSB, monitored fans for signs of potential violence or pro-Ukraine views. Tavria fans had fought and died on both sides in the war in eastern Ukraine, he said. He is still in touch with some friends who had pro-Ukraine views and left Crimea in the aftermath of the annexation, but they tried to restrict their conversations to football, and not politics. Tavria fans who moved to Ukraine set up a new club in Beryslav, a small town in south Ukraine. The club plays in the Ukrainian second division as Tavria Simferopol, despite it being no longer based in the Crimean city. “We have a problem taking players actually from Crimea, because we can’t have any players with a pro-Russian position,” said Oleh Komuniar, a Tavria fan who now lives in Kiev, and is the vice-president of the Crimean football federation in exile. The team finished this year’s season with an impressive 9-0 victory, but draws crowds of just a few hundred and struggles for finances. Backers of the two Tavrias like to dismiss the other as an irrelevance, claiming not to follow or be interested in the other. They also have differing attitudes to the World Cup being in Russia. During the tournament, unlike in most other Russian cities, there will be no official fan zone in Simferopol, because Fifa sponsors cannot operate in Crimea. “It would be nice to have a fan zone, but it’s not a problem, we will set up a ‘zone of collective viewing’ instead so everyone here can enjoy the World Cup,” said Borodkin. Komuniar, speaking from Kiev, was not sure he would watch the World Cup iat all. “Holding a tournament there when they’re killing people in Ukraine is disgusting. If I do watch, I’m going to be supporting all the teams who play against Russia,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/crimea-football-russia-annexation-divided-tavria-simferopol,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/crimea-football-russia-annexation-divided-tavria-simferopol
2018-06-11T14:23:57Z,world,World news,Italy's coalition on collision course with EU after migration standoff,"International concern about Italy’s new populist government has mostly focused on the challenge its plans for huge tax cuts and spending hikes might pose to the EU’s budget rules, and the risk it might even leave the euro altogether. But the refusal by the interior minister, Matteo Salvini, this weekend to allow the Aquarius rescue ship carrying 629 migrants to dock in any Italian port makes it clear that the country’s first big clash with the bloc will not be over the common currency, but migration. The Italian finance minister, Giovanni Tria, sought this weekend to reassure investors and EU officials, saying the coalition of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and far-right League intended to stay in the euro and would “avoid creating the market conditions” for an involuntary exit.
Matteo Salvini, the new interior minister and leader of the far-right League, was less emollient. “France pushes people back at the border, Spain defends its frontier with weapons,” he said, announcing that Italy’s ports were closed to the Aquarius. “From today, Italy is also starting to say no to human trafficking, no to the business of illegal immigration,” Salvini – who campaigned on a pledge to round up and deport 500,000 migrants living illegally in Italy – added. His intransigence, the first real evidence of the new government’s promised hardline stance, risks precipitating a full-blown crisis over EU asylum reforms, which the bloc has been trying to overhaul without success for the past two years.
Talks in Luxembourg aimed at establishing refugee quotas and a common system for member states to share responsibility for asylum-seekers ended in deadlock last week, with ministers pessimistic that any agreement can be reached by their self-imposed deadline of the next Brussels summit at the end of this month. Salvini, who declared last week that he would not allow Italy to become “Europe’s refugee camp”, did not attend the meeting and has already dismissed the latest EU proposals as not doing enough to help Italy. In an unusually outspoken intervention, Angela Merkel warned of the consequences of failing to reach an accord. “If we are unable to come up with a common response to the migration challenges, the very foundations of the EU will be at stake,” the German chancellor said. “Action is really needed.” Belgium’s minister for asylum and migration, Theo Francken, said Europe “will end” unless member states could agree a joint approach. “At the moment, there is totally no consensus,” he said last week.
With xenophobia on the rise across the continent and hard-right, anti-immigration parties either in government or riding high in the polls in countries as diverse as Italy, Hungary, Germany, Poland, Austria and Sweden, immigration has become an issue of existential importance for the bloc. Member states remain hopelessly divided over burden-sharing plans proposed by Brussels intended to ward off any repeat of the 2015-16 migration crisis. Under current rules, refugees must claim asylum in the country in which they first enter the bloc – leaving so-called frontline states like Italy, Greece and Spain complaining, justifiably, that they are shouldering an unfair share of new arrivals. Wealthier destination countries like Germany, France and the Netherlands, meanwhile, argue they are already hosting enough people who have moved northward, and hardline central European nations including Hungary and Poland have rejected out of hand all refugee quota schemes. Faced with deadlock, Europe’s capitals are exploring alternatives. Germany has announced unilateral plans to tighten its asylum system. Austria has promised a “revolution” – abandoning quotas, tightening external border controls, and processing asylum claims outside the bloc – if no consensus can be found. The coalition government in Vienna – which includes the far-right Freedom party – is also working informally with Denmark and the Netherlands on controversial plans to set up camps for rejected asylum seekers in countries outside the EU. As fears mount that migrant flows – down sharply since 2016 after deals were struck with Turkey and Libya – may be about to rise once more, an EU-wide consensus was already looking difficult to achieve. Salvini’s intervention is unlikely to make it any easier. • This article was amended on 12 June 2018 because Theo Francken is Belgium’s minister for asylum and migration, not interior minister as an earlier version said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/italy-coalition-collision-course-eu-migration-standoff-matteo-salvini,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/italy-coalition-collision-course-eu-migration-standoff-matteo-salvini
2018-06-11T14:02:05Z,world,World news,Japan: man freed after 45 years on death row could go back to jail,"A Japanese man who was freed in 2014 after spending 45 years on death row could be sent back to prison after a court overturned the decision to grant him a retrial. Iwao Hakamada was sentenced to hang in 1968 for the murders two years earlier of a company president, his wife and their two children in Shizuoka prefecture, central Japan. A district court in Shizuoka freed him in 2014 and ordered a retrial, saying police may have fabricated evidence, but the Tokyo high court on Monday ruled against it. It said the lower court had overstated the value of DNA evidence that cast doubt on the safety of his conviction, and that there were insufficient grounds to suspect that police had forged evidence. Hakamada, an 82-year-old former professional boxer, told reporters from his home in Shizuoka that his conviction had always been unsafe. “It is all lies,” he said, according to Kyodo news. His 85-year-old sister, Hideko, who has campaigned to prove her brother’s innocence, said the high court ruling was “regrettable,” but added that his supporters would continue the fight to clear his name. Hakamada’s lawyers are expected to appeal to the supreme court. The Tokyo court agreed to allow Hakamada, who is in poor health, to remain free on humanitarian grounds until a final decision has been made on his retrial. A live-in employee at the victims’ miso paste plant, he had initially confessed to the four killings but later retracted it and insisted he was innocent throughout his two-year trial. Hakamada told the court that police had beaten and threatened him during 20 consecutive days of questioning. At the time of his 2014 release, he was thought to be the world’s longest-serving death row inmate. Hakamada’s family had pleaded with prosecutors not to challenge the lower court decision, saying decades on death row had seriously damaged his mental and physical health. Hiroka Shoji, east Asia researcher at Amnesty International, described Monday’s ruling as a gross injustice. “Hakamada’s conviction is based on a forced ‘confession’ and there remain serious unanswered questions over DNA evidence,” Shoji said. “Time is running out for Hakamada to receive the fair trial he was denied 50 years ago. Any appeal by Hakamada’s legal team should be heard without undue delay. He is elderly and has poor mental health because of his many years on death row. “To send Hakamada back to prison would not only set the Japanese authorities against international safeguards protecting those with mental disability and the elderly from the use of the death penalty, but would be plain cruel.” Campaigners against the death penalty have used Hakamada’s case to draw attention to Japan’s “secret executions”, accusing authorities of driving prisoners insane and subjecting them to “cruel, inhuman and degrading” treatment. Human rights groups have criticised Japan’s practice of informing death row inmates of their impending execution just hours before they are led to the gallows. Families are sometimes informed only after the hanging has taken place. An Amnesty International report said the practice causes “significant mental illness”. Typically, condemned prisoners spend several years on death row in Japan. Hakamada’s execution has been delayed by a series of appeals against his convictions that ended unsuccessfully in the supreme court in 1980. Since then, his legal team have been pushing for a retrial. Some prisoners have been executed while their case for a retrial is being heard.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/japan-man-freed-after-45-years-on-death-row-could-go-back-to-jail,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/japan-man-freed-after-45-years-on-death-row-could-go-back-to-jail
2018-06-11T13:52:59Z,world,World news,Q&A: how damaging was Donald Trump’s G7 blow-up?,"Who was there? The G7 is attended by the leaders of the seven main western economies, and has been seen as a chance for world leaders to discuss the chief diplomatic and economic issues of the day. Leaders from the US, France, Canada, Germany Japan, Italy and the UK attend. EU officials also attend, as do chiefs from multilateral bodies such as the IMF. Russia used to attend the event, but it was blackballed following the 2014 annexation of Crimea. Since its inception in 1975, its tone is supposed to be gentle – as much fireside chat as firefighting. A G7 shibboleth is support for free trade, and a rules-based world order.
What was said? Donald Trump’s now infamous blow-up occurred as much before and after the summit, as during it. In the run-up, the US president announced he was slapping tariffs on EU steel and aluminium, called for Russia to be re-invited to the summit and then derided the World Trade Organization, the body that polices trade. Trump, his mind evidently on his upcoming summit with North Korea, showed his disdain by arriving late for key sessions, such as on gender equality, and leaving early, avoiding the climate change session, giving him a chance to hold a press conference before the hosts to ensure his account of the summit broke first. In essence, he said he had nothing personal against other world leaders, but the generosity of previous US presidents had left him with the unpleasant task of requiring Europe and Canada to stop ripping America off.
Despite personal relations with other leaders being at a level of “10 out of 10”, he said: “We’re like the piggy bank that everybody is robbing... It’s going to stop now or we’ll stop trading with them [other nations].” The tone was that of a man in possession of incontrovertible proof of a decades-long European heist. “The gig is up,” he said. If his relationship with Justin Trudeau was at 10 at the summit, it fell to zero when Trump – 30,000ft up in Air Force One – became infuriated by an account of the Canadian prime minister’s closing press conference. In a two-tweet tirade he accused Trudeau of making false statements, adding he was dishonest and weak, and only appeared meek and mild. He declared he was un-signing the communique. His advisers then took the insults to the next level. Larry Kudlow, the president’s economic adviser, said Trudeau’s comments were “a betrayal” and that he had “stabbed us in the back”. Trump “is not going to let a Canadian prime minister push him around”. Peter Navarro, the president’s trade adviser, was even harsher: “There’s a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad-faith diplomacy with President Donald J Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door.” Did Trudeau miscalculate? Reporters at Trudeau’s Saturday press conference, including from the New York Times, thought Trudeau went out of his way to be emollient about Trump, content he had cajoled Trump into signing the joint communique. He understood his role as host and co-ordinator. In probably his most aggressive remark, he said Canada was not going to be pushed around, and added he found it “insulting” that the US had justified extra tariffs on Canada by labelling its neighbour and military ally a security risk. Trump took this as evidence that Trudeau was two-faced. His judgment, presumably, is that his political base cannot get enough of the president “standing up for America”. Does Trump have a point about Canada and the EU? US tariffs are lower than those of the EU and Canada but the difference is marginal. WTO statistics show that the EU’s average trade-weighted tariff was 3% in 2015, the latest year for which this figure was available. Canada’s average trade-weighted tariff was 3.1% compared with 2.4% for the US. The US also has a trade surplus with Canada. At best, Trump is being pointlessly selective with his facts, ignoring the complex trade-offs, and taking no account of how his own policies feed a US consumer boom.
What are the wider implications? The US and the EU have had innumerable previous rows about trade, but right now on climate change, Iran, Nato, Russia and trade, the president is willing not just to differ with the rest of the west, but to challenge and undermine it. A horrified European political establishment sees Trump, like Vladimir Putin, backing the populists of Europe, especially in eastern Europe, Austria and Italy. These are forces that threaten the liberal order in a way that Emmanuel Macron, Theresa May and Angela Merkel are only beginning to understand. The former UK Foreign Office permanent secretary Simon Fraser for instance sounded genuinely alarmed when he tweeted: “Conventional wisdom is that Trump is a blip & normal service will one day be resumed. This is too complacent. The deeper, even more worrying question: are US values, priorities & interests fundamentally diverging from Europe? We should be seriously worried by what has just happened in G7.” The Europeans’ answer lies in managing Trump, including at the imminent Nato summit, but also strengthening Europe’s economic and security independence. But these are painstaking tasks, requiring long talks between German and French finance ministers, and discussion of a new European strategic defence culture.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/qa-how-damaging-was-donald-trump-g7-blow-up,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/qa-how-damaging-was-donald-trump-g7-blow-up
2018-06-11T13:40:33Z,world,World news,Mediterranean rescue vessel crew keep migrants calm during standoff,"Crew onboard the stranded MS Aquarius are desperately trying to keep hundreds of migrants calm while treating injuries incurred during their treacherous Mediterranean crossing amid a fiery political standoff between Italy and Malta, which both rejected the ship from docking in their ports. Spain’s new prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has given permission for the vessel to dock in Valencia, and said his country will welcome those on board, but the Aquarius said it had received no instructions yet to head to Spain. Onboard the vessel are 629 people, including 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 babies and seven pregnant woman. The ship is operated by the French-German charity SOS Méditerranée and has been undertaking risky year-round, search-and-rescue missions in waters north of Libya since 2015. Victoria Russell, a spokeswoman for Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which has staff working on the boat, said the situation was under control but could change at any moment. “None of the people on board have any idea about this whole diplomatic standoff that is unfolding around them, but they are starting to ask questions: why has the ship stopped?” she said.
“It is challenging for the staff onboard as they don’t want to make people over-anxious. There’s also a risk of crowd control, with people getting increasingly anxious. We could see physical and psychological deterioration: we know that they were in Libya and exposed to alarming levels of violence and exploitation, so can very reasonably assume they’re suffering torment from that too.” The ship has capacity for only 550 people, even though in the past crew have rescued more than 1,000. There is enough food and medicine to last four to five days. More than 15 people onboard have serious chemical fuel burns requiring regular care, due to oil spills from the cheaply made rubber boats they travelled in from Libya. There are also a number of cases that require orthopaedic surgery. Some of the passengers had to be resuscitated after almost drowning during a challenging overnight rescue operation on Saturday. “They have sea water on their lungs … they’re stable right now, but it could change at any moment, and they would need assistance that we can’t provide on the boat,” said Russell. The ship, which had been on its way to Sicily, was left stranded after both Italy and Malta refused to allow it to dock. Matteo Salvini, Italy’s new hardline interior minister and leader of the far-right League, said the ship could not dock at any Italian ports and should be taken in by Malta instead. Italy claimed that Malta should accept the Aquarius because Malta was the safest, closest port to the ship. Malta said Italy coordinated the rescues and that it has had nothing to do with it. On Monday, he reiterated his point by posting a picture of himself on social media alongside the hashtag #chiudiamoiporti (#close the ports). Maltese Premier Joseph Muscat accused Italy of violating international norms governing sea rescues and said its stance risked “creating a dangerous situation for all those involved.” This is not the first time the operation has faced disruption. The Guardian was onboard the vessel in late June 2017, when the Italian government threatened to close its ports after more than 12,000 people arrived on the country’s southern shores within the space of a week. The Aquarius rescued 1,032 in one day, which at the time set a new record for the ship. Among the passengers were a dozen or so women, some heavily pregnant or with wounds from oil burns, and two children, the youngest a three-month-old girl. Many of the migrants were suffering from scabies and had to be separated from others on board. One man had a severe mental illness. The women, mostly from Nigeria, spoke about being raped in war-torn Libya, where they had been domestic workers. Many had never even heard of Italy or seen the ocean before, but most said they would rather die in the Mediterranean than stay in Libya. Aquarius usually has a crew of about 12, including a doctor, two nurses and a midwife. Soon after the migrants arrive onboard, they are treated by medics and given fresh clothes and rehydration food. “The problem is the hygiene and medical treatment,” said Anton Shakouri, a rescue worker who has worked on the ship. “Because you can never know what has happened to people [before they are rescued]. SOS and MSF crew provide 24/7 medical assistance onboard but even this has its limits. As long as people keep calm and listen to the crew everything can be handled, but people get sick and tired.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/mediterranean-rescue-vessel-ms-aquarius-migrants,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/mediterranean-rescue-vessel-ms-aquarius-migrants
2018-06-11T12:17:22Z,world,World news,Parisian mayor launches 'rat map' to tackle rodent menace,"Rémy the rat, star of the hit film Ratatouille, set in Paris, may have given rodents a good name, but not with the city’s residents. Now a mayor in one of the French capital’s arrondissements has launched an interactive map to show how rats have infested his district. Geoffroy Boulard, who launched signalerunrat.paris on Monday, accused the city authorities of failing to address the problem and said not all could be blamed on public litter-bugs encouraging the rodents. He told Le Parisien he decided to act after learning that a local crêche was infested with rats. Within a few hours, dozens of residents in Boulard’s 17th arrondissement in north-west Paris had reported numerous sightings, dead and alive. “The presence of rats in public space is worrying and has become more and more serious. We had a creche surrounded with rats dead and alive. Nobody is taking their responsibility. It’s a matter of public health. The city has to react to this sanitary problem. It’s not just the 17th [arrondissement],” Boulard told BFMTV. The local mairie, or town hall, has also opened a rat “hotline” for those who do not have access to the internet. There is also a poster campaign in local parks and on municipal notice boards reminding people not to throw litter on the ground and to clean up after their picnics. Boulard said he hoped the campaign would put pressure on City Hall to act. “If it’s a priority for them then they should be working harder. As soon as a local resident or passer-by makes a report we will go back to City Hall and the interactive map will be updated each time they intervene. A small shovel will replace the drawing of the rat (on the map). That’s if they intervene.” He added: “I don’t wish to remain passive about this.” A pair of rats can produce up to 32 offspring a year, which in turn can produce a colony of more than 900 animals in the space of a year, given enough food and the right conditions. While City Hall organises regular eradication operations, Stéphane Bras, a pest control expert, said it was not enough. He said members of the public, shops and private companies all had to do their bit. “Buildings aren’t hermetic. If one is treated the rats move to another. The mairie has campaigns but these are necessarily supported by other private organisations,” Bras said. Bras added that there were not necessarily more rats in Paris than in other cities, but that they were more visible. “When they’re in the sewers they’re useful. When they come up to our level, they can do damage ... and in terms of image, for a city like Paris, or New York, to see rats running in the streets has an effect on the population and tourists that is disastrous,” he told Le Parisien.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/paris-mayor-launches-rat-map-to-tackle-rodent-menace,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/paris-mayor-launches-rat-map-to-tackle-rodent-menace
2018-06-11T10:10:59Z,world,World news,Pennsylvania abuse survivor calls on Pope Francis to intervene,"Mark Rozzi can remember the feeling of the tall grass brushing against his bare legs on the day he and a close friend desperately ran out of the rectory in Hyde Park, Pennsylvania. Rozzi, who was 13 at the time, had just been raped by his priest, the Rev Edward Graff, and remembers thinking in that moment, as he ran through a field, that he would take his terrible new secret to his grave.
When he got home and was peppered with questions by his mother – a Sicilian from Messina who sensed something was wrong – he lied and said Graff had dropped his towel in front of the boys. He did not tell her about the things he came to understand as an adult – that Graff had groomed him for months, by secretly talking to him about sex, plying him with alcohol and showing him pornography. It had all culminated in his vicious rape by Graff in a shower, where Rozzi can still recall staring at the tiles and wondering if he should stay or run. Rozzi did not, in the end, take his secret to his grave, and nor did hundreds of other victims. This month, the state attorney general in Pennsylvania is expected to release an 884-page report that will detail decades of clerical sexual abuse and cover-ups by the Roman Catholic church in six of Pennsylvania’s eight Catholic dioceses. The report has not yet been made public, but has been shared with the bishops in the six dioceses: Allentown, Erie, Greensburg, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Scranton. The report, which followed a grand jury investigation, comes two years after a separate state inquiry into another Catholic diocese, Altoona-Johnstown, found that hundreds of children had been abused by more than 50 priests in the last few decades. The results of the latest investigation could reignite a debate over the church’s poor handling of sexual abuse cases, even as Pope Francis has sought to come to grips with another clerical abuse scandal in Chile, where all of the country’s bishops recently offered their resignation.
In a letter to the Chilean bishops that was leaked to the media, Francis accused the Chilean hierarchy for lying about clerical sex abuse, destroying evidence and moving priests even when there was evidence of previous wrongdoing. The acts were examples of “grave negligence”, Francis said. Rozzi, who is now a state legislator and has been a staunch advocate for the rights of sexual abuse survivors, said he had not yet seen the grand jury report, but expected it to list hundreds of priests, and hundreds of their victims, and how the church covered up abuse. In his own case, Rozzi later learned that Graff, who has since died, was moved from parish to parish until he ended up in a Catholic-run rehabilitation centre. After being released, he is believed to have abused more children in Texas. “It is going to be the worst grand jury report in American history on sexual abuse cases, because it is going to be expansive,” Rozzi said, adding that it would also include testimony by priests and nuns about sexual abuse they suffered at the hands of other priests. “It will be the same stories over and over again. Of sexual abuse, of rape and cover-up,” he told the Guardian. The Vatican declined to comment. Rozzi said he expected that the report would also disclose new details of efforts by elected officials and community leaders to try to block legislation that would support abuse victims. So far, efforts by Rozzi to pass legislation that would allow previous victims to sue the church have ended up being blocked following lobbying campaigns by the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference, which Rozzi said has in the past unleashed 39 lobbyists to lobby 50 state senators. The question Rozzi is asking now is will the church change its approach now that Francis has expressed deep regret over the previous inaction in Chile? The efforts to block new laws on behalf of survivors has been led by the conservative archbishop of Philadelphia, Charles Chaput. A spokesman for the archbishop did not immediately comment. “We are asking the pope to intervene. I would love the opportunity to talk to Francis and let him know what is going on, and for him to do what is happening in Chile, and to ask those bishops in Pennsylvania to resign,” Rozzi told the Guardian.
Rozzi said the latest example of the church’s obfuscation came recently, when he was told that some bishops – who were not named by the court – had made a request that the release of the grand jury report by blocked. Their request was denied. The diocese of Allentown – one of the six – said it was not involved in the effort. In a statement, it said it welcomed the release of the report. “This story needs to be told,” the diocese said in a statement on its website. For Rozzi, the pain of his past can feel too much to bear, a fact he has discussed openly with his family and in an emotional interview with the Guardian. “It is time for them to accept responsibility and say we are going to turn the corner and do what is right and take care of our own,” Rozzi said. “All this has led to the destruction of our faith and physical and mental problems we live with for the rest of our lives. I can tell you it is not getting better, it is getting worse, as I get older.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/pennsylvania-catholic-church-abuse-allegations-report,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/pennsylvania-catholic-church-abuse-allegations-report
2018-06-11T09:19:35Z,world,World news,Gay asylum seeker faces deportation from UK to Nigeria,"A Nigerian asylum seeker who fled to Britain to avoid prosecution for being gay is facing deportation after being held for six months in an immigration detention centre. The threat hanging over Adeniyi Raji, 43, who received death threats on social media, highlights the increasing number of claims to the Home Office by individuals from countries where homosexuality is outlawed. In Nigeria, homosexual acts are punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Gay marriage and displays of same-sex affection are also outlawed. After Pakistan and Bangladesh, it is the country that produces the largest number of asylum claims based on sexual orientation. Home Office figures published last year show there were 362 such applications from Nigerians in the 21 months from July 2015 to March 2017. Of those, only 63 were allowed to remain in the UK after a tribunal hearing; the rest, 81%, were refused permission to stay. Raji fled the city of Lagos and arrived at Heathrow airport in November. He claimed asylum and was immediately detained, being held at Harmondsworth and Tinsley House detention centres. He was recently given bail and released from detention. “I decided to come to the UK to seek refuge and humanitarian protection [because] my life was in danger in Nigeria,” he told the Guardian. “I was attacked on several occasions. [My] ex-wife caught me and my former partner in bed. As soon as she saw us, she immediately raised the alarm. People gathered and started beating us severely. After that, she divorced me.” His employer in Lagos sacked him for being gay. “The Nigerian police started publishing my pictures and my name in the Nigerian national dailies,” he added. “They kept saying that anyone who has useful information that could lead to my arrest should come forward [so that I can] face the wrath of the land as a result of my sexual orientations.” Threats against him on on social media in Nigeria included comments such as: “I really wish you were killed that very day …”, “You know gay practice is an abomination in our land …”, and “You better stop your gay practice, if not you could get yourself killed in this country”. A first-tier immigration tribunal has rejected his asylum application. He is appealing against that decision. Bisi Alimi, a Nigerian-born British citizen who runs a UK-based campaign supporting LGBT rights in his home country, criticised the Home Office’s treatment of gay asylum seekers. “They are often treated as liars. It becomes their responsibility to prove that they are gay and that that will put their lives at risk,” he said. “In Nigeria, people put a tyre around your neck and burn you, and no one cares; or beat you until you die, and no one cares. The Home Office doesn’t believe in the impact of threats from non-state actors. “Most of the time it’s difficult to prove [anyone is gay] because they live their private lives in hiding. Most don’t have a life history [of being openly gay]. There’s been an increase in the number of Nigerians seeking asylum in the UK on the basis of their sexuality.” Raji’s solicitor, Bhaveshri Patel-Chandegra, an immigration specialist at the law firm Duncan Lewis, said: “The court has looked at his case and nullified all his evidence that he is at serious risk if removed to Nigeria but there’s been no evidence that his documents aren’t genuine.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and each claim is carefully considered on its individual merits. “We have worked closely with organisations and charities, including Stonewall, the UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group, and the UN high commissioner for refugees to improve our guidance and training for asylum caseworkers.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/gay-asylum-seeker-faces-deportation-from-uk-to-nigeria-adeniyi-raji,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/gay-asylum-seeker-faces-deportation-from-uk-to-nigeria-adeniyi-raji
2018-06-11T06:35:13Z,world,World news,Barricades draw battle lines over Nicaragua's revolutionary heritage,"Nicaragua has become a country of barricades as what began as a protest against pension cuts has quickly spiralled into a wide-ranging civic uprising against what many see as President Daniel Ortega’s autocratic 11-year rule.
The improvised roadblocks are a ubiquitous marker of Nicaragua’s current crisis, serving as both bulwark and emblem. Opposition newspapers publish maps of the protesters’ barricades on major highways around the republic. And in a country that lacks conventional street addresses – which instead are rendered as directions indicating a certain number of blocks from a given landmark – the joke currently doing the rounds on social media is that a typical Nicaraguan address is now: “From the barricade by the park, two barricades south and three barricades up.” Nicaragua’s streets have for decades been paved with polygonal concrete blocks known as adoquines. At the time of the popular, Sandinista-led revolution in 1979 against the dictator Anastasio Somoza, rebels found it was easy to lever these blocks out of the roadway and stack them into effective barricades as the armed revolt spread through Nicaragua’s cities and towns. The fact that the adoquines themselves were manufactured in a cement plant owned by the Somoza family added a piquant irony.
The barricades were such a feature of the revolution – which brought Daniel Ortega to power for the first time – that the now defunct Sandinista newspaper took the name Barricada and its masthead featured an image of a guerrilla firing from behind a makeshift rampart. (The paper’s longtime editor, Carlos Fernando Chamorro, is now a leading media critic of the government.)
So while on one level the barricades are simply practical – staking out territory and providing a measure of protection from the police and armed supporters of the government who have so far left nearly 130 protesters dead – they also represent a battle for the iconography of Sandinismo and who can claim to be Nicaragua’s true revolutionaries. Many of today’s protesters draw a direct line from barricades of the 1979 insurrection to their own uprising against what they see as a new dictator. But supporters of the government see themselves as the true heirs of the revolution – and those on the street as the agents of reactionary, possibly foreign-sponsored, forces.
Ortega, 72, still heads the Sandinista National Liberation Front, a party whose name recalls its origins as a Che Guevara-style guerrilla group. These days, its old red and black colours have been replaced by fuchsia, apparently at the suggestion of the president’s wife and now vice-president, Rosario Murillo, who has denounced the protesters as “toxic groups”.
Critics, though, allege that the party has long since become a personal vehicle for the president. Ortega’s vice-president during the 1980s, the internationally acclaimed novelist Sergio Ramírez, has hailed today’s youthful protesters as the “grandchildren of the revolution” and this week said of Ortega: “His time is up.” For now, Daniel Ortega remains in power. A church-sponsored dialogue has broken down, the casualties continue to mount and the adoquines remain piled high on city streets. But for a self-described revolutionary, being on the opposite side of the barricades is, at the very least, not a good look.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/10/barricades-draw-battle-lines-over-nicaraguas-revolutionary-heritage,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/10/barricades-draw-battle-lines-over-nicaraguas-revolutionary-heritage
2018-06-11T06:30:13Z,world,World news,"At Nicaragua's oldest university, resistance is the new curriculum","The spike strips, barricades, molotov cocktails and masked rebels at its perimeter leave no doubt: school is out at the Managua campus of Nicaragua’s oldest university. Banners demanding the removal of President Daniel Ortega deck the padlocked gates of the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (Unan), behind which lurk bleary-eyed undergraduate insurgents bracing for an onslaught they believe could come at any time.
“Our struggle is to eliminate this regime,” said Armando Téllez, the first-year economics student running one of three such protest camps to have consumed local universities since anti-government demonstrations erupted on 18 April. “The people have woken up – and there’s no way of putting them back to sleep.” Organisers say 500 rebel students have taken up permanent residence on the Unan’s campus since it was occupied on 7 May. “You’re being watched by 20 or 30 people,” another leader, Jonathan López, explained as he offered a tour of the student stronghold’s improvised ramparts – metal, wood and concrete barricades manned by masked students equipped with hard hats and shields fashioned from empty steel drums. Some carry improvised “mortars” – homemade devices which fire small explosive charges to deter attackers. “If I wasn’t with you they’d have let off five or six mortars already,” the 20-year-old added with a grin. The Unan occupation is one front in a mushrooming nationwide revolt against Ortega, the onetime Sandinista hero who helped overthrow Anastasio Somoza’s brutal dictatorship in 1979 and has ruled Nicaragua since making an electoral comeback in 2006.
Such is the level of discontent with what critics call Ortega’s corrupt and authoritarian rule – and such is Ortega’s apparent reluctance to step down – that some fear Central America’s largest nation now stands on the brink of a new era of mayhem. Rolando Álvarez, one of the most senior members of Nicaragua’s Catholic church, warned that unless the country’s 72-year-old president and his widely loathed wife and vice-president, Rosario Murillo, offered immediate concessions to the protesters “it is very likely that Nicaragua will find itself caught up once again in a civil war”.
“It would be a disaster, a chaos that we do not want,” said Álvarez, bishop of the city of Matagalpa. “I ask the Divine Spirit to illuminate the minds and the hearts of the president and the vice-president,” added Álvarez, a key figure in a recently suspended national dialogue that had been trying to find a political solution to the crisis but was abandoned because of Ortega’s failure to halt the violent repression of protests. “The cards are in the hands of the president. After God, he has the last word.” With the body count rising, and Ortega showing no sign of resigning or agreeing to early elections, Carlos Fernando Chamorro, editor of the opposition newsletter Confidencial, said he also felt trepidation. Activists say at least 130 people have been killed since the uprising began almost two months ago – the majority gunned down during police crackdowns or attacks by mysterious masked gunmen suspected of being government-backed paramilitaries. “Daniel Ortega will resist until the very last moment. And this means more repression, more pain and situations that I don’t even want to imagine,” warned Chamorro, the son of former president Violeta Chamorro. “I sincerely believe that we are living through a very dangerous moment because nobody – nobody – is safe today in Nicaragua. I’m not talking about me. No one is safe,” he added.
That is not news to the students of Unan, many of whom lost friends or relatives when demonstrations they were taking part in came under fire. “I’ve seen something like 20 or 30 people die … Some people here have watched their own brothers die,” said López, a third-year economics student from the colonial city of Granada, the stage for deadly clashes last week. The university has come under attack, with students reporting drive-by shootings at the roadblocks they have erected around the Unan. “A motorbike will come by and let off a whole clip. It’s happened several times,” claimed Téllez. A 25-year-old anaesthesiology graduate who runs five clinics within the occupation said his volunteer medics had treated five gunshot wounds since students stormed the campus last month. “In the back, the neck, the arm and the face,” said the doctor, who asked that only his nickname, Veneno (Poison), be used. “I wish I could be at home taking cold showers and watching movies – but as long as the people don’t give up, we won’t either.” The Unan may not be able to offer guests much in the way of security, but it does have an abundance of refreshments. A garage has been converted into a distribution centre for food supplies from sympathetic locals. The university’s sylvan grounds are overflowing with fresh fruit. “We’ve got mangoes, mamones, jocotes,” said Téllez. “We’re self-sufficient!” The odd Nicaraguan beer has also found its way into the encampment, with empty cans of Toña littering one frontline barricade.
There is plenty of shelter, too. The Institute of Geology and Geophysics – a two-storey building filled with glass cabinets containing precious stones and fossils – is now a hospital-cum-dormitory-cum-canteen where protesters can dine alfresco on a small rectangular lawn before crashing on mattresses and sofas in its corridors. Outside, dozens more squatters camp out under black tarpaulins or in hammocks strung between trees. “We feel tired, some are frustrated,” admitted camp commander Téllez, who said many of the protesters had not seen their families in weeks.
But messages of support have been posted around the occupation to lift spirits. One handwritten letter, from allies in the northern city of Ocotal, reads: “Dear students, We are grateful for the heroism and humanity of all those who are resisting in the Unan bastion.” “As young people and Nicaraguan citizens we cherish the ideal of a more democratic society in which people can live together in harmony … You embody the ideal of an authentic, fair and non-violent struggle. The ideal of a fair and free Nicaragua … The truth and the people will always win out.” Chamorro described Nicaragua’s rebel students as key members of a broader coalition that would been needed to force Ortega from office through a mix of dialogue, diplomacy, street protest and economic persuasion. “The solution requires an effort of maximum pressure.” But the journalist, who worked with Ortega during the 1980s when he edited the Sandinista newspaper, Barricada, warned that those trying to topple the onetime revolutionary did not fully appreciate the cunning of a man who has dominated Nicaraguan politics for decades. “Ortega cannot be underestimated. He is a political animal. He is a very determined political animal. And I’m worried … about how far he can go in terms of repressing.” At the Unan, the millennial rebels defying their septuagenarian president were adamant they would not be cowed.
“We’re defending democracy in our country,” said a 28-year-old chemistry dropout who was manning a barrier at the campus’s south-eastern tip, his face hidden by a blue ski-mask and a knife strapped to his thigh. “I’m ready, physically and psychologically, for whatever disaster might come.” A few hours later one did. At about 9.40pm on Thursday night, two SUVs carrying armed paramilitaries descended on one Unan fortification and began spraying it with bullets. Chester Javier Chavarría, 19, was hit in the chest and died as he was taken to hospital. “His death will not be in vain. One way or the other they will pay for his death,” vowed a fellow student rebel. “[The government] talks about love, peace. But you don’t show your love with shootouts.” Additional reporting by Juan Diego Briceño",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/nicaragua-university-protest-daniel-ortega-occupation,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/nicaragua-university-protest-daniel-ortega-occupation

The G7 summit, which brought together world leaders from Germany, Japan, Canada, the US, Italy, France and the UK, was held in Charlevoix, Quebec, in Canada, over the weekend. This year’s summit had a particular focus on trade. However, the enduring image from the summit was one in which divisions between the group were clear. The German chancellor’s office posted the striking picture to Instagram on Saturday with the caption: “Day two of the G7 summit in Canada: spontaneous meeting between two working sessions.” The photograph, which was taken by the German cabinet’s official photographer Jesco Denze, was quickly singled out for its uncanny resemblance to a classical painting.
Some Twitter users alluded to the overshadowing tensions between the two world leaders. After Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and recent tariffs on trade, the summit had been renamed by many journalists as the ‘G6 plus one’.
While others just jumped at the chance to have a little fun.
After a calamitous G7 summit, Donald Trump has arrived in Singapore ahead of his historic meeting with Kim Jong-un.

2018-06-11T05:30:47Z,world,World news,Monday briefing: Trump and Kim prepare for Singapore fling,"Top story: Sherpas smooth way to summit Good morning. I’m Martin Farrer and here’s the news to start the week. With the train wreck that was the G7 summit still dominating discussion in western capitals, the US president will put his diplomatic skills to the test again when he meets Kim Jong-un in Singapore tomorrow. As the US president tweeted that it was “great to be in Singapore” and that there was “excitement in the air”, preparations for the historic summit were in full swing in the Asian city state. Officials or so-called sherpas from each side were in talks aimed at narrowing differences before their leaders come face to face to discuss a possible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. Questions remain over what denuclearisation might entail but North Korea’s state-run news agency said the two sides would exchange “wide-ranging and profound views” to re-set relations and heralded the summit as part of a “changed era”. Here’s our guide to everything you need to know about the summit and you can also read about how Kim’s bodyguards have been trying to prevent snoopers trying to catch a glimpse of the supreme leader. For some light relief, there’s also news of the Fox TV host who apologised after referring to Trump and Kim as the “two dictators”. * * * Banks under scrutiny – Pressure is mounting on the pro-Brexit businessman Arron Banks to explain his connections to Russia after leaked emails revealed he had met the Kremlin’s ambassador to the UK three times, rather than once as he had previously said. Banks, who was the biggest single donor to the Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum, will face a postponed hearing before the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, which is investigating “fake news”. But the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said Banks should face a criminal investigation “based on an in-depth forensic look into the Kremlin connection”, while the Conservative chairman of the committee, Damian Collins, said he wanted to establish whether Banks profited from his Russian links. For his part, Banks denies any “Russian espionage” and has promised to take a hostile approach at his interrogation tomorrow. * * * Green warning – Springwatch presenter Chris Packham has warned that we are presiding over “an ecological apocalypse” and Britain is increasingly “a green and unpleasant land”. The naturalist has urging people to join a 10-day “bioblitz” next month which will aim to record what wildlife remains – from butterflies to bryophytes, linnets to lichens – in Britain’s highways and byways. * * * Fat chance – Scientists in America claim to have found a breakthrough in treating obesity which involves converting “bad” white fat into “good” brown fat tissue that burns calories far more rapidly. The radical approach has so far only been tested in human cells and in mice, but if the technique is shown to work in human trials it could prove to be an effective treatment for diabetes and obesity. Researchers at NYU Winthrop hospital in New York say the idea of harnessing “energy hungry” brown fat could bypass the use of weight control drugs, which can have harmful side-effects, and of invasive bariatric surgery, which can be risky and limited in its effectiveness. * * *
Safe haven – The mayor of Palermo has defied Italy’s newly installed populist government by opening the city’s port to a private rescue ship carrying 629 migrants picked up from people-smuggling vessels in the Mediterranean. The country’s hardline interior minister, Matteo Salvini, vowed on Sunday that all Italian ports would be closed to the Aquarius, but Leoluca Orlando decided to give the safe haven after Malta also refused to allow the ship to dock. He said Sicily had “always welcomed rescue boats and vessels who saved lives at sea. We will not stop now”. * * * Patient practice – Medical examiners will investigate patient deaths in the NHS in an effort to improve safety and protect staff from being prosecuted. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, is introducing the changes after the case of Hadiza Bawa-Garba, a trainee paediatrician who was convicted of gross negligence manslaughter and struck off following the death of a child in her care, Jack Adcock. Doctors rallied to her defence and said understaffing rather than incompetence was to blame for the tragedy. * * * Long hot summer? – World peace may be in the balance in Singapore this week and Britain is facing an environmental apocalypse, but the good news is that we can look forward to a hotter-than-average summer. After a record-breaking May, forecasters expect the good weather to continue over the next three months. The next week or so could be a bit rainy, they say, but after that things will clear up with a greater likelihood of above-average temperatures in June, July and August than below-average ones.

2018-06-11T05:00:11Z,world,World news,Abortion campaigners target Sajid Javid over Northern Ireland,"Sajid Javid will come under pressure from a crossbench group of MPs to bring forward a bill that would allow reformers to decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland. More than 30 MPs have pledged to send the home secretary written questions on Monday demanding the domestic abuse bill be brought before parliament by the autumn. This would allow pro-choice MPs to put down an amendment that would give women in Northern Ireland the right to access terminations. Calls for a shakeup of Northern Ireland’s strict anti-abortion laws have been growing since voters in the Republic of Ireland ditched a constitutional curb on the procedures in a landmark referendum last month. Theresa May faces a headache over the issue because the government depends on the support of 10 Democratic Unionist party MPs, who strongly oppose any change to Northern Ireland’s strict abortion laws.
MPs are targeting Javid, who is yet to comment on the issue, as they seek to allow parliament to hold a free vote on whether to repeal sections 58 and 59 of the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. Supreme court judges last week recommended repealing the legislation to address the breach in the human rights of Northern Irish women caused by the failure to provide access to abortion services. The MPs putting questions to Javid include the Conservative health select committee chairwoman, Sarah Wollaston, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Jo Swinson, the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas and the Conservative former minister Ed Vaizey. The Labour MP Stella Creasy plans to table an amendment to the bill aimed at equalising access across the UK and reducing the need for women from Northern Ireland to travel to England to access help. “It is clear there’s a majority across parliament who want to see this legislation which criminalises women who seek an abortion repealed, yet without this legislation being brought forward to parliament, an amendment can’t be tabled,” she said. “The government won’t give a date, so now MPs across parties are tabling questions demanding the home secretary set out the bill timetable. Without this, we face the prospect of a rape victim having to give evidence about the damage this legislation does to women’s rights before the government is forced to act,” she said. Campaign organisations including Bpas, the London-Irish Abortion Rights Campaign, Nupas, FPA, Amnesty International, Together for Yes and Alliance for Choice are working together to call for the decriminalisation of abortion across the UK. Last week, supreme court judges said Northern Ireland’s abortion law is incompatible with human rights legislation, but rejected a challenge brought by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission on technical grounds. The prime minister continued to resist calls to intervene in Northern Ireland’s affairs and insisted change was a matter for the devolved government there, which has not met for more than a year. The domestic abuse bill, which is out for public consultation, is a flagship piece of legislation for the prime minister. A government spokesperson said: “We want to see devolved government in Northern Ireland restored, so that locally elected, democratically accountable politicians can debate fundamental changes to policy on abortion, and the people of Northern Ireland have a direct say in the process.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/abortion-campaigners-target-sajid-javid-over-northern-ireland,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/abortion-campaigners-target-sajid-javid-over-northern-ireland
2018-06-11T01:11:46Z,world,World news,Kim Jong-undercover: North Korean security bars onlookers from snapping leader,"During a security lockdown inside and outside Singapore’s five-star St Regis hotel before the arrival of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Sunday, only two journalists moved freely along the blockaded street, flanked by crowds held back by police.
The two were North Korean cameramen waiting to capture images of their leader, who all North Koreans are duty-bound to revere, arriving for a historic summit with US president Donald Trump. The pair – dressed in identical black suits, with lapel badges showing former North Korean leaders and flanked by Singapore police – were busy getting into the best position for Kim’s arrival, setting up cameras in the middle of the road. The behaviour of the two cameramen, and of North Korean security guards who accosted tourists taking photos, offered a glimpse into how isolated, tightly regimented North Korea works. In authoritarian North Korea, where Kim’s family has passed on power through three generations, images propagated by state media such as the Korea Central News Agency, the Rodong Sinmun newspaper and Korean Central Television, help build a leader’s legitimacy and glorify his status.
Most North Koreans are still largely in the dark about the momentous summit. The official media has reported that the two leaders plan to meet, but has offered few specifics, including where and when. There was no official word until Monday that Kim had left the country.
As Kim’s motorcade approached his hotel in Singapore another two North Korean cameramen in black suits emerged through the sun-roof of a black SUV, filming the crowd. One car back, a photographer dressed identically stood out of the sun-roof of another black SUV, taking shots down the length of the motorcade. Security around Kim’s hotel was extremely tight and guests were prohibited from going in and out, hours before Kim’s black Mercedes-Benz limousine arrived. While a dozen North Korean journalists flanked by dozens of North Korean security men worked to capture Kim’s every movement, guests in the hotel lobby were repeatedly told by Singapore police and hotel staff not to take pictures of any North Koreans, especially Kim. When a couple of guests were seen sneaking a photo, a North Korean official approached and demanded to check their phones. “I saw them taking a photo of our chairman. How dare they do so, they shouldn’t,” the official told Reuters later. He declined to be identified.
Under the watchful eye of the official, and hotel staff, the guest deleted his photos. Another guest, challenged by the same North Korean official, said she had taken photos only of the lobby and refused to show her phone. After taking her to a private area, hotel staff assured the North Korean official she did not have photos of Kim. Other guests were bemused. “What do you expect? It’s North Korea,” said one western tourist with a shrug. Nicola Harding, visiting from Britain, said that it was all “a little weird”. But a human touch will always emerge, it seems. Several of the reporters who accompanied Kim to Singapore had also been to the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas for the inter-Korean summit in April. Recognising a Reuters reporter from then, one North Korean journalist, who declined to give his name, said: “It’s nice to see you again.” Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this report",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/kim-jong-undercover-north-korean-security-bars-onlookers-pictures,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/kim-jong-undercover-north-korean-security-bars-onlookers-pictures
2018-06-10T23:30:20Z,world,World news,"North Korea summit explainer: the people, problems and possibilities","The on-again off-again summit between Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will take place on 12 June in Singapore, the first time a sitting US president will meet the head of the isolated state. It is a high-stakes bid to try to solve the issue of nuclear weapons that has dogged four US presidents.
How did we get here? After fiery rhetoric between North Korea and the US last year, Kim declared in his New Year’s address that the country’s weapons program was complete. He then launched a charm offensive with South Korea, using the Winter Olympics to send high-level officials to meet the South’s president, Moon Jae-in. Those contacts culminated in a summit between Moon and Kim in April at a border village and a joint declaration that both leaders were committed to “complete denuclearisation”. Moon then brokered direct talks between US and North Korean officials, and when a senior South Korean official said Kim wanted to meet Trump, the impulsive US president reportedly accepted on the spot. Who are the main players? Kim Jong-un: The 34-year-old leader of North Korea who has incredible power and will benefit from simply meeting Trump. It will confer a sense of legitimacy on his rogue nation. Donald Trump: The mercurial US president who is looking for a major win after an administration dogged by scandals and stalled legislative efforts at home. Moon Jae-in: While the South Korean president may not be travelling to Singapore, his liberal government – elected after the downfall of his conservative predecessor –has been a major driver of rapprochement with the North. Mike Pompeo: Washington’s top diplomat has been on the front line of salvaging the meeting and is the most senior American to meet Kim Jong-un. Kim Yong-chol: The septuagenarian is the North’s top nuclear negotiator and former spymaster, he has focused on US policy for decades and was an adviser to both Kim Jong-un’s father and grandfather.
What is the focus of the talks?
The Trump-Kim meeting is squarely centred on convincing North Korea to give up its nuclear arsenal. In a New Year’s address Kim stated the country’s weapons development was complete in the wake of the most powerful nuclear detonation, in September 2017, and missile tests that could theoretically hit the US mainland. On Monday, North Korea’s state media said the pair would discuss a “permanent and durable peace-keeping mechanism” on the Korean peninsula, denuclearisation of the peninsula and other topics of mutual concern. There are other major issues the international community would like to address, including North Korea’s stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons and the country’s dismal human rights record. But those are unlikely to be brought up directly by Trump. What are the potential sticking points? Both sides have traditionally had radically different definitions of the word “denuclearisation”. For the US, it means Pyongyang would immediately dismantle its weapons program, ship nuclear warheads out of the country and allow international inspectors to verify the results. In diplomatic speak this is known as complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement, or CVID for short. North Korea likely envisions a staged process, where each concession from Pyongyang is met with something from Washington. Sanctions relief, economic aid, a formal peace treaty to end the 1950-53 Korean war and formal diplomatic ties could all be potential sweeteners to any deal. Why is the summit being held in Singapore? In the protocol-heavy world of diplomacy, everything is imbued with meaning. There was talk of holding the talks at Panmunjom, the “truce village” on the border between North and South Korea, but American officials worried it would be interpreted as the US being too accommodating of Kim. Singapore has diplomatic relations with both the US and North Korea, and can be seen as a nominally neutral party. What are the likely outcomes? When he announced the summit was back on, Trump said: “We’re not going to sign something.” He refused to comment on possible sanctions relief for North Korea, but added: “I look forward to the day when I can take the sanctions off North Korea.” He also said additional economic restrictions were ready to be implemented should the talks fall apart. Kim is likely looking for some sanctions to be lifted as he tries to improve the North’s economy. There have been reports Kim and Trump could declare a formal end to the Korean war, which ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty. But that might be complicated by the fact China would probably need to sign off on any agreement, since it was a signatory to the armistice pact.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/north-korea-summit-explainer,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/north-korea-summit-explainer
2018-06-10T23:01:05Z,world,World news,Lack of data hampers Theresa May's efforts on racial inequality,"Theresa May’s efforts to tackle racial disparity in public services are being hampered by poor data-gathering in Whitehall, MPs have warned. The House of Commons’ women and equalities committee welcomed the launch of the prime minister’s groundbreaking race disparity audit after she entered Downing Street in 2016, but said that without robust ethnicity data, government departments would remain ignorant of the “uncomfortable truths” they were supposed to be addressing. Among the findings of its first report, published in October 2017, were that: • Chinese and Asian secondary school pupils outperformed their white and black counterparts; • Black men were more than three times as likely to be arrested as white men; • The unemployment rate for black, Asian and minority ethnic people was nearly double that of white British adults. However, the committee said that without consistent data departments would struggle to develop the policies needed to address such inequalities.
“It is clear that public services are not currently collecting ethnicity data in a streamlined fashion and that some agencies are not collecting data at all,” it said. “Clear and measurable plans are needed for improving the consistency and robustness of the data and turning it into a set of cross-government priorities for action to reduce the disparities shown by the audit.” The committee’s chair, Maria Miller, said: “We strongly commend the principle and sound intentions of the race disparity audit. As the prime minister has said herself, it has helped expose many uncomfortable truths. “However, the picture at present is that data collection across different areas of government and public services is inconsistent, not properly joined up and in some cases just isn’t happening. That isn’t good enough.” A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: “This government is determined to build a society that works for everyone and we have not shied away from exposing uncomfortable truths that need to be addressed. It is encouraging that the committee has recognised the race disparity audit as an exemplary programme for tackling injustices. “The government has already taken action to address disparities it highlighted, and will set out in its response to the committee how it will continue to do so as we build a fairer society for everyone.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/lack-of-data-hampers-theresa-mays-efforts-on-racial-inequality,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/lack-of-data-hampers-theresa-mays-efforts-on-racial-inequality
2018-06-10T18:00:11Z,world,World news,Merkel's G7 photo says everything about Trump's diplomacy – or does it?,"Donald Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, insisted on Sunday that the president was “willing to talk to any world leader”.
But a day after Trump left a trail of diplomatic chaos from Canada to Singapore, the site of his summit with Kim Jong-un of North Korea, a picture of world leaders apparently confronting Trump dominated reactions to the G7 summit. The picture was taken by Jesco Denzel, a German government photographer, and released by Steffen Seibert, spokesman for the chancellor, Angela Merkel. It shows Trump, arms folded and eyes glaring, sitting while around him stand a group of world leaders and their advisers. Merkel is centre stage, arms planted on a table, with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, standing to her left, arms folded and a look of resignation on his face. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, stands next to Merkel, partially obscured, with the British prime minister, Theresa May, more obscured still at his right. To many observers the photograph, a rare glimpse of diplomatic activity not wreathed in smiles and handshakes, seemed both a summation of the effect of Trump’s “America first” foreign policy and the perfect pictorial accompaniment to a tense couple of days in Canada. Departing Washington on Friday, Trump called for Russia to be readmitted to the G7, four years after it was thrown out over the annexation of Crimea. At a Saturday afternoon press conference in La Malbaie, he blamed Barack Obama for the Russian invasion of Ukraine and complained about the US being a “piggy bank” which he said other countries were “robbing”.
In the picture released by Merkel, John Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser, stands at the president’s right. Showing that images of conflict can be deployed by both sides, the hawkish former United Nations ambassador used the same picture in a tweet issued after Trump’s early departure from the summit. Bolton wrote: “Just another #G7 where other countries expect America will always be their bank. The president made it clear today. No more.” That prepared the ground for Trump’s attack on the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and the US withdrawal from a communique on trade negotiated in an attempt to defuse tensions over Trump’s protectionist policy. The release of the picture caused animated commentary around the world about body language and what it might say about relations between the US and its allies in the Trump era. It was followed on Sunday by a furious attack on Trudeau by Trump’s leading economic advisers.
But every picture tells a story. Other images of the same gathering suggested a more relaxed interaction, Merkel smiling and Trump making eye contact while Trudeau, also smiling, stood by. The White House issued its own photo, showing a sitting Trump speaking as Merkel, Abe and Trudeau listened.
Helpfully, a German journalist tweeted composites of six contrasting pictures of the same moment – and who released them to the press. Still, there appears to be more than a little truth to suggestions that Merkel and Trump do not get on. Saturday was not the first awkward moment between them, and the chancellor has made no secret of her disagreement with the president on trade, his rejection of the Iran nuclear deal and his withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. In March 2017, Merkel’s first visit to the White House saw Trump either fail to hear or ignore the chancellor’s offer to shake hands. A visit in April this year warranted only a working lunch, several days after a state visit by Macron.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/10/angela-merkel-photo-donald-trump-diplomacy,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/10/angela-merkel-photo-donald-trump-diplomacy
2018-06-10T17:26:44Z,world,World news,Greece puts men accused over Turkey coup attempt under armed guard,"Greece has put in place the “greatest possible” measures to protect eight Turkish commandos accused of being coup plotters after Ankara warned it was a “national duty” to do everything within its power to bring them back. A week after the men were freed from detention, Athens admitted they were under 24/7 guard at an undisclosed location, for fear of retaliation. The admission came despite mounting tensions with Ankara, which last week suspended a refugee readmission deal with Athens, arguing the soldiers participated in the abortive coup against Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in July 2016. Greece’s deputy defence minister, Fotis Kouvelis, told the Guardian: “We are enforcing the greatest possible measures to secure their safety in a place which for obvious reasons will remain unknown. We haven’t forgotten what happened in our region a few months ago.” Kouvelis was referring to the enforced removal from Kosovo of six Turkish citizens also denounced as followers of the US-based cleric Fethullah Gülen, who Ankara has blamed for orchestrating the putsch. Tensions over the eight men, who flew into Greece on a Black Hawk helicopter a day after the failed coup, have added to an increasingly fiery campaign ahead of snap presidential and parliamentary elections in Turkey on 24 June. Friction with the west has escalated as the race appears to have tightened. At the weekend, Erdoğan accused Austria of fomenting a religious war between “cross” and “crescent” after it shut down overseas-funded mosques and raised the prospect of expelling Turkish Muslim clerics. But it is Greece that has been the focus of growing animus in Ankara with bilateral relations approaching an all-time low. Addressing an election rally in the western city of Izmir on Sunday, the nationalist MHP leader Devlet Bahçeli, who in the run up to the election has joined forces with Erdoğan’s AK party, ramped up the rhetoric. “The Greeks,” he warned referring to their defeat in 1922 by Turkish troops in the city, “should not forget the days when their grandfathers drowned in the bottom of the sea. “ On Monday, Turkey’s EU minister Omer Celik said it was clear Athens was refusing to hand over the soldiers because it wanted to “extract secrets” from them. Turkey has consistently argued the eight men were involved in the putsch against Erdoğan, which left 250 people dead and more than 2,000 injured. The Greek supreme court has rejected any notion of sending the officers back, saying they would not get a fair trial in Turkey, where a purge of the military and civil establishment continues. In April, the council of state, Greece’s highest administrative court, granted one of the eight commandos permanent asylum, despite objections by Alexis Tsipras’s leftist-led government. Similar judgments are expected to follow when verdicts are issued in the remaining cases. The men, who deny involvement in the coup, were moved to the secret location when the 18-month period they were legally allowed to be held in detention expired last week. Kouvelis said: “We have an independent justice system which applies EU laws, international laws. It’s not something we can ignore. We have to listen to it.” Media reports on Sunday suggested the commandos were at risk of being abducted and assassinated. The newspaper Ta Nea reported that 80 police officers, including snipers, had been seconded to protect the Turks. Kouvelis said air and sea violations by Turkish forces in the Aegean Sea had increased, with Turkey dispatching warships to its western shores facing Greece. “A lot of ships have been transferred to the area and we are talking about fighter jets moving at crazy speeds, which raises the possibility of an accident,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/10/greece-eight-commandos-accused-turkey-coup-armed-guard,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/10/greece-eight-commandos-accused-turkey-coup-armed-guard
2018-06-10T14:07:28Z,world,World news,Aid groups in Yemen warned attack could endanger all supplies,"The UK’s Department for International Development has told aid groups to make contingency plans for an imminent attack on the strategic port of Hodeidah, a move that could endanger humanitarian supplies for the entire famine-struck country. The note to aid agencies reads: “We are doing everything we can through diplomatic channels to discourage an assault on Hodeidah. However despite these actions, a military assault now looks imminent. “The Emiratis have informed us today that they will now give a 3-day grace period for the UN [and their partners] to leave the city. Please take all precautions necessary to prepare for this and let us know if there is anything we can do to assist you in any way. We are thinking of you and your staff at this very difficult time.” The UK minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, said in a tweet: “Extremely concerned that life-saving organizations are not getting the security guarantees they need to work safely in Yemen. All parties to the conflict must allow safe, rapid and unhindered humanitarian access to all parts of Yemen”. It appears that pressure on the UAE to agree a ceasefire is not having much effect, and the US government is unwilling to go as far as damaging ties with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over an issue that is so important to Riyadh.
The UN issued a public statement on Friday saying that in its worst-case scenario planningas many as 250,000 civilians would be killed as a result of an attack on Hodeidah. The Red Sea port supplies more than 80% of the aid for Yemen, including commercial and humanitarian aid. Houthi forces have held the port for more than two years, and the US and Saudi coalition see it as a route through which the rebels have been smuggling arms, including missiles with which to attack Saudi Arabia. Reports on Saturday suggested the Lower Al-Jahah area, south of the city, had been captured in fierce fighting. Local experts have said an attack on Hodeidah would be “Yemen’s Aleppo”. Bipartisan efforts in the US Senate are under way to tell the UAE and Saudi Arabia that proceeding may result in US assistance to the Saudi/UAE coalition in Yemen being severed. Senators Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, and Todd Young, a Republican, have already raised that threat. “The civil war and the world’s largest humanitarian crisis in Yemen are inflicting unacceptable damage to our national security interests and exacerbating heartbreaking human suffering,” they said. “The United States must use its influence to persuade Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to pursue an urgent diplomatic solution to end the civil war.” The chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat, also said he was “hearing very worrying reports that UAE forces may be about to strike Hodeida. This would be a mistake and have massive humanitarian and environmental consequences.” Military planners have said an attack was not only likely to cause a humanitarian catastrophe, but that it would be a strategic mistake militarily. NGOs have flagged that any military assault that results in obstructions to humanitarian aid could make parties to the conflict liable for UN sanctions under resolution 2216. Martin Griffiths, the UN special envoy for Yemen, has been holding talks with all sides to try to broker a peace settlement, but he fears a major new military assault could make his plans appear redundant. Lise Grande, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, said on Friday that humanitarian agencies “fear, in a prolonged worst case, that as many as 250,000 people may lose everything – even their lives”. As many as 600,000 civilians live in and around Hodeidah. “Cutting off imports through Hodeidah for any length of time will put Yemen’s population at extreme, unjustifiable risk,” Grande said. David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee (IRC), said: “The port of Hodeidah is a humanitarian lifeline for the people of Yemen. It is imperative that humanitarian supplies are maintained. We repeat, again, that an assault on Hodeidah is a grave threat to life and livelihood. We urge the UN security council to meet to demand immediate assurances to maintain this critical facility.” The IRC added that during the first three months of 2018, Hodeidah was estimated to account for more food imports than the next three largest sea ports combined. It said current levels of food and fuel imports into Yemen were already insufficient to meet the basic needs of the population, and that there was no viable alternative to replace Hodeidah. “Hodeidah is a living community of 400,000 people, including IRC staff working on critical, life-saving health and clean water and sanitation projects,” Miliband said. “Some residents have already left the city, others cannot afford to do so. These people have no option but to wait and see how events outside their control play out.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/10/aid-groups-in-yemen-warned-attack-could-endanger-all-supplies,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/10/aid-groups-in-yemen-warned-attack-could-endanger-all-supplies
2018-06-10T13:15:27Z,world,World news,Oleg Sentsov's family ask Putin to free him before World Cup,"The family of Oleg Sentsov, the Ukrainian film director imprisoned in Russia who is on hunger strike, have called on President Vladimir Putin to release him before the World Cup, which kicks off on Thursday. “He says he’s going to carry his hunger strike through to the end, and Oleg is the kind of person who doesn’t go back on his word,” Sentsov’s cousin Natalia Kaplan told the Guardian. “We have very little time left and I really hope that Putin will take the decision to release him and all the Ukrainian political prisoners before the World Cup.” Sentsov has been on hunger strike since 14 May, saying he will stop only if all Ukrainian political prisoners are released. His lawyer, Dmitry Dinze, who visited Sentsov in prison last week, said his client had lost 8kg since he began his hunger strike and was at risk of kidney failure. Prison officials have said they will begin force-feeding Sentsov if his health deteriorates to a critical point. Sentsov was jailed for 20 years by a Russian military court in 2015 on charges of terrorism. He was accused of deliberately setting fire to the offices of United Russia, a pro-Kremlin political party, in Crimea. He denied all charges and said he was being punished for organising peaceful resistance to the Russian takeover of the peninsula in 2014. His trial was littered with irregularities, including the prosecutors dismissing bruises on Sentsov’s body as the result of sado-masochistic sex rather than torture during interrogation. One prosecution witness recanted his testimony, saying it had been extracted under torture. Amnesty International said at the time the proceedings were “redolent of Stalinist-era show trials”. During his trial, Sentsov said he would not beg for sentencing from a “court of occupiers”, and said he was not ready to give up his pro-Ukraine stance, even under torture. “I don’t know what your beliefs can possibly be worth if you are not ready to suffer or die for them,” he said at the time. Now he appears to be ready to follow through on these words. “Things could deteriorate at any moment but people say the 30th day is when it gets really dangerous,” said Dinze. “He said he’s completely determined to carry it through to the end.” Sentsov is being held in a prison meant for particularly dangerous criminals nicknamed “the Polar Bear”, in the isolated Arctic town of Labytnangi, thousands of miles from his home in Crimea. Previously, he was held even further away, in the north-eastern region of Yakutia. “I think his case was needed for propaganda purposes and to show people in Crimea what the result of opposition to annexation would be,” said Kaplan. “Now, he is being punished. He called Putin a ‘bloodthirsty dwarf’ in court and I think he is being punished for that.” Dinze said that during his interrogations, officers from the security agency FSB told Sentsov that if he did not confess he would be sent to a particularly harsh Arctic prison, and “they’re doing what they promised – he is there as a special punishment”. Ukrainian authorities are believed to have suggested various swap deals for Ukrainian prisoners in Russia, and it has also been floated that Sentsov could be swapped for the journalist Kirill Vyshinsky, who worked for Russian agency RIA Novosti in Ukraine and was arrested last month at his office on charges of treason. Leading international film directors, as well as rights organisations and politicians including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, have sent letters calling on Putin to release Sentsov or raised his case in meetings with the Russian president. Putin appeared to pour cold water on any suggestion of a swap during a televised phone-in session on Thursday. Sentsov was detained not for journalistic activities, but for plotting a terrorist act, preparing an explosion, which could have injured people. These are completely different things we’re talking about. They are different and incomparable,” said Putin. “The Ukrainians have offered various scenarios for his release, the question is whether Russia is ready. The president can pardon him at any time, but Putin’s words don’t leave much hope,” said Dinze. On Saturday, Putin spoke by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart, Petro Poroshenko, raising hopes that a last-minute deal could still be done before the World Cup.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/10/oleg-sentsov-family-ask-putin-to-free-him-before-world-cup,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/10/oleg-sentsov-family-ask-putin-to-free-him-before-world-cup
2018-06-10T12:43:17Z,world,World news,Six face jail after illegal occupation of Spanish village of Fraguas,"Six members of a collective that resettled an abandoned Spanish village are facing prison after being found guilty of illegal occupation. The tiny village of Fraguas, which sits in the hills of northern Castilla-La Mancha, was emptied in the late 1960s as part of a reforestation programme and was later used as a training area for the Spanish army. A group of young settlers arrived in 2013 and began bringing the village back to life with the blessing of its former inhabitants. Over the past five years, they have rebuilt houses, planted vegetables and worked to restore the overgrown village cemetery.
Their activities have been opposed by the regional government, which points out that Fraguas lies in public woodland within the Sierra Norte natural park and argues that their presence is a fire hazard. Castilla-La Mancha’s high court ruled on Friday that the collective had unlawfully occupied the site and sentenced six of its members to 18 months’ imprisonment. They were also fined €2,700 (£2,370) each and ordered to reimburse the regional government for the cost of demolishing the newly restored areas of Fraguas. Although the sentences could be served on probation as they are under the two-year threshold, the court said failure to pay the fines would result in a three-year sentence.
Jaime Merino, a spokesman for the collective, described the sentences as devastating and said an appeal would be launched. “We had thought we might be acquitted. We thought the trial had gone well,” he said. “There were lots of other ways [the regional government] could have done this. They didn’t have to take it to court. There could have been negotiations instead, but they went down the criminal route, which is the toughest one available.” Despite the intervention of local environmentalists, who have been acting as negotiators – and a petition with more than 77,000 signatures in support of the project – the collective now believes prison is inevitable. Merino said the six did not have the money to pay the fines. “Anyway, it’s not just the fines we have to pay, it’s the cost of the demolition, which will be decided by the regional government,” he said. “If we don’t have the money for the fines and the demolition, they’ll translate the fines into prison time, which will increase the sentence and we’ll end up in jail.“We’re pretty freaked out but we haven’t lost hope. We haven’t decided to chuck it all in and head back to the city again. No way. We’re going to fight this all the way to the end. We’re convinced that we’re doing something good, not just for us but also for the former inhabitants, who’ve been supporting us.” The satirical Spanish magazine El Jueves tweeted its support for the collective. “These squatters shouldn’t be sentenced, they should be given an award. Pardon them and put them in charge of a rural repopulation ministry - now.,” it wrote.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/10/spanish-abandoned-village-fraguas-occupation-six-face-jail,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/10/spanish-abandoned-village-fraguas-occupation-six-face-jail
2018-06-10T09:00:47Z,world,World news,Denmark swings right on immigration – and Muslims feel besieged,"“It’s a lovely place,” says Jens Kramer, as he gazes across the harbour from his seat outside the wooden shed that serves as Holbæk’s boat club. “But I think people here are becoming more and more hostile to foreigners and I’m not proud of it. It’s not the Holbæk I love.” Kramer is not alone in thinking that the tone of Denmark’s immigration debate has changed. In recent years, the rise of the rightwing anti-migrant Danish People’s party has led to previously radical positions becoming mainstream. And the country’s Muslim population in particular feels under siege. Earlier this month Danish MPs passed a law that, in effect, bans the burqa. It imposes a penalty of 10,000 kroner (£1,200) for repeat offenders. In another move greeted with dismay by Denmark’s Muslims, a citizen’s proposal to ban the circumcision of children got the 50,000 signatures it needed to go to a parliamentary vote. In Holbæk, an attractive small town in Zealand, the latest legislation has had a mixed reception. Kramer’s companion Hanne Madsen says: “On the burqa ban there were people who said, ‘if they make it law, then I’m going to leave’, and I said ‘OK, then leave.’” She adds: “Jens and me, we are those who say: ‘If you have a problem come to me, but if you don’t want to take off your burqa or try to learn Danish…’” She throws up her hands in exasperation. The ban was backed not only by both the ruling centre-right Liberal party but also by the centre-left Social Democrats, whose rhetoric on Islam has started to rival that of the populist right in the last two years. The Social Democrats’ leader, Mette Frederiksen, has called Islam a barrier to integration, said some Muslims “do not respect the Danish judicial system”, that some Muslim women refuse to work for religious reasons, and that Muslim girls are subject to “massive social control”. She has also called for all Muslim schools in the country to be closed. Emrah Tuncer, a local politician for the pro-immigration Social Liberal party, worries about where the two main parties’ rhetorical race to the bottom will lead. “They are almost fighting about who has the most extreme ideas,” he said. “With the burqa ban we’re talking about 40 people who are wearing it. Our government is making laws for just 40 people! And these 40 women will now be trapped in their homes from morning to evening. Does it help them? It does not.”
The day before we met, Tuncer’s party formally ended its 25-year electoral partnership with the Social Democrats over the party’s rightward turn on Islam and immigration. “I think it’s very ugly that the Social Democrats have become so extreme,” he says. “They’re worse than the [far-right] Danish People’s party.” But he concedes that the party’s shift over the past two years has come in response to a change in public opinion. “They’ve smelt votes on this one,” he says. “It’s moved in Holbæk, like in the whole of Denmark, from: ‘Let’s help people even if they’re Muslims or immigrants’, to: ‘We have to take care of Danish people first.’” Tuncer attributes the shift in mood to the rise of the Islamic State terror group and the refugee crisis. “It’s because of terror: 150 Danish citizens went to Syria to fight with Isis,” he said. “And of course the refugees cost a lot of money at the same time as, in Holbæk, they didn’t didn’t have money to buy paper for schools, or markers to write on the whiteboards.” Stig Hjarvard, a professor of media at the University of Copenhagen who last year co-wrote a paper on Scandinavian attitudes to Islam, believes the antagonism goes further back. According to Hjarvard, it began with Danish troops’ involvement in the Nato-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, grew with the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and was further fuelled by the reaction to publication of cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in the Jyllands-Posten newspaper in 2005. He also thinks that the kingmaker position that the populist Danish People’s party has enjoyed in politics recently is important. “That has of course meant that their policies in terms of immigration have spilled into the agenda of the other parties: not only the Liberal party, but also the Social Democrats. That has consistently put immigration on the agenda. It’s immigration in general and it’s Muslim immigration in particular.” Outside Tuncer’s cafe, a couple of women in Islamic headscarves are browsing in the shops, but Holbæk is more ethnically homogenous than Denmark’s major cities. Tuncer’s brother Hikmet, who is chairman of the local mosque, says he’s not aware of anyone who wears the burqa or niqab. “I think here, it’s a bit more white and Danish,” says Dennis Petersen, who is in the harbour working on his traditional galeas schooner. “In Holbæk, it seems like we have this ghetto. They’re locked in. You don’t see them.” Madsen refers disparagingly to Agervang, a housing estate just outside the centre. “We have this ghetto where people are talking: ‘Bap, bap bap,’” she says, miming people babbling in a foreign language with her hands. Mina, 30, has lived in Agervang all her life after her parents came to Denmark from Turkey as children. “I think it’s so sad they call it a ghetto,” she says. “Do you know how many lawyers, doctors and engineers have come out of these blocks? I see so many people studying, trying to become part of this country, but suddenly we’re not good enough just because we don’t eat pork.”
When she went to school, she says, teachers and other pupils were sensitive to the fact that she was a Muslim without it being a big deal. “But I went to a kindergarten for my son, and the first thing they said is: ‘Are you a Muslim?’ The very first thing! I’m a human being.” She is particularly incensed by the recent call from Inger Støjberg, Denmark’s hardline immigration minister, for all Muslims to take holidays during this month’s Ramadan fast “to avoid negative consequences for the rest of Danish society”. “I don’t know what this lady is doing,” Mina says. “I can’t take a vacation just because I’m fasting. It’s so ridiculous.” Istahil Hussein, 36, says the change in Danish opinion so disturbing that she is thinking of returning to Somalia, the country she left 18 years ago. “You listen every day [about] Muslims doing this, Muslims doing that. It’s not good,” she says. “I think about what’s coming in the future, because Denmark 10 years ago, was not talking about Muslims. If Somalia is good I will go home. I will go back like this,” she laughs, and snaps her fingers. Each month, Holbæk council holds a meeting of its advisory committee on integration. Tuncer is a member, as is Derya Tamer, a Social Democrat councillor with a Turkish background. Tuncer thinks both the Social Democrat and Liberal groups on the town council are split on immigration. And he does not think that Christina Krzyrosiak Hansen, the town’s Social Democrat mayor (and at 25, Denmark’s youngest) backs her party’s hardline stance. “I believe she doesn’t think this position is the right one, but she can’t do much about it,” he says. He says he has challenged Tamer on Facebook to respond to her party’s hardline position on Islam, but without any success. “I don’t understand Muslim Social Democrats. Everybody is silent. We don’t hear them,” he says. “When they joined the party, [it] didn’t say this about Muslims, so how can they just sit there and applaud?” He wonders when or if a breaking point will come. “Now the Danish People’s party are saying that all schools and kindergartens should have to serve pork once a week,” he says. “That’s not only not liberal, it’s crazy.” This article was amended on 12 June 2018 to correct the attribution of the quote beginning “On the burqa ban”, previously attributed to Kramer.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/10/denmark-swings-right-immigration-muslims-besieged-holbaek,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/10/denmark-swings-right-immigration-muslims-besieged-holbaek
2018-06-10T07:00:47Z,world,World news,Stab victim Khadija Siddiqi: ‘My case is a fight for all Pakistani women’,"A student who was stabbed 23 times in daylight in one of Pakistan’s busiest streets has accused the country’s justice system of misogyny after her attacker, having been found guilty of attempted murder, was sensationally acquitted last week. Khadija Siddiqi was ambushed as she collected her six-year-old sister from school two years ago. She was repeatedly slashed across the throat and abdomen by fellow student Shah Hussain in an attack she said was motivated by revenge after she had spurned his advances. She escaped with her life only after her driver managed to drag Hussain off her. Her attacker was sentenced to seven years in prison – the minimum for attempted murder. But in an extraordinary turn, last week he was acquitted by the high court following claims by his lawyers that it had been Siddiqi who had pursued him, based on a letter she had written when she was 17, and that she had wanted the case to become “high profile”. In a country where there are estimated to be more than 1,000 so-called “honour killings” a year, her case has become a cause celebre, with the acquittal viewed by some as effectively sanctioning violence against women. Siddiqi’s lawyer, Hassaan Niazi, said it was “the worst form of victim blaming”. Speaking to the Observer, Siddiqi said women were being undermined by a patriarchal system that deters them from reporting crimes such as rape and “honour” violence because “of the stigma against women in the justice system, in which the onus is on the woman to prove she is the victim”. She added: “My struggle is a test case for all women who come into the court system. We are the targets of character assassination, and when it comes to motive, the onus is on the woman to prove her innocence instead of the criminal’s guilt. “When the court asked me what [Hussain’s] motive was, they tried to prove I was a woman of loose character, that I am immoral and don’t have values. The defence said in court that I was having illicit relationships with other boys, which was a lie. Their entire defence was based on discrediting my character.” Siddiqi, who is from a cosmopolitan, but religious and culturally conservative, family, struck up a friendship with Hussain, the son of a well-connected lawyer, at college. The pair became close, but she ended the relationship after becoming concerned by his obsessive and controlling behaviour, and his hacking of her Facebook account. “When a guy crosses all limits and he says ‘you are like my property’, that’s what made me leave him and that should be enough. It doesn’t matter what happens, even if I had married him, nothing gives him the right to attack a woman like that.” What followed was a campaign of harassment and blackmail, culminating in the attack in Lahore’s main shopping street, which left her fighting for her life. The case caused uproar, with celebrities and politicians expressing dismay. Jamshed Kazi, the country’s UN Women representative, said: “Khadija’s relentless pursuit of justice is an extraordinary example of courage that highlights the multiple barriers women face to access justice including stigma and gender bias.” Such has been the outcry that, following the acquittal, Pakistan’s supreme court took the extraordinary step of issuing a suo motu – where a court is able to start proceedings without a formal complaint – to re-examine the case. The process will start on Sunday. “The supreme court’s decision is a very positive step, not just for me, but for all women. It has revived people’s trust in the court system and shows the power of the people, of our youth and of social media who made their voices heard and the supreme court has listened,” she said. Siddiqi said she hoped her case would inspire other women to fight for justice, and lead to legal reforms to ensure women are treated fairly. “I’ve had so many messages saying ‘this happened to me’, and it gives people strength. There is a stigma for women to get justice, not just in Pakistan but across the world. This shows if you hurt or kill in the name of honour, you will be challenged. As a law student, I owe it to these women to show the justice system isn’t just for the rich and powerful. “Thousands of women are killed across the world. I was one of the rare few who survived, so I have been given the chance to be an example for all women.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/10/khadija-siddiqi-case-fight-all-pakistani-women-courts-stab-victim,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/10/khadija-siddiqi-case-fight-all-pakistani-women-courts-stab-victim
2018-06-10T03:08:46Z,world,World news,Trump's trade tirade casts Canada in unfamiliar role of America's bad guy,"Shortly after he landed on Canadian soil for the first time as president, Donald Trump was warmly greeted by Justin Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau. The trio lingered on the podium, chatting comfortably as they posed for photos at the start of the G7 summit in Quebec. There was little hint of the acrimony that had filled Trump’s Twitter feed hours earlier as he had raged at Canada and its prime minister, laying bare escalating trade tensions that have seemingly pushed US-Canada relations to their lowest point in recent memory.
Since taking office, Trump has routinely disparaged Canada’s trade policies, calling them a “disgrace” and “unfair”. As he prepared to visit Canada this week, however, the US president took it up a notch, personally attacking Trudeau. “Prime Minister Trudeau is being so indignant, bringing up the relationship that the U.S. and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things,” Trump tweeted on Thursday. “But he doesn’t bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy – hurting our Farmers, killing our Agriculture!” Trump escalated his attacks at the end of the G7 summit on Saturday when he blamed Trudeau for the US pulling out of the official communique, calling the Canadian PM “weak and dishonest”. The tweet was part of tumultuous 24 hours or so in which Trump mused about terminating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), the pact that underpins roughly 2.5m Canadian jobs and the three-quarters of Canadian exports that go to the US, and railed at Canada’s use of import tariffs and production controls to protect its dairy sector.
After an election campaign in which Trump had focused his antipathy on Mexico – vowing to build a billion-dollar wall, crack down on immigration and impose a steep border tax – many Canadians had not expected to find their country in the US president’s crosshairs. Trump’s increased targeting of Canada appeared to begin earlier this year when he sought to portray it as a country of suave swindlers, said Christopher Sands, director of the Center for Canadian Studies at Johns Hopkins University. “We lose a lot with Canada. People don’t know it. Canada is very smooth,” Trump told a gathering of state governors in February. “They have you believe that it’s wonderful. And it is. For them – not wonderful for us … So we have to start showing that we know what we’re doing.” The comments hinted at the fact that Canada’s strategy of crisscrossing the US to reinforce to senators and governors how Americans benefit from their relationship with Canada was having an impact, said Sands. “That kind of annoyed Trump,” he said. “I don’t think he loves Trudeau but I think that early on they had a good rapport. Now he finds that Trudeau is undermining him in his own turf.”
Trade tensions escalated after the US announced an end to Canada’s exemption on steel and aluminum tariffs, one week after a reportedly testy phone call between the two leaders, in which Trump referenced the 1814 burning down of the White House by British troops to justify levying the tariffs against Canada on national security grounds. Canada countered with retaliatory measures on C$16.6bn ($12.8bn) worth of goods and a tougher line from Trudeau. After more than a year of carefully avoiding any criticism of the US president, Trudeau slammed the president’s decision. “We have to believe that at some point their common sense will prevail,” he told reporters. “But we see no sign of that in this action today by the US administration.” He also stopped by American television to make it clear that Canada found the tariffs “insulting”. But the TV appearance further stoked the president’s ire, said Sands. “I don’t think he’s become public enemy number one by any stretch, but he has sort of annoyed Trump.” The result is the kind of sparks that have probably existed between US and Canadian leaders throughout history, but which are rarely aired in public, said Sands. “Nixon famously called Justin Trudeau’s father an asshole and Trudeau zinged back – but it was all behind the scenes and it came out years later.” Others contextualised the rhetoric by pointing to the scramble to renegotiate Nafta. “It is all posturing within the context of the Nafta negotiations,” said Dunniela Kaufman, a Canadian trade lawyer based in Washington. “I think Trump thought that he would arrive and the Canadians would play ball, that they would negotiate with him and get to where they needed to get.” But the talks have stalled after the Canadians refuse to budge on two key issues: a sunset clause that would allow any of the signatories to quit the pact after five years and binding dispute mechanisms. Trump had hoped the US metal tariffs would force Canada’s hand. Instead the country shot back with retaliatory measures, she said. “So I think he’s frustrated that Canada didn’t do that.” Officials on both sides of the border have downplayed any notion of a feud brewing between the longstanding allies. “I regard this as much like a family quarrel,” Larry Kudlow, Trump’s chief economic adviser, told reporters this week. “I’m always the optimist, I believe it can be worked out, and I’m always hopeful on that point.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/09/canada-us-trudeau-trump-trade-relationship,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/09/canada-us-trudeau-trump-trade-relationship
2018-06-10T02:26:16Z,world,World news,G7 in disarray after Trump rejects communique and attacks 'weak' Trudeau,"Donald Trump has left the G7 network of global cooperation in disarray after he pulled the US out of a previously agreed summit communique, blaming the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau whom he derided as “dishonest and weak”.
The US president, who arrived at the summit in Canada late and left early to fly to Singapore to prepare for his summit with Kim Jong-un, shocked fellow leaders with a bellicose press conference on Saturday in which he attacked the trade policies of other countries. The US had nevertheless appeared to agree a form of words on contentious issues thanks to an all-night negotiating session by officials from all sides. But after leaving for Singapore, Trump tweeted personal attacks on Trudeau and said that he had told his representatives not to sign the summit communique, turning what had already been a tense meeting of the world’s leading industrialised democracies into a fiasco. “PM Justin Trudeau acted so meek and mild,” he tweeted. “Only to give a news conference after I left saying that ‘US tariffs were kind of insulting’ and ‘he will not be pushed around’. “Very dishonest and weak” he claimed, adding in a separate tweet: “I have instructed our US reps not to endorse the communique.”
Journalists traveling on Air Force One to Singapore with Trump had been told that the US had decided to be part of the joint communique, which represented a minimal show of unity amid deep disagreements between Trump and the other six leaders over trade. The reporters only discovered when the plane landed on the Greek island of Crete to refuel that the president had changed his mind. Even for a presidency as capricious as Trump’s, his action marked a new blurring of lines between his personal feelings towards other leaders, and US government policy. It was also the latest example of Trump’s use of much harsher language towards fellow democratically-elected leaders of allied countries than to strongmen leaders of enemy and adversary nations. A few minutes before Trump sent out his inflammatory tweets, his hawkish national security security adviser, John Bolton, appeared to anticipate them by sending a tweet of his own, deriding the G7 summit he had just attended. “Just another G7 where other countries expect America will always be their bank. The President made it clear today. No more,” Bolton said. Bolton has been sidelined in talks with the North Koreans, but the last-minute turnaround on the G7 represents a win for his unilateralist approach to US foreign policy. The tweets also represent a blow to the French president Emmanuel Macron and the German chancellor Angela Merkel, who believed they had brokered a deal to smooth over tensions on US-European trade.
The communique said the leaders of the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Japan agreed on the need for “free, fair, and mutually beneficial trade” and the importance of fighting protectionism. “We strive to reduce tariff barriers, non-tariff barriers and subsidies,” the statement said. Like last year, the communique made it clear that the US had a different view on climate change and how to fight it from the other six leaders, increasingly being referred to informally as the G6. Governments tried to shore up the damage late on Saturday with statements backing the form of words they thought had been agreed.
“We are focused on everything we accomplished here at the #G7 summit,” a spokesman for Trudeau tweeted. “The prime minister said nothing he hasn’t said before – both in public, and in private conversations with the president.” A senior UK government source said it stood by the commitments made in the communiqué, while a European Union official at the summit said it would “stick to the commitments made by all participants”. The sensitive trade issue was the subject of Trump’s unscheduled press conference on Saturday morning. After slapping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, the European Union and Mexico last week, Trump threatened at the summit to cut off trade with countries that treated the United States unfairly.
“We’re like the piggy bank that everybody is robbing,” he told reporters. But Trudeau, in the media conference that irked Trump, rejected a US demand for a sunset clause in the North American trade agreement, Nafta, that would allow a member nation to withdraw after five years. “There will not be a sunset clause ... we will not, cannot sign a trade deal that expires automatically every five years,” he said. Trudeau said he had told Trump that the talks had been made more complicated by last week’s imposition of tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, ostensibly for national security reasons. Canada has promised retaliatory measures on 1 July. “I highlighted directly to the president that Canadians did not take it lightly that the United States has moved forward with significant tariffs,” said Trudeau. “Canadians, we’re polite, we’re reasonable, but we will also not be pushed around.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/10/g7-in-disarray-after-trump-rejects-communique-and-attacks-weak-trudeau,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/10/g7-in-disarray-after-trump-rejects-communique-and-attacks-weak-trudeau
2018-06-09T23:05:55Z,world,World news,Theresa May reiterates strong relationship with US despite slights,"Despite repeatedly embarrassing the British prime minister at a politically bruising G7 summit in Quebec, Donald Trump’s controversial visit to the UK next month would still appear to be on.Theresa May insisted that she had exchanged warm greetings with the US president and he had said how much he was “looking forward” to his visit.
“We have a very good relationship with President Trump,” she said, after she had been challenged on his reported remarks that she was schoolmistressy and politically correct. “We work closely with President Trump, and the UK has a very good relationship with the United States,” she said, defending his decision to leave early in order to prepare for his summit with Kim Jong-un. “He’s going to Singapore to sit down and discuss the denuclearisation of North Korea ... that is in the interests of all of us across the world.” May said that the fact that the G7 had managed to reach an 11th-hour agreement on all the main topics under consideration, including not readmitting Russia and a form of words on trade, was a victory for international cooperation. “We had some difficult conversations and some strong debate,” she said at the end of two days’ of impassioned argument vividly captured in an image of six of the G7 leaders confronting an isolated Trump. The US president had sat defiantly in front of them as they argued over the final communique at an impromptu session over the breakfast table on Saturday morning. But her anger at the presidential slights, which included omitting her from a list of G7 leaders he had a strong relationship with, was evident when she issued a clear reprimand about his attitude to global cooperation. “It does not mean taking unilateral action against your partners”, she said. “Where we disagree ... you air the action openly and frankly. We have done just that.” On Friday night, it looked as if it would be impossible to reach an agreed text, with the US blocking agreement on trade and on one of the summit’s main objectives, reaching agreement on tackling ocean plastics. But after an all-night session by the sherpas – the personal representative of each of the heads of state or governments – a communique acknowledging that globalisation left some people behind, and allowing both the US and Japan to negotiate a separate plan to tackle ocean plastics, was agreed in time for the final session. However, Trump’s own closing press conference a few hours later revealed how far apart the two sides were.
Like the other EU leaders, May was looking for some sign that the US president might reconsider his tariffs on steel and aluminium. And she hoped for public buy-in to her ambitious project for a rapid response unit to tackle hostile state activity. Instead he arrived at the summit late and left early, after demanding again that Russia be readmitted to the forum, leaving after a verbal rampage through the wreckage of the rules based world order at a closing news conference. “It’s not a question of, ‘I hope it will change’”, he warned his fellow G7 members on trade relations. “It’s going to change, 100%. Tariffs are going to come way down because people cannot continue to do that. We’re like the piggy bank that everybody’s robbing. And that ends.” He angrily warned the EU – set to bring in £2.5bn worth of tariffs against the US at the beginning of July – against further tit-for-tat tariffs, telling them there would only be one winner.
“There’s very bad spirit when we have a big trade imbalance and they keep raising it so we never catch up,” he said. “That’s not a good thing to do. And we have very, very strong measures that take care of that ... the numbers are so astronomically against them ... we win that war a thousand times out of a thousand.” Trump also failed to namecheck May when referencing G7 leaders as he ran through events of the past two days. “I’d say the level of relationship is a 10. We have a great relationship. Angela [Merkel], and Emmanuel [Macron] and Justin [Trudeau] ... I would say the relationship is a 10.” May’s officials have been arguing that despite the pre-summit reports of Trump struggling with her “schoolmistressy” style and her “political correctness”, he always listened to her carefully. May now flies back to face a week that includes what will almost certainly be a tense meeting of Conservatives backbenchers and two days of debates and votes on the EU withdrawal bill, which will be a defining moment in the UK’s passage out of the EU. She warned rebels on the bill not to risk frustrating its passage. “It is an important and key building block in the process of leaving the European Union and I would hope that everybody across the House of Commons will see the importance of ensuring that that bill is not frustrated,” she said. “At its core, it’s about delivering to the British public on their vote to leave the EU.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/10/theresa-may-donald-trump-relationship-despite-slights,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/10/theresa-may-donald-trump-relationship-despite-slights
2018-06-09T23:05:35Z,world,World news,The 1975 back new centre for London’s LGBTQ+ community,"The international chart-topping Manchester band The 1975 have helped finance a new LGBTQ+ community centre for London, making a significant donation that has allowed the project to secure its fundraising target. Matthew Healy, the band’s frontman, told the Observer: “You might wonder why it is needed, and even ask yourself what exactly is everyone still scared of, but sadly, I think stigma still exists even in London and we still have some way to go.” Healy, 29, added that he was surprised to find the capital city did not have a place for LGBTQ+ people to meet and support one another. New York, Berlin, Los Angeles and Manchester already have such venues – and London did once. A Gay and Lesbian Centre in Farringdon was shut down in the early 1990s, because of a lack of funding and management disagreements about its core purpose. But now a team of volunteers, including the activist and journalist Michael Segalov, are attempting to set up a new and more welcoming place for London’s large LGBTQ+ community that could have a more stable future. Segalov, too, had assumed that Londoners in need of friendship, or a safe space to escape from prejudice, already had somewhere to go. The fundraising campaign won support from Hackney Council, the borough that will host the planned centre, and then from the London mayor’s office. Money-raising events, ranging from club nights to community picnics, got the project off the ground, but it was Healy and his band’s 11th-hour response to the project’s appeal to raise £50,000 that has now enabled the creation of the centre. “When a friend of mine sent me the link, I was quite surprised that such a good idea had not yet raised enough to get over the threshold,” said Healy, the son of actors Tim Healy and Denise Welch. “I am a bit wary of talking about it because I don’t want to appear to be virtue-signalling, but me and the others in the band all felt it was obviously a good thing to put our money towards.”
The musicians, who formed a group in 2002 while at school in Wilmslow and won the Brit award last year for best British band, are currently in the studio working on a third album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships. In 2013, their debut album went to the top of the UK album chart. In 2016, their second album topped both the UK chart and the US Billboard 200. Yesterday, Healy said a large section of the 1975’s fanbase comes from the LGBTQ+ community so the decision to fund the centre had seemed a natural choice. “Aside from believing in the idea, a more superficial reason is that one of our songs, Loving Someone, has become a bit of an anthem for some people in that community,” he said. The new venue will host a wide variety of entertainment and group activities, from drag shows to Christmas dinners for the lonely. Key to its purpose will be welcoming older members, who are sometimes left out, and holding events that do not revolve around alcohol. The centre plans to run a cafe employing LGBTQ+ people, as well as an information and research hub. Three full-time official posts will run the operation, with new personnel selected each year. “The fundamental aim is setting up the centre,” explains Segalov, adding the team has now set the online fundraising target to £100,000. “But it’s also about bringing together a community that can be disparate. We’re trying to bridge those gaps.” More than half of London’s established bars, clubs and pubs set up for the LGBTQ+ community have closed in the last decade, many of them victims of rising business rates and rents. At the same time, concerns about public safety among this community have grown. A recent YouGov national survey of 5,000 people suggested that in the last five years, verbal or physical attacks on LGBTQ+ people have increased by almost 80%. Research conducted by the Albert Kennedy Trust also found that 24% of homeless young people identify as LGBTQ+.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/09/the-1975-funding-for-lgbqt-centre-in-hackney-london,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/09/the-1975-funding-for-lgbqt-centre-in-hackney-london
2018-06-09T17:15:18Z,world,World news,Donald Trump at G7: 'US is not a piggy bank to be robbed',"In an unscheduled press conference hours before the G7 summit was due to end, Donald Trump accused the rest of the world of treating the US like a piggy bank to be robbed, appeared to snub Theresa May and called for tariff-free trade with the G7 countries. In a bravado performance, he also described Russia’s annexation of Crimea as “something that happened a while ago”, warned in the bluntest of terms against economic retaliation for the US’s introduction of tariffs, and described the way the EU treated the US as brutal.
Referring to his longstanding complaint about trade and his decision to impose unilateral tariff barriers on metals, he denied the move was contentious, but admitted that he had used strong language to emphasise that the current position could not continue. “It’s not a question of ‘I hope it will change’”, he said. “It’s going to change, 100%. Tariffs are going to come way down because people cannot continue to do that. We’re like the piggy bank that everybody’s robbing. And that ends. “If they retaliate, they’re making a mistake because you see we have a tremendous trade imbalance ... There’s very bad spirit when we have a big trade imbalance and they keep raising it so we never catch up. That’s not a good thing to do. And we have very, very strong measures that take care of that ... the numbers are so astronomically against them ... we win that war a thousand times out of a thousand.” In an omission that underlines the cooling relationship with the UK, he conspicuously failed to namecheck the British prime minister while referencing other G7 leaders as he ran through events of the past two days. “I’d say the level of relationship is a 10. We have a great relationship. Angela [Merkel], and Emmanuel [Macron] and Justin [Trudeau] ... I would say the relationship is a 10.” May’s officials have been arguing that despite the pre-summit reports of Trump struggling with ther “schoolmistressy” style and her “political correctness”, he always listened to her carefully. The US president, however, bluntly dismissed her complaint that it was wrong to talk of a trade imbalance as a question of national security. “It is national security, it’s our balance sheet, it’s our strength, it’s absolutely national security,” he said. “We have to have deals that are fair, and we have to have deals that are economic otherwise that does affect our military ... to have a great military you need a great balance sheet.” With only hours to go before the summit wraps up, the prospect of a final communique agreed by all seven nations now hangs in the balance. Although there has been disagreement before, this has been the most openly tumultuous G7 meeting in the grouping’s 43-year history. It is feared that failure could ultimately threaten the future of the whole post-second world war system of international rules governing trade. A British official said on Saturday: “Sherpas had a long night working on possible texts. There is a feeling a chair’s statement is the most likely outcome, but talks are ongoing.” In what was widely seen as another ostentatious display of contempt for the process of international cooperation, Trump began the day by failing to show up for the start of the Saturday morning working session on gender equality. The summit president, Justin Trudeau, had finished before he arrived. Canada’s ambassador to France, Isabelle Hudon – the co–chair of the session – was making her contribution when he finally walked in. The official pool photography session, when the world’s media are allowed in to take the day’s first pictures, was taking place and security personnel had to open a path for the president through a crowd of journalists. As Hudon continued to talk about the need for gender equality to be included in every policy decision, Trump walked slowly to his seat while the whole room watched. His entrance is part of a pattern. He has demanded that Russia, suspended since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, be readmitted – a demand he reiterated in his press conference although it clearly undermines May’s initiative due to be signed off later on a rapid response unit to combat actions of hostile states. Before he had even left Washington, he was deep into a Twitter war with Trudeau over trade. In an indication of how concerned other G7 members are about the impact of Trump’s decision, and the threat of escalation, on Friday, May and other leaders emphasised the US’s leading role in setting up the international system. Closing communiques are usually written before the meeting begins. This time it was “hanging in the balance” as leaders flew in to the remote Quebec resort of La Malbaie on Thursday night. The meeting of leaders of the west’s biggest economies is a regular occurrence. There have been three since Trump took office, although his dislike of international rules and collective action has made each of them knife-edge affairs. At last year’s G7, in Sicily, the trade row and Trump’s determination to withdraw the US from the Paris climate change agreement – President Obama’s biggest legacy – led to a tense summit and a final agreement that “took note” of US dissent.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/09/donald-trump-at-g7-us-is-not-a-piggy-bank-to-be-robbed,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/09/donald-trump-at-g7-us-is-not-a-piggy-bank-to-be-robbed
2018-06-09T14:40:31Z,world,World news,Clara Ponsatí accuses Spain of illegal vendetta against Catalan nationalists,"Clara Ponsatí, the Catalan academic facing extradition to Spain, has accused the Spanish judiciary of pursuing an illegal vendetta against Catalan nationalists. Ponsatí told a fringe meeting at the Scottish National party’s spring conference that last October’s referendum on Catalan independence was entirely legal, even if it had not been supported by the government in Madrid. “It was the duty of the Catalan authorities, who had a mandate for the referendum, to organise a referendum. We were obliged to do it. Besides it was not illegal. We have done nothing illegal,” she said.
“The Spanish authorities have manipulated the judiciary, have manipulated the reading of the law, have manipulated the facts and they’ve opened these charges which are totally, totally illegal themselves. What is illegal is what the judiciary is doing in Spain now. That is illegal.” Ponsatí, an economics professor at St Andrews University in Scotland, faces a four-week extradition hearing later this summer after the Spanish authorities issued a European arrest warrant. The Spanish courts accuse her of violent rebellion and of misuse of public funds in organising the referendum. The staging of the vote divided Catalonia, and Madrid insists it was illegal and unconstitutional because it was not authorised as required by Spain’s parliament. Ponsatí’s lawyer, Aamer Anwar, says there is “not a scrap of evidence” to support the charges against her, which carry maximum sentences of 25 years and eight years in prison respectively. Other Catalan leaders, including the then president Carlos Puidgemont, face a similar extradition case in Germany. Anwar told the meeting that violent attacks by Spanish civil guards on voters at some polling stations on 1 October carried “shades of Franco”, and were reminiscent of the suppression of human rights during the regime of the fascist dictator who ruled from 1939 to 1975. SNP activists and some Scottish MPs have rallied to Ponsatí’s cause. Her legal defence fund has reached £270,000, but Anwar has told her supporters she needs £500,000 to cover all her expected legal costs given the complexity of the case. Joanna Cherry, an SNP MP and QC, told the meeting that nine political and civic leaders who backed the referendum in October remained in prison, with 19 people due on trial in Madrid in August. She and Anwar said the Ponsatí and Puidgemont extradition cases had increased concerns that some EU member states were abusing the European arrest warrant system to pursue political opponents rather than criminals. The cases also raised concerns about judicial independence, they said. St Andrews University has officially backed Ponsatí, suggesting the extradition attempt against her is politically motivated. The Courier newspaper, based in Dundee, has reported that 10 or more academics at St Andrews including Spanish staff are unhappy it has done so and asked for its statement to be retracted. Much rests on whether the newly appointed Socialist-led government in Madrid, which came to power in part as a result of a deal with Catalan parties, starts talks with the Catalan authorities in Barcelona and agrees a political solution to the crisis.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/09/carla-ponsati-accuses-spain-of-vendetta-against-catalan-nationalists,https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/09/carla-ponsati-accuses-spain-of-vendetta-against-catalan-nationalists
2018-06-09T11:00:20Z,world,World news,Why Canadian milk infuriates Donald Trump,"In the midst of what appears to be a full-blown trade war between Canada and the US over steel and aluminum, and with Donald Trump taking his first steps on Canadian soil for the G7 summit, a familiar bugbear reappeared to haunt the negotiations.
Whatever understanding Canada and the US may (or may not) have come to on their high-value trade in lumber or auto parts, they remain implacably opposed on the comparatively minor matter of milk.
Trump has attacked Canada’s protected dairy industry before, calling it a “disgrace” and blaming it for widespread hardship among US farmers. Although the entire trade in dairy products between the two countries is worth less than US$600m, ideological division has sharpened the ongoing dispute. His negotiators have demanded the dismantlement of Canada’s openly dirigiste system of supply management in agriculture – a complicated nexus of production quotas and import tariffs designed to ensure Canadian dairy, egg and poultry farmers receive fair prices for their products.
But the Canadians are no less determined to retain one of the last vestiges of their otherwise-abandoned collectivist traditions. Canadian cows are sacred, and the farmers who care for them enjoy outsized influence in national politics. Expert observers have said that Justin Trudeau’s government would abandon the treaty altogether before sacrificing supply management. “It’s just too sensitive for the Canadians,” Kevin Carmichael, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, recently told CNBC news. Even so, the Trudeau government recently alarmed Canadian farmers by signalling a willingness to give on the issue in the face of insistent US demands. The dispute has acquired new urgency as the US dairy industry continues to suffer from a deep crisis of persistent overproduction, with farmers sinking into insolvency as farm-gate milk prices stick stubbornly below the cost of production. Last year, US farmers dumped almost 100m gallons of surplus milk. Recently, a surge in dairy-farmer suicides has caused national alarm, drawing attention to what the New York Times called “the widespread hopelessness afflicting the industry”. Representing a state suffering especially hard from farm failures and suicides, the US Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, recently echoed his Republican president in blaming Canada for the debacle. “Canada, when it comes to dairy, acts like China when it comes to trade,” Schumer told hard-pressed farmers in upstate New York. “They’re unfair. They put up barriers. They treat us bad.”
Meanwhile, just across the St Lawrence river in what free-trading Americans like to call Soviet Canuckistan, the dairy industry is thriving like never before – and like none other in the developed world. Family farms milking an average of 80 cows each have prospered under a heavily regulated system that supports prices at sustainable levels by restricting domestic overproduction and keeping imports at bay. In 2016, Canadian farmers received an average price of C$0.79 a litre for milk, compared with C$0.49 on average for US farmers. The result is that dairying remains a key economic support of traditional rural life throughout central Canada. As critics of the system like to point out, hoping to inspire resentment among consumers annoyed by the price of milk, Canadian dairy farmers enjoy incomes 60% above average in the country. But to supporters, the uniquely prosperous, protected Canadian dairy industry stands as a model alternative to the increasingly disruptive and unpopular dynamic of unrestricted free trade in all things. Supply management enjoys strong government support in no small part because the policy obviates the need to subsidize farmers directly in the manner of the US and the EU – the two greatest culprits behind the current world dairy glut. “The system works so incredibly well,” said Bruce Muirhead, associate vice-president and professor of history at the University of Waterloo. “And the big thing about supply management is that it doesn’t cost the government a cent. Consumers pay the full cost of production.” Domestic critics have called supply management a grotesque distortion of free-market principles, complaining that the comparatively high price of Canadian milk sacrifices the interests of consumers in favour of producers and victimizes the poor. But no consumer or social policy group has taken up the cause, and all six parties currently represented in the House of Commons unanimously support supply management. As do Canadian consumers: an Ipsos poll this year by the Dairy Farmers of Canada reported that 75% of Canadians support even greater government efforts to defend the industry in the face of current US demands. As the trade minister, Chrystia Freeland, has pointed out, trade data flatly contradicts the claim that Canadian supply management is ravaging US dairyland – either because it unfairly restricts imports or because it dumps a subsidized surplus in US markets. In 2016, Canada imported dairy products from the US worth five times more than the small amount it exported there. “I would call that a pretty good deal,” she told the House of Commons. Canadian farmers point out that despite the tariffs that protect them, imports make up 10% of the country’s dairy consumption. By contrast, the US restricts dairy imports to 3% of domestic consumption. “That just screams hypocrisy to me,” Muirhead said. “I don’t understand how they can get away with these positions.” As a recent visitor to Wisconsin, “America’s Dairyland”, where low prices are forcing the closure of hundreds of dairy farms a year, Muirhead said he encountered no resentment against Canada among local farmers. “The president of the Wisconsin Farmers Union told me that what they really wanted was a supply-managed system like ours,” he said. Dairy deregulation has spread hardship wherever it has been implemented, Muirhead added. “Every single objective indicator says that in the case of dairy you cannot have a system that operates without production controls,” he said. “If you try, you’re basically consigning your farmers to a life of penury – or worse.” Canada successfully defended the system in its first free trade agreement with the US, and several subsequent ones. But with the full wrath of Trump now focused squarely on the country’s protected farmers, this stubborn remnant of Canadian exceptionalism has never been more fragile.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2018/jun/09/milk-canada-us-trade-war,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/commentisfree/2018/jun/09/milk-canada-us-trade-war
2018-06-09T09:24:58Z,world,World news,Donald Trump calls for G7 to readmit Russia ahead of summit,"Donald Trump has called for Russia to be readmitted to the G7 club of world leaders, opening up a new rift with US allies who swiftly contradicted him at a contentious summit in Quebec. Although there were smiles and handshakes between Trump and his counterparts from Europe, Canada and Japan, there was no sign by Friday night that they were any closer on the deeply divisive issues of trade, climate change and policy towards Moscow. Trump made his comments on the way to the summit, saying: “Why are we having the meeting without Russia being in the meeting? Russia should be in the meeting, it should be a part of it.” In a Russian television interview due to be aired on Saturday, President Vladimir Putin said that dialogue with Trump could be “constructive”. Trump is “a serious-minded person who knows how to listen to people and respond to their arguments. This leads me to believe that dialogue may prove to be constructive.” The last meeting between Trump and Putin was a brief exchange in Vietnam last November. In meetings on Friday with Emmanuel Macron of France and Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, a jovial Trump claimed to have good personal relations with the leaders, and claimed at his meeting with Trudeau: “We’ve made a lot of progress”. After his session with the French president, Trump said: “The United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union, and we’re working it out. And Emmanuel has been very helpful in that regard. And something is going to happen, and I think it will be very positive.” However, a senior official at the summit in the resort town of La Malbaie said no headway had been made in talks about new tariffs the US has imposed on imports of steel and aluminium – and there were strong doubts that the seven leaders would be able to agree on a joint communique by the end of the two-day meeting. “It was a predictable discussion,” the official said. “Trump recited his figures on trade. The Europeans brought up conflicting figures that showed overall they had lower tariffs than the US. It was very much six against one.” A second official said that European leaders made “an attempt to set the record straight, pointing out that the EU and US have the most expansive trade and investment in the world, and 70% of all foreign direct investment”. At one point, the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, offered to visit the US to bridge the divide between the competing US and EU narratives. Trump did not accept or reject the offer, witnesses said. Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign minister, said the discussions had been “cordial” but it was clear the G7 leaders were far from agreement from a common statement. She said the sherpas, officials negotiating the consensus communique, had only had a few hours’ sleep on Thursday night. “Work on the communique continues,” Freeland said. “We’ll see where we land ... It could be another late night for our hardworking sherpas.” At a working dinner on Friday night, the leaders were due to discuss foreign policy, including Trump’s talks with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, on Tuesday. With discussion of Russian policy on the agenda, Trump’s comments about Russia caused consternation among his G7 partners. The country has been suspended from the summit for four years, for its intervention in eastern Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea. It marked a dramatic break from the position taken by the Canadian hosts, Washington’s main European allies and Trump’s own state department, who all insist Moscow must withdraw from Ukraine before normal relations are resumed. Senior officials lined up to contradict Trump. Theresa May told Sky News: “Let’s remember why the G8 became the G7. And before discussions could begin on any of this, we would have to ensure Russia is amending its ways and taking a different route.” Trump’s remarks on Russia cut across a UK initiative at the summit to create a rapid response unit to combat state-sponsored aggression, such as cyber-attacks and the poisoning of dissidents which have been blamed on Russia. Freeland said Canadian officials had brought up the issue in bilateral meetings. “Canada’s position is absolutely clear, that there are no grounds whatsoever for bringing Russia with its current behaviour back into the G7,” she said. Trump appeared to win support from the newest invitee to the G7 attendee, the incoming Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, who tweeted: “I agree with president [Trump]. Russia should re-enter the G8. It is in the interests of all.” Other European leaders challenged Conte on his statement on Friday morning, and according to officials familiar with that meeting, he insisted that Italy’s policy had not changed, and that he thought Russia should only be readmitted when conditions were right.
Earlier, a Russian government spokesman also appeared wary, with Dmitry Peskov, saying in a brief statement: “Russia is focused on other formats, apart from the G7.” The remarks, at a time when Trump’s election campaign is under investigation for possible links with Moscow – raised eyebrows in Washington. “This is weak,” Ben Sasse, a Republican senator from Nebraska, said in a swiftly issued statement. “Putin is not our friend and he is not the president’s buddy. He is a thug using Soviet-style aggression to wage a shadow war against America, and our leaders should act like it.” Tensions were already high before the two-day summit, after a public dispute about trade between Trump and his French and Canadian counterparts, Macron and Trudeau. At stake is the prospect of the current bout of tit-for-tat tariffs between the major western economies turning into an unrestrained international trade war.
The tone in the immediate run-up to thesummit showed no sign of compromise between a US president determined to disrupt the status quo to force more favourable terms for his country, and six US allies resolved to stop him. Trump is due to leave La Malbaie early on Saturday, missing sessions on climate change and the health of the oceans, to meet Kim Jong-un in Singapore.Trump had sparred with other G7 leaders over trade well into the night before the summit, accusing the EU and Canada of unfair business practices, and then resumed his polemic around 6am US time, complaining about Canadian dairy tariffs. “Looking forward to straightening out unfair trade deals with the G7 countries,” Trump tweeted. “If it doesn’t happen, we come out even better!” Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said the summit would be “far from easy”. “What worries me most is the fact that the rules-based international order is being challenged, quite surprisingly not by the usual suspects, but by its main architect and guarantor, the US,” Tusk said at a press conference in La Malbaie. “We will not stop trying to convince president Trump that undermining this order makes no sense at all, because it will only play into the hands of those who seek a new post-west order, where liberal democracy and fundamental freedoms would cease to exist. This is in the interest of neither the US nor Europe.” May, who sat next to Trump at Friday’s afternoon session, was forthright in her criticism of his decision to introduce tariffs. She described his actions as “deeply regrettable”, and said that to seek to justify a move that would damage the economies of some of the US’s closest allies on the grounds of national security “makes it harder to understand and to explain to our businesses and our electorate”. May also warned that WTO-sanctioned tariffs would become unavoidable unless a way back was found quickly. The EU has submitted restrictions on US goods from denim to Harley Davidson motorbikes due to come in by next month. May made it clear that she did not want the situation to escalate. “If you tax trade through tariffs there is no guarantee that domestic sources will replace it, plus the loss of trade undermines competition it reduces productivity removes the incentive to innovate and makes everyone poorer.” On Thursday, Macron berated Trump for imposing unilateral tariffs rather than going through international arbitration, and for walking out of a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran. “The risk is to create a world of survival of the fittest. That is not good for us nor for any of our friends in the world,” Macron tweeted. “Tensions are mounting everywhere. This G7 is going to be demanding.” • This article was amended on 12 June 2018 to correct a word in a quote from Theresa May.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/08/donald-trump-shows-no-sign-compromise-flies-in-g7-summit,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/08/donald-trump-shows-no-sign-compromise-flies-in-g7-summit
2018-06-09T06:30:15Z,world,World news,"'One way in, one way out': why G7 summits are in such remote locations","Until the leaders of the seven most economically advanced nations in the world descended on it, the Charlevoix region of Quebec was perhaps best known for the beauty of its landscapes and the opulence of its state-run casino in La Malbaie. It is also a remote tourist destination, reached by way of an often perilous one-lane highway, and has a population density lower than the (already sparse) national average.
This is no coincidence. Though it poses certain logistical issues, Charlevoix’s isolation is perhaps its greatest asset when it comes to staging a meeting of these world leaders. In an era where mass protests of such things are a given, Charlevoix offers a key security feature: it is difficult for protesters to get there, harder still to circulate and near impossible to escape the eye of law enforcement. “One way in, one way out,” says Alan Bell, president of the Toronto-based security consulting firm Global Risk International. “If you go back to some recent G7 and G20 meetings, the downtown core always gets trashed. What they want to do is zero in on the protesters. If they want to come, they basically have to walk in.” The practice of holding such huge and consequential meetings in hard-to-reach places is relatively new. The first G6 summit was held in 1975 in the Parisian exurb of Rambouillet. The meeting was a low-key affair that dealt almost exclusively in global economic matters. Protests were non-existent; the only delay, it seems, was a result of the Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev’s perpetual exhaustion, according to news clippings of the day. Canada, which joined the group in 1976, held subsequent G7 meetings in Ottawa (in 1981) Toronto (in 1988) and Halifax in 1995. (Russia was admitted in 1998.) Everything changed with the teargas-drenched spectacle known as “the Battle of Seattle”. In 1999, 60,000 protesters demonstrated at the meeting of the World Trade Organization, fomenting what has become an enduring anti-globalization movement.
This large and diffuse group of trade unionists, NGOs, workers and black bloc members managed to disrupt the proceedings. The ensuing damage, and the images of police phalanxes doing battle with mostly unarmed protesters, were a headache for the city, law enforcement and world leaders alike. “World leaders were taken off guard. A lot of planning and organization went into the protests, and it all aligned in Seattle,” says Barry Eidlin, an assistant professor of sociology at McGill University in Montreal. “The retreat from the city is itself a response to these mass mobilization tactics.”
The G8 meetings held in Canada since Seattle have taken place in Kananaskis, Alberta, and Muskoka, Ontario – like Charlevoix, remote locations to which access can be tightly controlled. In Charlevoix, a designated red zone restricts entrance to residents and summit participants, with a larger fenced-in “green zone” surrounding it, accessible only to those with accreditation. Beyond this is the white zone, the notable home to the summit’s so-called “free speech zone” where protesters can vent – 2km from where Donald Trump and his six peers will gather. The summit and associated meetings will cost Canadian taxpayers more than $600m. In 2010, Toronto provided a Canadian cautionary tale to the pitfalls of urban-held trade meetings. That year, police “kettled” more than 1,000 protesters –corralling then holding them outdoors for hours on end during a torrential downpour. It led to the high-profile disciplining of a senior Toronto police officer and an enduring black eye for the force. There probably won’t be a similar event this weekend. Though there have already been limited protests in Quebec City, a massive police presence and the sheer distance to Charlevoix has apparently dulled the outrage. Of course, those who would like to hark back to the old days of protest-free trade meetings can look forward to the 2020 G20 summit in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, where access is all but impossible given foreigners need permission to visit, and free expression is often outlawed completely.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/09/g7-summit-canada-remote-locations,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/09/g7-summit-canada-remote-locations
2018-06-09T03:00:10Z,world,World news,"China's Beyonce: meet Wang Ju, the pop idol breaking down beauty barriers","Wang Ju swaggers on stage, stepping out in front of the other female contestants competing to be China’s next pop idol. Wearing white boots and a short pink windbreaker, she leans toward the audience as she sings in English lyrics that she wrote: “You don’t have to put a ring on me. I can buy my own.” She raps in English and Chinese as the camera pans to a crowd of mostly young women cheering. “Free your mind, fight [for] your right. Cold moonlight shines on my warrior coat. With a gorgeous attitude, my life is in my own hands.”
Wang, 25, is a contestant on the singing competition, Produce 101, a new Chinese remake of a South Korean show of the same name. Over the course of the contest she has also become China’s latest female icon and an unlikely hero remaking beauty standards in an industry that has long prized women who are doe-eyed, fair-skinned, girlish and cute. Wang is not beautiful by Chinese pop’s exacting standards. Just under 5’5 tall and weighing 60kg - her height and weight are listed on the show’s website – she is considered too short and too heavy. When she first appeared on the show in April viewers called her dama or “old auntie,” for being older than most of her rivals. One wrote, “Wang Ju is chunky and dark. I’ll never vote for her.”
Yet, she has developed a cult following of people who find her both relatable and inspirational. Fans refer to Wang fondly as Jujie, or Ju big sister. Fan clubs canvass for her – her ranking depends on viewers’ votes. Dozens of memes have emerged to honour her. She has also spawned her own lexicon. Among her fans, people who aren’t familiar with Wang are called Juwairen or “Ju outsiders.” Chinese media have breathlessly covered her rise, including China’s state-run Global Times, which described her as “a cultural phenomenon worthy of attention.” “Many viewers have found themselves, or the power they wish to have, in Wang Ju,” it said in an editorial on June 8. In the past week, her rank on the show has shot up to 23rd place, from 94th out of 101 contestants. “I think we’ve always lacked of a female role model who is confident and dares to challenge conventional standards,” said Echo Wu, an interior designer based in Beijing, who runs a fan club for Wang Ju called “Naomi Wang Ju backup,” after the singer’s English name. The club makes posters and rhymes to circulate online to raise support for Wang.
Wang’s so-called “queen style” has drawn more comparisons to Beyonce, Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, or Cardi B than China’s own more demure stars, earning her nicknames like “Juyonce,” “Nicki Minaju,” “Juhanna” or “Cardi Ju.” In a recent interview, Wang asked why it was easier for people with pretty faces to win over audiences than those with actual talent. Speaking after a performance in May, she also said, “Some people say girls like me cannot be idols. But what exactly are the standards for being a girl idol? I’ve eaten up all the standards.”
Wang hails from Shanghai. After graduating from university and working as a primary school teacher and then a recruiter, she joined a talent agency, Esee Model, in Shanghai where she now manages models. When Produce 101 sent notice to the agency of auditions earlier this year, Wang asked if there was a height requirement. When she learned there was not, she signed up. Michelle Chien, who runs PR at the agency, says she doesn’t believe Wang is deliberately trying to run against convention. In their days of ordering take-away or shooting short videos when work was slow, Wang never mentioned she wanted to become a performer. “I wouldn’t say she is a rebel. I’d say she is real. She faces things and speaks about what she wants honestly,” Chien said. Yet Wang has become a poster child for minority voices. Before gaining widespread popularity, she was a hit with China’s LGBT community. Late last month, LESDO, a WeChat account for lesbians endorsed Wang. Another publication Danlan, wrote, “Everything Wang Ju has been through, we gays have been through.” Wei Tingting, a cultural studies scholar in Guangzhou, said of Wang and marginalised groups, “They have the same experience of being excluded by a certain standard, thus they share the same sense of belonging.” Wang herself has pushed back against standards. After photos of a younger, thinner and paler Wang emerged online, one of the show’s judges asked if she would like to return to her earlier look. “I wouldn’t want to go back. The standard of being beautiful is to be yourself,” she said. “I control my own life. Having an independent spirit is too important.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/09/chinas-beyonce-meet-wang-ju-the-pop-idol-breaking-down-beauty-barriers,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/09/chinas-beyonce-meet-wang-ju-the-pop-idol-breaking-down-beauty-barriers
2018-06-09T00:06:20Z,world,World news,Kim-chi and El Trumpo tacos: Singapore feeds pre-summit anticipation,"Singapore is a city that has been described as having all the atmosphere of an airport terminal or a large shopping mall. Dirt and chaos are not welcome here, be it in the form of litter, chewing gum, graffiti or political protest. Cross the road away from a designated crossing at your peril. It is into this highly regulated city-state that two of the world’s most powerful yet unpredictable world leaders will meet for the first time in a summit next week.
“I hope that this is not just a gimmick, not just a stunt,” says Singapore resident Eric Hok Keng, 36. “It’s such a big event and in Singapore we should be proud that our small country was chosen as the destination for these two to meet for a peace summit. A deal for peace also benefits us so let’s hope that something positive comes out of it, and there will be a reason to celebrate next week.”
Here, Trump does not have to fear the mass street protests that have greeted him during other foreign visits. In Singapore the government bans unauthorised demonstrations and a gathering of just five people can be deemed an illegal assembly. Even an Australian comedian known best for impersonating Kim Jong-un was told by the Singaporean authorities on his arrival to stay away from the areas surrounding the summit. The setting of the summit will be the lavish Capella hotel on Sentosa, a small island connected to the mainland by one bridge, once known for its dark, violent pirate past but now mainly home to Disneyland-style resorts, waterparks and golf courses. Access to the hotel, where rooms can cost £8,000 ($US10,700) a night and which has hosted Lady Gaga and Madonna, has been restricted and guests report the entire second floor had black-out curtains. Across the island a visible beautifying mission is already in action, with workers repainting pavement edges and pulling dead leaves off the already-elaborate flower displays and lush green topiary.
Security barriers are visible around Sentosa and residents expressed concern about getting on and off the island. But while most in Singapore seemed pleased their small country had been selected to host such a huge summit, some visitors were not so happy. Sylvia, 21, who was visiting from New York shakes her head in dismay. “I booked this holiday six months ago to escape Trump,” she says. “I can’t believe he’s followed me here.” Kim-chi diplomacy While the island location has been seen as ideal in terms of security, the proximity of the Capella hotel to the immaculate green of the nearby Sentosa golf club may also be an added benefit for Trump, known for his love of the sport. The golf club declined to comment whether they would be open to hosting Trump for a post-summit game. With the sanitised streets of Singapore free of kitsch unofficial summit merchandise, the celebration of the summit fell mainly to the city’s restaurants and bars. Zach Wen, 34, the co-founder of food outlet Harmony Nasi Lemak, had his chefs create a special version of the rice dish in honour of the summit, playing tribute to both leaders. The Trump Kim-chi Nasi Lemak features imported US beef. “Donald Trump in every trade negotiation talks about exported beef, that his beef should be protected, so I thought, OK we’ll use US beef,” says Wen. The recipe also includes Korean speciality kimchi. In a nod to America, the portion size is “huge”, he says.
“There is so much negativity in the world right now but this is a rare moment when progress towards peace is happening so we decided to mark that with a special dish,” says Wen. “When we heard the news that Donald Trump was coming to Singapore, we were all like ‘wow’. People thought Obama could solve the problem, people thought Bill Clinton could solve the problem, but no, it’s Donald Trump, the most unlikely candidate. God is a joker.” Meanwhile mexican taco joint Lucha Loco created the El Trumpo taco and the El Hombre Cohette taco (rocket man taco) in honour of the summit. Anyone ordering the tacos also gets their name entered into a draw, the winner of which gets to chose a pinata of either Trump or Kim to smash into oblivion.
“This summit is obviously a big deal, and something people are talking about in a very serious way, so we just wanted to take the edge off it a little, have a laugh with it,” said chef Josh Jones. “And we think people are up for giving both leaders a good whack.”
Stan Sri Ganesh, the owner of Singapore’s Escobar, has specially created blue and red Kim and Trump cocktails. Their popularity could be symbolic of the balance of power relations at the summit. “I have to admit that when it comes to which is selling better, it is leaning towards Trump as the favourite at the moment,” laughed Ganesh. “That’s just the way of the world isn’t it, everything leans towards Trump.”
The area where the two leaders are reported to be staying during the summit – Trump in the Shangri-La hotel and Kim in the St Regis hotel – has been designated a special zone, but it was business as usual this week, with only a slightly visible security presence. The American summit contingent may also be reassured that the Shangri-La hotel is just a three-minute drive to the nearest McDonald’s, said to be Trump’s favourite food. It is just as well Trump doesn’t arrive until next week, for the event schedule of the Shangri-La this week could have caused some tension.

news,Would you give a job to this gangster?,"It was a scorching hot day when Carlos Fernando Argueta was interviewed for a job at a clothing factory in western El Salvador, but he still wore a long-sleeved shirt. The tattoos on his arms had cost him jobs before, tell-tale signs of his past life in the notoriously brutal Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) street gang. “Believe me, I’m very ashamed,” says Argueta, 39, who joined the gang when he was 12. “I know that we corrupted many hearts and minds. But if God has his arms open for people like us, then why can’t society give us a job opportunity?” Between 30,000 and 60,000 active gang members in El Salvador, in a population of 6.3 million. It was one of the most dangerous countries in the world last year; in 2015 it recorded one murder every hour, after a truce between the MS-13 and Barrio 18 gangs fell apart and a bloody turf war resumed.
The interviewer spotted that Argueta was attempting to hide his past. He gave him the job anyway. Argueta has worked for nine years at League Central America, a clothing factory that produces apparel for US universities including Harvard and Princeton. It’s one of a growing number of firms, at least 10 so far, in El Salvador hiring reformed gang members. Those include energy firm AES Corporation and a tuna packing company, according to the Trabajemos por la Paz (Working for Peace) group, which has found jobs for more than 700 reformed gang members since 2008.
Unsurprisingly, research suggests that those who can find regular employment are more likely to escape the cycle of gang violence that has tormented the country. League Central America has employed at least 100 former gangsters since 2009. The company pairs with local churches and community groups to provide job training and facilitate the delicate process of cutting ties, which involves careful negotiation with leaders who view defectors with suspicion. In fact, members are never considered to have truly left, only to have become calmado, or inactive. According to the head of League Central America, Rodrígo Bolaños, none of those who joined his firm have returned to active status.
This process of rehabilitation stands in stark contrast to the politically popular mano dura, or iron fist, approach to dealing with the country’s gang violence, which has seen lethal extrajudicial violence meted out by security forces. “We have stopped a tremendous problem by embracing the community, giving them a true opportunity in life. We’re resolving the problem instead of killing them,” says Bolaños. “It sends the message that we have to embrace the community if we want to have a healthy country.” Manuel Oswaldo Henríquez, a 31-year-old employee at League Central America, joined the Barrio 18 gang at 14. “After ninth grade, I didn’t want to study anymore,” Henríquez says. “There was no future for me in this country because I had already tattooed my body.” His teachers were afraid of him, awarding passing grades out of fear. His life consisted of shootouts in rival neighbourhoods, followed by the inevitable retaliation on his own turf. “It’s hard being in the gang. It’s not like your mom telling you to do something. If you don’t follow the orders, there are punishments, beatings. That’s life in the gang.”
Now, Henríquez has a respectable job that allows him to provide for his wife and six-year-old son. Not everyone is convinced of the merits of offering jobs to people such as Argueta and Henríquez who have perpetrated terrible crimes. Many Salvadorans bear the scars of years of gang violence. Some firms still refuse to partner with Trabajemos por la Paz, while others are only comfortable offering food for programmes and events. Those that do open their doors also face the task of winning over the existing employees. “It’s a challenge to convince not just the business owners, but all the people working at a company,” said Nelson Morales, the executive director of the group. “But through the years, we’ve realised that people are opening up. Part of our work is making sure that society and business owners understand the [gang] phenomenon.”
For Morales there’s a simple logic to the approach. “Any social reintegration programme is incomplete if it can’t provide people with a way of making a living that is respectable and socially accepted,” he says. Henríquez has faced resistance in his new life. “There are many people who don’t believe that gang members can change,” he says. “But they can, I’ve seen it in myself and I’ve seen it in other people as well. If there are opportunities, I know that a gang member can change and be different.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.
