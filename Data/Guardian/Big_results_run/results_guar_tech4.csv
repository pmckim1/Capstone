2015-06-08T20:47:06Z,technology,Technology,Women top the bill at Apple's developer conference in first for company,"Forget the streaming music service and the software update. Forget Drake’s walk-on appearance and The Weeknd’s closing performance. Apple has women! Jennifer Bailey and Susan Prescott presented on stage at the Apple Worldwide Developer Conference conference on Monday – the first time Apple’s own female executives have presented publicly since the event was first held 1976. It was a major first for a company that has struggled, along with the rest of Silicon Valley, with a lack of diversity among its ranks, especially at the top. Speaking from the Moscone Centre in San Francisco, Bailey, the vice-president of Apple Pay, updated the audience on the company’s contactless payment system and said it would soon be making its UK debut.
Bailey said “250,000 locations across the United Kingdom are ready to accept Apple Pay”, which is a greater number than the initial roll-out in the US. More than 70% of credit and debit cards would work with Apple Pay, Bailey said. Merchants signed up include Boots, Marks and Spencer, and Waitrose. In London, commuters will be able to use Apple Pay for tube travel. Passbook is to renamed Wallet, and will allow users to store card information for easier transactions.
Prescott, Apple’s vice-president, also graced the stage to introduced Apple’s news app, in partnership with various media outlets including Conde Nast – which will make 17 titles available to the app. The New York Times will offer 30 free articles per day. Prescott said: “News [the app’s name] has the latest stories, articles and posts, with over a million topics to choose from. The service would track over 1m topics and allow readers to follow all their favourite news sources as well as using search to discover new sources.”

Last year Cook came out as gay and described his sexuality as “among the greatest gifts God has given me”. According to the company’s 2014 diversity report, 70% of its 98,000 employees were male and 55% were white.
Apple and other technology firms have been criticised for having a predominantly male workforce, a lack of ethnically diverse employees and a low number of women in senior management positions. Angela Ahrendts, senior vice-president of retail and online stores, is the sole woman on its 10-strong executive team. The balance is typical for technology firms. Facebook reports a 69% male and 57% white workforce, while Twitter has a 70% male and 59% white employee demographic. Apple’s events typically feature slots from Craig Federighi, head of software engineering; marketing chief Phil Schiller; Eddy Cue, vice-president of internet services; and iOS software supremo Scott Forstall.
The more diverse speaker lineup is part of a concerted effort by Cook, who told technology news site Mashable on Sunday that “you’ll see a change tomorrow” with the speakers, and spent time meeting female student WWDC scholarship winners at Sunday’s orientation session. Apple also remains a “lifetime” partner for the non-profit organisation National Center for Women & Information, which encourages women to enter into technology positions."
2015-06-08T20:30:34Z,technology,Technology,Darpa robot challenge showcases further potential for automation,"It is very difficult to read the words “Defense Department” and “robots” and not immediately come up with the phrase “robot army”, but if this weekend’s contestants at the Darpa Robotics Challenge in Pomona, California, invaded your town, the damage would be about what a gang of arthritic 90-year-olds could do, if those 90-year-olds also kept forgetting where they were and what they were trying to accomplish. These robots stumbled, they broke, they stood motionless for half an hour, they couldn’t get out of the car. And this was the exciting version - the 2013 trials in this competition were “like watching paint dry”, according to one Darpa worker. The robots may be coming slowly, and with a lot of stops and starts, and they often have to be repaired, reworked and disassembled over long periods of time. But they are definitely coming, and probably for your jobs. Christopher Atkeson, the ursine roboticist from Carnegie Mellon University on whom the villain in Disney’s Marvel Comics sci-fi cartoon Big Hero 6 was partially based, is very much in favor of better robots, soon. He wants them to be healthcare professionals like Baymax, the robot in that movie. Getting there, he told the Guardian, is “a long, hard slog”. “So you have Moore’s law for microprocessors,” said Atkeson, wearing a Build Baymax T-shirt of his own design and staring out over the Pomona fairgrounds where his team was about to field a challenger in the DRC. Moore’s law, he explained, means that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles about every 24 months – essentially, microchips are twice as good every two years. Digital brains are constantly getting smarter, and digital perception, like reading road signs and lane lines the way the new generation of self-driving cars does, has progressed by leaps and bounds with innovations like Lidar. “That capacity is going to explode,” said Atkeson. “But when we start to talk about things that move, it’s mostly hydraulics. That hasn’t changed since world war two. Perception is going to be dirt cheap, but movement is going to be expensive.” “What’s going on in the car business is mostly perception,” Atkeson explained, the fruit of development in the self-driving cars that came out of the Darpa Urban Challenge. Much of the software work on the current project was already done before the humanoid robots even showed up; the same kinds of perception used by self-driving vehicles are crucial to the eyes and ears of the competitors in Pomona last week. Atkeson is something of a rock star here, and a veteran: 11 years ago, when Darpa offered its first million-dollar prize to the team of engineers who could make a car successfully navigate an obstacle course the way a human driver would, no one won. Darpa didn’t change the goals for the next year’s edition – they just increased the prize money, and that did the trick. Five teams completed the course. Last month, Daimler’s self-driving 18-wheelers became street legal in the state of Nevada, and Uber and Google are edging ever closer to publicly available self-driving vehicles. Last week, three human-sized robots (one made by the Google-owned Boston Dynamics) successfully drove a car, not with a complex computer interface, but with a steering wheel. Things are moving forward, literally. Robots that can operate in human environments are incredibly difficult to make, largely because the raw materials that make up an organic body are so much more sophisticated than anything manmade. It’s frustrating for scientists like Atkeson, who’ve seen electronics far outstrip mechanics. Workarounds aren’t very practical, but they are abundant – you can build your own cyborg cockroaches from a kit these days, cockroach not included (please email me if this is a problem for you – I have extras). That difficulty is why Darpa offered $2m to the winner of the challenge this year. Napoleon, DRC head Gill Pratt pointed out, discovered that you could keep food from spoiling in jars in 1795 (before germ theory) by offering 12,000 francs to the person who came up with the best method of food preservation. People and robots are natural partners, Pratt said: “The person is great at thinking strategically about what needs to be done. What is the robot good at? Working in a really dangerous situation.” Of course, robots can also work in non-dangerous situations, especially now. Automation has been diminishing the number of employees required on, say, a car assembly line for decades. Now it’s becoming possible to automate easier work. “I don’t think there’s necessarily anything more sophisticated about combing through records as a junior partner at a law firm than there is about working on an assembly line,” said Peter Frase, editor at leftist politics magazine Jacobin. “The technical frontier has moved from ‘How do we make one piece of metal and move it to another piece of metal?’ and become more about boiling down a lot of information into something that is comprehensible and useful.” IBM supercomputer Watson, for example, notable for crushing human opponents under its electronic boot heel (on Jeopardy) is now being used to sort healthcare information. To be sure, robots are lousy novelists, and they’re not very good musicians, either. But the question, Frase said, is ultimately one of fundamental human politics. “It may be possible in principle to have a society where automation means that we all have more leisure time, but people who are promoters of this tend to talk about it as something that will inevitably happen,” he said. “It most certainly will not inevitably happen. We could easily have a future where a few people get rich and everyone else is unemployed and miserable.”"
2015-06-08T19:28:51Z,technology,Technology,Apple unveils streaming service Apple Music and 24-hour radio stations,"Apple unveiled its long-awaited streaming music service on Monday, entering a crowded market for online music that already includes Spotify, Amazon and Google, as the company seeks to re-exert its dominance in digital music. The launch at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco was introduced by the rapper Drake. “This is something that simplifies everything for the modern musician like myself, and the modern consumer like you,” he said.
Apple Music, as it’s known, was built by the team behind the Beats Music service that Apple acquired as part of its $3bn purchase of music-tech firm Beats Electronics in 2014. “2015, music industry is a fragmented mess. Do you wanna stream music? You can go over here. If you wanna stream video, you can check some of these places out. If you wanna follow some artists, there’s more confusions with that,” said Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine as he introduced Apple Music on-stage at WWDC. “So I reached out to [Apple executives] Tim Cook and Eddy Cue and said: ‘Guys, can we build a bigger and better ecosystem with the elegance and simplicity that only Apple can do?’ ... All the ways you love music, all in one place, and that place is in almost a billion hands all around the world already: one single app on your iPhone.” Apple Music will launch in 100 countries later in June, initially available on iOS, Mac and Windows, with an Android version following in autumn. After a three-month trial, it will cost $9.99 a month, or $14.99 for a family plan for up to six people.
The core of Apple Music will be a catalogue of millions of songs and music videos to stream on-demand, as well as a wide variety of programmed playlists created by its in-house team of editors, and by musicians. They will including a 24-hour radio station headed up by former BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe. The radio station is called Beats 1, and will broadcast round-the-clock from Los Angeles, New York and London. “The truth is: internet radio isn’t really radio, it’s just a playlist of songs. So we wanted to do something really big: a worldwide radio station broadcasting around the globe,” said Iovine. The third plank of Apple Music is something called Connect, a cross between Facebook and SoundCloud, where artists will be able to post music, videos and photos for fans that follow them. They will also be able to post from Connect to Facebook, Twitter and their own websites, as Apple bids to become the hub for their online activity. “Apple comes late to the music streaming business, due in part to Steve Jobs’ refusal to believe that music subscription services would ever work,” said Forrester analyst James McQuivey. “But the writing is on the wall: digital downloads don’t make sense for consumers that are connected wherever they go.”
“Can Apple beat Spotify? Yes, it can, not because its service will be any better - but because it can build its new music service into the hundreds of millions of devices that its loyal Apple users already love. Advertising will help, but magically updating your iPhone or iPad to include a free month of Apple’s new service will help Apple catch up to Spotify’s paid subscriber base in less than a year. However, it will also inject new energy into Spotify, as the service reaps the windfall of so much attention to the music streaming business it helped pioneer.” Beats Music started life in early 2013 as a Spotify rival codenamed Daisy, developed within audio hardware firm Beats Electronics – the company co-founded by Dr Dre and Universal Music executive Jimmy Iovine. They hired veteran digital music executive Ian Rogers to run the service, and Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor as its chief creative officer, before renaming it as Beats Music ahead of its January 2014 launch in the US. After Apple bought Beats Electronics for $3bn later that year, the company kept Beats Music running while putting its executive team to work on the company’s plans to launch a new streaming service in the summer of 2015.
Beats Music had 250,000 paying subscribers in May 2014 according to Iovine, although the Wall Street Journal recently reported that this figure rose to only 303,000 by the end of that year – by which point, Spotify had 15 million paying subscribers out of its 60 million active users. Former Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe and several of his producer colleagues have been poached by Apple to work on the new service, although there have been a few clouds over it in the weeks leading up to its announcement. Apple’s licensing deals with major labels reportedly went down to the wire before the planned announcement – although this is hardly uncommon in the music industry. More serious were reports that regulators in the US and Europe are investigating complaints from rivals about potentially anticompetitive behaviour from Apple. That speculation focused on rumoured plans to strike exclusive deals for music; the way it takes a 30% cut of subscription payments made within those rivals’ iOS apps; and claims that Apple has been encouraging labels to pressure Spotify to restrict its free service. Apple’s next moves in streaming are being eagerly anticipated by the music industry, which hopes that competition between Apple, Spotify, Google/YouTube and other streaming services will spark a return to growth for the industry.
An estimated 41 million people paid for a streaming music subscription in 2014, according to industry body the IFPI, which claimed that another 100 million use the free tiers of services like Spotify – collectively generating $1.6bn for the industry. “A new launch from Apple, when it comes to the UK with its vast digital penetration and marketing reach, could represent one of those pivotal moments when the industry takes its next big leap forward,” said Geoff Taylor, chief executive of industry body the BPI. “It is sure to give the streaming market, which doubled last year in the UK, a further turbo boost. And most important, it is likely to deliver a fantastic experience for music fans, helping to drive consumer awareness and appreciation of premium music subscription as something that enhances your life.” • Apple Music interview: ‘Algorithms can’t do it alone – you need a human touch’"
2015-06-08T19:05:17Z,technology,Technology,Apple confirms native apps coming to Apple Watch,"Apple opened its new watch up further to developers on Monday in a bid to improve the smartwatch experience for customers, separating it from the iPhone and allow more customisation. The latest version of its new smartwatch operating system – WatchOS 2 – will let app developers run apps directly on the watch, rather than powered by the connected iPhone, similar to other smartwatches from Google, Pebble and Samsung.
“Today we’re bringing native apps to the Watch ... We believe in technology for the wrist and we believe that you will create powerful new apps to change our lives,” said CEO Tim Cook on the stage of WWDC, the tech company’s annual developers’ conference. The new apps will be subject to fewer restrictions, and will be able to run similar to Apple’s own programmes. Fitness tracking apps, for instance, will work without an iPhone connected. Apps will also be able to connect directly to the internet via Wi-Fi without an iPhone connected. Apple’s Kevin Lynch promised “performance will be great”, addressing the complaints of slow app loading and sluggish performance leveled at the Apple Watch. Apple has added two additional photo-based watchfaces, one for personal photos and another featuring time-lapse photography linked to the wearer’s current location. An alarm clock mode, which displays the time overnight on the watch’s screen, was also added. The Watch will now be able to play short form video, such as vines via a glance screen, on the watch face and control internet of things with Apple’s HomeKit from the watch face. Users will be able to reply to email from the watch, a function previously limited to text messages, while a new calendar, event and app browsing system called “Time Travel” will allow users to fast forward in time and see upcoming events. WatchOS 2 will be available as a free update in the fall.
On WatchOS 1.0, all third-party apps worked in conjunction with a paired iPhone. The phone does the heavy lifting, and the code running directly on the watch is limited to the user interface. That has severely constrained what developers could do with their watch apps, particularly in situations when a paired iPhone isn’t available. The decision not to launch the Watch with native app support was widely believed to be due in part to the compressed timeframe for the launch, with the watch shipping just months after the kit was made available to developers. But the company’s focus on extending battery life for the watch was also seen as a key reason for preventing power-hungry native apps from running. Battery life is likely to be impacted by native apps. Google’s competing smartwatch platform, Android Wear, has always offered developers the ability to run directly on the device, in keeping with the platform’s general selling point of “openness”. But even owners of those smartwatches may benefit from Apple’s change: the install base of the Apple Watch is large enough to guide development practices generally. For example, transit app Citymapper launched a simple Android Wear app first, before launching a much more full-featured Apple Watch app and porting it back to Android Wear."
2015-06-08T18:37:15Z,technology,Technology,Apple iOS 9 to give four extra hours of iPhone battery life,"The next update to Apple’s iOS iPhone and iPad operating system was unveiled on Monday and introduced a new intelligent search assistant, greater speed and security.
The free update that will be available in September is aiming to refine features and styles implemented last year with iOS 8, instead of launching big new features, as the operating system matures following Jony Ive’s promotion to chief design officer. Apple has concentrated on optimising iOS to run smoother and faster with lower power consumption, adding an extra hour to the iPhone’s battery life, plus an additional low-power mode will add another three hours of iPhone battery life. One of the more significant new features is a new search assistant that builds on Apple’s Spotlight search facility and integrates with Siri to create a Google Now competitor, capable of displaying data from apps and the web, and controlled via text or voice. Intelligence Siri can now offer directions based on invitations pulled automatically from email, as well as when to leave reminders based on events. The information displayed is context sensitive, including the ability to understand that the user is looking at something in particular when they say “remind me about this later today”. Users can plug in headphones in one location and always get the music app, for instance. Apple’s search app Spotlight will also be able to pull information straight from the web and apps such as recipe app Yummly. Siri will also be able to search via voice for photos and other apps. A search for “Eddy Cue karaoke” for instance, will bring up pictures from the Photos app. “All of this is done on device, and stays on the device, under your control,” said Apple’s senior vice-president of software engineering Craig Federighi, saying that searches made on the internet are performed anonymously, as Apple is not interested in your data, a dig at rival Google.
Apple Maps will see an overhaul, with public transport directions, including those within London, New York and San Francisco, and enhanced street-level imagery, similar to Google’s Street View. News
Apple also launched a new news aggregation app called “News” – a Flipboard-style interface for content from third-party publishers including the New York Times and ESPN. Apple stressed that readers would be anonymous and that their reading would not be tracked. It will be available in the US, UK and Australia. The iPad received enhanced multi-tasking upgrades with the ability to have more than one app on screen using “slide-over” similar to Microsoft’s Windows 8.1 split-screen modes. Videos can also be played in a picture-in-picture windowed mode, while the virtual keyboard gained text editing features and enhanced support for bluetooth keyboards, taking aim at Windows tablets and laptops. One of the big changes will be in the sizes and speeds of apps built using Apple’s Swift language. The programming language, open sourced by Apple, will form an integral part of the new operating system. The operating system will also take up a smaller amount of space on the device, requiring 1.3GB of free space to install. iOS 8 required more than 4GB to install, which caused issues for users requiring them to delete apps. Increased security Security has been improved in iOS 9 to help fend off hackers. Stronger end-to-end encryption will be used for syncing information such as notes and reminders, while a new set of security extensions will prevent unauthorised access to secure files. The new measures are likely to cause issues for the jailbreaking community, which often exploits weaknesses in system files to open up iPhones and iPads and install custom software. iOS 9 will support all devices currently running iOS 8, available as a free update in the fall. Apple follows Google in focusing on making existing features operate better, faster and more efficiently. The search giant announced it was making very similar changes to its next version of Android “M”, designed to boost battery life, security and speed, while boosting privacy features and adding advanced Google Now integration."
2015-06-08T18:15:46Z,technology,Technology,Wikipedia volunteer faces reprimand over ‘Shapps account’ investigation,"Wikipedia’s “high court” looks likely to reprimand one of its senior administrators over the way he investigated claims that the former Conservative party co-chairman Grant Shapps used an account to edit his own page and those of rival Tories. The site’s arbitration committee – a group of volunteers chosen by the community to adjudicate on controversial decisions – looks certain to strip Richard Symonds of the right to unearth the IP addresses of Wikipedia users and also the ability to hide certain key edits. The 15-person committee is likely to reach its decision in the next 24 hours. In April, after the Guardian approached a number of administrators with details of edits made over several years, Symonds blocked the account of a user named Contribsx because of suspicions that it had been used by Shapps or “someone under his direction”. The committee has criticised Symonds for the way he used his access to the site’s CheckUser tool, which can uncover the IP addresses of devices used to make edits. It said it “does not believe that there was a significant violation of policy through this action but that it creates an appearance of favouritism” towards the Guardian. It looks unlikely that Symonds will be “desysoped” and lose all rights as an administrator on Wikipedia. Neither does the arbitration committee propose at present to reverse Symonds’ decision to block Contribsx. The disclosure during the general election campaign that Shapps was suspected of engaging in “sock puppetry” – creating a fake online identity for improper purposes – proved highly embarrassing to the Tories. David Cameron faced questions about the story on the campaign trail. Shapps denied the allegations. After the election he was removed from the post of party co-chairman and made a minister at the Department for International Development, a move widely seen as a demotion. Symonds, whom the Tories tried to paint as part of a political conspiracy owing to his previous membership of the Lib Dems, said it would be be premature to comment on the outcome of the internal investigation before the committee votes. He added: “That said, my heart is warmed at the upwelling of support, both private and public, that I have had from the flurry of experienced Wikipedians who believe that I did the right thing.”"
2015-06-08T18:11:16Z,technology,Technology,Apple Pay to launch in UK in July,"Apple Pay will come to the UK in July, Apple confirmed at its Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco on Monday. It will be available at more than 250,000 locations - more than the number of merchants it had in the US for last year’s launch.
Participating retailers include Marks & Spencer, Costa and Waitrose – as well as Transport for London, meaning that Tube and bus travel can be paid for with Apple’s contactless payment system. Apple Pay will be supported by more than 70% of the credit and debit cards in the UK, said Apple executive Jennifer Bailey at WWDC. The mobile payment system launched in America in 2014, alongside the iPhone 6, but has been slow to expand to other territories. Britain is the first country outside the US to have access to use Apple Pay, which lets users pay for things, both on- and offline, using just their phone or watch. When used as an offline payment system, Apple Pay works in conjunction with an NFC (near-field communications) chip found in the two newest iPhones and the Apple Watch to let users pay for goods by tapping their phones on contactless card readers in stores. In the US, the system took a marathon of deals to put together, with Apple negotiating with banks, retailers and credit card companies individually to build enough support. Elsewhere, however, the launch is expected to be much simpler because Apple Pay uses the same technology as that found in conventional contactless card readers, already common across much of Europe and Asia. But unlike contactless cards, Apple Pay includes an extra security measure – tokenisation – which ensures that the card details stored on a phone are never passed to the retailer. Instead, the payee receives a one-use “token”, which allows them to debit the payment but cannot be reused in future. Online, Apple Pay uses the same tokenisation system to speed up and secure e-commerce, letting iPhone owners pay for goods on supported websites with just a tap of their finger on the phone’s fingerprint reader. In the US, uptake of Apple Pay was strong, with more than 40% of iPhone 6 owners having used it at least once, according to Auriemma Consulting. But the service was hampered by a need to bring partners in one by one, leading to some major hold-outs: most notably Walmart, which is already waging a war against credit card firms over merchant fees and reportedly views Apple Pay as merely perpetuating an expensive system."
2015-06-08T17:58:24Z,technology,Technology,El Capitan: Apple unveils next version of OS X software,"Apple announced the latest update to its OS X desktop software on Monday, which the company says will make it faster and easier to use. OS X 10.11 El Capitan, named after a mountain within Yosemite national park, will be available as a free update in the autumn.
Apple’s Craig Federighi said it was going to be the fastest version of OS X to date: “It’s up to 1.4x faster and we’ve seen it twice as snappy switching between apps.” The company has rewritten parts of the operating system to optimise it, extending battery life and making existing computers feel faster. It will be able to open PDF documents four times faster, for instance. Apple brought its Metal graphics system from its iOS to the Mac, which Epic Games, developers of the Unreal graphics engine used by many of today’s top games, said was significantly faster and less processor intensive for rendering intensive graphics. Spotlight, Apple’s search engine, also so an upgrade with semantic searches. “Users can search for “documents I worked on last June” and it will find all the documents created in June last year on your Mac,” said Federighi. Apple has improved window management in El Capitan, including the ability to size windows to half the screen, something Microsoft’s Windows has had baked in for years but requires a third-party app such as Moom or manual rearrangement on Yosemite. Federighi said the company had made many hundreds of small changes to the rest of Apple’s core apps, including Safari which can now pin tabs within the tab bar in the corner and can load instantly."
2015-06-08T16:15:33Z,technology,Technology,Apple takes on Facebook with revamped news app,"Apple revamped its news service on Monday, making a play to take on Facebook as the two tech giants court readers and publishers to be the top platform for news. Media organisations including the Guardian, ESPN, the New York Times, Conde Nast, the Daily Mail and Hearst will produce content specifically designed for the new service, which will replace Newstand, Apple’s current news app.
“News [the app’s name] has the latest stories, articles, and posts, with over a million topics to choose from,” Susan Prescott, vice president of product marketing, told Apple’s WWDC developers’ conference. She said the service would track over 1m topics and allow readers to follow all their favourite news sources as well as using search to discover new sources. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, said the New York Times would initially provide 33 articles a day tailored to the service as would other publishers including ESPN and Conde Nast magazine’s including Vogue and Vanity Fair. While content will be hosted and delivered on Apple’s platform, the publishers will own the content and control the format of articles. Publishers will also be able to sell premium ads through the app and keep the revenue. The service looks similar to Flipboard, an app that serves up news and other articles in a magazine-like format, and can be tailored to location as well as other preferences. Tony Danker, international director, Guardian News & Media, said: “We’re excited to be a launch partner for Apple News. Like Apple, we are increasingly seeing a surge in demand for original, high quality journalism from millions of new readers. And we are delighted that Apple and other large platforms recognise the value and influence of Guardian journalism.”
Apple’s Newsstand, launched in 2011, was heralded as the saviour of newspaper and magazine market in the internet-connected, smartphone and tablet era. The app saw digital magazine and newspaper revenue quadruple in the first year. But more recently publishers have complained that Newsstand hides content rather than highlights it. Many have switched to standalone apps dedicated to pulling content from websites, like the Guardian app, which has offered them greater visibility both on the iPad homescreen and within stores. Publishers will now sell apps directly within the App Store like any other app, with Apple continuing to take a 30% cut of revenue from subscriptions. Within the new Flipboard-style app, publishers participating and displaying content will keep 100% of revenue for ads they sell around their content. Apple will also help sell unsold ad slots for a fee, according to the tech site Recode. The revamp comes after Facebook revamped its news service and announced it would partner with publishers to promote stories."
2015-06-08T13:26:44Z,technology,Technology,Amazon sells reasonably-priced towel set for $800 billion,"Ever thought that stepping out of the shower and drying yourself on $100 dollar bills might be just a little too ostentatious? Ever wanted to bathe in liquid gold but didn’t want to be judged in times of global austerity? Well, never fear, for Amazon is selling a $800bn towel set, or $796bn, to be fair (£521bn). We’re guessing that stockists Portlight have made a fat-fingers keyboard mistake, or someone at the company has a very, um, dry sense of humour. The towels, manufactured by Calcot Ltd and which apparently come in just the one colour – amethyst, obviously – are woven into “super soft Supima cotton loops using zero-twist technology”. We have no idea what this means either, but damn it, we need these towels. The set, ludicrously, does not come with a free serf to hand-wash the towels using miniature bottles of Fiji water, and then dry them by soft whispering of compliments into the fabric, but are machine washable and tumble dryer safe.
The set does include two “generously sized” bath towels, two hand towels and two wash cloths (otherwise known as flannels). The towers are “less prone to pilling”, which is a word we had to look up on Google. “Functional and decorative fold-over edge is added to finish off an already perfect towel”, reads the description, and at least one punter agrees. David H writes in his product review: “This is quite possibly the best towel ever made. I had to take out a second mortgage on my house and sell my children into indentured servitude but it was way worth it. The cotton alone must have been grown in heaven. Every time I dry off I feel like I’m wrapped in joy. Sometimes I will take this towel to the lake and fish jump into my boat just to be near it. Where ever you are, this towel will attract attention.” However, Jonathan M. Pryce is less than impressed: These towels cost 12-figures and they’re not even Amazon Prime eligible??” Clay P. is equivocal: It’s alright.” The average rating for the product is 3.8 stars, but we live in an imperfect world. You can order the towel set here. But, beware, postage and packaging is $4.49 shipping . Which, frankly, is a rip-off."
