2018-01-02T20:09:44Z,world,World news,"Iran's enemies to blame for unrest, says supreme leader, as death toll rises","Iran’s supreme leader has blamed the Islamic Republic’s enemies for nationwide unrest, as authorities cracked down with increasing intensity on protesters, leading to the death toll rising. “In the events of the past few days, the enemies of Iran are deploying every means at their disposal including money, arms and political and intelligence support to coordinate making troubles for the Islamic establishment,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in his first public remarks since the protests began on Thursday. Videos posted on social networks suggest riot police and protesters are becoming more confrontational. In a sign that the rhetoric is also hardening, Esmail Kowsari, a senior Revolutionary Guards commander, vowed that the elite forces would crush those he said were disturbing the country’s security. In the event that the unrest continued, “the authorities will undoubtedly make a decision and finish the business”, Kowsari said. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, called for international action in solidarity with the demonstrators and said the US would seek emergency UN sessions on Iran. Haley, one of the most hawkish figures on Iran in the Trump administration, rejected Khamenei’s comments, saying the protests were “completely spontaneous”. “By the thousands, Iranian citizens are taking to the streets to protest the oppression of their own government. It takes great bravery for the Iranian people to use the power of their voice, especially when their government has a long history of murdering its own people who dare to speak the truth,” Haley said. “We must not be silent,. The people of Iran are crying out for freedom.” The US Department of State spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, later denied that the US was calling for regime change, saying it was simply backing the right of the protesters to demand changed policies from their government. The demonstrations, the largest seen in Iran since its disputed 2009 presidential election, resumed on Tuesday evening for the sixth consecutive day.
The protests began on Thursday when opponents of Iran’s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, gathered in north-eastern Iran to demonstrate over economic grievances. They then spread nationwide and took on more of an anti-regime dimension, including anti-Khamenei chants. An intervention by Rouhani on Sunday, when he acknowledged the discontent, failed to quell the anger. Monday night’s disturbances were the most violent so far. At least 21 people are now thought to have died across the country. More than 450 people have been arrested in Tehran alone since Saturday – nationwide figures have not been released. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, expressed his “regret” at the rising death toll and called on Tehran to respect the rights of peaceful protesters. “We expect that the rights to peaceful assembly and expression of the Iranian people will be respected,” his spokesman said.
A senior Iranian official directly blamed Saudi Arabia, Iran’s regional rival, for the demonstrations. Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s supreme national security council, told a Lebanese Arabic-language TV channel that the number of messages on social networks sent online via Saudi Arabia showed the country was involved. He warned that Iran would retaliate with “an appropriate response” in due course. In the first intervention of its kind, the actor Taraneh Alidoosti – famous for her collaboration with Iran’s Oscar-winning director Asghar Farhadi – called on Twitter for the authorities to refrain from using violence against protesters and instead to understand their anger and find a way to calm the situation.
State TV and semi-official news agencies that used relatively conciliatory language last week are increasingly referring to the protesters as mobs who want to destroy public property. On Tuesday judicial authorities gave an ultimatum to protesters, threatening harsher sentences if the unrest continued. State television said six protesters had been killed overnight as they tried to attack a police station in the town of Qahderijan in the central Isfahan region. It also said an 11-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man had been killed in the town of Khomeinishahr, while a member of Iran’s paramilitary militia was killed in the town of Najafabad. None of the reports could be confirmed independently.
Observers reported riot police riding on motorbikes and wielding batons on the streets of Tehran. Similar scenes were reported in other cities. A Tehrani man who drives a taxi for Snapp, Iran’s equivalent of Uber, told the Guardian that motorbike-riding security guards with batons had been out in full force in Tehran on Monday night. “I was out at 8 or 9pm and the atmosphere was tense. In Tehran the riot police was unleashed near Vanak Square, in Enghelab Street and in Naziabad,” he said. “I was in Vanak Square at 5pm and it was full of security guards.” The driver said the protests were more widespread in the provinces than in Tehran because working class people in the provinces were the most affected by Iran’s economic problems. “In Kermanshah [in the west of Iran] there was an earthquake recently and a lot of those affected are still living outside,” he said. “In Ahwaz, 30 years after the [Iran-Iraq] war, the situation is still bad. “The city of Arak has many industries and a lot of people are without jobs. One of my relatives works for a petrochemical company in Arak – they haven’t got salaries for a few months now, that’s why they’re out … Gradually people are getting fed up and raising their voice.” Rouhani spoke with a number of parliamentarians on Monday in a meeting that officials insisted had been planned before the protests began. The president acknowledged anger over the country’s flagging economy, although he and others warned that the government would not hesitate to crack down on those it considered lawbreakers. The Economist Intelligence Unit, a UK-based advisory business, said rising inflation and a recent increase in food prices were to blame for the protests, as well as a lack of economic development. Youth unemployment remained at about 40%, the EIU noted, despite a promise by the Rouhani administration that the 2015 nuclear deal would help to create jobs and improve people’s living standards. The scale and speed at which the protests have spread across Iran have puzzled many in the country, including reformists who are critical of the political atmosphere but are wary of any move towards regime change. Iran blocked access to social networks including Telegram and Instagram on Sunday but insisted the move was temporary. On Tuesday the US urged Iran to stop blocking social media and advised its citizens to set up virtual private networks, or VPNs, to circumvent censorship.
One of Iran’s most outspoken MPs, Mahmoud Sadeghi, said on Twitter he had urged the interior ministry not to link the protests with foreign powers, and instead to improve the economic situation, open up state television to diverse opinions and lift restrictions on regime critics. In his latest tweet on the ongoing unrest, Donald Trump praised protesters for acting against Tehran’s “brutal and corrupt” regime. “The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The US is watching!” Trump wrote. Iran’s foreign ministry responded by saying the US president should focus on “homeless and hungry people” in his own country rather than insulting Iranians. A spokeswoman for the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the EU had been touch with authorities in Iran. “We expect that the right to peaceful demonstration and freedom of expression will be guaranteed,” she said."
2018-01-02T19:47:35Z,world,World news,Israel to tell African migrants: leave or face indefinite imprisonment,"Israel is set to inform thousands of Africans who entered the country illegally that they have three months to leave or face indefinite imprisonment. The decision, opposed by rights groups, follows months of speculation over the future of both the migrants and the Holot detention facility in the Negev desert, which the government says it intends to close. There has been often heated debate about the presence of around 40,000 African migrants in Israel, many from Eritrea and Sudan.
It is proposed that migrants who do not have a refugee application pending will receive a notice the next time they are obliged to appear at an interior ministry office to renew their residency permits, telling them to leave Israel or face indefinite imprisonment. Details of the plan were disclosed this week in a statement by Israel’s interior minister, Arye Deri, and the public security minister, Gilad Erdan. They said the migrants would have “two options only: voluntary deportation or sitting in prison.” Critics have pointed out that the option to leave is far from voluntary if the alternative is prison. It is not clear whether Israel’s supreme court, which has intervened in the migrant issue before, will do so again. Most of the migrants arrived in Israel in the second half of the last decade, crossing from Egypt before new security on the border sealed the route. Groups including the Centre for Refugees and Migrants, Amnesty International Israel and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel have signed a letter demanding the expulsions be stopped. “Anyone who has a heart must oppose the expulsion of the refugees,” the letter says. Referring to a widely reported deal to pay Rwanda $5,000 per person to accept migrants, it adds: “Rwanda is not a safe place. All the evidence indicates that anyone expelled from Israel to Rwanda finds himself there without status and without rights, exposed to threats, kidnappings, torture and trafficking.” Rwanda has said it could take as many as 10,000 people. An investigation by the Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, an NGO, found people who had already agreed to leave for Rwanda were vulnerable to a number of threats including imprisonment, violence and extortion. Recently the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, criticised the emerging plan. “The Israeli government’s decision to expel 40,000 African asylum seekers is of great concern,” he said. “Israel has a painful history of migration and exile. New generations must not forget that refugees do not flee out of choice but because they don’t have any other choice.”"
2018-01-02T18:57:04Z,world,World news,YouTube star Logan Paul apologises for film of man's body in Japan,"The celebrity YouTuber Logan Paul has apologised after sparking outrage by posting a video showing the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. The 22-year-old American, who has 15 million subscribers on YouTube, was labelled “disrespectful” and “disgusting” after he joked with his friends about discovering the body in Aokigahara forest, a notorious suicide spot at the base of Mount Fuji. The video, which Paul posted on Sunday, received millions of views before it was removed. Paul and his friends, who are filming from various locations in Japan, reportedly came across the body moments after entering the forest. Their video showed the body of a man, whose identity is unknown, from several angles but blurs his face. A member of the group is heard remarking that he “doesn’t feel good”. Paul replies: “What, you never stand next to a dead guy?” and then laughs.
The exchange, and the decision to upload images of the victim, prompted a wave of criticism online. The Breaking Bad actor Aaron Paul tweeted: “You disgust me. I can’t believe that so many young people look up to you. So sad. Hopefully, this latest video woke them up … Suicide is not a joke. Go rot in hell.” Fellow YouTube star Kandee Johnson said: “Dear @youtube, after the Logan Paul video where he shows a dead body of a suicide victim, uses that for the title, makes heartless jokes next to the body, there needs to b age restrictions for certain creators. How is this allowed on YT? His followers are children! Horrifying.” Paul later apologised to his 3.9 million followers on Twitter: “Where do I begin … Let’s start with this – I’m sorry,” he said. “This is a first for me. I’ve never faced criticism like this before, because I’ve never made a mistake like this before.” He added: “I didn’t do it for views. I get views. I did it because I thought I could make a positive ripple on the internet, not cause a monsoon of negativity. That’s never the intention. I intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention.” But the initial statement was criticised by many, including the Game Of Thrones actor Sophie Turner, who tweeted: “You’re not raising awareness. You’re mocking. I can’t believe how self-praising your ‘apology’ is. You don’t deserve the success (views) you have. I pray to God you never have to experience anything like that man did.” British Labour MP Melanie Onn, who had tweeted that she bought a Logan Paul hoodie as a Christmas present for her 10-year-old son, said the video was “dreadful”, adding: “I can’t believe he was able to put that up without any checks at all.” Paul later issued a second statement of apology. “I want to apologise to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologise to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness or depression or suicide, but most importantly I want to apologise to the victim and his family,” he said. “For my fans who are defending my actions, please don’t – they do not deserve to be defended.” YouTube said Paul’s video violated its policies, but did not respond to calls to suspend him from the site. “Our hearts go out to the family of the person featured in the video,” a YouTube spokeswoman said. “YouTube prohibits violent or gory content posted in a shocking, sensational or disrespectful manner. If a video is graphic, it can only remain on the site when supported by appropriate educational or documentary information and in some cases it will be age-gated.” Aokigahara has gained worldwide notoriety as a suicide spot, with a record 105 bodies reportedly discovered there in 2003. Local police have stopped releasing the number of annual deaths in an attempt to reduce the area’s association with suicide. The forest’s hiking trails are dotted with signs urging those with suicidal thoughts to consider their families and contact a suicide prevention group.
The number of Japanese who kill themselves has fallen in recent years, although the country still has the sixth highest suicide rate in the world. The number of people who took their own lives dropped to 21,897 in 2016 – the lowest level in 22 years – according to government figures. The number rose in the late 1990s and remained just above 30,000 for more than 10 years – a rate experts partly attributed to financial pressures caused by the collapse of the bubble economy in 1992 and the end of lifetime employment. The lack of services for people with mental health problems, as well as debt and serious illness – particularly among elderly people – have also been cited as common causes of suicide in Japan. The figure has remained below 30,000 a year since 2012. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international suicide helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org."
2018-01-02T18:39:21Z,world,World news,Iran protests: how did they start and where are they heading?,"How did the protests start? A relatively small protest on 28 December, in Mashhad, Iran’s second largest city, began a wave of seemingly spontaneous demonstrations that have spread across the country. Officials close to the moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, have blamed supporters of his rival, hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi, who has his base in the city, for starting the protests. Initial chants of “death to Rouhani” soon gave way to harsher slogans targeting the foundations of the Islamic republic, such as “death to the dictator”, in reference to the country’s Raisi-allied supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Who is protesting? The protests, stronger in the provinces than Tehran, appear dominated by members of the working class under-25s who have suffered the most under Iran’s sluggish economy. Observers say the partial lifting of sanctions that followed Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with the west delivered uneven economic benefits to the country. “Middle class fortunes have improved somewhat following the nuclear deal … On the contrary, members of the working class … [have been] very vulnerable,” said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, the founder of the Europe-Iran business forum. What are they calling for and who do they blame? While the protests may have begun over economic grievances, they soon took on a political dimension. Chants have both called on Khamenei to step down and voiced opposition to Iran’s regional policy, including “Let go of Syria, think about us” and “I give my life for Iran, not Gaza, not Lebanon”. Videos posted on social networks show some protesters chanting nostalgic slogans in support of the deposed monarchy and late shah. The tone of the slogans has troubled many reformists, who are critical of hardliners in the Iranian establishment but do not urge the overthrow of the Islamic republic. Another contributing factor could be that although Rouhani was re-elected in a landslide victory last year, with nearly 25m votes, he then took a conservative path and failed to deliver on promises to change the country. How bad is the economy? Inflation is at 12% – albeit down from 40% at the start of Rouhani’s first term in 2013 – and unemployment is high. Youth unemployment is about 40%, more than 3 million Iranians are jobless and the prices of some basic food items, such as poultry and eggs, have recently soared by almost half. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, this is “despite the promise of Hassan Rouhani that the 2015 nuclear deal would help to create jobs and improve people’s living standards”. How do the protests compare to what happened in 2009? The protests are the biggest challenge to Tehran’s leaders since 2009, when the disputed re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to months of unrest amid a bloody crackdown. The protests are bigger in the provinces than in 2009, of a scale rarely seen since the 1979 Islamic revolution, but in Tehran they are so far smaller than the mostly middle class protests of 2009. Most chants during 2009 featured slogans in support of the opposition leaders under house arrest, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, but in the recent protests their names are seldom heard. What do the protests mean for Iran’s reformists? Reformists, silenced and relatively marginalised for over a decade by hardliners, are puzzled how to react. Most senior figures within the reformist camp have remained mute, troubled by calls for regime change, while a number of reformist commentators have come out asking the ruling system to allow peaceful demonstrations but expressing concerns that the recent protests are becoming too radical. Ironically, the ruling establishment now would need the help of the reformists to contain the growing unrest – but some have been sidelined and others, particularly the younger ones, discouraged by a lack of political reform under Rouhani. How has the state handled the protests so far? In the early days of the protests, the authorities largely held back but as the unrest continued and an intervention from Rouhani failed to calm public anger, security forces have taken on a harsher line. According to latest official figures, at least 21 people have died, including a number of security guards, and since Saturday, at least 450 people have been arrested in Tehran alone. Hundreds more have been arrested in provinces. Protesters say they have been hit by teargas but in sharp contrast to their handling of previous unrest, authorities have allowed local media to report on the protests, although many still reflect the official line. A limited number of foreign media still operating in Iran are also allowed to report. What could happen next? It is too soon to say if the protests will continue or peter out as the authorities step up their crackdown. In 2009, months of bloody crackdown ultimately prevailed. As the protesters do not have a leader, many say they lack strategy. Others say Rouhani may capitalise on the unrest and urge the hardliners to open up the political atmosphere, while pessimist reformers think the hardliners have now found a pretext to undermine Rouhani and the moderates, consolidating their power before any vacancy opens for the next supreme leader. Are foreign powers meddling? Iranian authorities have been quick to blame the unrest on foreign powers, accusing Saudi Arabia of direct involvement and claiming Donald Trump’s tweets, which have welcomed the protests, as evidence of enemy involvement. But there is little evidence so far to show that the unrest is being driven from outside, even though Washington and Riyadh have not been shy to say explicitly that they favour regime change and have been doing all at their disposal to purse it. Exiled groups, such as the People’s Mojahedin Organisation of Iran, which is not popular inside Iran, and monarchists, have seized upon the moment and welcomed the protests. One of Iran’s most outspoken MPs, Mahmoud Sadeghi, however, said he had urged the interior ministry not to link protests with foreign powers and instead improve the economic situation, open up state television to diverse opinions and lift restrictions."
2018-01-02T16:29:03Z,world,World news,Trio who used trafficked girls to work in nail bars jailed under slavery laws,"A woman and man who forced children trafficked from Vietnam to work in nail bars in the UK have been jailed under modern slavery legislation. Police say it is the first time a successful prosecution involving children has taken place since the laws were brought in two years ago. The case centres on girls aged under 18 who were smuggled into the UK and compelled to work for little or no money. Thu Huong Nguyen, known as Jenny, and Viet Hoang Nguyen, known as Ken, were found guilty of conspiring to arrange or facilitate the movement of people for labour exploitation and conspiring to require others to perform forced or compulsory labour at Stafford crown court. Jenny, 48, from Bath, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, while Ken, 29, from Burton-upon-Trent, was jailed for four years. A third defendant, Giang Huong Tran, known as Susan, was found guilty of conspiracy to require others to perform forced or compulsory labour. The 23-year-old from Burton-upon-Trent, was given a two-year suspended sentence.
Officers said they believed many more girls and boys were at risk. They hoped the prosecution would send a message to nail bar owners who use children that they would be pursued, as well as alerting customers to the possibility that young people were being exploited. The investigation began when police, immigration officials and staff from the charity Unseen visited nail bars in Bath in February 2016. At the Nail Bar Deluxe premises, in the city centre, they found two Vietnamese girls working on clients’ nails. It emerged they were working 60 hours a week. One was being paid about £30 a month while the second was not paid. They were staying at the four-bedroomed home of the owner, Jenny, in Bath. One lived in a tiny room, while the other slept on a mattress in the attic. Because Jenny was out at the time, officers were able to talk to the girls. DI Charlotte Tucker, who led the operation for Avon and Somerset police, said: “They were extremely vulnerable. They were from impoverished backgrounds in Vietnam and had come to the UK seeking a better life.” The pair were brought into the UK in the back of a lorry. It is not known if they were collected by someone from the nail bar or simply dumped in Bath to seek out Vietnamese people such as Jenny. The nail bar was lucrative. When police raided Jenny’s home, they found £60,000 in £50 notes hidden inside a teddy bear and a cabinet full of designer handbags, some worth thousands of pounds. She also had a string of bedsits in Bath. Tucker said: “She was making a lot of money using cheap or totally free labour. Stashing money away in teddy bears suggests she didn’t know what do with all the cash she was making.”
The teenagers were taken into emergency foster care but ran away. “Unfortunately, this is a common occurrence in trafficking cases, as victims are conditioned to feel reliant on those controlling them and compelled to return to them,” said Tucker. They were re-trafficked but were traced to a nail bar in Abbey Arcade, in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire. Two other victims were found there. Tucker said the girls spoke little English. “They were so vulnerable they had no chance of running away. They were not locked up but had nowhere to go. “We want to get the point across to the public that they are hiding their victims in plain sight. When people go and get their nails done there can be a victim there who comes here for a better life, sometimes with debt bondage connected to families back home. They are trapped here. “In the case of nail bars, warning signs could be very young-looking members of staff, low prices, a rapid turnover of staff or controlling behaviour by senior employees. If you have any suspicions, please contact the police.” The case was run as a “victimless prosecution” – more often used in domestic violence cases where the victim does not necessarily cooperate with the prosecution. “They are so conditioned to believe they are not victims. They didn’t see they had been exploited for gain,” said Tucker.
Donna King, service delivery manager for the charity Unseen, which works with modern slavery survivors, said there were hundreds, possibly thousands, of girls – and boys – being put to work in a similar way. She said many felt they could not defy those exploiting them for reasons ranging from fear of violence to concerns they would be deported because of their immigration status. • The national 24/7 Modern Slavery Helpline is 08000 121 700"
2018-01-02T16:16:54Z,world,World news,Boko Haram says it carried out Christmas attacks in Nigeria,"A leader of the militant group Boko Haram has released a video claiming it carried out a series of attacks in north-east Nigeria over the Christmas period. Abubakar Shekau, the head of one of Boko Haram’s three factions, declared the group active and operational a day after the Nigerian president said the militants had been defeated. “We are in good health and nothing has happened to us,” he said in the video released on Tuesday. “Nigerian troops, police and those creating mischief against us can’t do anything against us, and you will gain nothing. “We carried out the attacks in Maiduguri, in Gamboru, in Damboa. We carried out all these attacks.” There has been a surge in violence in recent months, with dozens of people killed in suicide bombings and attacks on military bases in the region. Authorities have put this down to desperate insurgents trying to find food, weapons and ammunition. Three people were reportedly burned to death on Christmas Day in Molai, a village near Maiduguri, the birthplace of Boko Haram. On Saturday 25 loggers were killed 13 miles from the state capital. It is unclear to which Gamboru attack Shekau was referring, but he may have meant an ambush of an aid convoy on the Gamboru road in which four people were killed. His declaration that the self-styled Islamists are alive and well contradicted the Nigerian president’s new year message which was broadcast the day before. “We have since beaten Boko Haram,” said Muhammadu Buhari. “Isolated attacks still occur, but even the best-policed countries cannot prevent determined criminals from committing terrible acts of terror.” It is unclear why he made such a claim, after his exhortation in 2015 that the Nigerian military had “technically won the war” against Boko Haram was met with derision. In mid-December the government announced it was releasing $1bn from its excess oil account to pay for military equipment and training to fight the insurgency. Later it said not all the money would be spent on fighting Boko Haram alone. Nigeria has recently announced a plan to combat Boko Haram by making villagers living in insecure areas move to garrison towns – although this was in effect how the military operated for most of 2017. It is unclear how villagers who have always made their living farming, herding and fishing will be expected to survive when they are living on lands not their own and are not permitted to leave. It is impossible to build up a clear picture of what exactly is happening in north-east Nigeria and across its borders in Cameroon and Chad. According to a security tracker set up by the Council on Foreign Relations to monitor deaths reported in the media, more than 30,000 people have died in the conflict since May 2011. There are thought to have been large numbers of unreported deaths in inaccessible regions. For the past two years, the Nigerian government has insisted it is winning or has won the war. According to the Nigerian army’s latest pronouncement, 700 Boko Haram captives recently escaped to Monguno, one of the local government areas of Borno state, after military operations in the region. Pouring scorn on declarations of his death or capture, Shekau periodically releases video messages aimed at the government, the Nigerian people or a global audience. In the most notorious of these, he paraded the Chibok girls, a group of 300 schoolgirls kidnapped by his men, and vowed he would “sell them in the market”."
2018-01-02T15:28:51Z,world,World news,Indian doctors protest against plan to let ‘quacks’ practise medicine,"Indian doctors have accused the government of seeking to “sanction quackery” by proposing to allow homeopaths and others trained in alternative remedies to practise conventional medicine after taking a bridging course. Doctors at private hospitals held protests on Tuesday while their counterparts in public facilities wore black armbands in opposition to the proposal, part of a sweeping overhaul of medical governance. Aimed at addressing a severe shortage of doctors, particularly in rural areas, the bill would allow people who dispense Siddha, Ayurvedic and other traditional Indian remedies to practise medicine after taking a course, the length of which is yet to be decided. A similar law already in place in Madhya Pradesh state licenses traditional healers to dispense and prescribe 72 medicines after taking classes for three months. The Indian Medical Association has criticised the plan, saying it will “lead to an army of half-baked doctors in the country”, according to the association’s president, KK Aggarwal. “The government is giving sanction to quackery,” he said. “If those doctors make mistakes and people pay with their lives, who is going to be held accountable?” SS Uttre, the president of the Maharashtra state medical association, said the proposal would dilute medical education and provide a “back-way entry into medicine”. He added: “We are going to oppose it tooth and nail.” Although India has more than 400 medical schools producing tens of thousands of high-quality graduates annually, the country has about 12 doctors, nurses or midwives per 10,000 people – less than half the World Health Organization benchmark. Thousands of graduates each year prefer to take their skills to the US or UK, or are drawn to well-paid jobs in the burgeoning private health industries of big cities such as Delhi or Mumbai.
As a result, research three years ago found more than 2,000 primary health centres around the country lacked even one doctor to treat patients, with shortages of surgeons and specialists even more acute. Many Indians turn instead to traditional remedies such as Ayurveda – treatments prepared according to recipes from ancient Hindu texts – or to “quacks” who present themselves as doctors but lack any medical qualifications. About 57% of purported Indian doctors are thought to fall into the latter category. Similarly, according to a 2014 study, traditional healers already carry out clinical care in as many as one in three primary health centres in rural or tribal areas. To address the shortage, state and federal governments have experimented with licensing non-specialist doctors to carry out caesarean sections or administer anaesthetics. Village social workers and “quack” doctors have also received formal training in basic medicine, while under a health ministry proposal, traditional healers will soon be permitted to deliver babies, carry out non-invasive abortions and treat certain noncommunicable diseases. Ayurveda, yoga and other traditional practices have been championed by the current government, led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, which in 2014 established a ministry to promote alternative remedies. At least 65 Ayurvedic “hospitals” have been established in the past three years, with more planned.
Rules for rigorous testing of Ayurvedic products have also been relaxed or waived, despite the concerns of medical scientists who say there is insufficient evidence to recommend their use in clinical settings. Another state, Gujarat, has sought to alleviate the doctor shortage by equipping some children with stethoscopes and allowing them to administer Ayurvedic treatments for “minor diseases” to their classmates. The government bill under scrutiny also proposes to scrap the doctor-run Medical Council of India and replace it with a new organisation overseen by health officials and free of the taint of corruption allegations, which have dogged the council. Doctors’ groups say the proposed changes are undemocratic and shift power from medical professionals to regulators who are without experience in the field. Medical groups said they would return to work after the government agreed to send the bill to a standing committee in parliament for further examination. Uttre said doctors would fight the proposal for bridging courses in any form and appeal to the supreme court if necessary."
2018-01-02T14:01:50Z,world,World news,Families fear no justice for victims as 31 die in Honduras post-election violence,"Tinsel and colored lights still adorn many houses in Choloma, a gritty manufacturing town near the Caribbean coast of Honduras, but at the home of David Ramos there are no signs of the festive season. “Christmas no longer exists for us: not this year, not any year,” said Ramos as he leafed through freshly printed pictures of his oldest son. José Ramos, 22, was killed by military police officers last month, at a protest over alleged fraud in the country’s presidential election.
The contested results triggered the country’s worst political crisis in a decade and have led to the deaths of at least 30 people, according to the Committee for the Families of the Detained and Disappeared in Honduras (Cofadeh), a human rights group. Most of the victims were opponents of President Juan Orlando Hernández, who they say rigged the vote to beat the opposition candidate, Salvador Nasralla. According to Cofadeh, at least 21 people were killed by the military police, (PMOP), which was originally created to lead the government’s crackdown on violent street gangs. Relatives of the dead say they fear that there will be no justice over post-election violence: some say they have been threatened by troops; others point out that human rights prosecutions involving security forces are overseen by the same taskforce that helps coordinate PMOP operations. Across Honduras, protesters took to the streets after the 26 November election, blocking roads and clashing with security forces who used teargas, water cannon, and live ammunition.
The unrest was most deadly in northern Honduras – particularly around the second city of San Pedro Sula, which overwhelmingly supported Nasralla. Of the 30 deaths documented, 21 were in the north, said Cofadeh. But the total is probably higher. San Pedro Sula’s morgue confirmed that 13 protesters had been killed in the area, and said it had at least six more bodies that “in all likelihood” were related to the protests. “[The death toll] is higher – some people haven’t reported the deaths out of fear; other deaths haven’t been investigated,” said a morgue worker who asked not to be named. Amnesty International has accused the government of deploying “dangerous and illegal tactics to silence any dissenting voices”, while the United Nations and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have denounced torture of detainees in military installations and said they were “alarmed by the illegal and excessive use of force to disperse protests”. But the US-backed government has rejected a request by the Organization of American States (OAS) to send a special delegate to investigate abuses. Honduran officials have downplayed the deaths, claiming gang members are behind protests. At least four other people were killed in the same incident as José Ramos. The PMOP told local press they had shot at a group of armed men, but a cellphone video sent to the Ramos family by a witness tells a different story.
The scene opens with a small group of young men blocking a road, and hurling rocks at a line of what witnesses and local press say were military police officers. José appears briefly with the red flag of the opposition Libre party tied around his shoulders. Then a barrage of gunfire breaks out. The cameraman starts running. José, who had also turned to run, hits the ground. In the footage, none of the protesters is holding a firearm. José is clearly empty-handed. The morgue source said of the five young men killed in the incident, “practically all of them were shot somewhere in the back part of their bodies”. The United States has not responded to the killings, beyond a 22 December statement asking “all Hondurans to refrain from violence” and calling on the military to respect the rights of peaceful protesters. And the Trump government was quick to congratulate Hernández, who has worked closely with Washington to stem migration and drug trafficking. Since 2009, the United States has provided at least $114m in security assistance to Honduras, according to Security Assistance Monitor, a Washington DC-based thinktank. Senior military officials – including the newly appointed head of the military, René Ponce – have received ample training from the US. Ponce – who was appointed amid the post-election crisis on 20 December – has strong ties to both the PMOP and Fusina, the military-led interagency structure through which the military police are largely deployed. While a military commander in San Pedro Sula, Ponce oversaw training and operations of the PMOP force in the area. He was then named head of Fusina in northern Honduras. Ponce has participated in several US training courses, according to local press reports, including an anti-terrorism course at its Joint Special Operations University at MacDill air force base in Florida. While the United States does not directly fund the PMOP or Fusina, units assigned to Fusina can receive US funding and operate alongside the PMOP.
“The United States has a strong incentive to pressure Hernández to cut it out,” said Adam Isacson, a senior associate at the Washington Office on Latin America. “The optics of the US backing a candidate that goes out and massacres a lot the opposition are not great.”
Military police units operating under Fusina have been linked to grave human rights violations, including in the murder of environmental activist Berta Cáceres. However, two days after the election, the US state department certified that Honduras had made progress on improving human rights and fighting corruption, paving the way for millions in security aid to be released. And Fusina also oversees the lawyers responsible for human rights cases involving soldiers, leading many activists to worry there will be no serious investigation of post-election violence. Relatives of some of the victims say they fear reprisals if they speak out. Sandi Mancia’s husband David Quiroz was shot by security forces during a 15 December protest; when she rushed to the hospital to see him, Mancia and her son were threatened by troops. “At the hospital the military police took videos and photos of me and my family. They stood on each side of David’s bed all day and threatened to kill my son when he took a picture of them.” Two human rights groups and an on-duty doctor confirmed that soldiers had harassed the family. Quiroz later died of his wounds. Protests have slowed over the holidays, but local activists say they will pick up again in the new year, particularly ahead of Hernández’s 27 January inauguration. Mariela Hernández, whose brother Cristian was shot and killed by the PMOP on 18 December, says others will continue to fight. “This whole country is in mourning – there are so many killings and no justice. I can’t get my brother back, but the resistance will go on. Juan Orlando is not my president.”"
2018-01-02T13:46:39Z,world,World news,Two members of Germany's far-right party investigated by state prosecutor,"Two delegates of Germany’s far-right party are being investigated by Germany’s state prosecutor over possible incitement to hatred, after one of them accused Cologne police who had tweeted a new year message in Arabic of appeasing “barbaric, gang-raping Muslim hordes of men”. Beatrix von Storch, the deputy leader of Alternative for Germany (AfD), was also temporarily suspended from Twitter and Facebook as a new law forcing social media companies to remove hate speech came into force in Germany on 1 January. A tweet from AfD MP Alice Weidel, the party’s joint leader in the Bundestag, was also blocked by Twitter in Germany. In the message, Weidel criticised Von Storch’s ban, saying: “Our authorities submit to imported, marauding, groping, beating, knife-stabbing migrant mobs.” Cologne police tweeted their new year message in several languages including English, French and Arabic. It wished the people of Cologne and Leverkusen (and everywhere else) a happy new year.
The authorities are considering whether Von Storch and Weidel should be charged with incitement to hatred.. Von Storch’s Twitter account was suspended for 12 hours over her post. Under the new law known as NetzDG, social media firms face fines of up to €50m (£44m) if they do not remove “obviously illegal” hate speech and other postings within 24 hours of receiving a notification. Critics of the law, which was conceived by the Social Democrat-run justice ministry, say it will place censorship decisions that require legal training at the whim of technology companies. Questions have been raised about whether sites such as Twitter will hire enough trained moderators to cope with the expected influx of deletion requests. Digital rights activists, technology companies and political groups including the pro-business Free Democratic party, the Left party and the far-right AfD have been vocal critics of the new law. Returning to Twitter after her ban, Von Storch – who posed with the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage when he endorsed AfD’s election campaign in September – posted in German: “Facebook has now also censored me. This is the end of the constitutional state.”
Cologne’s state prosecutor said it had received “several hundred” criminal complaints against Von Storch. If she is charged and found guilty of incitement to hatred, she could face a fine or a prison sentence of up to three years. A spokesman for Cologne police told Der Spiegel that its investigation into the inflammatory tweets was normal procedure. “If there’s a suspicion that we are dealing with a crime, it is our legal responsibility to act,” he said. Von Storch previously provoked outrage for her social media activity when she answered “yes” in January 2016 to a question on Facebook asking whether firearms should be used against women and children trying to cross the German border. Von Storch, whose grandfather served as finance minister under Hitler, later claimed her computer mouse had slipped."
2018-01-02T12:46:26Z,world,World news,Right to dunk: the children of African immigrants who fought the law to play basketball,"“If wishes were horses, beggars would ride,” says Patrick Edomwaddoba, barely audible over the racket of the Tam Tam basketball team warming up for their fourth match of the season. The Pentecostal pastor watches proudly as the players take part in an exercise drill, neatly passing the ball between themselves in a tight lattice before raining a quick succession of shots towards the hoop. Originally from Nigeria, Edomwaddoba is on the sidelines to watch his two sons, Victor and King, compete against the league leaders in an eagerly anticipated encounter. But the outcome of the game seems of little importance when taking into account the struggles the team has been through in order to participate at all. If anyone understands the notion of having to work hard to be a part of something, it would be Edomwaddoba, who, together with the other parents of the team and the rest of the forgotten community of immigrants who live in the Caserta area of Campania, just north of Naples.
When a former Italian basketball champion, Massimo Antonelli, decided to start the team in the area, he had no idea that within a year they would inadvertently find themselves at the centre of a fierce political debate on what it means to be Italian. Until a month ago, the teenage players of the Tam Tam squad had been denied the right to compete against other teams in the regional league because their parents were immigrants and, as such, considered foreigners in the eyes of the law. In their endeavour to contest the decision to bar them a media storm erupted, disrupting practice and shining a light on Italian attitudes towards immigration and integration.
The Tam Tam team take on rivals Caserta. Below: Destiny, Tam Tam’s playmaker, and below right: Wisdon in action.
It was only last year when a handful of teenagers gathered on a cracked asphalt basketball court in the grounds of an abandoned holiday resort to start training for the first time. Founded in Castel Volturno, an area with 25,000 inhabitants of which 5,000 are registered migrants and many thousands more who are undocumented, the premise of the club is that it should be free to join. Antonelli has relied on support from his basketball peers to donate trainers and organise crowdfunding campaigns to sustain the team. This support helped turn an abandoned sports hall in the area into Tam Tam’s home court as well as purchase a team bus.
Coastline with abandoned houses. Pineta Mare was a residential area built illegally in the 1960s by the Coppola brothers as the “Miami of the Med”, a place where aspiring middle-class Italians could buy a seaside home. A mass of buildings was erected swiftly along the coast. The resort lasted just long enough for the Camorra crime family and politicians to make a fortune. In 1975, it was seized by the state, leaving an abandoned labyrinth of concrete, twisted steel and a vast patch of asphalt where the Tam Tam basketball team would later make their first training ground.
A player’s mother cheers on the team. To begin with, a mixed group showed up from different backgrounds but as the weeks went by players whose parents were born in Italy began to drop out, leaving just those whose parents were born in west Africa. Of those who remained, only two had previously been able to afford costly after-school sports activities. It took an hour to walk to training along the Domiziana dual carriageway, but if this was a deterrent for the “Italians”, the remaining players were not going to be put off. Soon, they were training three times a week and begging the coach for longer and longer sessions. As the winter nights closed in on the outdoor court, the players’ initial interest developed into diehard passion just as Antonelli had hoped. Little did they know the far-reaching consequences their sporting hunger would have.
The team inside a minivan used to travel to games owing to the lack of public transportation. Below: Faisal and Star listen to music. Below right: Wisdon chats on his phone.
As a team ready to compete in local tournaments emerged, Antonelli realised the challenge was not so much winning games but getting around the strict regulations imposed by the Italian Basketball Federation (FIP). The FIP was emphatic: only two foreign players per team. Consequently, when Antonelli tried to enrol his under-14s team in the league, his application was rejected. The young hopefuls were bruised by the exclusion, amplifying their marginalisation in a country still coming to terms with the changing sociodemographics caused by an increase in immigration over the last decade.
Team-mates Honesty and Star walk through the streets before training at the local sport palace. Unlike the UK, the right to citizenship at birth – known legally as jus solis (the right of soil) – is still unapproved in Italy, denying children born of immigrant parents automatic citizenship. As it stands, only upon reaching 18 is it possible to make the long, fastidious and costly application for permanent citizenship and only if the applicant has never left the country for any length of time and has always had “residency” at a fixed address. However, the plight of the Tam Tam team has given face to those that suffer under the legislation and forced the issue back to the top of the political agenda. The debate is intensifying, as the Democratic party (PD) of the prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, had hoped to push through the change in legislation by the end of the year but did not have enough support to win a majority. Luigi Manconi, a DP senator who has accused Italy of “raising children to be half citizens”, has been on hunger strike over lacklustre support in the lead-up to Christmas. Meanwhile, the Northern League leader, Matteo Salvini, has been up and down the country promoting his anti-immigration party’s stance that “kids must prove Italy is their nation only when they become adults”.
Worshippers attend Sunday Pentecostal mass in Castel Volturno. The local African community often gathers on Sundays in places of worship because of a lack of other venues to come together.
Honesty, who is 13 years old, with his family. He and his siblings will have to apply for citizenship when they are 18 because of the ‘temporary’ status of their mother, Osas Fedina. Edomwaddoba has been in Italy for 22 years, jumping through the hoops necessary to obtain official citizenship. This means that his sons Victor and King will face a less difficult time applying for citizenship when they reach 18. However, many children are not so lucky. They inherit their parents’ “temporary” status, which results in an interminable struggle with the Italian state and constant, time-consuming visits to the immigration office to renew their costly residency permits – all while being treated like foreigners. The process is “a never-ending cycle of paperwork, uncertainty and isolation”, says Edomwaddoba despairingly. His players on the other hand just don’t like people thinking they are different. Matthew says it is “totally unjust” that he and others are not considered Italian, while Wisdom says: “If my friends see me as Italian, that means I am Italian.”
The coach gives Tam Tam players a team talk during a game against Caserta. Aside from the Tam Tam basketball team, Castel Volturno is known for two things; a massacre of eight west Africans by the Casalese mafia in 2008 and a vast complex of illegally built apartment blocks and holiday villas, which now lie partially abandoned. The failed holiday resort, known as Villagio Copolla, has served as one of the main attractions in the region for destitute immigrants searching for somewhere to live. The presence of the mafia has meant work can be found in the shadows, while drug trafficking and sex work thrive along the notorious Strada Domiziana. Moreover, since the 1970s nearby tomato farms have provided informal cash-in-hand work. Underpaid and overworked, these immigrant workers are known to prop up Italy’s agro-economy. In an area where parents struggle to make ends meet and with no other opportunities for young people to distract themselves aside from the local Caritas community centre, the Tam Tam team has emerged as an important project for younger members of Castel Volturno’s immigrant community.
One of the Tam Tam coaches, Andrea, helps the players with their shooting. In October Antonelli took the team’s plight to the authorities, using his sporting reputation to attract media attention which in turn applied the necessary pressure for the issue to be debated in parliament. He pushed Italy’s International Olympic Committee (Coni) to make a legal exemption so the team could play this season. By mid-November the players were on the court in match kit. However, the key to the triumph lies hidden within the dense Legge di Bilancio (public finance law). On 21 December parliament passed a small but significant bill entitled Save Tam Tam basketball team, changing sporting regulations so that all children born in Italy to “foreign parents” will be allowed to compete officially from 1 January. Some may reach the top of sport, perhaps like the Italian football international Mario Balotelli, who was born in Italy to Ghanaian parents but was only able to obtain full citizenship at 18. He too has had his “Italian-ness” questioned by the media even when he was the lead striker for Italy. The new legislation is one decisive move that may go towards a more inclusive society, but with the more far-reaching reforms to jus soli still yet to be approved, the government of Gentiloni still has a long way to go in making the estimated 1 million “new Italian” children, as the media have called them, feel at home.

Ask Tam Tam player Kessy why he loves basketball so much and the 13-year-old says it makes him forget everything and feel free. Such sentiments point to sport’s capacity to heal and to build confidence, empowering young people as they prepare for adult life. However, the Northern League continues to exploit the growing immigration crisis in Italy by blocking legislative changes that would help safeguard the next generation. The party has sought to conflate and muddle the differences between immigrants who have just arrived and those born in the country. For the latter, this poses an impending challenge: they live and feel just as Italian as their peers but are not treated so by law or by society.

2018-01-02T11:50:22Z,world,World news,"I was asking about Bom-Del flight, says man charged with Mumbai bomb threat","An Indian businessman charged with making a bomb threat at a Mumbai airport claims he was misheard by a telephone operator while asking for the “Bom-Del status” – the status of his Bombay-to-Delhi flight. Vinod Moorjani was arrested at Mumbai international airport on Sunday while waiting to board a flight to Delhi with his family. The airport has the city code BOM, because Mumbai was formerly known as Bombay. Police allege that Moorjani, 45, was frustrated with flight delays and used a phone booth in the airport to call its toll-free number, warning the operator “bomb fata hai” – a bomb has exploded. He then immediately hung up. Investigators claim he made the threat in order to delay all outbound flights from Delhi so he would not miss a connecting flight to Rome, according to Press Trust of India. Moorjani has appeared in court charged with criminal intimidation and other offences. But court officials told Indian media he had pleaded innocent to the charges. His lawyer argued he had merely called the operator to enquire about the status of the flight, asking for the “Bom-Del status”, and had hung up because of a disturbance on the line.
In April 2016, a flight from Ahmedabad to Mumbai was delayed for nearly four hours when a cleaner found a ticket reading “bomb” in a passenger pouch. Authorities detained the man who had flown in the seat but released him soon after, reportedly concluding that check-in staff had scrawled the passenger’s seat number, B-47, on the ticket beside the code for Mumbai, BOM. In November, another flight was delayed in Chennai after making an emergency stop in the city when an Iranian woman discovered mid-air that her husband was having an affair. The woman used her husband’s thumb while he was sleeping to unlock his phone, where she found pictures of another woman. Staff were unable to calm her and elected to land the plane midflight and offload the entire family. Moorjani was released on bail of 30,000 rupees (£348)."
2018-01-02T08:15:17Z,world,World news,Africa heads in different directions â€“ politically and economically,"African leaders will meet in Addis Ababa at the end of January to discuss the good news and the bad across the continent. The 30th summit of the African Union will take place under the slogan “Towards a peaceful, prosperous and integrated Africa”. The objective is a laudable one, but still distant. Alex Vines of the London thinktank Chatham House says that the watchwords of 2018 will not be “Africa rising”, now broadly seen as overly optimistic, but “Africa diverging” – politically and economically. “The different paths that different parts of the continent are taking will be ever more apparent. So you’ll have something pretty hopeless in central Africa and more positive trajectories in southern and western Africa. A general trend is the continued decline of longstanding leaders,” Vines said.
When Yahya Jammeh of Gambia refused to submit to the results of a general election that ended his 21-year rule in 2016, pressure from Senegal, Liberia and Nigeria forced him to step down. The example was noted elsewhere – as was the fall of Robert Mugabe after 37 years and the departure of José Eduardo Dos Santos in Angola after four decades. Many other long-standing rulers are looking increasingly fragile. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where unrest, humanitarian need and economic decline are likely to intensify through 2018, Joseph Kabila, now in his 16th year of power, may be forced to hold elections and even to stand down. “He may be gone by the end of the year or about to go. He’s a rich man but not a strong man. He’s in place partly because the Kinshasa elite can’t work out who they want to be his successor,” said Vines.
One early upset could be the premature end of Jacob Zuma’s second term as president of South Africa. Theoretically in office until 2019, the election of Cyril Ramaphosa at the end of 2017 as leader of the ruling African National Congress, after a contentious party conference vote, may force him to step down. On the security front, tens and possibly hundreds of millions of people remain at risk of famine and related diseases such as cholera, while huge numbers are likely to be displaced. The DRC is now one of the biggest humanitarian crises in the world. Rather than bringing stability, the prospect of elections in Libya and South Sudan are expected to exacerbate tensions and fuel violence, according to a recent report by Acaps, a non-profit venture that supports humanitarian aid workers with daily monitoring and analysis of 150 countries. “If 2017 did not look good, predictions for 2018 are no better: violence and insecurity are likely to deteriorate in ...Democratic Republic of Congo, Libya, Ethiopia, Mali, Somalia,” the Acaps director, Lars Peter Nissen wrote.
But even in countries facing massive humanitarian crises there are places – often towns – that are doing better. The north-east of Nigeria has been devastated by the ongoing insurgency of Boko Haram, the Islamist militant movement. Yet Lagos is booming. A key emerging trend that is likely to be reinforced in 2018 is Africa’s growing status as a frontline in the fight against Islamist extremism. The US military has ramped up its presence across a swathe of the continent from the Lake Chad basin to the Horn and has intensified operations. These are likely to lead to increased casualties among all involved – US special forces, civilians and the militants. French troops and tens of thousands operating under the authority of the United Nations or the African Union will also continue operations that at best are just about containing the spread of groups linked both to al-Qaida and the Islamic State. Few are optimistic that such efforts will dramatically improve the situation. Jihadist groups exploit opportunities provided by weak governance, said Stephanie Wolters, head of the peace and security research programme at the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria. “Insurgency, migration, trafficking, banditry all stem from the absence of a strong state that is delivering services to its people,” Wolters said. Political and ethnic as well as religious violence across the continent have been rising since historic lows several years ago.
Not all is linked to extremist religious ideologies. Conflict between pastoralists and sedentary communities is likely to continue to intensify, exacerbated by climate change. East Africa is likely to suffer from extreme weather events, notably drought. The flow of migrants within Africa, or towards Europe, is unlikely to slow. “Propping up heads of state who say they will crack down on terrorism or migration when these are the kinds of rulers and government which drive people to extreme measures like migration or joining a jihadi group is not a strategy that is going to bring results,” said Wolters. There will be divergence, too, on the economic front. Growth in sub-Saharan Africa overall is forecast to rise to 3.4% in 2018 but with wide variations. Political uncertainty has held growth back in the biggest economies on the continent. Ghana is tipped by the World Bank as the fastest growing economy in Africa next year, followed by Ethiopia and Tanzania. A final divergence may be in relations with external powers. Washington’s interest in Africa is minimal, with scores of top official policy-making and ambassadorial posts still unfilled. China, though its attitudes and interventions are frequently misrepresented, retains a strong focus on the continent. France is likely to try to expand outside its traditional sphere of influence – as signalled by President Emmanuel Macron in November. The UK will look to historic ties in places like Zimbabwe or Nigeria to project influence post-Brexit, though it may find imperial nostalgia or the advantages of the anglosphere have less attraction in Bulawayo or Abuja than in Tunbridge Wells."
2018-01-02T08:04:06Z,world,World news,South Korea offers to hold talks with North after Olympics olive branch,"South Korea has proposed holding high-level talks with North Korea next week, a day after the regime’s leader, Kim Jong-un, said he was prepared to send a delegation of athletes to next month’s Winter Olympics in the South Korean town of Pyeongchang. In a cautious indication of progress in inter-Korean relations after a year of tensions over Pyongyang’s ballistic missile programme, South Korea’s unification minister, Cho Myoung-gyon, said the offer reiterated “our willingness to hold talks with the North at any time and place, and in any form”. Cho proposed that the two Koreas meet next Tuesday at the border village of Panmunjom, where they last held high-level talks in December 2015. “We hope that the South and North can sit face to face and discuss the participation of the North Korean delegation at the Pyeongchang Games, as well as other issues of mutual interest for the improvement of inter-Korean ties,” Cho told reporters in Seoul, according to Yonhap news agency.
“We think that the suspended inter-Korean communication channels should be immediately restored. We propose that the two Koreas discuss details of talks including agenda items and the composition of delegations ... at the truce village.” North Korea has yet to respond to the offer, and the US president, Donald Trump, said on Tuesday he was withholding judgement on the offer to talk. “Sanctions and ‘other’ pressures are beginning to have a big impact on North Korea. Soldiers are dangerously fleeing to South Korea. Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time. Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not – we will see!” Trump wrote in a tweet. The Pyeongchang Games will be held 50 miles (80km) south of the heavily armed border that has separated the two Koreas since their three-year conflict ended in a truce in 1953. In his New Year’s Day address on Monday, Kim said he hoped the Olympics would be a success and offered to send a delegation to Pyeongchang. He said the Games would be “a good opportunity to display the status of the Korean nation, and we sincerely wish that the event will be held with good results”, adding: “We are prepared to take various steps, including the dispatch of a delegation.” The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, a liberal who favours engagement with Pyongyang, has encouraged North Korea’s participation in the Games, believing its presence could lower tensions on the peninsula. Last month, he suggested that the US and South Korea could postpone joint military drills until after the Games as a gesture of goodwill to North Korea, where the exercises are viewed as rehearsals for an invasion. Moon said on Tuesday that Kim’s conciliatory tone was a “positive response” to Seoul’s desire to see the Pyeongchang Games become a “groundbreaking opportunity for peace”. He added, however, that any Olympics discussions must proceed alongside talks on North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, three months after the regime conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test. “The improvement of relations between North and South Korea cannot go separately with resolving North Korea’s nuclear programme,” Moon said at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Some analysts believe Kim is attempting to drive a wedge between Moon and Trump, who has warned that he is considering all options, including military action, to address the threat from North Korea’s nuclear programme. Evans Revere, a former senior US diplomat who took part in unofficial talks with North Korean officials last year, said Pyongyang was likely to attempt to win concessions in exchange for taking part in the Olympics. “It is hard to imagine Seoul falling for this,” Revere said, noting that Kim’s speech made clear he expected North Korea to be regarded as a bona fide nuclear state. “Implicit in Kim Jong-un’s speech is a willingness to engage with others, including the United States, on the basis of their acceptance of the ‘reality’ of North Korea’s permanent nuclear status,” he added. “That’s not a basis on which the United States is prepared to engage.”
It is not clear what form North Korean participation in the Games would take. The figure skating pair Ryom Tae-ok and Kim Ju-Sik were the country’s only athletes to qualify for Pyeongchang, but missed their event’s registration deadline at the end of October. Reports said the pair could still be invited to compete by the International Olympic Committee."
2018-01-02T06:30:32Z,world,World news,Gunmen kill 14 churchgoers after services in Nigeria,"Gunmen killed at least 14 churchgoers returning from midnight services on Monday in Nigeria’s Rivers State, a police source said, after the latest violence to hit the oil-rich region. “The gunmen opened fire on a set of worshippers at about 12.30am on Monday,” said Ugochi Olugbo, a relative of one of the victims who were attending a New Year’s Eve service.
The Nigeria Independent reported gunmen operated at two different locations, the Kirigani and Oboh axis of Aligu, Omoku, in a coordinated attack on Christians returning from church services. “Fourteen persons died on the spot, while 12 who sustained gunshot wounds were rushed to the hospital and are receiving medical attention,” said a police source who asked to remain anonymous. Rivers State police public relations officer Nnamdi Omoni could not confirm the number of casualties. “The commissioner of police, Ahmed Zaki, has also launched a manhunt for the bandits to ensure they are arrested and prosecuted,” Omoni said. “The deputy commissioner of police in charge of operation and other tactical heads have been mobilised there to restore peace.” Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"
2018-01-01T18:14:19Z,world,World news,Palestinian girl filmed slapping Israeli soldier is charged with assault,"A 16-year-old Palestinian girl who was arrested after being filmed slapping an Israeli soldier has been charged with assaulting security forces, incitement and throwing stones. The video of Ahed Tamimi – which went viral on social media two weeks ago – prompted competing reactions from Israelis and Palestinians, including a campaign for her release. Her father, Bassem Tamimi, called it a “political trial”, saying Israel had dug up old incidents to “justify her arrest”. Ahed’s mother, Nariman Tamimi, who allegedly livestreamed the incident on social media, was also charged with incitement and assault. The footage showing Ahed, Nariman and a cousin, 21-year-old Nur Tamimi, physically confronting the soldier – who did not respond – led to the teenager being hailed as a hero by Palestinians, who saw her as standing up to Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. According to the charges, Ahed pushed a number of soldiers and told them, “Get out or I’ll punch you,” before kicking and slapping them.
Ahed and her mother were charged in relation to the incident and to remarks broadcast in the immediate aftermath, in which Nariman asked her daughter to give a message to the world. According to the prosecution, Ahed said she hoped “everyone will participate in the protests”, in comments that the prosecution claims also endorsed violence. At the centre of concerns over the case against Ahed are fears that she has been singled out for “embarrassing the occupation”, as well as the use of the military courts system to deal with a minor. Some anti-occupation activists have sought to compare Ahed to Malala Yousafzai or have referred to her as the West Bank’s Joan of Arc, celebrating her as a youthful symbol of “Palestinian resistance”. But on the Israeli side there have been accusations that her family were using the teenager in staged provocations for the cameras, as well as calls for her to face stiff punishment. At the centre of the rival narratives is the fact that Ahed has long been a familiar figure at demonstrations in the West Bank village of Nabi Saleh. She was photographed two years ago scuffling with another Israeli soldier; that image also went viral. Before the hearing, Ahed’s lawyer, Gaby Lasky, told journalists the charges related to six different incidents. In an op-ed piece for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Bassem Tamimi – a well-known activist who has spent time in prison – portrayed his daughter as a “freedom fighter”.
“My daughter is just 16 years old,” he wrote. “In another world, in your world, her life would look completely different. In our world, Ahed is a representative of a new generation of our people, of young freedom fighters.” He continued: “Ahed is one of many young women who in the coming years will lead the resistance to Israeli rule. She is not interested in the spotlight currently being aimed at her due to her arrest, but in genuine change.” The Israeli right has been equally forthright. The prominent Jerusalem Post commentator Caroline B Glick wrote: “In a very real sense, the Tamimi family is at the nexus of a global war against Israel. “The Tamimis have connections with nearly every government and group involved in that war. The Israeli and American Left, the EU, Jordan and Turkey and of course Hamas and the PLO all support them.” The case has raised complex questions over the prominent role of minors in Palestinian activism, not least in violent confrontations with Israeli security forces. Concerns have also been raised over the treatment of minors in the Israeli military court system, and how the media – both local and international – interpret such images from the conflict."
2018-01-01T17:56:01Z,world,World news,Dubai Frame: UAE's latest surreal landmark frames a controversy,"Home to the tallest skyscraper, the largest shopping mall and the longest driverless metro system in the world, Dubai adds another superlative to the list this week: it can now admire all its world record-breaking trophies through the biggest picture frame on the planet. Rising 150 metres above Zabeel Park, encrusted with swirling golden motifs that glisten in the desert sunshine, the Dubai Frame has finally opened almost a decade after it was first designed. For 50 dirhams (£10), visitors are treated to an immersive exhibition of the emirate’s history, before taking an elevator to a 93-metre long viewing gallery at the top of the frame, where they can walk along a precipitous glass-floored walkway and enjoy views back to the old city of Deira to the north and the teetering towers of Sheikh Zayed Road to the south. A neon-lit “vortex” tunnel then transports visitors to an interactive exhibition on the future of Dubai, with augmented reality displays offering glimpses of the UAE 50 years from now. It all has the feeling of an Expo pavilion, which is fitting given that the entire building is smothered with the patterned golden livery of Dubai’s Expo 2020 brand – making it a 50-storey billboard for the forthcoming extravaganza. The Frame is one of the more surreal silhouettes to have appeared on the city’s busy skyline in recent years, standing as a slender hollow rectangle visible for miles around, as an outline awaiting its content. Its pared-back rectangular form makes it difficult to discern its scale. From some angles it looks like an empty roadside hoarding stripped of its advertisement; from others like a gargantuan triumphal arch, pimped-up to the max. With the temporary air of a scaffolding structure, some locals have asked when it’s actually going to be finished and filled in with floors. It has already become a popular backdrop for selfies, providing a glitzy #nofilter border to countless couples’ romantic poses in Zabeel Park. But the building has proven controversial for other reasons. The 50-storey portal may be the tallest picture frame in the world, but its architect wants to add another title to the stats: for him, it is the biggest stolen building of all time.
“They took my project, changed the design and built it without me,” says Fernando Donis, the Mexican architect whose frame proposal won an international competition in 2008 for a “tall emblem structure to promote the new face of Dubai”. Organised by the German elevator company Thyssen Krupp in collaboration with the International Union of Architects (UIA), a Unesco-affiliated organisation that ran the competitions for the Sydney Opera House and the Pompidou Centre in Paris, the contest received over 900 entries from across the globe. Some questioned the need for another high-rise emblem, given that Dubai is famously home to a bristling thicket of mirrored-glass shafts, from the soaring Burj Khalifa, to a pair of golden doppelgängers of New York’s Chrysler building, to towers crowned with pyramids, spires and orbs. In this global capital of landmark buildings, the challenge was to make a new kind of landmark that would stand out from the crowd. Donis was well placed to rise to the challenge. While working for Rem Koolhaas at OMA in Rotterdam, he had designed a number of “anti-iconic” projects for Dubai, including an unrealised scheme for a monolithic plain white rectangular block named the Renaissance, whose professed aim was “to end the current phase of architectural idolatry”. For the 2008 competition, Donis took it a step further. “Instead of another massive structure,” he says, “I proposed a void. Something that would frame all the other landmarks.” Conceived at the height of Dubai’s light-headed bubble, as islands in the shape of the world were being sold on the eve of the global financial crisis, his winning design was a stroke of minimalist brilliance. It was an impossibly slender white frame, standing apart from the surrounding cacophony of novelty silhouettes, yet containing them all. It had the stark clarity of a Sol LeWitt sculpture, a scaleless outline wrought in concrete and steel that would change its aspect from different vantage points around the city. The architect received his $100,000 prize and was flown to Dubai to be feted at a dinner with the crown prince, but he says that shortly thereafter he received a contract from the Dubai municipality that limited his involvement to an advisory role. It demanded that he hand over his intellectual property, never visit the construction site and never promote the project as his own work, while the municipality could terminate the agreement at any point. Donis says he refused to sign it, so they hired Hyder Consulting, a branch of Dutch engineering giant Arcadis, and went ahead without him. “It is an act of supreme arrogance,” says Edward Klaris, a New York-based lawyer who filed a lawsuit on behalf of the architect in the United States federal court last year, to no avail. “The United Arab Emirates puts itself out there as a country that respects intellectual property, yet it will blatantly infringe copyright. The Dubai legal system makes it impossible to sue the municipality unless the municipality gives you authority to sue them. They give themselves sovereign immunity against any lawsuit.” The municipality has been contacted by the Guardian several times over the past year, but has so far declined to comment, nor allow access to the site. In a letter to Donis, Thyssen Krupp said the situation amounted to “a commercial disagreement” and that the company “does not have any possibility to interfere”. In a statement to the Guardian, the UIA said: “All UIA-endorsed competitions are required to adhere to the principles embodied in the Unesco regulations [which protect intellectual property]. Nevertheless, the UIA cannot legally intervene in the aftermath of a competition.” Donis, whose practice is now working on a number of high-rise projects across Mexico, has not returned to Dubai, but he has been following the progress of the frame via social media. “It is fantastic to see it materialised,” he says. “It seems to work on the skyline exactly as we proposed. Of course we would like it to have been much more subtle, with less décor, but it does precisely what I wanted. I just would have loved to be part of it.”"
2018-01-01T17:43:38Z,world,World news,Time's Up: Hollywood women launch campaign to fight sexual harassment,"Three hundred female Hollywood actors, agents, writers, directors, producers and entertainment executives – including Natalie Portman, Emma Stone and Reese Witherspoon – are kicking off the new year with a coordinated effort to counter systemic sexual harassment in the entertainment business and US workplaces.
The initiative, announced with a full-page ad in the New York Times, includes a $13m legal defense fund to help women in less privileged professions protect themselves from sexual misconduct and the consequences that may arise from reporting it. Entitled Time’s Up, the programme was launched with an open letter signed by hundreds of women in show business, including Ashley Judd, Eva Longoria, America Ferrera, Rashida Jones and Kerry Washington, as well as powerful backroom Hollywood figures, including producer Shonda Rhimes, whose credits include Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal. “The struggle for women to break in, to rise up the ranks and to simply be heard and acknowledged in male-dominated workplaces must end; time’s up on this impenetrable monopoly,” part of the letter reads. “If this group of women can’t fight for a model for other women who don’t have as much power and privilege, then who can?” Rhimes told the New York Times.
In a sense, Time’s Up is being launched as a companion to the #MeToo movement that grew out of the spontaneous response to revelations about Hollywood’s “casting-couch” system of sexual predation and enduring gender-pay disparities. While attention has largely focused on show business and the media, Time’s Up seeks to include the plight of working-class women. The organization arose from informal gatherings of female talent agents in Los Angeles who starting meeting after the issue of sexual harassment landed like a bombshell on the entertainment industry in October. The group rapidly expanded and now includes meetings and workshops for participants in New York and London. Organizers said they were moved to broaden the effort after receiving an open letter on behalf of 700,000 female farmworkers in November. The initiative’s goals also include promoting legislation to penalize companies that tolerate persistent harassment, and to fight against the use of non-disclosure agreements to shield sexual abusers. Organizers also plan to ask women walking the red carpet at the Golden Globes this year to wear black. “This is a moment of solidarity, not a fashion moment,” actor Eva Longoria, who rose to fame in Desperate Housewives, told the paper.
“For years, we’ve sold these awards shows as women, with our gowns and colors and our beautiful faces and our glamour,” Longoria added. “This time the industry can’t expect us to go up and twirl around. That’s not what this moment is about.” Beyond the symbolism of red carpet fashion, Time’s Up’s legal defense operation will be administered by the National Women’s Law Center’s Legal Network for Gender Equity which connects victims of sexual harassment with legal representation. Donors include Witherspoon, Meryl Streep, Steven Spielberg and wife Kate Capshaw, and leading talent agencies that are under pressure to reform their practices in the aftermath of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Witherspoon told the New York Times the organization, which was founded in October, offered an opportunity for women to join forces in an industry that has typically been run by men. “We’re finally hearing each other, and seeing each other, and now locking arms in solidarity with each other, and in solidarity for every woman who doesn’t feel seen, to be finally heard,” Witherspoon said. While Time’s Up plans to structure itself as a decentralized organization with no formal hierarchy but established traditions, it plans to forge alliances with similarly focused organizations, among them 50/50 by 2020, a group that aims for equal representation in US boardrooms by 2020. Producer and legal defense fund donor Katie McGrath said that many women had realized from early on that they needed to establish what they wanted to achieve, “and what was going to be required in order to shift and pivot from this horror to structural change”."
2018-01-01T17:00:01Z,world,World news,'Nothing but lies and deceit': Trump launches Twitter attack on Pakistan,"Donald Trump has accused Pakistan of “lies and deceit”, saying America was foolish to have given Islamabad more than $33bn in aid. Trump began the new year by launching an attack on Islamabad in his first tweet of 2018, saying Pakistan was providing “safe haven to the terrorists we hunt”. “The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools,” he wrote. “They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!” The tweet on Monday comes in the aftermath of heightened tensions between Washington and Islamabad since the summer, when the US president announced his administration’s national security strategy for Afghanistan. As part of the “fight-to-win” strategy Trump called on Islamabad to cut support for militants who find a haven along the Afghan border and warned Pakistan would have “much to lose” if it did not comply. “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,” he said in a speech. In a surprise visit to Afghanistan last month, the US vice-president, Mike Pence, said the US administration was putting Pakistan on notice to end its support for Taliban insurgents, a comment that generated a chorus of criticism from the Pakistani civilian and military establishment, which has denied harbouring Afghan militants. The New York Times reported last week that the Trump administration was considering withholding $255m in aid to Pakistan over Islamabad’s failure to confront terrorism in the country. Pakistan had refused to allow the US access to a captured militant from the Taliban-linked Haqqani network. The militant was arrested in October by Pakistani troops as they rescued a Canadian-American couple who had been held captive for five years, and the US believe he could provide important information about other American hostages in Afghanistan. Pakistan’s foreign minister, Khawaja Asif, told Geo television on Monday that Pakistan has already refused to “do more” for the United States. “We have already told the US that we will not do more, so Trump’s ‘no more’ does not hold any importance. He tweeted: “We will respond to President Trump’s tweet shortly inshallah ... Will let the world know the truth … difference between facts & fiction.” The prime minister of Pakistan, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, told the Guardian: “We have called a cabinet meeting on this issue tomorrow.” Hamdullah Mohib, Afghanistan’s ambassador in Washington, said in a tweet on Monday that Trump’s tweet was a “promising message to Afghans who have suffered at the hands of terrorists based in Pakistan for far too long”. Pakistan maintains that it has continued a military operation to push out terrorists from its territory and that 17,000 Pakistanis have lost their lives in fighting militants, target killings and suicide bombings since 2001. “America’s stance is clear and it will deteriorate relations further, the US is shifting blame of its failures in Afghanistan on Pakistan,” Zahid Husain, an analyst based in Islamabad, said. In November, the White House condemned Pakistan’s release of Hafiz Saeed, who was accused of masterminding the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people in the Indian financial hub."
2018-01-01T14:13:54Z,world,World news,More protesters killed in Iran as Rouhani's plea fails to dampen unrest,"At least 12 people have died in clashes between protesters and security guards in Iran since protests erupted across the country last week, officials said on Monday, as an intervention by the president failed to quell public anger. Protesters defied warnings by the authorities to stay away or be confronted with an “iron fist” as demonstrations, in scenes that are increasingly becoming violent, continued on Sunday evening for the fourth day, hours after the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, acknowledged discontent.
The demonstrations began on Thursday after opponents of the moderate president gathered in north-eastern Iran, but soon spread nationwide, escalating from initial demands over economic grievances and taking on a political dimension. At least two people were killed in the city of Izeh, in Khuzestan province, during protests on Sunday night, according to its member of parliament, who claimed it was not clear which side fired the shots. Two others were killed in Lorestan province. There were turbulent scenes in a number of cities across Iran, including the capital, Tehran, Karaj, Tuyserkan, Hamedan, Arak, Saveh, Amol, Sari and Qazvin. Officials said on Monday 10 people died during protests on Sunday night and at least 400 people had been arrested over the past five days. Videos posted on social networks appeared to show riot police becoming more confrontational. Similarly, protesters are seen attacking government buildings and shattering windows in an escalation of the unrest.
Protests continued on Monday evening for a fifth day. Anti-riot police riding on motorbikes and wielding batons were unleashed on the streets of Tehran, observers said. Similar scenes were reported in other cities. The semi-official Tasnim news agency, close to the elite Revolutionary Guards, reported that one police officer was shot dead in the city of Najafabad, in Isfahan province on Monday night. The agency claimed he was killed by one of the protesters. Rouhani spoke with a number of parliamentarians on Monday in a meeting officials insisted was planned before the protests began. The president said: “Not all protesters are receiving orders from foreign powers, some are ordinary people who have come to streets because of their problems and sentiments.” The president said people wanted Iran’s political atmosphere to open up, but was adamant the Islamic republic would endure the turmoil without much difficulty. “People will confront a minority and a small group who are chanting slogans against the law and the will of people and insulting sanctities and revolutionary values, destroying public properties,” he said. A day earlier, in his first public comments on the protests, Rouhani acknowledged discontent in a video aired on state television, saying people had constitutional right to hold protests and criticise. But he also warned that criticism was “different from violence, destruction of public property”. The president added: “Based on the constitution and citizenship rights, people are completely free in expressing criticisms and even their protests, but at the same time, we must pay attention to the way in which criticism and protest should be made to lead to better conditions for the country and people’s lives.” Rouhani denounced comments made by the US president, Donald Trump, who tweeted on Sunday: “The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism.”
Rouhani said Trump had no right to express sympathy with Iranians because “a few months ago, he called the Iranian nation terrorist” and was “against the Iranian nation from head to toe”. Trump again tweeted on Monday, saying Iran was “failing at every level” as he reiterated his support for the protesters. “Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!” The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said the UK was “watching events in Iran closely” and “people should be able to have freedom of expression and to demonstrate peacefully within the law”. He added : “We regret the loss of life that has occurred in the protests in Iran, and call on all concerned to refrain from violence and for international obligations on human rights to be observed.” The scale and the speed at which the protests have spread across Iran has puzzled many in the country, including reformists who are critical of the country’s political atmosphere, but are wary of any move towards regime change. Iran blocked access to social network sites including Telegram and Instagram on Sunday, but insisted the move was temporary. In contrast to their previous handling of such protests, Iranian officials appeared to be more conciliatory, at least towards some groups of protesters, acknowledging that they have legitimate economic grievances. The head of Iran’s judiciary, Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani, a hardline cleric, said: “Attacking mosques, public buildings, banks, is unacceptable.” He vowed the perpetrators would be prosecuted."
2018-01-01T13:03:22Z,world,World news,"Archbishop: use new year to focus on compassion, not horror","People can choose whether to be defined by the horrors and difficulties of today’s world or the compassionate response of communities coming together, the archbishop of Canterbury has said in his new year message. Justin Welby delivered his message for 2018 from the London ambulance service’s special operations centre, which responds to major incidents in the capital. Its staff took hundreds of calls from members of the public caught up in the London Bridge and Borough Market terrorist attack in June. As well as atrocities and tragedies in London and Manchester in 2017, “all over the world we witnessed the horror and devastation caused by terrorism”, Welby said. He recalled the “desperation and sorrow” he witnessed when visiting Grenfell Tower on the day of the fire. “Then there are those whose suffering will never make the news,” he said. “People who are struggling to find work or relying on food banks. Those who are bereaved, or coping with poor mental health or physical illness.” In such difficult times, “there are often questions which hang in the air: is there any light at all? Does anyone care?” Recalling the words of the Bible, “the light shone in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it”, Welby spoke of the light of resilience, heroism and compassion. “We see [this light] in the faces of the hundreds of volunteers who turned out after Grenfell, simply to help strangers in need,” the archbishop said. “We see it in the heroism of the ambulance crews, police, fire service and security forces. I will never forget the image of a group of unarmed police officers sprinting flat-out towards Borough Market, as so many people were running in the opposite direction.” In the past year, “the depth of suffering was matched by a depth of compassion as communities came together”. People could choose which stories defined them, he said. “The horror? Or the response? The darkness, or the light?” Welby’s message was broadcast on BBC One at 1pm on Monday."
2018-01-01T11:00:08Z,world,World news,"In gay-friendly Palm Springs, America's first all-LGBT government is no surprise","Palm Springs has just ushered in America’s first all-LGBT city council and this is what it’s doing to celebrate: nothing. No rainbow flag over city hall, no pride parade, no proclamation about making history, not even a press release. In fact it has barely acknowledged the milestone. “Tell the truth, I didn’t even think about it until after the election,” the mayor, Robert Moon, 68, said in an interview this month as the new council prepared to convene. “You see, it doesn’t really matter. It’s not an issue here.” The struggle for gay and transgender rights, in other words, has so triumphed in this wealthy desert oasis it sees little remarkable about electing three gay men, a transgender woman and a bisexual woman, all Democrats, to its five-member council.
A precedent-setting event which might elicit cheers and controversy elsewhere unfolded in this picturesque corner of California’s Coachella valley with a shrug and some bemusement at national and international interest. “The reaction in Palm Spring was very much, OK, so?” said Geoff Kors, a council member. “People are simply judged on their merits.” The real victory, he and other council members said, was not that LGBT candidates swept the election but that they did so with barely a mention of sexual orientation or gender identity. Voters cared more about policing, homelessness and roads.
“There is no gender associated with potholes,” said Lisa Middleton, 65, the newly elected transgender council member, who was still unpacking belongings in her office. The former auditor was more passionate about road repairs than identity politics. “If the street is not well paved you’re not going to be happy. It doesn’t matter what party you are.”
Nationally, it can be another story. Donald Trump’s administration has sought to fire up the president’s conservative base by rescinding Obama-era rights for transgender students and attempting to ban transgender troops in the military. Roy Moore, Alabama’s defeated Senate candidate, threatened to bring an atavistic view of homosexuality to Washington DC. Palm Springs, a 47,000-strong community which boasts fine dining, galleries and mid-century architecture, feels like a parallel universe.
Sexual orientation did surface in last month’s city council election, but in a very Palm Springs way: one candidate, Christie Holstege, 31, who is married to a man, was accused of pretending to be bisexual in order to curry voters’ favour. She insisted she was, and won, becoming the second new council member, alongside Middleton. “Only in Palm Springs would it be claimed that someone faked being bi to get ahead,” Holstege said this week, with a wry smile. She said her qualifications as an attorney with expertise in homelessness clinched victory, not her sexual orientation. Bread-and-butter issues, not grandstanding gestures such as a resolution to impeach Trump, will be the focus. “We don’t want to go on a progressive tirade. We have to guard against backlash.” Palm Springs had long been an LGBT haven so an all-LGBT council should not come as a surprise, said Holstege. Seated in a Starbucks, she indicated the gender-neutral toilets, the result of an ordinance passed last year by the previous council, which had four LGBT members. The sole straight member was also the sole Republican.
Once best known as a desert hangout for Hollywood’s 1960s rat pack, Palm Springs is now arguably the gayest town in America. It is ranked first in California and the third in the US among cities with the most same-sex couples per 1,000 households, according to census data analysis by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. Gay vacationers flocked here in recent decades because it was discreet – what happened in Palm Springs stayed in Palm Springs – and many ended up staying. Soaring housing costs in the San Francisco Bay Area prompted another wave of arrivals. Local politics used to be deeply Republican but the demographic shift prompted an evolution, said David Ready, the city manager. LGBT residents are very engaged in local government, he said. “In other places they used to be fearful of being involved. Here there’s a safety, a comfort. You can be who you are. It’s almost like a cultural diversity utopia.”
The city manager, who is gay, estimated that about half of the members of neighbourhood organisations were gay. Moon, the mayor, said that for decades he had led a “careful, closeted” life as a naval officer and so cherished the fact that Palm Springs accepted an all-LGBT government as no big deal. “My hope is that some day every city, state and country will feel the same way.” But extra visibility brings extra responsibility. “People are watching,” said Middleton. “Anyone who is first feels extra pressure to be good, to do the job well.”"
2018-01-01T05:00:01Z,world,World news,Iran's enemies would be wise not to wish for regime change,"Like birds of prey circling high in the desert sky, Iran’s many foes and rivals are watching the street protests in Tehran and other cities with beady-eyed anticipation. Hopes that the unrest could trigger regime collapse, voiced openly in the US and Israel, appear premature. But any real or imagined weakening of the Iranian government’s grip could presage a dangerous escalation of regional tensions. Predominantly Shia Muslim Iran’s efforts to project its power across the Middle East have earned it many enemies. Its expansionist policy gathered pace after the strategic cuffs came off at the end of the cold war, and accelerated following the British-American debacle in Iraq after 2003. Iran is now a leading actor in post-Saddam Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. These perceived encroachments are a cause of great resentment, not only in Iraq’s Sunni heartlands to the north and west of Baghdad but especially in the headquarters of Sunni Islam, Saudi Arabia. Iranian officials have already accused the Saudis of fomenting the protests. When Lorestan’s deputy governor blamed “takfiri groups” (Sunni extremists) and “foreign intelligence services”, he was using code for Riyadh. Until recently, the idea that Saudi Arabia was secretly plotting regime change in Iran might have seemed outlandish. But tensions between the two countries are at an all-time high. The Saudis accused Iran of direct responsibility for a recent missile attack on the king’s royal palace in Riyadh. The missile was launched from Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting Houthi rebels backed by Tehran.
The rivalry extends to Lebanon, where the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, mounted what most observers concluded was a bungled coup in November to reduce the influence of Tehran-backed Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia political party and militia. In his drive to repulse Iran, knock Qatar and other Arab Gulf states into line, and assert control at home, the youthful Salman has gained a reputation for recklessness. Nobody truly knows how far Salman is prepared to go, although he has vowed in the past “to take the fight to Iran” and has described Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as “the new Hitler of the Middle East”.
Salman has attracted an enthusiastic informal following and a spoof video depicting a Saudi military conquest of Iran recently went viral. Salman has the strong backing of his friend Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law and Middle East envoy. Trump’s hostility towards what he calls Iran’s “rogue regime”, and his wish to see it toppled, are no secret. What is a surprise is the sudden eruption of the protests, which had no obvious internal trigger. Trump and Mike Pence, his vice-president, voiced hopes Iran’s “oppressive regime” would fall, ignoring the fact that Hassan Rouhani was democratically re-elected as president less than one year ago. Israeli politicians are also excited about regime change in Iran. The regional cooperation minister, Tzachi Hanegbi, said Iranian protesters were “courageously risking their lives in the pursuit of freedom”, and called on the “civilised world” to support them. But Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, who has built a career demonising Iran as an existential threat, urged them to pipe down – presumably concerned that Iran’s leaders could turn their wrath on Israel. If Netanyahu fears a backlash, he is probably wise to do so. Unlike Trump and Pence, Israel is in the firing line if matters get out of hand. Israel says Iran has stepped up missile and weapon supplies to Hezbollah in Lebanon and to Palestinian militants in Gaza. It is increasingly worried about the security of its de facto Golan Heights border with Syria. A weakened, wounded Iran could lash out. It could also prove a disruptive, unpredictable partner for both Iraq and Syria, as well as for Turkey and Russia, currently Tehran’s allies of convenience. As for the circling American, Saudi and Israeli hawks, they should be careful what they wish for."
2018-01-01T05:00:01Z,world,World news,North Korea casts nuclear shadow over Asia's 2018,"North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes dominated Asia-Pacific’s geopolitical landscape in 2017, and will loom large throughout the year ahead. Pyongyang is enjoying better returns on each test, with the rest of the world seemingly helpless to resist its self-sponsored application to join the global nuclear club. Its most recent launch involved a powerful intercontinental ballistic missile that, in theory, puts all of America’s major cities within range. Evidence that the regime is mastering the technology needed to guide a missile back into Earth’s atmosphere could emerge in the first few months of 2018. It’s unclear how Donald Trump’s administration intends to make good on its promise to “deny” Pyongyang the ability to strike the US mainland. In the 11 months since he took office, the president has failed to articulate a coherent plan to denuclearise the Korean peninsula – and some analysts believe he should now accept that Pyongyang’s nuclear genie is out of the bottle. Repeated attempts to cajole China into inflicting tangible economic pain on North Korea have had mixed results. Beijing has signed off on UN security council sanctions, but is unlikely to deliver what Trump believes would be the decisive blow of stopping oil supplies – a move China fears could foment regime collapse and create a vacuum filled by South Korea and its US ally. There is little to suggest that Trump has a diplomatic ace up his sleeve.
The biggest test of Trump’s Asia policy will come if Pyongyang convinces the US, through more tests, that it can send a nuclear-armed missile all the way to Washington. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, declared on Monday the US should be aware that his country’s nuclear forces were now a reality, not a threat. In a live TV broadcast of his annual New Year’s Day address, Kim said the North’s nuclear forces had been “completed”, adding that the nuclear launch button was on his desk. “This year we should focus on mass producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment,” he said. “These weapons will be used only if our security is threatened.” The removal of any doubt over the North’s ability to strike the US could have profound consequences for Japan and South Korea, where fears will grow that Washington’s commitment to their security will waver if the US joins them in Kim’s crosshairs. Simply put, would the US be prepared to trade San Francisco for Seoul? A year of provocations from North Korea have played into the hands of Shinzo Abe, Japan’s conservative prime minister, who successfully fought this autumn’s general election on the “national crisis” created by the looming missile threat. Abe is expected to strengthen Japan’s security in the next 12 months through more defence cooperation with the US, and the reported acquisition of cruise missiles to take out North Korean military targets in pre-emptive strikes – a stance that sits uncomfortably with Tokyo’s strictly defensive postwar posture. Abe and his allies view their country’s postwar pacifism as an anomaly – a concession necessitated by wartime defeat but which now is an unfair constraint on its ability to defend itself against North Korea, and counter Chinese attempts to control over seas near the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Abe is expected to put forward an amendment to the constitution that would legalise the status of the self-defence forces, which are a standing military in all but name. Abe has the votes he needs in parliament but must persuade a sceptical public to back him in a referendum.
China’s president, Xi Jinping, will meanwhile play an increasingly important role on the world stage as Trump reduces US diplomatic efforts, especially in international treaties and tackling climate change. Xi is also likely to step up his overhaul of the military and the sweeping campaign against corruption. The Chinese leader secured a second five-year term in October and has signalled he wants to extend his fight beyond the ruling Communist party to 62 million government workers. Growth in the Chinese economy will continue to slow, unlike fellow Bric country India, which, according to a recent forecast, is set to replace Japan as the world’s third-biggest economy by 2028. The US is also preparing to take a tougher stance on trade policies with China, which could lead to a full-scale trade war if it retaliates. In India, Narendra Modi will continue to dominate politics but his sheen could start to wear off in 2018. How the economy fares will be crucial to the political fortunes of the Indian prime minister, as the country gears up for the biggest democratic exercise in the world, its months-long, multi-stage national polls, the results of which won’t be known until May 2019. The rivalry in the region between China and India intensified in 2017 as soldiers from the two countries engaged in a months-long standoff in territory belonging to tiny Bhutan (or to China, according to Beijing). No shots were fired and both sides eventually disengaged, but analysts said such confrontations might become increasingly dangerous as China aggressively expands its influence in south Asia. Next year will also be crucial for the more than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims who fled persecution in Myanmar to Bangladesh over the past months. The next year could see the implementation of an agreement between Burmese and Bangladeshi officials to begin repatriating the refugees – a fraught process that could see many suffer reprisals or further persecution upon their return, as well as the same systematic discrimination the community has suffered for decades."
2018-01-01T03:05:43Z,world,World news,Kim Jong-un: North Korea's nuclear arsenal is now complete,"North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has warned the United States his country’s nuclear forces are now “completed”, adding that the nuclear launch button was always within easy reach. While he remained defiant in his confrontation with Donald Trump, he struck a more conciliatory note on relations with South Korea, offering to start talks on sending a North Korean delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. After a year in which he ordered a string of missile launches – including three intercontinental ballistic missiles – and the regime’s sixth and most powerful nuclear test, Kim used his annual New Year’s Day address to declare the North’s nuclear weapons capability a reality.
“We achieved the goal of completing our state nuclear force in 2017,” Kim said in a speech broadcast live by state TV. “We need to mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles and accelerate their deployment. “The US should know that the button for nuclear weapons is on my desk. This is not blackmail but reality.” Dressed in a western-style grey suit and tie, Kim added, however, that the North’s nuclear arsenal played a purely deterrent role. “The entire area of the US mainland is within our nuclear strike range,” he said. “The US can never start a war against me and our country. These weapons will be used only if our security is threatened.” Asked about Kim’s claim that he has a nuclear button on his desk, and that the weapons can reach the US, Donald Trump said from his New Year’s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago: “We’ll see, we’ll see.” Kim said North Korean athletes could participate in the Winter Olympics, which open in the South Korean town of Pyeongchang next month. South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, has encouraged Pyongyang to send a delegation to the Games, hoping their presence would help ease tensions on the Korean peninsula. Kim said: “The Winter Olympic games that will be held soon in the South will be a good opportunity to display the status of the Korean nation, and we sincerely wish that the event will be held with good results. “We are prepared to take various steps, including the dispatch of a delegation.” The Winter Olympics will be held from 9-25 February, followed by the Paralympics from 9-18 March."
