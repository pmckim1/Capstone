2020-09-01T20:00:35Z,politics,Politics,Johnson backtracks on meeting group for Covid-19 bereaved,"Boris Johnson has declined to meet members of a campaign group representing families bereaved by coronavirus, despite appearing to promise to do so on live TV last week. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, which says it represents 1,600 bereaved families, is campaigning for a rapid public inquiry into the government’s response to the pandemic and is taking legal action to force one, sending pre-action letters to the government. Challenged live on Sky News last week about repeated requests from the group for a face-to-face meeting, the prime minister said he was “not aware” of their letters, but “of course” he would meet them. The Guardian has seen a letter from the prime minister that now declines to meet the group’s representatives, saying it was “regrettably not possible”. In the letter, signed by the prime minister, Johnson said he was “acutely conscious that a letter will be of little comfort against the grief and heartbreak that families have suffered”.
He said he would “of course meet members of the public and key workers who have been bereaved as a result of Covid-19” but said he could not offer condolences in person after every request to meet. Johnson said he would announce an independent inquiry “at the appropriate time” but said all correspondence had to go through the government legal department because of the legal challenge mounted by the group. The group’s founder, Jo Goodman, whose father, Stuart, died from Covid-19, said the prime minister had ignored five letters and had now done “a U-turn followed by a U-turn” by agreeing and then refusing a meeting. She said the bereaved families understood that the prime minister could not meet every bereaved person, but said her group was one of the largest in the country. “We think it’s critical the PM hears the experiences of families bereaved by Covid-19, many of whom can shed light on serious systemic and policy failings that contributed to the death of their loved ones: from deaths in care homes to inadequate protective equipment,” she said. The group has called for an immediate public inquiry with a quick-reporting first phase, similar to the Lord Justice Taylor review set up after the Hillsborough disaster, where the first phase reported back in 11 weeks to allow fast changes to be rolled out in other football stadiums. “If the prime minister had replied to our first letter back in June, a rapid review could be reporting right now: giving crucial lessons on how to save lives as the virus spikes again, as we’re seeing in locations in Europe and across the country,” Goodman said. Johnson has committed in principle to an independent inquiry but has said now was not the “right moment to devote huge amounts of official time to an inquiry”. Though there have been no further details about the inquiry, the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has advertised for an adviser to help prepare for the inquiry. A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The prime minister has responded to Bereaved Families for Justice to express his sincere condolences to all families who have sadly lost loved ones to this terrible disease. “He remains committed to meeting with members of the public and families of key workers who have been bereaved as a result of Covid-19. The prime minister is resolute in his determination to beat this virus and prevent further families from suffering such dreadful loss.”"
2020-09-01T18:35:48Z,politics,Politics,Gavin Williamson gets to stay in case Boris needs someone to sack later | John Crace,"No one can accuse Boris Johnson of not seeing the big picture. After a summer of U-turns – helpfully described by the prime minister as merely strategic tacking into the head of a gale; thank heavens there was a purpose to months of chaos after all – Boris chose to mark parliament’s return by announcing that he was joining LinkedIn. Though with his own CV carefully doctored to omit most of his own career embarrassments. But what some ministers will be really watching for is whether they get an email from Boris to link in with him. Not least Gavin Williamson. Private Pike’s summer from hell has been pure, unrequited joy for most of his cabinet colleagues as it has meant the spotlight has been off them. Their departments have been left to trundle on uninterrupted regardless of any number of minor cock-ups. Matt Hancock looks positively refreshed: though his lucky pink tie still looks as if it is only held together by the stains, he is almost back to his Tiggerish self. Everything is once again for the best in the best of all possible worlds for Matt. Before the summer recess, Hancock looked close to breaking point. Brittle, snappy and unsure of himself. Now he is a man reborn. Called to answer what could have been an awkward urgent question on the government’s ongoing mishandling of the coronavirus crisis, Matt just breezed his way through. He by and large ignored questions about why his department had chosen to dismantle Public Health England in the middle of a pandemic and headed up the new body with Dido Harding, a woman whose CV bears even less scrutiny than the prime minister’s. Most startlingly of all he repeatedly claimed that Typhoid Dido’s track-and-trace system was meeting all its targets – it has consistently missed them for the past nine weeks – and praised the government’s response as world beating. “We are in the top tranche internationally,” he boasted. As in the top tranche both for mortality rates and for those countries who don’t actually have a mass testing system against which we can compare ourselves. He even seemed quite thrilled by the prospect of France and Spain having a second wave. He was sick and tired of them getting so many good headlines early in the pandemic. It was probably just as well Boris had chosen to end recess early. Another week and Matt could have been on the same wavelength as former Australian prime minister – and possibly soon to be joint trade president for the UK – Tony Abbott, who had interrupted his usual round of abuse that morning to use a speech to say that maybe the coronavirus had done the world a favour. People should be just chilling a bit. All that had happened was that some of the weak and vulnerable had been culled by natural selection. Nice. Gavin didn’t have things nearly so easy as he was forced to come to the Commons to explain the Department of Education’s dismal performance over the summer. On the plus side, it was too early to say just how many schools had managed to return with a full head count of pupils, so he was able to act as if everything had passed off relatively smoothly. Which it probably had, when put up against every other clusterfuck. If Private Pike had been spending the morning brushing up his own LinkedIn profile – who could forget that glory, glory night in 2007 at the St Albans Travelodge when he had won ‘Fireplace Salesman of the Year’ for the second time? – then it’s a fair bet there would also have been a fair bit of revisionism to match Boris’s. Out would have gone being sacked for leaking details of a National Security Council meeting, along with every departmental cock-up since March this year. It’s a long list. So much so, that the most striking feature of Gav’s Commons statement was its amnesia. He had forgotten that it had been him who had ordered Ofqual to devise an exam algorithm that prioritised minimising grade inflation over and above the impact on less well-off students from traditionally poor-performing schools. Ofqual had been to blame, he declared, and he had taken “immediate” action to rectify the situation once it had been brought to his attention. Immediate, as in saying students should stop moaning for the best part of a week so that many missed out on their first choice universities. And he also wanted to pay tribute to Sally Collier, the outgoing chief executive of Ofqual, who had done the decent thing and agreed to be sacked after it had been made clear to her that no one at the DfE was going to take responsibility for Gav’s mistakes. Labour’s shadow education secretary, Kate Green, merely read through the charge sheet yet again. Somehow it becomes more damning on every retelling. She did stop short of demanding Gav’s resignation though. Mainly because there is no point. In any normal world Williamson would have gone long ago, but we are way through that looking glass. Gavin gets to stay merely because Boris needs someone to sack in case anything else goes wrong in the next few months. Sack him now and there’s no one but Boris left to take the hit. So Private Pike is the classic useful idiot. Another asset to add to his LinkedIn CV. Which reminded him. There was still no invitation to share his profile with the prime minister."
2020-09-01T18:11:17Z,politics,Politics,Gavin Williamson accused of leading a 'summer of chaos',"Labour has accused the education secretary Gavin Williamson of presiding over “a summer of chaos, incompetence and confusion,” as he updated MPs on schools reopening in England. Williamson was addressing the House of Commons for the first time since last month’s U-turn on A-level and GCSE results. The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, accused him of allowing the interests of children and their families to “take a back seat,” while he “U-turned on everything from CAGs [centre assessment grades] to face masks, and let officials take the blame”. Since the exams fiasco, regulator Ofqual’s chief executive Sally Collier has announced her resignation. The Department for Education’s permanent secretary, Jonathan Slater, was then removed by the prime minister in a decision the FDA union said marked “the end of ministerial accountability”. Green said Williamson was returning to Westminster, “after a summer of chaos, incompetence and confusion that has caused enormous stress to children, young people, their families and teachers”. She added: “He must now take responsibility for ensuring that a summer of incompetence does not descend further into an autumn of disaster and dismay.” Headteachers reacted with exasperation when guidance on how schools would be treated in future local lockdowns was published late on Friday evening, just days before schools were due to reopen to all pupils. There was also frustration about last week’s decision that secondary schools in areas subject to local lockdowns would be told that pupils should wear face coverings in communal areas – a decision criticised at the time by some Conservative MPs. In a statement, Williamson called the return of all children to schools in England, a “massive milestone”. He apologised to students and their families for the disruption to their education, and highlighted the extra provision the government would be making for catchup lessons in the coming months. “I know that these past few months have been some of the most challenging that schools, parents and most of all children have faced. The education secretary also praised schools staff, saying, “I would like to take this opportunity to applaud all of our dedicated education staff for the incredible efforts that they have made to keep children learning at this difficult time. I am confident that we have the necessary preparations in hand to ensure a successful return for all of our pupils.” He said he hoped recent advice from chief medical officers about the risks of contracting Covid-19 in schools, had, “given parents extra reassurance that with protective measures, out pupils are returning to a safe environment, and an environment they will gain so much from.”
The education secretary’s job appears to be safe for the time being, despite the backlash that followed the exams U-turn. He was given a relatively easy ride by Tory colleagues in the House of Commons on Tuesday despite many being privately exasperated at the shaky handling of the exams issue and other last-minute policy changes in recent weeks. Williamson was challenged by Luton North MP, Sarah Owen, about when all children will have received their BTec results. He said the awarding body, Pearson, had reassured him that where students were still awaiting results, it was because it did not have sufficient information. “They have assured us that they’re making every effort to close that circle,” he said. The education secretary also defended the government’s programme for purchasing laptops for children without digital resources at home – criticised by campaign groups for being too slow. He said it had been carried out, “in good order, and on time, when we have said we will do so.”"
2020-09-01T17:53:59Z,politics,Politics,"England test-and-trace system in global 'top tranche', says Hancock","Matt Hancock has insisted that England’s system of tracing and testing suspected coronavirus carriers is in the “top tranche” internationally, despite widespread criticism of its performance. He made the claim during his first appearance in the House of Commons after a summer of confusion, testing mishaps and government U-turns in its policy on Covid-19. Since its creation in May, NHS test and trace has often failed to reach the 80% of confirmed cases and their contacts that public health experts say is needed for the system to be effective, which is itself vital to help reduce the risk of a second lockdown. The health secretary was asked by the Conservative MP Jack Lopresti how his assessment of the performance of NHS test and trace compared with the equivalent programme in other countries and what lessons the system in England was learning from its counterparts, including in Germany and South Korea. Hancock replied: “Well, of course, we learn the lessons and I talk to my international counterparts, including in Germany and South Korea. Actually, compared to international systems … we are now absolutely in the top tranche and we’re constantly looking all around the world to how we can improve the operation of test and trace.”
However, opposition MPs said that its performance was much less impressive than Hancock claimed. Dr Philippa Whitford, the Scottish National party’s health spokeswoman, stressed that the test-and-trace system in Scotland, which is run by local councils and Public Health Scotland, is getting hold of more than 99% of contacts and asking them to get tested and self-isolate. She asked Hancock if the Department of Health and Social Care has included any targets for how many contacts should be traced in its contracts with Serco and Sitel, the private firms that are providing the call handlers for England’s test-and-trace system. The minister did not answer. Justin Madders, a Labour shadow health minister, accused Hancock of wasting public money on private companies that had so far not performed well enough. “In some areas private companies involved in test and trace have been reaching less than half of the contacts they’re supposed to, not the 80% that [Hancock] claims. “So you don’t need an algorithm to work out that their performance, when compared to local public health teams, is where test and trace is failing. So why then is it that this government is rewarding private sector failure by extending these contracts?” Madders added. Hancock defended NHS test and trace, which is run by Dido Harding, the Conservative peer who has also been put in charge of the new body that is replacing Public Health England. Last week it reached 84.3% of contacts and asked them to isolate in cases where contact details were given, he said. “Since its launch we’ve reached over 300,000 people who may have been unwittingly carrying the virus and transmitting it, to ensure that they keep themselves safe and keep their communities safe,” he said. A new advertising campaign is being launched soon to remind people of what they can do to help reduce the spread of coronavirus, including washing their hands, covering their face, staying 2-metres apart from those nearby and getting tested if they are displaying any symptoms, he said."
2020-09-01T17:19:28Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: Labour attacks Gavin Williamson over 'summer of chaos, incompetence and confusion' â€” as it happened","Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, has said schools may want to introduce longer days or weekend lessons as they consider how to help pupils catch up for the education they have lost this year. In a statement to MPs, in response to a Tory backbencher who proposed extending the secondary school day by 30 minutes to help pupils make up for the education they had lost, Williamson said that that idea had merit for some pupils - but that it would be for individual schools to decide if they wanted to adopt it. He said: As part of the advice that was worked up along with the Education Endowment Foundation, one of their key recommendations was looking at how you can extend the school day, how you can look at provisional weekends in order to support children who really do need that little bit of extra help in order for them to have a real impact in terms of their educational attainment. All of these measures can have an enormously positive effect and that’s why we developed a £1bn Covid catch-up fund because schools then have the ability to take such action. Labour’s Kate Green said Williamson was responsible for a “summer of chaos, incompetence and confusion that has caused enormous stress” to parents, pupils and teachers. But Williamson received very little criticism from Conservatives in the chamber, despite the fact that his U-turn over A level grades last month created abysmal headlines for the government. Boris Johnson’s claim that Britons are going back to the office “in huge numbers” (see 11.20am) has been undermined by figures showing the traditional mass return to the workplace failed to materialise in London, with passenger numbers on the tube and buses rising more slowly than usual for the end of summer. Johnson has moved to mollify angry backbenchers disillusioned by the number of government U-turns, admitting the government has been forced to backtrack on multiple issues throughout the pandemic but insisting it is on the right course. Tax increases will be needed across the board for Britain’s highest and lowest earners to bring down record levels of government debt amassed during the coronavirus crisis, leading economists have warned. Plans to lift coronavirus restrictions for more than half a million people in Greater Manchester have been thrown into “chaos and confusion” as local leaders urged the government to change course after a sharp rise in infections. Tony Abbott, the former Australian prime minister tipped to become a UK trade envoy, has railed against Covid “health dictatorships”, saying the economic cost of lockdowns meant families should be allowed to consider letting elderly relatives with the coronavirus die by letting nature take its course. The Scottish government will propose the timescale and question for a second referendum on Scottish independence by next spring, Nicola Sturgeon has said, as she pledged the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic would act as an accelerant and not a brake on the Scottish National party’s ambitions. That’s all from me for today. Our coronavirus coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here."
2020-09-01T17:04:01Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson seeks to mollify Tory MPs dismayed by U-turns,"Boris Johnson has moved to mollify angry backbenchers disillusioned by the number of government U-turns, admitting the government has been forced to backtrack on multiple issues throughout the pandemic but insisting it is on the right course. The prime minister has been facing a restive party as MPs return to Westminster, with several senior Conservatives expressing public dismay over the disaster of A-Level grading and chaotic communication over quarantine periods and the use of masks in schools and shops. Addressing cabinet ministers, Johnson acknowledged it had been “necessary to tack here and there”. “In the last few months we’ve been sailing into the teeth of a gale, no question,” Johnson said. “And I am no great nautical expert but sometimes it is necessary to tack here and there in response to the facts as they change, in response to the wind’s change, but we have been going steadily in the direction, in the course we set out and we have not been blown off that course.” Vocal critics of the government’s strategy include Charles Walker, the vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee, who said the government appeared like it “licks its finger and sticks it in the air to see which way the wind is blowing”. It is understood members of the 1922, which represents Conservative backbenchers, are seeking an urgent meeting with Johnson to relay colleagues’ concerns. Tory MPs are due to meet on Wednesday, in a hybrid meeting both online and in person, though no speaker has been confirmed. “Many of us are extremely concerned that the government says one thing one minute and 24 hours later, it changes,” another member of the 1922’s executive committee said. “Ministers have been on the TV on Saturday and Sunday insisting ‘this is the way forward’ and it’s an about-turn by Monday afternoon. “You just think: plan these things properly and say, we’re responding to the science. Don’t deny it until you inevitably have to cave in. Some of us could see the A-level fiasco coming a mile off and that has really dented confidence.”
MPs were particularly angered by Gavin Williamson’s handling of the exam results algorithm, which downgraded almost 40% of students’ A-level grades, at first defended by the government and then ditched in favour of teacher-assessed grades. Other flashpoints included the wearing of masks in secondary schools in England, at first discouraged and then introduced as mandatory in lockdown areas. One former minister said MPs were returning to Westminster with “a sense of dismay about a lot of things” not just the conduct of U-turns but also the direction of planning reforms, which many MPs are concerned could see a spate of building in Tory shires, and the state of the Brexit negotiations. Another senior MP said Walker “spoke for a lot of us” with his criticism of the government’s strategy over the summer. In parliament on Tuesday, Conservative MPs made digs at the frequency of the government’s reversals. Veteran MP Sir Edward Leigh said: “We don’t want to have this thing where the man from Whitehall knows best ... especially when he changes his mind every two minutes. Can we please get back to being a proper Conservative government and trusting the people?” Johnson’s spokesman suggested U-turns were an inevitable part of responding to an unprecedented situation. “We have been responding to a global pandemic with an entirely novel virus and we have been guided by the scientific advice and as more is learned about the virus then we have ensured we have taken the right steps to keep the public safe,” he said. “But the PM is clear the government will not be knocked off course of levelling up the country.” Speaking at the first cabinet meeting after the summer recess, the prime minister said there would be further outbreaks of “this wretched Covid” but said he was “absolutely confident” they could be dealt with. Johnson also told cabinet ministers employees were “going back to the office in huge numbers across our country and quite right too”, though a Downing Street spokesman was unable to immediately provide evidence of a significant rise in the number of commuters. Concerned about the impact on city centres of the shift towards home-working, the government is expected publicity campaign in the coming days to encourage more workers to return to the office. Borrowing a phrase from Labour under Jeremy Corbyn, Johnson promised a “new green industrial revolution for the UK” and said there would be “some very exciting announcements we are preparing to make in the autumn, that I believe will help to deliver not only a cleaner, greener country but hundreds and thousands of new green jobs across the UK”. He said there was “still going to be some turbulence ahead and of course things are still going to be difficult on the economic front and of course we still need to get this disease absolutely out of our systems but I am absolutely confident that if we continue in the way that we have that there will be calmer days, brighter days and calmer seas ahead of us.”"
2020-09-01T16:56:53Z,politics,Politics,Nicola Sturgeon vows to set out independence vote plans by next spring,"The Scottish government will propose the timescale and question for a second referendum on Scottish independence by next spring, Nicola Sturgeon has said, as she pledged the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic would act as an accelerant and not a brake on the Scottish National party’s ambitions. Setting out her programme for government – Holyrood’s equivalent to the Queen’s speech – on Tuesday afternoon, the first minister announced a “youth guarantee”, offering a job or a place in education or training to everyone aged 16 to 24 , as she said Covid “will not be the defining experience for this generation”.
She also revealed plans for a £100m green jobs fund, further investment in digital infrastructure, and a review of adult social care, which will set out options for a “national care service”. Sturgeon hailed her government’s “game-changing” Scottish child payment, but anti-poverty campaigners said that the delay of the rollout until next February would leave many families overwhelmed in the interim. In a move welcomed by children’s advocates, the first minister confirmed what she described as “one of the most ambitious pieces of legislation in the 20-year history of devolution”: the full and direct incorporation into Scots law of the United Nations convention on the rights of the child. Sturgeon emphasised that the pandemic did not mean her government would simply “hunker down and wait for the storm to pass”. She told MSPs: “Even amidst the uncertainties of a global pandemic, this is a time to be ambitious. To use the disruption of Covid to rethink how we do things.” She compared a national care service – which Scottish Labour has been calling for over many months – to the postwar establishment of the National Health Service, and acknowledged that lockdown had further highlighted digital exclusion. She confirmed that Connecting Scotland, established during lockdown, would provide laptops, unlimited data and training to those without digital access to 50,000 households by the end of 2021. During her address, Sturgeon said that – were she governing an independent country and not having to deal with the “self-sabotage” of Brexit – she could contemplate even more far-reaching plans, including a reformed migration system and a universal basic income. She pledged that by next spring her government would publish a draft bill for an independence referendum, which would set out “clearly and unambiguously to the people of Scotland” both the question to be asked and the timing of the vote. The question would be subject to appropriate testing by the Electoral Commission, and the timescale would be “within the next term of parliament”, which lasts until 2026, and also “taking account of the development of the Covid-19 pandemic at the time of publication”. She added that at next May’s Holyrood elections – in which the SNP are already predicted to win a majority as support for independence continues to rise – “we will make the case for Scotland to become an independent country, and seek a clear endorsement of Scotland’s right to choose our own future”. But the new Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, accused Sturgeon of existing in a “Holyrood bubble”. Ross said: “This was the moment where the first minister could have put selfish, narrow interests to one side and united the country. Instead, we’re told the solution is another referendum bill, only this time in the middle of a pandemic. The first minister just doesn’t get it. She needs to leave the Holyrood bubble and get back into the real world, where people are fearful of losing their jobs.”"
2020-09-01T16:26:23Z,politics,Politics,"SNP ministers focus of 'remarkable' number of bullying cases, says union boss","Scottish National party ministers have been the focus of a “quite remarkable” number of misconduct and bullying complaints compared with those in other parts of the UK, a civil service union leader has told an inquiry. Dave Penman, general secretary of the First Division Association, which represents the country’s most senior civil servants, said he had dealt with “a handful” of complaints about ministers in other UK departments over the past decade. In Scotland, around 30 senior officials had raised complaints or flagged concerns about bullying and misconduct involving ministers in five offices since 2010, Penman told the Scottish parliamentary inquiry on Tuesday. Penman did not name the ministers. Penman said he was aware of “probably a handful of instances” for the UK civil service in that period, which was why the Scottish government figure “felt quite remarkable” in terms of numbers. “It did feel like there was an unusual number in the Scottish government compared to the rest of the UK civil service.” The committee is investigating the Scottish government’s mishandling of an internal inquiry into alleged sexual harassment claims made against former SNP first minister Alex Salmond in early 2018. The complaints were upheld by an internal inquiry but its findings were quashed by the court of session in January 2019 after Salmond launched legal action against his former government. The permanent secretary, Leslie Evans, said the process was unlawful and had the appearance of bias because the inquiry was overseen by a senior official who had had prior contact with the two complainers about their complaints. Salmond denied all the allegations, and in March 2020 was acquitted of all 14 charges of alleged sexual assault, including one of attempted rape, following a two-week jury trial at the high court in Edinburgh. He has accused senior figures within the SNP and Sturgeon’s inner circle of pursuing a vendetta against him, by fabricating or pursuing ill-founded claims. Penman and Malcolm Clark, convenor of the Scottish government’s trade unions committee, told the hearing on Tuesday that unions had been agitating for ministers to be included in its anti-bullying policies since 2008. Two years later Salmond agreed to include ministers in a new “fairness at work” procedure. In November 2017, following an “explosion” of concerns raised by the #MeToo movement, Sturgeon agreed to include ministers and former ministers in a sexual harassment policy that was quickly used to investigate Salmond. Penman told the committee these policies were “unique” among UK government departments. He said Scotland’s policies were the most far-reaching, and superior to the politically controlled ministerial code process used in Whitehall. Even so, there was still high levels of mistrust amongst civil servants about the independence of the Scottish process, he said. The entire UK civil service and all ministers should instead be covered by a fully independent, transparent complaints process, Penman suggested, otherwise ministers were “marking their own homework”. “I don’t think we would be here if we’d had a fully independent process. I think it would’ve been less subject to challenge or accusations around malevolent intent or motivation; we would’ve taken all of those things, all the politics, out of it.” He told the inquiry the “quite extraordinary” number of complaints suggested there was a specific problem within the Scottish government, which began during the previous Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition government and was continuing today within Nicola Sturgeon’s administration. “The numbers of people raising concerns about the Scottish government are so significantly greater than we are aware of elsewhere that it suggests that something particular – over the longer term – has happened in the Scottish governments,” Penman said."
2020-09-01T15:24:30Z,politics,Politics,No 10 blames EU and plays down prospects of Brexit trade deal,"Downing Street has played down the prospect of reaching a trade deal with the EU in time for December, saying it will be “very difficult” – and blaming Brussels’ insistence on tackling tough issues upfront. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, is meeting his EU counterpart Michel Barnier in London, in advance of the next round of formal talks next week. But with the clock ticking to 31 December, when the status quo transition is due to end, Boris Johnson’s official spokesman conceded that hopes of a deal were dwindling. “The EU continues to insist that we must agree on difficult areas in the negotiations, such as EU state aid, before any further work can be done in any other area of the negotiations, including on legal texts, and that makes it very difficult to make progress,” the spokesman said. “We would instead like to settle the simplest issues first, in order to build momentum in the talks, as time is short for both sides.” The EU has consistently said it wants to see the contentious issues of fisheries policy and state aid settled up front. EU officials are exasperated however by the briefings about negotiations in London, pointing out that the UK has not yet tabled its own proposals for state aid. “How can we negotiate this when we don’t even know what state aid in the UK will look like next year,” said a source. Insiders say the UK is trying to “cherry pick” and claiming it would be happy with a “bare bones” deal, while making sizeable asks across the 11 sections of the negotiations which, when put together, amount to a deal of substance. Johnson’s government is reluctant to cede any control over state aid policy, boasting during last year’s election campaign that one benefit of Brexit would be that the government could intervene more readily to help struggling UK businesses. The prime minister’s spokesman underlined that message on Tuesday, saying: “We’ll set out further detail of our domestic regime in due course. After the transition period, the UK will have its own regime of subsidy control, and will not be subject to the EU’s state aid regime. We have been very clear about that throughout.” He added: “The UK’s future subsidy arrangements are a matter for the British people and parliament, not the European Union.” Brussels regards state aid constraints as a key aspect of ensuring a level playing field, so that UK businesses cannot unfairly undercut their EU counterparts. With an EU council expected to be held in October to finalise any free trade agreement, time is running short. During last year’s fraught negotiations over the EU withdrawal agreement formalising the UK’s exit terms, Johnson made significant last-minute concessions – effectively allowing a border in the Irish Sea – to get his “oven-ready” deal done. But he is under pressure from Brexit-backing Conservative MPs not to make fresh compromises now – and even to repudiate some aspects of the withdrawal agreement. One potential solution to the negotiating impasse that has previously been mooted is a series of separate deals on different issues – financial services, fisheries and so on. But a senior UK official close to talks has previously revealed that the EU is not keen on a “Switzerland-style suite of agreements”, in reference to the 100-plus bilateral deals the country has with Brussels, as it “would be too complicated to manage for them”. The EU is also keen to have an overarching deal on governance and dispute resolution. France’s EU affairs minister, Clément Beaune, said that no deal was a risk, but blamed the British government for the impasse. “Things are not advancing because the UK would like to have its cake and eat it: to leave the European Union and have access to the European market,” he said. Speaking on French radio, he said the EU would not compromise on linking market access to respect for its rules on health and the environment. The EU has said the UK can only have tariff-free, quota-free access to the European market if it agrees to respect European standards on environment, workers’ rights and state aid for companies. EU officials dismissed reports Barnier was refusing to discuss British proposals on a future fisheries treaty.
“The UK has not presented new legal texts in the area of fisheries,” a spokesman for Barnier said. “We have been engaging constructively and in good faith. Michel Barnier said at the end of the last round of negotiations that we have shown flexibility by taking note of prime minister Johnson’s three red lines and working on them. We have not seen, however, a reciprocal effort on the UK’s side regarding European priorities. We are now waiting for the UK to present concrete and constructive proposals.”"
2020-09-01T15:01:44Z,politics,Politics,What are Conservative backbenchers' main grievances?,"Boris Johnson is expected to face criticism from Tory backbenchers as MPs return to Westminster with lists of grievances – from the government’s multiple U-turns, to planning reform and the forthcoming budget. Here’s what restive MPs have on their minds. A summer of U-turns From lockdown hawks to mask-sceptics, a huge number of Conservative backbenchers have privately and publicly expressed concern at the sheer number of U-turns over the summer recess, usually begun with a categorical denial that the government’s position will shift, followed by unilateral change or a change in Scotland or Wales, and finally an about-turn. From the A-level grading chaos, to the enforcing of face-covering in shops and certain schools, Johnson’s No 10 operation is seen to be days behind the curve. Key critics: Charles Walker, deputy chair of the 1922 Committee, Bernard Jenkin, chair of the liaison committee. Foreign aid This is a thorny issue for many Tory MPs, a significant number who have always wanted to see the back of the 0.7% spending target will see the pandemic as an opportune moment to cut back on this spending, but others feel equally as strongly about the moral case for aid and as a tool of soft power. Downing Street has denied the aid budget, now subsumed into the Foreign Office with the demise of the Department for International Development, is a target for savings but rightwing papers have briefed that it could be used to plug holes in defence spending – though that would require primary legislation. Key critics: Former development secretary Andrew Mitchell, former cabinet minister and the chair of the One Nation Tory caucus, Damian Greene. Planning reform The reforms, which will give default planning permission in areas earmarked for development, are likely to result in a significant rise in housebuilding in Tory shires, leading some MPs to call for the government to reprioritise building on brownfield sites. Affluent, leafy suburbs, typically Tory, are likely to be the top targets for building because the reforms require councils with the least affordable housing to release the most land. The Tory MP Neil O’Brien was the first to publicly criticise the reforms and Conservative-run councils are extremely wary of the reform, which requires them to relinquish most of their planning powers. Key critics: MP Neil O’Brien, a former No 10 aide, and multiple Conservative council leaders. Tax rises Rishi Sunak has some difficult choices ahead in the budget about how to claw back rivers of cash spent coping with the coronavirus pandemic. He has been reportedly eyeing potential increases to corporation tax, cheered by the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, but which has caused horror at the Institute of Directors, which has warned it “risks stamping out the recovery”. The Sun suggests a rise in fuel duty – but this is often a move mooted ahead of budgets then quashed as a sweetener to Tory backbenchers. An increase in capital gains tax is also likely to be opposed by Tory MPs, criticised as a hit to middle income-earners. Key critics: Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee and anti-fuel duty campaigner and Conservative-aligned business groups. Brexit Opponents of a no-deal Brexit still do exist in parliament, including former cabinet minister Greg Clark and former ministers Steve Brine and Stephen Hammond, but most have been muted since the December election result. Pressure to shun any deal from the EU is likely to come from Brexiters who have already made noises of discontent about the withdrawal agreement signed by the prime minister before the UK’s exit in January, particularly over the UK’s financial liabilities. In July, a report by the Centre for Brexit Policy, endorsed by Bill Cash and Owen Paterson, demanded the junking of the withdrawal agreement, which it called a “poison pill”. Key critics: Former cabinet ministers Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson."
2020-09-01T11:22:40Z,politics,Politics,Simon Case named as UK’s new top civil servant,"Simon Case has been confirmed as the UK’s new top civil servant, with the prime minister saying he would do a “fantastic” job as cabinet secretary. The 41 year old replaces Mark Sedwill, who announced at the end of June that he would stand down from his twin posts of national security adviser and cabinet secretary. Case won the trust of Boris Johnson when he was drafted into Downing Street to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic, and then promoted to permanent secretary at No 10, after a stint as private secretary to the Duke of Cambridge. A career civil servant, Case has previously held several senior roles, including principal private secretary to David Cameron and Theresa May, and director of strategy at the government’s intelligence-gathering agency, GCHQ. Johnson said: “Simon will make a fantastic cabinet secretary and head of the civil service. His years of experience at the heart of government and working for the royal household make him ideally suited for this crucial role.” Case said: “Over these few months of working on the Covid response, I have seen how much hard work is being done by the civil service to support the government and our country through unprecedented times. It is a privilege to come into this role to lead a service that is working day in, day out to deliver for people right across the country.” The prime minister’s chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, has been handed the national security role that was the other part of Sedwill’s job. Theresa May publicly condemned that decision, calling Frost, “a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security”. Sedwill’s departure was regarded as a victory for Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s most senior aide, who had a tense relationship with Sedwill, and Michael Gove, the cabinet minister who is pushing through a restructuring of government departments. Sedwill is one of a number of senior civil servants who have departed in recent months – the most recent being the Department for Education permanent secretary Jonathan Slater, who was pushed out after the exams debacle. In Tuesday’s statement, Johnson said, “I would like to thank Mark Sedwill for his outstanding service to the government and the country as a whole. After serving for decades with great distinction, I believe he has earned the gratitude of the nation.” Case’s appointment comes as Cummings continues to shift the balance of power towards the centre of government, with a newly refurbished office at 70 Whitehall staffed by officials and political advisers where decision-making is expected to be concentrated. Government communications are also being dramatically centralised, with departmental press offices expected to be cut back at the expense of a beefed-up Downing Street operation, run by Johnson’s director of communications, Lee Cain."
2020-09-01T05:00:28Z,politics,Politics,Hancock accused of favouring Tory areas with Covid lockdown changes in England,"Matt Hancock has been urged to publish the scientific advice behind his decision to lift coronavirus restrictions in some areas after critics accused him of “playing politics” with public health. The health secretary announced on Friday that more than 1 million people across north-west England would be allowed to visit friends and family for the first time in a month from Wednesday. However, the move has prompted fury among Labour MPs and council leaders, who accused the government of overruling local public health decisions in order to appease Conservative MPs. The announcement means people living in some Tory-voting constituencies will no longer be subject to the restrictions, while those in neighbouring Labour seats with similar or lower infection rates will not. The Guardian has been told the government had been due to announce the changes to local restrictions at 11am on Friday but it had to be pushed back several hours after serious concerns were raised by local leaders. It is understood that a draft government statement outlining the changes described the decision as being made “in agreement with local leaders” – however this line had to be dropped after pushback from councils. The announcement, eventually made at 5pm on Friday, will lead to restrictions lifted in the Greater Manchester borough of Trafford, where the infection rate rose over the weekend to more than three times the national average, at 35 cases per 100,000 people. The borough now has a higher infection rate than Salford and Bury, where the restrictions will remain in place. Hancock had been warned by Trafford council, its director of public health and its two Labour MPs that it was too early to ease measures covering its 235,000 residents. However, they were overruled by the health secretary. The influential Tory MP Graham Brady, whose constituency includes part of Trafford, had been pushing for the area to be removed from the restrictions. Andrew Western, the Labour leader of Trafford council, demanded an urgent explanation on Monday: “It would be common courtesy when you’re overruling the local authority, the director of public health and the vast majority of local politicians, to explain the reasons why – particularly because we’re now seeing the spike in cases we thought we may do. “Nobody has bothered to explain it or give any justification whatsoever. We have to explain that decision to our residents. How can we have confidence in it if they have not bothered to tell us the reasons why?” Restrictions will also be lifted from Wednesday in Bolton, Stockport, parts of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees in West Yorkshire and Burnley and Hyndburn in Lancashire. A ban on households mixing remains in place in Oldham, Pendle and Blackburn – which have the highest coronavirus infection rates in England – and in the city of Leicester. A ban on two households mixing indoors remains in place in Manchester, Salford, Rochdale, Bury, Tameside and Preston. In Bradford, nine wards in two Tory constituencies will see restrictions eased in line with the rest of England from Wednesday while the city’s remaining 23 wards – mostly represented by Labour MPs – will remain under local lockdown despite recording few recent Covid-19 cases. Bradford’s three Labour MPs and its council leader accused Hancock of “playing politics” with the restrictions, and warned that removing individual wards would be “unenforceable” and confusing for residents. It is understood that the city’s local outbreak control board, comprised of its most senior health officials, had also cautioned against this approach in a meeting with Bradford’s five MPs last week. The council and Labour MPs had asked for the whole of Bradford to be lifted out of the restrictions, with targeted interventions in areas with a higher number of cases. However, the two Conservative MPs – Philip Davies and Robbie Moore – advocated a more localised approach. Judith Cummins, the MP for Bradford South, said on Monday she had written to the health secretary urging him to publish the scientific evidence behind his decision. She said: “In these difficult times it’s imperative that the secretary of state for health and social care not only act with political neutrality in determining these matters, but importantly he should also be seen to act without political bias.” Two other West Yorkshire council areas, Calderdale and Kirklees, have also been carved up, with neighbourhoods in two Tory-voting constituencies removed from the restrictions from Wednesday. Tim Swift, the Labour leader of Calderdale council, said it had agreed as a compromise to measures being eased in part of the borough, but added: “Looking at the proposals across the north it seems that this is a political decision to appease Tory MPs rather than something that is led by clear scientific evidence. “I would now challenge the government to publish the scientific advice which underpins the decision they have taken.” The Department of Health and Social Care said it was “regrettable” that some councils and MPs had not been able to come to a consensus on the appropriate measures for their area. It said it welcomed the “constructive and collaborative” approach taken by many local authorities and that it would continue to work with all bodies in the areas “where this has not yet been possible”, adding: “We are prepared to take decisive action to stop outbreaks to save lives and will remove restrictions as soon as they are no longer necessary.”"
2020-08-31T17:47:03Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson ally Simon Case poised to be named head of civil service,"The government is to unveil its new top civil servant on Tuesday to replace Sir Mark Sedwill, who stepped down following hostile briefings linked to No 10, with a 41-year-old outsider closely allied to Boris Johnson expected to be named. Simon Case, a former private secretary to Prince William who was seconded to No 10 in May at the prime minister’s request, is to be formally announced as the new cabinet secretary, the Financial Times said, citing three unnamed sources. The Cabinet Office, which is responsible for civil service matters, refused to comment on the report, saying only that the announcement would be made on Tuesday. Sedwill is due to step down as permanent secretary – a key advisory role that makes the holder the head of the civil service – in September. The announcement was made in June, bringing criticism from former colleagues who said Sedwill had been undermined by Johnson’s top aide Dominic Cummings and others in Downing Street. Sedwill is among a series of senior civil servants to be eased out in recent months, including Jonathan Slater, the most senior civil servant in the Department for Education, who left in the wake of the exam results crisis. Critics say officials are being scapegoated for failings instead of ministers taking responsibility. Sir Philip Rutnam, formerly the lead official at the Home Office, is suing for unfair dismissal after quitting in February. While Case would be the youngest cabinet secretary for decades, he has significant government and Downing Street experience. He worked in No 10 under David Cameron from 2012 to 2014, and returned after working as head of strategy for GCHQ from 2015 to 2016. He stayed on as principal private secretary when Theresa May took over, but left in 2017 to work on Northern Ireland border issues connected to Brexit. Case unexpectedly left this role in March 2018 to become private secretary to Prince William. Any hopes of a quieter working life were dashed by the crisis over Prince Harry’s formal separation from the royal family. In a sign of the regard Johnson and his No 10 team hold for Case, he was brought back to Downing Street in May on what was officially a secondment, with the task of improving the central grip on the response to coronavirus. Case was nonetheless seen as unlikely to replace Sedwill, with the more experienced Chris Wormald, the head official in the Department of Health, seen as the frontrunner. The choice of a relative outsider close to Johnson will be linked by observers to a desire in No 10 to radically reshape the civil service – a process spearheaded by Cummings, who reportedly told aides that a “hard rain” was heading for intransigent officials. Unlike Sedwill, Case will not also hold the role of national security adviser. Downing Street announced in June that this role would go to David Frost, currently the government’s chief Brexit negotiator. Though a former diplomat, Frost has little direct experience of security matters. His appointment brought rare criticism from May, with the former PM saying the government had promoted someone with “with no proven expertise”."
2020-08-31T17:31:24Z,politics,Politics,Tory plan to scrap election watchdog 'undermines democracy',"Opposition parties have condemned Conservative proposals to abolish or significantly revamp the Electoral Commission, with Labour saying any move to restrict the elections watchdog risks undermining faith in democracy. The Liberal Democrats said any moves against the Electoral Commission, as outlined by the Conservatives’ co-chair Amanda Milling, appeared an attempt to prevent the exposure of “embarrassing funding connections to Russian oligarchs”. The commission regulates political donations, spending and other areas, and has the power to undertake its own investigations, and fine parties and officials for breaches of the rules, although more serious matters are passed to police. The government’s advisory body the Committee on Standards in Public Life is currently holding a review of electoral regulation. In a submission to the process, the Conservatives said the commission should not be given new powers of prosecution, saying this would bring “too many conflicts of interest”. Writing in the Telegraph, Milling argued that the body should accept more outside scrutiny or be disbanded: “If the Electoral Commission fails to make these changes and do the job it was set up to do then the only option would be to abolish it.” The commission is viewed with suspicion by some Conservative MPs who believe it has unfairly targeted pro-Brexit groups, such as with its decision to fine the campaigner Darren Grimes £20,000 for electoral spending offences in the 2016 referendum. This was overturned by a court appeal. Some campaign groups have called instead for increased scrutiny of the election system, particularly after a long-delayed report by parliament’s intelligence and security committee said the government and intelligence agencies had failed to properly assess Russian attempts to interfere with the Brexit vote. Cat Smith, Labour’s shadow Cabinet Office minister, who deals with voting issues, called the Conservative proposal “a harmful and worrying step for the integrity of our democracy”. “Removing the Electoral Commission is just one part of a concerted strategy by the Tories to remove scrutiny and proper accountability,” she said. “Without the Electoral Commission, no one could prevent the Tories from introducing policies that fundamentally make it harder for people to vote, such as mandatory Voter ID. “This move comes straight out of the Republican party playbook.” The Lib Dem MP Wendy Chamberlain said that with attacks on judges and the illegal prorogation of parliament, Boris Johnson had shown he was “a threat to the rule of law”. She said: “Now, with the Tories’ embarrassing funding connections to Russian oligarchs exposed, their plan to turn their guns on the Electoral Commission is a direct attempt to undermine our democracy.” In its own response to the review of electoral regulations, the Electoral Reform Society has called instead for increased powers for the commission, on the lines of the Information Commissioner’s Office. The group argued: “It is striking that we now have a regulator with substantial powers to protect data privacy, but no such powers have been granted to the regulator entrusted with protecting our democracy.”
A Conservative spokesman said that if the commission were abolished, its functions should be transferred to other bodies, such as police and Companies House. He said: “Our submission makes clear that the Electoral Commission needs to reform to become more accountable, with clearer, up-to-date, non-conflicting guidance for political parties, particularly in light of past mistakes. “Would the Liberal Democrats or Labour say every fine or investigation into them has been proportionate and fair? Rather than lobbying for more powers, the commission should be focusing on getting its house in order.”"
2020-08-31T15:27:28Z,politics,Politics,"Tories offer 'virtual stalls' at online party conference for up to £25,000","The Conservative conference may be strictly virtual this year, but the party is still seeking to extract a lucrative income stream from businesses wanting access to ministers – at a cost of up to £25,000. The usual autumn gathering is cancelled because of coronavirus, but the party has promised members the consolation of an online event, which it said would still provide “a fantastic opportunity for members to share ideas and hear from voices across the party”.
While attendance is free for members, the party hopes to squeeze a significant income from the event. Politico reported on Monday that the Conservatives would offer “virtual stalls” in an online “exhibition hall” at prices ranging from £6,000 to £25,500 plus VAT. Businesses weighing up the wisdom of a stand at an event confined to the internet are told that they will be able to “meet MPs and councillors, mingle with members and inspire thousands of influential delegates”. Exhibitors from “bronze” to “platinum” levels are told of benefits ranging from “ministerial virtual visits from senior members of cabinet”, a “brandable, dedicated interactive stand”, and “lead generation with a virtual business card fishbowl”, a brochure for the event says. Politico reported further options for businesses including a virtual “policy roundtable” with a minister for £7,400 and the chance to host “Zoom-style” virtual fringe events – studio included – over the four days of the conference for £40,000. The brochure indicates a certain urgency to the fundraising efforts: “If it’s got space for a logo or website,” it says, “then it could be yours.” Prospective advertisers are told they will get “access to high-value prospects and compelling ROI [return on investment]” and can book “virtual billboards located in key areas of the delegate journey”. A Conservative party spokesperson said the party was offering “a wide range of packages” that would also include a spot at next year’s spring conference, and added: “It is commonplace for political parties to sell exhibition space at their conferences.” All of the main political parties had to rethink their annual conferences this year, which typically provide a substantial source of income as well as rallying members and garnering major media coverage. The Scottish National party postponed its summer conference, while Labour and the Liberal Democrats have also gone online. It is understood that while Labour does not intend to have an equivalent virtual marketplace, its Connected event will feature some sponsored sessions.
The Lib Dems, meanwhile, also have a host of online opportunities on offer, including “expo booths”, which consist of banner ads linking through to a page showcasing products and services with video content and slides. The party’s brochure adds that booths have a “customisable lead-generation feature built in (call-to-action button) for capturing delegate interest”. Substantially lower than the Conservative equivalent, prices start at £1,500."
2020-08-31T12:24:05Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's in-tray: what are the key issues PM needs to address?,"Boris Johnson’s curtailed mini-holiday to Scotland could soon start to feel a distant memory, with MPs returning to parliament on Tuesday, and the prime minister facing an overflowing political in-tray. Here are some of the more immediate crises he must face in the coming months: Schools and universities Most pupils in England and Wales return this week, many after nearly six months away from schools, with university and FE students following soon after. As well as managing the anger caused by this summer’s exams debacle, Johnson will be intensely aware of the role educational settings could play in pushing forward a new wave of coronavirus into the autumn and winter – and the overwhelming political imperative to keep them open nonetheless. Lockdowns The government has been warned that for schools to remain open, new restrictions might be needed in other sections of the economy. But what? Wholesale closures of pubs and restaurants could finish off much of the hospitality sector, while local lockdowns have created anger, and can give the impression of a government playing an endless, “whack-a-mole” game that it cannot win. A winter NHS crisis It is easy to forget that even ordinary winters, with their run of flu and other seasonal illnesses, traditionally put huge pressure on the health service. Even if a fresh upsurge in Covid cases is less than feared, the impact could be severe. A big factor in winter hospital bed shortages is delays in moving vulnerable patients to care settings. With care homes still reeling from coronavirus, this could be even more significant this year. Brexit Such is the political bandwidth taken up by Covid that the crisis that dominated UK politics for three years is now relegated to lower down on lists such as these. But the perils are still the same. In a matter of weeks, it would seem, Johnson must decide whether he gives up on talks with the EU, or prepares for the sort of carefully choreographed policy pirouette he undertook to seal the initial exit deal last year. The first will add to the economic and social impacts of an effective no-deal departure onto Covid; the latter would leave Brexit-minded Conservative MPs aghast and furious. The public finances The idea of increases to corporation and inheritance tax, among others, brought a predictably angry response from some Tory MPs after it was floated in Sunday papers. It could just be Treasury kite-flying. But one thing is clear: given Johnson has promised no return to austerity, there are some big holes developing in the public finances. His decision is not whether they must be addressed, just how and when. Reshuffle For all that Gavin Williamson has been written off as a zombie education secretary, awaiting the inevitable demise, the last near-nine months have shown that Johnson’s government has a habit of defying norms on accountability, as shown by the continued presence of Dominic Cummings and Robert Jenrick. The PM faces a wider conundrum. Sweeping reshuffles can be used a demonstration of Downing Street power. But for a still-new PM with a strong majority and no need to assuage competing power bases, doing one so soon could be seen as a sign that – as some Tory MPs believe – too much of the current cabinet isn’t up to the job. Climate emergency Johnson might prefer to ignore this issue, but it’s not about to go away, especially with the UK due to hold the crucial Cop26 climate summit next year. If Joe Biden wins November’s US election, international cooperation could spark back into life; if Donald Trump is returned, then other countries might have to face a US-less response to the issue."
2020-08-30T14:52:04Z,politics,Politics,Johnson’s quest for a spokesperson goes on – but who'd want the job?,"From the coronavirus strategy to the merits of Rule, Britannia!, the prime minister’s new spokesperson will have to deal with the full range of issues confronting the government. As the selection process for the first incumbent reaches its closing stages, though, the successful candidate is likely to face a harder question still: why on earth would you want to do it? With the closing date for applications passed and the Downing Street machine back to full gear with Boris Johnson’s director of communications, Lee Cain, returning to the office, it was reported on Sunday that the process of sifting through the CVs will now intensify. And although the job answering the questions of the press on camera will command a salary of £100,000 a year and a place on every news broadcast, the clearest signals yet are about those who view the opportunity with caution. According to reports in the Sunday Times, Johnson hoped to persuade the BBC’s Riz Lateef to take on the role, which will involve fronting a daily televised press conference. “Riz Lateef was Boris’s first thought,” the paper quoted a Tory source as saying, in part because of his respect for the RTS award-winner’s role questioning him when he was mayor of London. While the paper said Lateef ruled herself out, it is understood that the approach has not reached the stage of an offer to accept or decline. Sophy Ridge has also been named as a possible candidate. But it is understood she was reluctant to leave her position as Sky News’ lead political interviewer. “It’ll be an enormously, possibly uniquely challenging role in government communications,” said Paul Harrison, who was Theresa May’s press secretary. “The scope of the role is vast, and the unexpected consequences of the pandemic make it particularly demanding.”
Craig Oliver, a former director of politics and communications for David Cameron, said the role would be akin to “being on a tightrope without a safety net every day. In the current system, because it’s not recorded, you can go back and forth, fudge things a bit, and that pantomime can run again and again – but that’s rather difficult when people are watching you on TV. “When a crisis hits the government, and everyone has very specific questions on the record, if you slip or look like you’re playing games, that clip will be played endlessly.” In those circumstances, the former BBC, ITV and Guardian journalist Allegra Stratton, now chancellor Rishi Sunak’s communications chief, has emerged as a frontrunner, with a rare combination of broadcast skills and time at the heart of government. It is understood Downing Street believes that a woman should hold the role, in part to counter the perception that Johnson’s administration is too male-dominated. But Oliver suggests that on-air experience may not be the prerequisite many have suggested. “They’ve been through the cycle of thinking it would be a broadcaster – it’s not a dealbreaker now. Much more important is someone who is fluently across the detail and makes the case and is willing to take bullets – you’re in the frontline and your job is to defend the government and put the government and the prime minister first. “The last thing you want is someone who’s going to grandstand – you have to understand that actually this is a profoundly egoless task, and narcissists need not apply.” Another former No 10 aide pointed out that whoever takes the job will be closing the door on a traditional journalistic career for good – and that unlike in the US, where lucrative pundit roles on CNN and Fox are on offer for former White House advisers, the next career steps for whoever does it are not obvious. “You can become a pundit, but you don’t get that big-shot deal,” the former aide said. “Given the high turnover of staff in the current administration, you’re taking a risk. You potentially become more famous than a lot of cabinet ministers, but you leave yourself incredibly exposed. You only have to look at Sean Spicer” – Donald Trump’s notorious first press secretary, who found himself an object of ridicule for his misleading briefings and wound up on Dancing with the Stars in a neon green ruffled shirt. Despite all those pitfalls, Oliver sees the logic to the government’s plan. “Someone on the record who is overtly political and able to say political things and promote the PM is very important to them,” he said. “A civil servant [as the current spokesperson is] is actually very limited in what they can say.” And he notes that while “this is a risk for the government, it’s a risk for the media too. I think at the beginning of lockdown [when televised briefings became a daily norm], the lobby was quite surprised to find that the public doesn’t like the way it goes about its business. Are you actually interested in winkling out information, or do you want to trip someone up? So the feeling was, let’s put them in the spotlight too.” For all the downsides, Harrison said, “working at the centre of government, at the centre of our national life, is a huge privilege. You’ll have days which are extremely difficult, challenges which sometimes seem insurmountable, but it’ll be the most interesting thing you ever do.”"
2020-08-30T14:03:14Z,politics,Politics,"Ditching tax on tech firms will mean less money for key workers, says Labour","Labour has told Rishi Sunak that if the UK Treasury scraps a tax on technology companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon it would mean losing out on enough money to pay for tens of thousands of key workers in Britain. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said there were serious questions about a potential multibillion-pound black hole in the Treasury’s finances that needed urgent clarification. Her intervention comes after a report suggested ministers were preparing to ditch Britain’s digital services tax – a levy of 2% on the revenues tech companies derive from UK users – because it could jeopardise a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. In a letter to the chancellor, Dodds said the future of £465m in revenue from the digital services tax had been thrown up into the air, warning this was equivalent to the cost of employing 13,000 nurses, 8,700 teachers or 8,600 police officers. Sources told the Mail on Sunday last weekend the tax was “more trouble than it is worth” and that ministers could scrap it to secure a favourable trade deal with Donald Trump’s White House. Although the Treasury poured cold water on the report, it also confirmed the tax would be removed once a “global solution” over taxing technology firms could be reached with other countries.
Sunak had written a letter in June alongside EU finance ministers demanding that big tech firms pay more tax to help fund the recovery from the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury is also considering whether to launch a digital sales tax as part of its plans to reform business rates. However, Dodds said the chancellor urgently needed to clarify the government’s position, and that much more needed to be done to tax big technology companies. “This government promised to make tech giants pay a fair share of tax to support our public services. Scrapping the digital services tax will do the opposite, costing millions in revenue that could pay for thousands of nurses, teachers or police officers,” she said. “It’s another example of incompetence from a government that is holding back Britain’s recovery.” A spokesman for the Treasury said: “The digital services tax is a proportionate measure that ensures that tech firms pay their fair share of tax in the UK. We’ve been clear it’s a temporary tax that will be removed once an appropriate global solution is in place – and we continue to work with our international partners to reach that goal.”"
2020-08-30T11:17:08Z,politics,Politics,Scottish Tory leader would vote against UK import of chlorinated chicken from US,"The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, has said he would vote against allowing UK imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef from the US in a post-Brexit trade deal. Ross said the UK government was listening to complaints from the National Farmers Union (NFU), which has a strong presence in his rural constituency of Moray and fears a US trade deal would threaten food standards. He said ministers in London also needed to refine their proposals on common rules for the UK’s “internal market” after the country leaves the EU single market next year. They want a mutual recognition scheme, under which quality standards in one part of the UK would automatically be accepted by all four governments.
The Scottish and Welsh governments, backed by NFU Scotland and other business organisations, say that would force devolved parliaments to accept lower quality goods that breach their quality standards, potentially including US chicken and beef. Ross said the UK could not force the US to change its food quality laws in any trade deal, but “what we can do is to say we would not allow hormone-injected beef or chlorinated raw chicken in. Our standards can be as high as they’ve always been.” Asked if he would vote against allowing those products into the UK, he said: “Absolutely. We would need legislation … I would be in no doubt and have no hesitation in voting against any legislation which would allow those products into this country. That’s a categorical assurance.” Westminster had never voted to lower the UK’s food quality and safety standards and would automatically adopt all the EU regulations when the post-Brexit transitional arrangements end in January next year, he said.
Holyrood will also acquire more than 100 new powers from the EU when the transition period ends, but ministers were still taking account of vociferous complaints about the problems with the UK government’s internal market plans, he said. “The NFU wants more reassurance on the common framework and there’s more work to be done on that,” he said. “There would be no point having the consultation if the government was just going to forge on ahead and pay no attention to what has been said. “The crucial point is that, and I reiterate it because it’s worth 545,000 jobs for Scotland, we have to have this legislation in place to protect the internal market because the alternative is the SNP leave the internal market [by seeking independence] and that would be catastrophic for our economy, for jobs in Scotland and for our businesses.” The Scottish Tories will publish plans on Monday for a programme of major infrastructure projects run jointly by the UK and Scottish governments, upgrading motorways and building new towns and industrial hubs. Ross said one proposal was to establish permanent “job security councils” in Scotland of the kind used in Sweden since the 1970s. Based on specific industries, they specialise in coaching and supporting unemployed workers. In Sweden, 90% of the unemployed return to work within a year. If they succeeded in Scotland, he said, they could be rolled out across the UK. Appointed Scottish Tory leader after Jackson Carlaw resigned suddenly on 30 July, Ross defended his plan to remain MP for Moray if he wins a Scottish parliament seat in Holyrood elections in May next year. He also plans to continue working as an assistant football referee, as well as having a young family. “My number one priority is delivering for the people of Scotland. I’m 100% committed to that,” he said. “There’s clear precedence for this. [From May 2007 to April 2010] Alex Salmond was able to be a husband, an MP, an MSP, leader of the Scottish National party and first minister of Scotland. He was able to do all of those things.”"
2020-08-29T18:56:20Z,politics,Politics,How Labour climbed 26 points to match the Tories in opinion polls,"Labour is now level-pegging with the Conservatives, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer, which shows the Tories have lost a massive 26-point lead in the five months since March. The survey – which puts the two main parties on 40% of the vote (the Conservatives are down two points and Labour up one point on a fortnight ago) – will cause further alarm in Tory ranks as internal unrest over the performance of Boris Johnson’s government grows. At the same time it will be a boost for Labour, as MPs prepare to return to Westminster on Tuesday. It is the first time since Johnson became Tory leader that Labour has been level, and caps a remarkable surge since Keir Starmer took control of the main opposition party in April.
At the end of March, in the final days of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership and when the country was rallying behind Johnson after he imposed the full lockdown on March 23, the Tories were 26 points ahead of Labour. An Opinium poll at the end of the month put them on 54% of the vote, and Labour on 28%. In the same poll at the end of March a large majority of people (65%) approved of the way the government had handled the Coronavirus crisis, while 23% disapproved. Five months on, after the UK became one of the worst performing nations and ministers executed a string of policy U-turns, the proportion approving has more than halved to 31%, and that disapproving has more than doubled to 47%. As schools prepare to reopen in England from Tuesday, a clear majority of people believe it will, however, be safe for young people to go back to the classrooms. Of those questioned, 63% think it will be safe for primary schools to reopen while 30% think it will not be. For secondary schools, 60% think it will be safe while 33% have doubts. More people (40%) blame Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, for the recent exams fiasco than lay blame at the door of the regulator Ofqual (29%) or teachers (10%). Commenting on Labour’s recovery, Adam Drummond of Opinium said: “This is the first time Labour have drawn level since July 2019 when both main parties were in freefall and losing votes to the Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats. “Since Boris Johnson became prime minister the Tories typically had a double-digit lead, peaking in March/April this year when they were seen to be handling the pandemic and lockdown fairly well while Labour changed leader. In the five months since that peak, the lead has gradually declined from 26% to 0% now.”"
2020-08-29T18:45:15Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson faces Tory wrath as party slumps in shock poll,"Boris Johnson is facing a showdown with furious Conservative MPs over his government’s chaotic handling of Covid-19, as a new poll shows the Tories have surrendered a massive lead over Labour in just five months. As MPs prepare to return to Westminster on Tuesday, Charles Walker, who is vice-chair of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, told the Observer that a recent string of U-turns had left many colleagues in despair, with some struggling to support and defend their government to constituents. Governing by U-turn in this way, he said, was unsustainable. Walker, who is normally counted as a firm Johnson loyalist, said: “Too often it looks like this government licks its finger and sticks it in the air to see which way the wind is blowing. This is not a sustainable way to approach the business of governing and government. “It is becoming increasingly difficult for backbenchers now to promote and defend government policy as so often that policy is changed or abandoned without notice. Whether this approach is by design or by accident, the climate of uncertainty it creates is unsustainable and erodes morale.” Walker and the chairman of the 1922 committee, Sir Graham Brady, are expecting to have their “ears bent” by angry colleagues when MPs reconvene in the House of Commons, before relaying those concerns and strength of feeling to No 10. “We need to take the temperature on Tuesday and Wednesday and then decide what the plan of action is,” said a 1922 committee source. The recent exams fiasco and other sudden policy reversals, most recently over the wearing of face masks in schools, led many Tory MPs to believe that Johnson and his cabinet ministers have lost their grip. Conservative MPs, including many ex-ministers with extensive experience inside government, are also increasingly angry that their voices and concerns, and those of senior Whitehall officials with many years of service, are being ignored and dismissed as power and decision-making is increasingly centred on a tight but inexperienced group within Downing Street. Today, in a further blow to Conservative morale, a poll by Opinium for the Observer shows Labour is now level-pegging with the Tories for the first time since last summer, before Johnson was leader. In just five months since the full lockdown was imposed by the prime minister, the Conservatives have lost a 26-point lead over Labour who now stand neck-and-neck with the Tories on 40%. The Liberal Democrats under their new leader Ed Davey, who was elected last week, are on 6%. Adam Drummond of Opinium said: “This is the first time Labour have drawn level since July 2019 when both main parties were in freefall and losing votes to the Brexit party and the Liberal Democrats. “Since Boris Johnson became prime minister the Tories typically had a double digit lead, peaking in March/April this year when they were seen to be handling the pandemic and lockdown fairly well while Labour changed leader. In the five months since that peak, the lead has gradually declined from 26% to 0% now.”
Anxious Conservative MPs are particularly frustrated by education secretary Gavin Williamson’s handling of the A-level and GCSE results crisis. With schools in England allowed to re-open fully for the first time since March from Tuesday, MPs and ministers believe Williamson will not survive if the return to education is mired in further chaos. Yesterday teachers and their unions launched new attacks on Williamson after his department issued last-minute guidance to schools on how to cope with Covid-19 outbreaks, giving them just days to react, having asked for months for such guidance and been dismissed. In an open letter to all parents, Williamson insists there is a firm consensus among medical experts and scientists that schools will be safe for pupils and staff. In addition, he says young people’s life chances will be severely damaged if they do not return. Williamson writes: “If a child is not in school, they stand to lose far more than just a few months of learning. It could well put a huge dent in their future life chances. Education is a birthright, so let’s make sure we get all children back – back to learning, back to playing and back to being kids again.” Johnson is due to appear before the powerful House of Commons liaison committee of senior backbenchers on 16 September, during which he will be pressured to explain his government’s shortcomings by MPs of all parties. On the same day Williamson will appear before the all-party education select committee. At the end of March, shortly after Johnson imposed the full lockdown, the Conservatives were surging ahead on 54% of the vote, with Labour, awaiting the result of the party’s leadership election, on 28%. At the time Johnson’s personal ratings were also very positive, but are now consistently well behind those of the Labour leader, Keir Starmer. • This article was amended on 31 August 2020. An error introduced in the editing process led an earlier version to say that from Tuesday, schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland would re-open for the first time since March. That meant to only refer to schools in England."
2020-08-28T19:15:21Z,politics,Politics,Chris Grayling resigns from intelligence and security committee,"Chris Grayling has resigned as a member of the intelligence and security committee six weeks after he was humiliatingly defeated in his attempt to become chair of the parliamentary watchdog. Grayling wrote to the man who beat him to the position – Julian Lewis – saying he no longer wanted to serve on the body when parliament resumes next week. There was no immediate explanation of why Grayling, a former transport and justice secretary, quit. However, a Labour source said he was “off in a sulk” and had no desire to serve as an ordinary member on the body that scrutinises Britain’s intelligence agencies. Grayling had been promised the job of chair by Boris Johnson only to fall victim in July to an ambush in which Lewis stood against him and won the nomination 5-4 with the support of Labour and SNP members. A furious Downing Street stripped the Conservative whip from Lewis, an MP since 1997, who hit back by saying that No 10 had made “an improper request” in trying to get him to support Grayling for the position. Lewis then led the publication of the long-awaited Russia report, which revealed that British government and intelligence agencies failed to conduct any proper assessment of Kremlin attempts to interfere with the 2016 Brexit referendum. Although Johnson had the right to nominate five Conservatives to the nine-member committee following the election win, it was not actually up to him to pick the chair. Instead once the prime minister and leaders of the main opposition parties put forward those who will serve on the body, that group meets to elect their head, a process designed to ensure the body’s independence. The attempt to impose Grayling was controversial even among Conservatives because of his record as a cabinet minister. As transport secretary, he presided over the collapse of Northern and Thameslink rail services and the granting of a no-deal Brexit ferry contract to a company with no ships. As justice secretary, he part-privatised the probation service and banned prisoners from receiving books from relatives, a measure that was overturned in the courts. The ISC said: “The Rt Hon Chris Grayling MP has, in accordance with the Justice and Security Act, written to the chairman of the intelligence and security committee of parliament tendering his resignation from the committee. The chairman has sent a reply.”"
2020-08-28T16:18:48Z,politics,Politics,MPs call on Jacob Rees-Mogg to extend hybrid parliament system,"MPs are calling on Jacob Rees-Mogg to extend the system that has allowed them to work from home, which is due to expire next week as the summer recess ends. Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has been keen for as many MPs as possible to return to Westminster, with the government hoping to “lead by example” in encouraging employees back to their workplaces. But opposition parties are demanding an extension of the “hybrid parliament” arrangements that allowed them to take part in proceedings by video-link, appearing on large screens in the Commons chamber. Ed Davey, the new leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: “Hybrid proceedings are still an absolute necessity. With areas of the UK still in lockdown and the threat of spikes in the virus remaining very real, there will be many parliamentarians and parliamentary staff with good reason for being unable to be in Westminster in person.” Some MPs are warning that they have underlying health conditions while others are in areas where local restrictions are tighter and do not want to risk travelling across the country. Andrew Gwynne, the Labour MP for Denton and Reddish in Greater Manchester, has documented his struggles with “long Covid” – the long-term effects of the coronavirus suffered by some of those who contract it. He said: “Clearly the government would like MPs to go back to sitting in parliament permanently, but that just isn’t going to be possible for a small number of people. Either for public health reasons, because they’re coming from parts of the country that are facing local lockdowns, and what you don’t want to do is inadvertently become a super-spreader and give it to other MPs who then go back to their own constituencies that are relatively Covid-free and start polluting their own areas. But also, there are people like myself who are still struggling with the long-term impacts of coronavirus. “On a good day I would probably be able to cope OK, but I can’t plan which is going to be my good day and which is going to be my bad day. And my constituents should not be disenfranchised.”
The SNP’s spokesman on the Cabinet Office, Tommy Sheppard, said: “The return of parliament is a significant test for the UK government, as we are still in the middle of a global health pandemic and know that social distancing is impossible in parts of Westminster.” He called for the hybrid arrangements to be extended to the end of the year. “In accordance with the guidance for those who live in Scotland, where working from home is possible, SNP members and our staff are encouraged to do so,” he said. During the early stages of the lockdown an electronic voting system was introduced in parliament, but Rees-Mogg later replaced that with voting in person, which caused long, distanced queues to snake through the Palace of Westminster in what sceptical MPs nicknamed the “Rees-Mogg conga”.
MPs with health concerns can request a proxy vote, which is exercised on their behalf by party whips. Gwynne said the electronic voting system was preferable. “It’s not for me not to trust the whips, but I would far sooner cast the vote myself and be fully accountable to the electorate than trust my whip to do the job for me,” he said. The hybrid system will expire at the end of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting unless the government tables a motion to extend it. A spokesperson said: “In July we extended arrangements to allow for remote participation in scrutiny proceedings until 2 September. The position will be assessed when the House of Commons returns from the summer recess.” The shadow disabilities minister, Vicky Foxcroft, who has rheumatoid arthritis and was advised to shield earlier in the outbreak, said: “If you look at the government’s own comms on this stuff, it says if you were shielding, work from home if possible; your employer should support you to do this. So they’re saying one thing to everybody else and then saying something else in parliament.”"
2020-08-28T16:12:14Z,politics,Politics,UK Border Force aims to check less than third of arrivals for test-and-trace forms,"Border Force officials have been set a target of checking less than a third of arrivals to the UK to ensure they have forms to aid test-and-trace efforts, sources have told the Guardian. It raises the prospect that hundreds of thousands of people have entered the country without the documents being inspected. Dozens of travellers have contacted the Guardian to raise concerns over a lack of checks. Arrivals in the UK from abroad must submit a passenger locator form online beforehand, to be shown at the border either in printed form or on a mobile device. Failure to provide details risks a fine of up to £100.
Border Force officers “will use the QR code at the top of the document to check you have completed the form successfully”, the government says. Information including the passenger’s UK address and travel details is used to check that individuals are self-isolating if necessary or to warn them if they have come into contact with travellers with Covid-19. Border Force aims to spot-check 30% of arrivals for passenger locator forms, according to a target understood to be contained in a weekly update circulated in Whitehall. It states that between 17 and 23 August, 10% of those spot-checked by Border Force had not filled out the forms. Home Office figures published this week show 1.3 million passengers arrived in the UK by air in July. It is understood that the checks need to be made manually by Border Force officials, with no automated system of logging passenger locator form details when passports are scanned. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: “Passenger locator forms are a crucial part of a functioning test, track and isolate system. These are deeply worrying findings, amounting to yet another example of failing to implement effective protective measures at UK borders. This issue needs to be addressed urgently for the sake of public health and to reassure travellers.”
More than half of the 136 people who responded to a Guardian callout about arrivals to the UK said their passenger locator forms had not been checked. Peter de Groot, 72, who flew into London’s Heathrow airport from Kenya this month, described the monitoring in the airport as “a scandal”. “When I got there they seemed really disinterested. There was far more security getting into a Kenyan supermarket,” he said. “Nobody checked I filled in the form; I felt it was quite disgraceful. There was a digital thermometer sat on a desk, but no one there to man it. It seemed like the government were expecting the airlines to do their work for them. It’s pathetic.” Colin Beesely, a secondary school assistant principal who lives in Stratford-upon-Avon, said he was shocked at the difference in measures when he arrived at Stansted from Spain in the first week of August. “When we arrived in Spain, our QR code was scanned by two police officers and we were led into a foyer where our temperature was taken. Only then were we permitted to leave the terminal,” Beesely, 60, said. “When we got to Stansted, there was nothing, we just walked out. We were really angry because you’re either doing this seriously or not. The absolute lack of people to check documentation upon our arrival speaks volumes.” Many reported failings onboard ferries and trains. A 45-year-old man from Essex said he had not been aware that he had to complete a form until he boarded his ferry home from a holiday in France, but he was not stopped or asked for further details. Only three fixed-penalty notices were handed out by police to people who failed to self-isolate after arriving in England and Wales between 15 June and 17 August, according to figures published by the National Police Chiefs’ Council on Thursday. Lucy Moreton of the ISU union, which represents Border Force staff, confirmed she was aware of the 30% target for checks. “The primary problem with performing those checks is the length of time that it takes to do it,” she said. “They have the time if that is what government directs, but the impact of that would be significant queuing. If we were to check 100% we’d have to turn the e-gates off, and at the moment over half our traffic goes through e-gates, and of course e-gates can’t check a health locator form.”
A spokesman for the Public and Commercial Services Union said: “The current quarantine measures put a burden on staff to such a degree that only 30% of passengers can be checked. Due to financial cuts and agreed queuing targets in conjunction with social distancing measures, it is logistically impossible for 100% of passengers to be checked on arriving at airports.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Passengers do not to need to hand a passenger locator form to a Border Force officer on arrival, the form is completed and submitted online. “Border Force continues to operate a spot-check regime so passengers may be asked to show proof they have completed the form to an officer. We are seeing a high level of compliance and we expect this to continue as everyone plays their part to help stop the spread of this disease.”"
2020-08-28T14:38:59Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson urged to set out credible back-to-office plan,"Boris Johnson has been urged to produce a “credible plan” for persuading more workers to return to the office instead of relying on what unions have condemned as a “scare campaign”. The prime minister, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have become increasingly concerned about the impact on city centre economies of the shift towards home-working during the pandemic. They are expected to launch a publicity campaign in the coming days to encourage more workers to return to the office, and advise employers about what they can do to keep staff safe. On Friday, Downing Street distanced the government from reports that ministers planned to argue that working from home could put employees at greater risk of being fired. Responding to a Daily Telegraph headline that said: “Go back to work or risk losing your job”, a government source said: “This is a deeply irresponsible headline with no truth behind it. Our priority has always and will always be protecting people’s jobs.” The Trades Union Congress general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said the government’s priority should be improving the test-and-trace system, and tackling practical issues, such as transport and childcare. “The prime minister needs a credible plan to help more people travel and work safely, not a scare campaign. “Throughout this crisis millions of people have worked extremely hard from home, often in cramped bedrooms with limited equipment or balancing work with childcare. “Many now want a better balance of office- and home-based working. But before this can happen, ministers must take responsibility for guaranteeing workers’ safety with a fast and reliable test-and-trace system, and better enforcement of transport safety and workplace risk assessments.” She said the government should “wake up” to the impact limited childcare provision was having on many parents’ ability to return to work. The Confederation of British Industry’s director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, has warned of the risk of “ghost towns” if more office workers do not return to their workplaces. But industry experts cautioned against the idea that the government should decide when was the right time to return. Kate Shoesmith, the director of sales and marketing at the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said: “Steadily reopening the economy, including workplaces, is important for reducing the long-term effects of this crisis on jobs, incomes and opportunities. But when to reopen is a choice for individual businesses to make in collaboration with their staff. Public health and safety has to be the number one priority. “Government’s focus should be on making sure their guidance is clear, that public transport can be used safely, and that businesses have access to enough health and safety supplies.”
Peter Cheese, the chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said: “The government’s drive for individuals to return to their workplace should not leave them feeling pressured or duty-bound to do so.” He added that working from home had proved successful for many staff and organisations, with CIPD research having found that a majority of employers believed homeworkers were either as productive as other workers, or more so. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said on Friday there was a limit “in human terms” to remote working. Speaking on Sky News from his home, Shapps said: “What we’re saying to people is it is now safe to go back to work and your employer should have made arrangements which are appropriate to make sure that it is coronavirus-safe to work and you will see some changes if you haven’t been in for a bit as a result. “The vast majority of employers just want to get their businesses back up and running, they want to do the right thing, and many will have found that, actually, home-working can work for some of their employees.” But he added: “I think there’s a limit, just in human terms, to remote working. And there are things where you just need to spark off each other and get together in order to make progress. So I think common sense will prevail.”"
2020-08-28T13:58:33Z,politics,Politics,Barnier 'flabbergasted' at UK attempt to reopen Brexit specialty food debate,"The UK government has renewed its attempt to reopen the chapter of the Brexit divorce treaty protecting specialty food and drink, such as Parma ham, roquefort cheese and champagne, in a move that left the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, “a little bit flabbergasted”. The British proposal on protected status for food and drink was included in a draft free-trade agreement handed to Barnier by his opposite number, David Frost, last week, according to two EU sources. But EU officials have ruled out diluting the divorce deal provisions that protect more than 3,000 high-end food and drink products from copycats. “It’s just not going to happen,” said one official.
The withdrawal agreement signed between Boris Johnson and EU leaders last October preserves the status of food and drink protected under the EU’s geographical indications (GI) policy. A top priority for EU trade negotiators, these rules bar English or Spanish vintners from calling their sparkling wine champagne, for example, while only crumbly cheese from Greece can be labelled feta. Under the withdrawal treaty, the protection applies “unless and until” a new deal can be negotiated. According to EU sources, the UK is attempting to water down protection for EU geographical indications, while keeping the special status for British produce, such as Scotch whisky, Melton Mowbray pork pies and Cornish pasties. The return of the proposal, floated in the early stages of trade talks last spring, caused astonishment. “The asymmetry was met with open mouths. Why would you even suggest that in a serious negotiation?” said the EU source. Barnier was “a little bit flabbergasted”, the person added. The government disputes the EU description of its proposal and argues Barnier is making unprecedented demands to tie Britain to European standards – demands, it says, not made on other trade partners such as Canada or Japan. A UK government official said the British proposal on specialty foods was “in line with the withdrawal agreement” and would provide protection for existing and future GIs for both sides “as is standard” across the EU’s free-trade agreements. “The UK proposal would allow existing EU GIs that meet the requirements of the UK’s new domestic regime to be protected in the UK,” the official said. British negotiators argue they signed up to the food provisions in the withdrawal treaty in the expectation they would be superseded by a future deal. Frost, a former chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, which campaigns to stop foreign rivals using the name “Scotch”, included the GI proposal in a draft trade agreement he hoped would inject new momentum into the stalled negotiations. But the British “consolidated text” has gone down badly in Brussels. In trade negotiations, usually both sides work out a consolidated text once they have agreed on general principles. The British text is said to incorporate wording on which both sides agree, but also highlights areas of disagreement. One EU diplomat, who had not seen the text, said it was “not very useful because it focused mainly on offensive issues for the UK”, meaning issues where the government is seeking an advantage. The UK has not said if it plans to publish the text sent to Barnier. Sandro Gozi, an Italian MEP elected on the ticket of the French centrist party La République En Marche, cast doubt on whether the UK intended to unwind the protected food provisions of the withdrawal agreement. “If it was real, from a French or an Italian perspective, we cannot go back on geographical indications. Geographical indications are the priority No 1 of any new trade agreement for the EU.” Brussels negotiators are warning only a few weeks remain to seal a deal before the EU deadline of late October. “The next negotiation round in September will be crucial,” said a second EU diplomat. “If it ends without any progress as well, the window to close a deal will close quickly. Time would simply be running out.” The EU has said it needs around two months to legally fine-tune and ratify a treaty before the end of the transition period on 31 December."
2020-08-28T08:09:10Z,politics,Politics,Grant Shapps says it is safe to return to work in offices in England,"The UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps has said it is safe to go back to work in England, as the government prepares to launch a publicity drive to persuade the public to return to the office. Ministers are concerned about the prospects for city centre businesses if more office workers fail to return to their workplaces. The Cabinet Office will take out ads in regional newspapers after schoolchildren in England return to the classroom next week, advising employers about how to make their offices Covid-secure, and encouraging the public to feel safe to go back. Speaking on Sky News from his home, Shapps said: “What we’re saying to people is it is now safe to go back to work and your employer should have made arrangements which are appropriate to make sure that it is coronavirus-safe to work and you will see some changes if you haven’t been in for a bit as a result.” He said there was a limit, “in human terms”, to remote working. “The vast majority of employers just want to get their businesses back up and running, they want to do the right thing, and many will have found that actually home working can work for some of their employees.” But he added: “I think there’s a limit, just in human terms, to remote working. And there are things where you just need to spark off each other and get together in order to make progress. So I think common sense will prevail between employers and employees.”
The sandwich chain Pret a Manger announced on Thursday it would cut nearly 2,900 jobs after the desertion of high streets due to the coronavirus pandemic sent its sales plummeting, underlining the potential impact of changing work habits. The CBI’s director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, has warned that city centres could become “ghost towns” unless more is done to help. Labour has urged the government to provide more support for high street businesses – in particular those that are still seeing a sharp decline in trade due to government restrictions. The shadow business and consumer minister, Lucy Powell, said: “It’s no wonder businesses and workers don’t feel confident about going to the office given the government’s confusing and inconsistent messaging.
“Ministers must come forward with a clear plan to reassure businesses they can safely return, supported by a working test and trace system.” Downing Street sources distanced the government from reports that ministers would argue that working from home could put employees more at risk of being fired. Responding to a Daily Telegraph headline that said, “Go back to work or risk losing your job,” a government source said: “This is a deeply irresponsible headline with no truth behind it. Our priority has always and will always be protecting people’s jobs.” In a separate interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Shapps cited the impact on workers’ mental health of staying at home – pointing to the experience of young workers, in flat-shares, on video-conference calls all day “from a corner of their bedroom”. “For a lot of people, it will be the right time to return,” he said. Asked whether the dramatic changes in work habits kicked off by the lockdown could become permanent, with a knock-on effect on many city centre firms, Shapps said: “I don’t agree with this apocalyptic view of the workplace, but I do agree that we’re going to be in a period of quite tremendous change at the moment.”"
2020-08-28T06:00:16Z,politics,Politics,Number of UK civil servants leaving Whitehall rises by 9% in a year,"The number of civil servants leaving their profession has risen by 9% over the last year, new figures reveal amid growing concern over morale following a string of high-profile resignations and sackings across Whitehall. The statistics have been released as Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said officials are now “carrying the can for the failure of ministers” following Boris Johnson’s decision to remove the Department for Education’s permanent secretary, Jonathan Slater, on Wednesday. Slater’s sacking came the day after the resignation of Sally Collier, chief executive of Ofqual, the exam regulator at the centre of the A-level results scandal. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has survived. The changes come after Johnson’s top aide Dominic Cummings, an avowed Whitehall reformer, said “a hard rain” was going to fall on the civil service.
According to Cabinet Office statistics, 34,070 people left the civil service in 2019-20 up from 31,240 the previous year, while less than 30,000 left the service in 2017-2018. Dave Penman, head of the FDA union which represents the UK’s most senior public servants, said the new figures may be a reflection of waning morale since Johnson’s government took over last July. “At a time when the civil service is growing, it should start to raise concern that not only has the number of those leaving increased over the last three years, but that it grew by 9% last year. “There can of course be many reasons for this, but as we have repeatedly warned, if ministers – and indeed the prime minister – continue to undermine, brief against and discard committed public servants for political expediency, it will come as no surprise if increasingly, those that the country relies on to deliver vital public services choose to go elsewhere.” He added: “The toxic culture being created by this government, where civil servants are routinely trashed in the press by anonymous briefings from inside government and senior leaders discarded for political expediency, inevitably destroys trust and goodwill over time. The [new] statistics … may signal for the first time that, as a result, civil servants are increasingly choosing to work elsewhere.” The most common reason for leaving this year was resignation, accounting for nearly half (15,810) of all leavers, the statistics released on Wednesday said. The next most common reason was retirement, while 2,570 people were dismissed from the service. Slater’s exit follows several high-profile departures of senior civil servants from government. The cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, will step down in the coming weeks, as will the Foreign Office permanent secretary Sir Simon McDonald. The highest ranking civil servant in the ministry of justice, Sir Richard Heaton, announced last month that he would not seek reappointment at the end of his five-year term this summer.
Those moves come after the resignation of Sir Philip Rutnam from the Home Office in February. He is taking the home secretary, Priti Patel, to an employment tribunal under whistleblowing legislation, claiming he was victimised for trying to stop her from bullying staff. Patel denies the allegations. Lord Kerslake, who left government in 2014 and has since advised Labour, said it was a “disgrace” Slater had been sacked while Williamson has stayed in place. “I know Jonathan Slater well. He is an extraordinarily experienced and capable civil servant. And I believe there was nothing wrong with the quality of his advice, there’s everything wrong with the quality of the minister receiving it,” he told Civil Service World.
He said civil servants were feeling “undervalued and insecure” and that “they don’t think the relationship is working between civil servants and ministers”. “This is really not good stuff. I think we’re going to see a diminishing trust between the civil service and ministers which is crucial and an unwillingness to give the honest advice that’s needed,” he said. Johnson faced criticism this week for suggesting that a “mutant algorithm” was to blame for chaos over A-level and GCSE grade estimates in recent weeks. Speaking to year 11 pupils at Castle Rock high school in Leicestershire on Wednesday, the prime minister acknowledged that the process must have been “stressful” for those involved. Helen Hayes, the shadow cabinet minister, said there had been a pattern of civil servants time and again taking the fall for ministers. “We certainly need more transparency and an investigation would be the right way to go about establishing whether there were any issues in both of these departments [DfE and Ofqual],” she told Radio 4’s Today programme. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “The latest statistics show the civil service headcount is currently almost 11,000 higher than last year.”"
2020-08-27T18:14:52Z,politics,Politics,"Home Office wrong to refer to 'activist lawyers', top official admits","The most senior civil servant at the Home Office has conceded that officials should not have used the phrase “activist lawyers” in a promotional video posted on Twitter, although the tweet remains online. The post on Wednesday described the department’s efforts to deport people with no right to remain in the UK and attacked “activist lawyers” for frustrating the process, prompting a furious response from barristers and solicitors. Matthew Rycroft, the Home Office’s permanent secretary, said in response to a complaint that he had told his team the term should not be used again. On Thursday night, the Home Office confirmed that a charter flight that was due to depart to Spain carrying asylum seekers who arrived in the UK on small boats had been cancelled. Home Office sources said the reason for the cancellation was due to a high volume of legal challenges. While its statement on the cancellation did not make any reference to “activist lawyers” it suggests that without the last-minute challenges the flight could have gone ahead. Earlier, writing to Jonathan Portes, a professor of economics at King’s College London, Rycroft had said: “The general point the video is making is that our efforts to facilitate legitimate and legal returns are often frustrated by individuals and lawyers putting in last-minute claims. These claims are very often entirely without merit, but have the effect of timing out a return due to stringent Dublin regulations. “However, I agree that the phrase you quote should not have been used on an official government channel. I have made clear to the team that this post should not be used again from Home Office accounts or anywhere else by civil servants.” The Dublin regulation is an EU law that broadly determines which member state is responsible for the examination of an asylum application.
The Guardian approached the Home Office for comment, which declined to issue a refreshed statement and instead pointed to a tweet sent by Portes in which an extract of Rycroft’s response was included.
Referring to the cancelled charter flight, a Home Office spokesperson said: “The government’s efforts to facilitate entirely legitimate and legal returns of people who have entered the UK through illegal routes are too often frustrated by last-minute challenges submitted hours before a scheduled flight. These claims are very often baseless and entirely without merit, but are given full legal consideration, leading to removal being rescheduled.” Portes had written directly to Rycroft arguing that the video was not consistent with the Government Communications Service (GCS) “propriety guidance” stating that messages should “be objective and explanatory, not biased or polemical”, as well as “sensitive to tone and guard against perceived attacks on particular interests, organisations or individuals”. Portes told the Guardian: “One of the jobs of civil servants is to communicate government policy. But they’re not allowed to use polemical language like this or target a particular group. This was way over the line. The prompt reaction of the permanent secretary is very welcome. I hope comms teams across Whitehall take note.” Lawyers condemned the video. Simon Davis, the president of the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, said: “Attacks on the integrity of the legal profession undermine the rule of law. Solicitors advise their clients on their rights under the laws created by parliament. To describe lawyers who are upholding the law as ‘activist lawyers’ is misleading and dangerous.” Toufique Hossain, director of public law at Duncan Lewis, one of the “activist lawyers” the Home Office is referring to, demanded an apology from the Home Office. “In the light of the senior Home Office official accepting that it as wrong for the Home Office to use this term we would like an apology from Priti Patel. The cancellation of today’s charter flight shows that lawyers simply made legal representations. It was not us who forced the Home Office to cancel today’s charter flight. They took that decision themselves.” Amanda Pinto QC, the chair of the Bar Council, which represents all barristers in England and Wales, said: “Irresponsible, misleading communications from the government around the job that lawyers do in the public interest are extremely damaging to our society. “Legal professionals who apply the law and follow parliament’s express intention are not ‘activists’. They are merely doing their jobs, enabling people to exercise their statutory rights and defend themselves against those in power. Without those lawyers, our system would crumble.” David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, said: “The Home Office’s misleading attack on solicitors who represent migrants is a deeply troubling attack on the rule of law. “The British legal system is respected around the world because of its reputation for fairness and independence. We should be proud that everyone who needs it is entitled to legal representation. “The Home Office should recognise its misjudgment by deleting the video.” Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the PCS union, which represents civil servants, said the video was “a callous and inaccurate portrayal of a complicated issue which needs compassionate and calm discussion. People fleeing persecution have the right to seek asylum in the UK, and they have the right to be treated with dignity and humanity. “To use a graphics similar to Dad’s Army and equating that with migrants fleeing war and famine is politically and morally repugnant. “Home Office staff do an important job often in very difficult circumstances. And the last thing they need is the home secretary [Priti Patel] playing crude political games.”"
2020-08-27T18:04:44Z,politics,Politics,'Wake up and smell the coffee': Ed Davey elected Lib Dem leader,"Ed Davey urged the Liberal Democrats to “wake up and smell the coffee” , as he was declared his party’s fourth leader in five years following a string of poor general election performances. Davey, who has been acting leader since last December, was a cabinet minister in the 2010-2015 coalition government. He beat his rival for the post, Layla Moran, by a wider-than-expected margin of 42,756 votes to 24,564. In a livestreamed acceptance speech on Thursday, Davey said: “My job, as from today, is to rebuild the Lib Dems to national relevance.” He said the Lib Dems were “powerful advocates locally”, but on the national stage “we have to face the facts of three disappointing general election results”. The Lib Dems have just 11 MPs, and recent opinion polls have put them on 5-10% of the vote, suggesting Davey faces a tough challenge in rebuilding electoral support. “Voters don’t believe the Lib Dems want to help ordinary people get on in life,” he told members who had tuned in to see his acceptance speech. “Voters don’t believe we share their values. And voters don’t believe we are on the side of people like them. Voters have been sending us a message, but we have not been listening. It is time for us to start listening,” he said. “I am listening now.” He promised to travel the UK in the coming weeks, adding: “I will face up to uncomfortable truths, and I will make your concerns my own.” But like the other party leaders, Davey will be denied the platform of a full annual conference to stamp his authority on the party in person. This year’s event, which was due to be held in Brighton, has been moved online.
Davey stressed his ministerial experience and commitment to tackling climate change during a drawn-out contest. He told the Guardian as he launched his campaign in June that he believed his experience as a young carer for his terminally ill mother had given him the compassion to help create a more caring society. “That would be a very big part of what I’d like to see the Liberal Democrats talking about: how we build a more caring society. And if we can make common cause with others for a caring agenda, I’d like to do that.” Davey described the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, as someone he could work with – in contrast to the Lib Dems’ frosty relationship with Jeremy Corbyn. Davey was energy and climate change secretary in the coalition government. He lost his Kingston and Surbiton seat at the 2015 general election when the Lib Dems, then led by Nick Clegg, were punished for forming a pact with the Conservatives. Davey won his seat back and returned to parliament in 2017. He went on to double his majority in 2019 when his Conservative rival was Aphra Brandreth, the daughter of the veteran broadcaster and former MP Gyles Brandreth. Clegg, who is now a senior executive at Facebook, made a rare intervention into UK politics by congratulating Davey, saying his “resilience, humanity and experience” would serve the party well.
The leadership contest was initially shelved for a year as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, before being rescheduled for the summer. Davey’s predecessor, Jo Swinson, was leader for just five months after defeating Davey decisively in last year’s leadership contest. She expanded the parliamentary party with defections from Labour, and made stopping Brexit the Lib Dems’ overriding aim, echoing the tactics of Vince Cable who had raised eyebrows by posing with “bollocks to Brexit” leaflets before last May’s European elections. Swinson fought the 2019 general election claiming to be a potential prime minister, but ended up losing her own seat to the SNP. All of the former Labour MPs who joined the Lib Dems after forming the breakaway group Change UK, including Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger, lost their seats. Davey was Swinson’s deputy during that general election campaign, which a damning internal report described as a “high-speed car crash”. Moran, 37, was a teacher before entering parliament in 2016. She is currently the Lib Dems’ education spokesperson, and had been expected to shift the party to the left if she won. In a video message to her supporters, Moran congratulated Davey on his victory and said she was ready to work with him to “change our party so that we can change the country,” adding, “I’m so excited now to just get cracking.”"
2020-08-27T15:48:11Z,politics,Politics,Â£13 a day to self-isolate 'a slap in the face' for low-paid in England,"The government’s trial scheme to pay low-paid workers in England up to £13 a day to self-isolate over coronavirus has been described as a “slap in the face” that could leave millions of people without enough money on which to live. Scientists, political leaders and trade unions said the “paltry” amount should be increased to cover any lost income, and the scheme should be expanded to millions of workers across England, and not just those in coronavirus hotspots. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), said the government’s test-and-trace system would fail unless people could afford to self-isolate when required to do so. “These paltry payments will not make the difference needed,” she said. In a trial starting on Tuesday in Oldham, Pendle and Blackburn with Darwen, which all have high infection rates, low-paid workers who test positive for Covid-19 will receive £130 for their 10-day isolation period – £13 a day – if they cannot work from home. People they have been in close contact with, including members of their household, who have to isolate for 14 days will get £182. The amounts equate to about a fifth of the median weekly wage in Greater Manchester, where part of the trial is being held. The move follows weeks of campaigning by regional mayors, councils and trade unions who said millions of people across the country could not afford to isolate without pay for a fortnight.
Workers will have to show proof of employment or self-employment, be unable to work from home, and be receiving universal credit or working tax credit in order to be eligible for the scheme. The Department of Health and Social Care said stringent checks would be carried out on people to prevent fraud, and the payments would aim to be made within 48 hours of evidence being provided. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said the amount was based on statutory sick pay (SSP) of £95.85 a week, but it was roundly criticised as going “nowhere near far enough”. There are an estimated 300,000 people in Greater Manchester who may not be able to afford to self-isolate, including self-employed people and 90,000 workers who do not qualify for SSP because their incomes are too low. These include hospital porters, cleaners, warehouse workers and hospitality staff. Prof Susan Michie, the director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours, a government advisory group, said the payments were not enough and should not be limited to people living in areas with high infection rates. “This is a question of guaranteeing no financial loss,” she said. Stephen Reicher, another member of the Sage subcommittee on behavioural science, described the scheme as “woefully inadequate in multiple ways”, adding that the financial support should be increased and expanded across England. Mohammed Iqbal, the leader of Pendle borough council, one of the areas where the scheme is being trialled, said: “I welcome the fact that there is a financial package in place but the figures that the government has introduced are really a slap in the face for those people who sadly test positive.” Dominic Harrison, the director of public health at Blackburn with Darwen council, said the self-isolation payments should be equivalent to the jury service fee of £64.95 a day. Steve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool city region, said the figure “falls far below what people need” and would force people to “choose between putting food on the table or keeping their communities safe”. He said people should be able to claim back any lost wages from the government. Hancock told Times Radio the scheme was “the first step in paying people to self-isolate” and suggested the payment could be raised if the trial were expanded. Jim McMahon, the Labour MP for Oldham West and Royton, said it was nowhere near enough to replace the lost income of people such as taxi drivers, warehouse workers, delivery drivers and security operators who would face a choice between self-isolating without pay or providing for their families. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, who led calls for low-paid workers to be paid their full normal wage for the quarantine period, said he was pleased ministers had acknowledged the issue but the scheme it went “nowhere near far enough” and would “leave people without enough to live on”. He added: “The health secretary has already said that he couldn’t live on statutory sick pay at £95 a week. So how can an announcement like this work?”"
2020-08-27T14:41:47Z,politics,Politics,Ed Davey's entirely inconsequential speech: the quintessential Lib Dem event | John Crace,"Maybe a cardiograph could have picked up a hint of a heartbeat, but to the untrained eye the Lib Dem leadership contest appeared to have been flatlining almost from the start. It’s not as if the Lib Dems don’t try to provide excitement – this was the fourth leadership election in five years. And some of the party’s core membership might have picked up on fractious areas of dissent between Ed Davey and Layla Moran – at least 87 people tuned into one YouTube hustings – but the rest of us were either totally unaware the contest was taking place or just didn’t care one way or the other. But all good things – and, indeed, all relatively indifferent things – must come to an end and in an online announcement shortly after 11.30 by the Lib Dem president, Mark Pack, it was revealed that Ed Davey was the winner. The same Ed Davey who had come a distant second to Jo Swinson last time round. The same Jo Swinson who had gone on both to lose her seat and all but obliterate the party in the polls in December’s election after insisting she was a genuine contender to become prime minister. Voters may be a bit dim at times, but not that dim.
Prior to the declaration, the Lib Dems had tried to inject a little excitement into proceedings by insisting that the vote had been incredibly tight, but Davey romped home by 45,756 to 24,564. Moran hadn’t even bothered to turn up to the result with a victory speech prepared just in case. Their only exchange appeared to be one rather awkward, and not entirely socially distanced, handshake at the very end. Though by then someone had switched the lights off and it wasn’t easy to see who was doing what to whom. Still, you had to admire the commitment to the environment. Davey strode to the podium wearing a black face mask, which he removed before speaking. He began by thanking Moran for the way she had fought the campaign, for inspiring the youth vote – though, luckily for him, in insufficient numbers – and reassuring her that she had an important role to play in the future. Which, given that there are just 11 Lib Dem MPs, including Davey and Moran, felt like the least he could do. When it comes to a Lib Dem shadow cabinet, everyone is included. For a short while Ed looked overcome with emotion as he went on to thank his family for their support – it can’t be easy to keep your spirits up when 93% of the country haven’t got a clue who you are, your party is polling on just 6% and almost everything you do is bound to make no difference – but he then reined back the tears and went into the standard off-the-shelf acceptance speech. One that serviceably filled his allotted 10 minutes slot without actually saying anything of any interest.
This was the highlight of his last 30 years – it takes all sorts – and he was proud to say he loved the party. “I believe in it,” he said. “But it is time to wake up and smell the coffee.” One could argue that moment had come five years ago when it was hammered by voters for its role in the coalition government, but no one wanted to spoil the moment. Davey also referred to the last three elections in which its results had been “disappointing”. Disappointing as in completely catastrophic. “It’s time to listen,” he continued. “And I am listening now. Whether you are from the north or the south of somewhere in between. Whether you are a brexiteer or remainer, I will travel up and down the country to meet you.” The thought did occur that it might have been better if he had decided to do a bit of listening a while ago. After all, he was the cabinet member in the coalition government who had voted both for austerity measures and tuition fees. A bit of listening to potential Lib Dem voters back then could have made all the difference. Indeed, it was hard to wonder if Davey wasn’t still part of the problem, rather than the solution. Though more that 42,000 party members had thought otherwise. And that was about it. There was no great vision for the future of the Lib Dems. No hint as to whether Davey would be working with Labour and the SNP to fight the increasingly illiberal policies of the Boris Johnson government. No hint of how he would stop those unhappy few who had voted Lib Dem last time because they couldn’t stomach Jeremy Corbyn from drifting back to Labour now Keir Starmer was in charge. No hint of anything very much. All of which made it more or less the quintessential Lib Dem event. Thoroughly niche and almost entirely inconsequential. Quite where the party goes from here is anyone’s guess. Davey doesn’t appear to be the man with the charisma to spark a revival. Nor someone to necessarily safeguard the remaining 6%. Maybe then the election was less a leadership contest and more an entry for the annual Darwin awards. Now that would be something. The first political party to contribute to human evolution by selecting itself out of the gene pool and becoming extinct via its own actions."
2020-08-27T10:40:30Z,politics,Politics,Ed Davey's first job is to heal divisions in Lib Dem membership,"Ed Davey now faces his first political battle – healing a divided Liberal Democrat membership. For a leadership contest described politely by activists as “mellow”, internal party divisions crystalised this summer and activists grew more and more fractious. The party hasn’t had much luck picking its leaders of late – this is election number four in five years and follows another period of turmoil after Jo Swinson’s 2019 election wipeout. They are on 11 MPs. Polling is at 6% nationally, yet the membership is a healthy 120,000. The demands on the new leader are vast and neither candidate quite represented the full package members seemed to want. Just some of the faultlines on the horizon are familiar territory: does tacking to the left equal electoral success, is it wise to sever all links with the coalition years, what do they do about Brexit and how do they respect party structures and the old-timers who felt sidelined under Swinson? However, a row igniting Lib Dem activists in the final days of the campaign was who has the best appeal for the youth vote. And with this comes the split between those wanting safety and stability after Swinson’s shoot-for-the-moon vision of becoming prime minister, and those pushing for bolder policies and a fresh face. The party’s under-30s are deeply impatient for change, frequently referencing the Thornhill review into the election disaster that said the base had not been listened to enough. Davey “represents the past, the link to coalition”, some have said, and in his time as acting leader he has not cut through in the media. One member cruelly dubbed him “Sir Six Percent” – a nod to that dire polling. This explains why Moran, 37, was a big draw for some. The half-Palestinian, pansexual, ex-teacher ticked a lot of boxes for members who even in their early 20s describe themselves unflatteringly as pale, male and stale. One member joked that under Moran they may even have the chance to be a little bit “cool”. Daniel Newton, 22, from Hartford, who campaigned for her, said: “She’s done so much work with the climate strikes and with schools. “It’s now about having a distinct vision and [to] hone in on education, the economy and environment.” With Moran, who only came into parliament in 2017, they felt they could get a political clean bill of health free from the millstone of tuition fees and Cameron-era policy. Jack Haines, a 22-year-old councillor in Hull, said being a young Lib Dem is like being constantly haunted by the past. “I’m still hit with ‘you voted for the bedroom tax’ in the council chamber now. I just say: ‘I was in year seven at the time’. I want the party to move past that type of thing.” The challenge now is “exciting policies” he said. “If we don’t, it’s a bleak future.” Callum Clafferty, 18, who lives in County Durham and who backed Moran in part for her appeal to younger voters, said: “People still don’t think the Lib Dems care about young people … the tuition fees, the cuts to the carer’s allowance … it really is so frustrating. Success is winning back seats but what would be more successful to me is gaining back the trust of voters.” Both men are loyalists though and would have happily worked with anyone. However, one young member said a Davey victory would be thoroughly deflating and rumbling in the background are members who may genuinely want to quit the party. An older activist with more than 25 years’ experience said he was aware that Davey potentially had zero youth appeal but backed him because he thought he would always be the best option at an election. On the immediate risk of members quitting, he said: “I could see some people going under Ed. For some members of the party it’s more of the same and not different enough. Of course the idea of a radical left party is naturally appealing to some but is it shoring up the soft Tory vote? We need to remember most of our target seats are those areas. Your Guildfords and Eastbournes, middle England. “To the public this has probably been a boring election but for the party it’s probably been one of the more fractious internally.” Davey, a former energy secretary and MP with more than 20 years experience in Westminster, served as acting leader from December 2019. He was beaten by Swinson in a landslide election last summer. Overall, he shares similar policy ground with Moran and it hasn’t always been easy in this summer’s digital hustings to pull them apart. They both talk compellingly about the environment and support the climate strikes. They both want to promote other issues, not just discuss Brexit. Sophie Thornton, 24, from Sheffield, who works for a learning disability charity, backed Davey but said any leader now has to think hard about the Conservative-facing seats. She said it would be wrong to assume that future success for the party could be built on only appealing to the left, which is what some say Moran bases her appeal on and won’t work when Labour’s leader is Keir Starmer. The Twitter narrative had told her Davey was older, dull and boring but she said: “It’s just unfair. He has a very relevant personal story having been a carer himself but what really made me choose him was his environmental record – quadrupling renewable energy in this country.” Guy Benson, from Fareham, who joined the party in 2017, said: “Last year if you’d said Lib Dem to someone, they’d have said we wanted to stop Brexit. We lost the argument on that. “Education, the environment and economy should be our focus but I’d also add one more area – social issues and racial equality, the Black Lives Matter movement, these are progressive areas that we can stake out. “And to the wider public – having a charismatic leader isn’t the be all and end all. Just look at Keir Starmer.”"
2020-08-27T06:40:13Z,politics,Politics,Labour official denies 'grand plan' to sabotage Corbyn's 2017 election bid,"A senior Labour official accused of being one of a Corbyn-sceptic group who sabotaged the 2017 election has defended his colleagues’ actions, saying the party would not have lost so badly two years later if a similar strategy had been followed. Patrick Heneghan, the then executive director for elections, said “electoral oblivion” had been the direct result of the departure of experienced staff because they were not loyal to Jeremy Corbyn. “The stab-in-the-back myth is their deflection from reality,” he said. “The endless debate of this fantasy needs to be put to bed. Grand conspiracy theories offer nothing for a party that has been out of office for a decade so far.” He said Corbyn staff had demanded the party defund the campaigns of some prominent critics of the leadership and give extra resources to some key supporters who had bigger majorities. Heneghan said some staff, many of whom were named in a leaked internal report describing a “hyper-factional” environment among party workers hostile to Corbyn, had set up a defensive campaign to save Labour seats rather than to deliberately defy the leadership.
The anonymously leaked report, which reignited painful divisions in the party, included hundreds of private WhatsApp messages from named staff, many of whom expressed hostility towards Corbyn or his close allies and bemoaned Labour’s better-than-expected performance at the 2017 general election. Some workers are alleged to have used racist and sexist language to denigrate senior allies of Corbyn, including Diane Abbott. Heneghan said: “Recent weeks have seen the growth in conspiracy theories suggesting there was some grand plan to ‘throw’ or ‘sabotage’ the 2017 election. This is not the reality but simply a deflection tactic to absolve the architects of the 2019 campaign of their culpability for a disastrous result.” He said party staff had expanded the target list to include 93 offensive seats at Corbyn’s team’s request, giving them extra digital advertising and key seat visits. But Heneghan said he refused to comply with a request in mid-May that some held seats should be defunded, some of which he considered “very marginal”. “The seats to defund were largely MPs considered by Corbyn’s team to be political opponents (many of them would fall to the Tories in 2019),” he said. “I was also given a list of seats that needed extra funding. Most of these had majorities of over 10,000 but were strong allies of the leadership.” Heneghan said he would provide evidence of his claim to the independent inquiry into the leaked report and Labour’s culture under Corbyn, chaired by Martin Forde QC. In their submission to the party inquiry, Corbyn and his leadership team have accused hostile officials of setting up a “shadow operation” in a Westminster office as part of efforts to plot their own election course and defend anti-Corbyn MPs. Heneghan defended that action, saying 2017 polling had consistently showed that Corbyn was unpopular in “red wall” seats, many of which fell to the Tories in 2019. “Corbyn’s team were simply not prepared to take polling information seriously,” he said. “But we knew we couldn’t acquiesce in allowing these seats to fall.” He said campaigners at the party’s headquarters then changed tactic to focus on local issues in those seats rather than the leadership. Heneghan said the loss of seats such as Mansfield, North East Derbyshire and Stoke South was proof the strategy was correct, adding that the campaign retained seats such as Dudley North, which was held by the Corbyn critic Ian Austin but fell to the Conservatives in 2019. “I have heard it said that Labour could have been in power for just over 2,000 more votes in the right seats. It’s also true that the Tories could have won a majority by moving a lot fewer votes the other way,” he said. “To suggest these questions of judgment are akin to sabotage is laughable. Yes, there were differences of opinion on how to get the best result possible. In the end I think the balance between offensive, and defensive was probably just about right given the facts and data we had. It’s hard to claim the balance was right in the 2019 Labour campaign.” He said WhatsApp messages in the leaked report, which appeared to show Labour officials sounding horrified at the party’s advance, “omits our WhatsApp messages such as ‘amazing, amazing, amazing’… or the excitement when its confirmed it’s a hung parliament”. Officials named in the report plan to take legal action against the party over data protection issues and libel as well invasion of privacy and, for some staff, breach of contract and employment. In the formal submission to the inquiry by the officials accused of sabotage, which was leaked to the Guardian this month, the officials allege their WhatsApp messages were used to falsely make them seem racist and sexist."
2020-08-26T19:18:25Z,politics,Politics,The growing list of civil servants frozen out while Johnson's ministers remain,"This week’s resignations from the head of Ofqual, Sally Collier, and the department of education’s permanent secretary, Jonathan Slater, are only the latest in a series of senior departures from Whitehall. By contrast, no ministers have been sacked for any of the government’s high-profile crises or scandals. The civil servants frozen out Sir Mark Sedwill The cabinet secretary and the UK’s most senior civil servant announced in June that he will step down in the autumn. Colleagues say he was unfairly blamed by Number 10 aides for ministerial failings over Brexit and coronavirus. Sir Philip Rutnam The home office’s top civil servant resigned in February, alleging he had become the “target of a vicious and orchestrated campaign” coordinated by the home secretary, Priti Patel. He is taking Patel and the department to an employment tribunal under whistleblowing legislation, claiming he was forced out because he tried to stop her bullying staff. She denies any wrongdoing. Sir Simon McDonald The permanent secretary at the foreign office will step down early next year after anonymous briefings claimed he had clashed with Boris Johnson when he was foreign secretary. Along with Rutnam, McDonald’s name was on a “hitlist” of three permanent secretaries Downing Street wanted to replace which was reported by the Sunday Telegraph in February. Tom Scholar, the treasury’s permanent secretary, survives. Richard Heaton The Ministry of Justice’s permanent secretary will step down this month, it was announced in July, following speculation that his contract would not be renewed as part of top No 10 aide Dominic Cummings’s overhaul of senior Whitehall jobs. The ministers who have clung on… Robert Jenrick The housing secretary shrugged off resignation calls after ensuring a controversial housing development was agreed before a new levy was introduced which would have cost millions for a Conservative donor. Priti Patel The home secretary refused to go despite allegations from senior staff including Rutnam that she had bullied civil servants in three separate government departments. Johnson authorised a cabinet office inquiry into her alleged behaviour but it is still to be released to the public, months after it was handed to the prime minister’s office. Gavin Williamson The education secretary, who was forced to resign as defence secretary last year after leaking information from the National Security Council, has faced a chorus of demands from senior Conservatives to do so again over the exams fiasco. The former chief whip said he was “incredibly sorry for the distress” caused, but former minister George Freeman said the “exam shambles” raised “worrying” questions about leadership in the department. Matt Hancock The government’s much-criticised handling of the pandemic led critics of the health secretary to wonder whether he would be the Cabinet minister to face the chop. He hasn’t."
2020-08-26T18:28:35Z,politics,Politics,Books seen behind Boris Johnson tell their own story,"The prime minister’s address to the nation’s children as they prepare to return to classrooms was upstaged by Twitter tongues wagging over a school librarian with a sense of humour. As Boris Johnson told children at Castle Rock school in Coalville, Leicestershire, that exam results had almost been derailed by “a mutant algorithm”, eyes turned to the bookshelves behind him, lined with titles like The Twits, Betrayed and The Subtle Knife. On the day it was announced that the top civil servant at the Department of Education (DfE), Jonathan Slater, was to leave his job, hot on the heels of Ofqual chief Sally Collier, the titles had a resonance which did not go unnoticed. “Has a savvy school librarian or English teacher snatched a golden opportunity to have a pop at the PM in front of the nation?” asked a reporter from the TES. “Whichever librarian managed to get not just the “The Twits” but also “Betrayed”; “Resistance” and “Fahrenheit 451” in the shot behind Johnson has my admiration,” tweeted Sam Freedman, a former senior policy advisor at the DfE. Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel by American writer Ray Bradbury about a society where books are banned.
Freedman continued: “It has been noted that the Subtle Knife; Glass Houses; The Toll (about a monstrous dictator); and Guards Guards (about a shady villain installing a puppet king) are all there too. It looks like it’s been carefully curated!” The thread that followed included much praise for librarians."
2020-08-26T18:16:58Z,politics,Politics,Top DfE official's exit 'proof that ministerial accountability is dead',"Boris Johnson has been accused of presiding over the death of ministerial accountability after No 10 removed the most senior civil servant in the Department for Education (DfE) from his post in the wake of the exams fiasco. Jonathan Slater will step down as permanent secretary within days after Johnson decided there was “a need for fresh official leadership” in the department, the DfE said. His departure was announced a day after the resignation of Sally Collier as chief executive of the exams regulator Ofqual. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has faced calls to quit but has remained in post and repeatedly declined to say whether he offered his resignation. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the senior civil servants’ union, said Slater’s abrupt departure was proof that “ministerial accountability is dead and the message to civil servants is that they are expendable the moment life gets tough for a minister. This administration will throw civil service leaders under bus without a moment’s hesitation.” Slater will depart on 1 September, just as the DfE is overseeing the return to school of millions of children in England. A Downing Street source said the decision was made last month and claimed it was unrelated to the exams row. “The prime minister has very ambitious plans for education and it was important to have the right leadership in place,” the source said. Slater, a public servant for 35 years, is one of several senior mandarins to have stepped down in recent months. Others include the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, and the Foreign Office permanent secretary, Simon McDonald.
In June Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s chief adviser, reportedly warned of a “hard rain” hitting the civil service. Mary Bousted, a joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “It’s just a scorched-earth policy for civil servants. The ministers who should be resigning because of their political decisions have … refused to take responsibility and are laying into these civil servants, the unfortunate fall guys and gals for ministerial incompetence.” There is a longstanding convention in British politics that elected politicians rather than unelected officials make decisions and are accountable for their department’s failings. The idea is enshrined in a section of the ministerial code, the handbook for government, that says: “Ministers have a duty to parliament to account and be held to account for the policies, decisions and actions of their departments.” Williamson initially sought to blame Ofqual for the exams debacle, in which nearly 40% of A-level results were initially downgraded, disproportionately affecting disadvantaged pupils. He then issued a statement supporting the regulator after its chair, Roger Taylor, threatened to resign. The education secretary paid tribute to Slater on Wednesday, saying: “I would like to thank Jonathan Slater for his commitment to public service, including over four years spent as permanent secretary in the DfE. Like the prime minister, I appreciate the hard work of officials across government, particularly during this unprecedented time.” But Slater’s departure was viewed in Westminster as part of what one Tory MP called a “general purge” of officials whose approaches clash with that of No 10. The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said: “Parents will be looking on in dismay at a government in complete chaos just a matter of days before children will return to schools. Leadership requires a sense of responsibility and a willingness to be held accountable – qualities this prime minister and his ministers utterly lack.” Earlier on Wednesday Johnson prompted ridicule when he told pupils at a school in Leicestershire that the exams fiasco was caused by a “mutant algorithm”. When A-level grades for England were first announced, Johnson said the results were “dependable” and “robust”. Even after the U-turn in which the algorithm was dropped, Nick Gibb, the schools minister, said: “The model was a good model, and we continued to refine it.” The statement issued by the DfE on Wednesday included a tribute to Slater from Sedwill, whose successor has not yet been announced. “The cabinet secretary would like to put on record his thanks to Jonathan for 35 years of public service,” it said. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We now have a second public servant who appears to have fallen on their sword following the departure of Sally Collier. It is abundantly clear that things have not gone well at the DfE and Ofqual, culminating in the debacle over this year’s GCSE and A-level grades. But it is pretty unsavoury that civil servants appear to be carrying the can while ministers remain unscathed. “The grading fiasco really does need to be resolved by a proper independent review of what went wrong and we have written to the secretary of state for education to request that this takes place immediately. We think this is a more productive way forward.” Slater replaced Chris Wormald as permanent secretary at the DfE four years ago and has worked for four education secretaries in his time at the department. His role will be covered on an interim basis by Susan Acland-Hood, who was previously chief executive of the courts and tribunals service. It was announced last week that she had been drafted in to the department as a temporary second permanent secretary."
2020-08-26T17:21:12Z,politics,Politics,Germany scraps plans for Brexit talks at EU ambassadors summit,"Germany has scrapped plans to discuss Brexit at a high-level diplomatic meeting next week because there has not been “any tangible progress” in talks, the Guardian has learned, as Brussels laments a “completely wasted” summer. EU officials now believe the UK government is prepared to risk a no-deal exit when the transition period comes to an end on 31 December, and will try to pin the blame on Brussels if talks fail. The German government, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU council, had intended to discuss Brexit during a meeting of EU ambassadors on 2 September but has now dropped the issue. “Since there hasn’t been any tangible progress in EU-UK negotiations, the Brexit item was taken off the agenda,” an EU diplomat said. The decision matters because Angela Merkel was billed as a potential dealmaker when talks on the UK-EU future relationship reach a crucial stage this autumn. The German chancellor last week met Emmanuel Macron at the French president’s official residence on the French Riviera, where they discussed the EU’s post-Brexit future. Following last week’s inconclusive round of negotiations, both governments issued near-identical statements calling for “concrete answers” from the British government. “Over the recent months Franco-German cooperation has gained new traction,” said the EU diplomat, with the two countries having “realigned” on issues including Brexit. “Given this new reality it would be futile to wait for a white knight from Paris or Berlin to come to the rescue.” Sandro Gozi, an Italian MEP who sits in Macron’s party in the European parliament and was Italy’s Europe minister during the early phase of Brexit talks, said: “I doubt even Merkel or Macron would be able to transform a stalemate into a positive outcome. “I have always thought – that is my personal position – that no-deal was a real option especially on London’s side … Every day that passes without concrete progress is a day closer to no-deal Brexit.” Dropping Brexit from next week’s diplomatic agenda is a sign of deepening pessimism in Brussels. “People underestimate how bleak the mood is in the EU negotiation team,” said an EU official who added that time was running out to negotiate a complex legal treaty expected to exceed 400 pages. “We have had the whole summer completely wasted, a cabinet that doesn’t understand how the negotiations work, a prime minister who, I think, doesn’t understand how the negotiations work – because he is under the wrong impression that he can pull off negotiating at the 11th hour.” The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, last week declared he was surprised by the UK “wasting valuable time” as Boris Johnson had told EU leaders in June that he wanted an outline deal by July. The EU official said: “If they (the UK government) see it’s not going to work out they are just going to try and make it really acrimonious.” A UK document leaked to the Sun on Sunday, warning of public disorder, shortages and price hikes in the event of a no-deal Brexit, was perceived in Brussels as a sign of the government’s seriousness about leaving the EU single market and customs union with no agreement. “More and more people have come to the conclusion that Brexit ideology trumps Brexit pragmatism in the UK government,” the diplomat said. “If the UK really wanted to jump off the Brexit cliff for ideological reasons, there would be no way for the EU to stop this.” If the UK’s negotiating stance became “more pragmatic and realistic”, there was still a chance to save the talks, they added. For the EU, “pragmatism” means accepting that tariff-free access to the single market necessitates common standards on environment, state aid, worker and consumer protection – a position rejected by the UK. With talks set to resume on 7 September, EU sources are increasingly frustrated with the UK chief negotiator, David Frost. “The feeling is that David Frost acts more as a UK messenger then a UK negotiator. If he doesn’t get more negotiating space, talks will remain in dire straits,” said the EU diplomat. British officials hit back, accusing the EU of slowing progress by insisting that all difficult issues had to be resolved in parallel. “The EU’s insistence that nothing can now progress until we have accepted EU positions on fisheries and state aid policy is a recipe for holding up the whole negotiation at a moment when time is short for both sides,” said a UK source close to negotiations. “We are also faced with the EU’s frustrating insistence on parallelism, meaning that they will not progress areas apart from these ‘difficult’ ones until we have moved towards their position on them. That’s a sure way to hold up the negotiations. For our part we are ready to knuckle down and get into the detailed discussions of legal texts which is what is needed now. We hope the EU will do likewise.” Johnson is understood to have full confidence in Frost and the UK negotiating team."
2020-08-26T17:16:35Z,politics,Politics,Liberal Democrats set to elect fourth leader in five years,"The Liberal Democrats will elect their fourth leader in five years on Thursday as the party continues to try to rebuild itself after a series of crushing general election defeats and poor poll ratings. The result is due to be announced at midday on Thursday, with senior party sources suggesting it had been an extremely close race. The coronavirus pandemic meant the acting leader and former energy secretary, Ed Davey, and the party’s education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, were forced to conduct the campaign almost entirely online. This is Davey’s second attempt to take on the leadership of the party after he lost to Jo Swinson in her landslide victory last summer. Just six months later, she resigned after losing her seat at the 2019 general election following a highly personalised campaign in which she claimed she could be prime minister. Davey said: “The next leader faces a huge job to rebuild the party, take on the Conservatives and get the party winning nationally again. “This contest has put both candidates through our paces and made sure that the victor is battle-tested for this tough job ahead. “Whoever wins, it is vital that the party unites, works together on the challenges we face and continues to stand up for the people in society who need us the most.” The new leader will take over the party at a moment when it is polling at 6% and has struggled to make a comeback since its time in coalition with the Tories when it had 57 MPs. However, membership remains at a record high of 120,000. In a relatively quiet campaign, one of the main points of difference has been on how closely the Liberal Democrats should work with other parties, with Moran favouring closer cooperation than Davey. Moran, who is half-Palestinian, has also been seen by younger members as a fresh face untainted by the coalition era, as she was elected to Oxford West and Abingdon in 2017. She also got widespread support from the party’s LGBT+ group. Strategically, both will have to contend with an altered political landscape where Labour’s disenchanted supporters may drift back to the party under the leadership of Keir Starmer. Moran said: “I am immensely proud of the positive and hopeful campaign my team have run, and I have sent my heartfelt thanks to all the volunteers who helped me. “Both Ed and I have committed to implement the general election review and improve diversity in our party.”"
2020-08-26T15:57:02Z,politics,Politics,It's a dog's breakfast for Gavin Williamson and his owner | John Crace,"“Do you take responsibility for what happened? Because last week my colleague on this programme, Louise Minchin, asked you several times if you had considered your resignation and you didn’t answer that then,” said BBC Breakfast’s Dan Walker. “So do you take responsibility for what happened over exams and what happened in the last 24 hours over the wearing of face coverings in schools?” “Um ... unprecedented … er ... pandemic ...” replied Gavin Williamson as he wittered on for 30 seconds about nothing very much. “But do you take responsibility for the issues in your department?” Walker interrupted. “Um ... in terms of exam results … er … policy approach ...” Gavin continued aimlessly. Finally Walker – possibly the gentlest interviewer any cabinet minister could hope to come up against – cracked. “You’re talking down the time so I don’t get to ask you the questions,” he snapped. And when Walker reaches his breaking point, you know the game is up. But then Williamson had known the game was up the night before when he had got the phone call from the prime minister telling him he had changed his mind about face masks in schools and that he wanted him to do the Wednesday morning media round. Even Private Pike has a humiliation threshold. It had been bad enough having to explain why he had switched to predicted A-level grades the week before, now he was going to have to come up with another reason for doing the one thing the government had said it wasn’t going to do only days earlier. “What shall I tell them this time?” Gavin had sobbed. “How about that they’ve got as much chance of dying from the coronavirus as being knocked down by a car,” Boris Johnson had said. “I’m not sure that choosing between two ways of dying is the way to go here.” “Oh, well, I’m sure you will think of something. I’m up to my neck trying to stop that Scottish farmer from suing me for trespass. And don’t worry. I’m about to appoint that rightwing Aussie lunatic Tony Abbott to the board of trade – it will be a race to the bottom to see who is the stupider, him or Liz Truss, so with any luck everyone will soon forget your latest embarrassment.” It didn’t feel that way to Private Pike as he shuffled from the BBC Breakfast to the Today studio. If he could get his arse handed to him on a plate by Walker, God knows what state he would be in by the time Mishal Husain had finished with him. He mentally tried to rehearse his lines. It was like this. This wasn’t yet another U-turn. Rather it was a sign of clarity and consistency. The country had got used to the government constantly changing its mind on issues, so everyone would have been mentally prepared for the latest switch of policy. Had the government actually stuck to what it had said it was going to do then everyone would have been totally confused. Besides, no one – apart from a whole load of twitchy Tory MPs, such as Huw Merriman and Charles Walker, who were demanding he made a bad decision and stuck with it – wanted a government that wasn’t prepared to do something different to what it had promised. “At every stage we listen to the latest scientific advice,” Gavin began, sounding more confident than he felt. Now it was Husain’s turn to be confused. Her understanding was that the World Health Organization had issued guidelines that it was beneficial for secondary students to wear face coverings in areas of schools where social distancing could not be guaranteed. So how come the deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, had said on Monday there was no strong evidence for them? Hell, even Alok Sharma, the business secretary whose signature move was to never commit himself to anything that might be construed as news, had confirmed that masks in schools were a definite no-no just the day before. “Ah, let me be clear,” said Gavin. He hadn’t said how quickly he would follow the scientific advice and England had a strong track record of reacting later than everyone else. That was why we had a coronavirus mortality rate to be proud of. Besides, it was no big deal. It was only for schools in lockdown areas and on no account were children going to be wearing masks in the classroom. At which point headteachers of all schools everywhere made a note to prepare for pupils wearing masks the whole time. By now, Private Pike was prepared to commit himself to anything and promised that all schools would definitely return in September. He had no idea if this was true, but he no longer much cared as he knew he was in line for the sack within a month or two regardless. Husain cut to the chase. “Do you actually want to stay in the job?” she said, her voice finally betraying a hint of sympathy for the hapless education secretary. “I love the job. It’s the best job in government.” The teachers at his comprehensive school had done a brilliant job in helping him to achieve what he wanted in life. Even if the rest of the country was wishing they had done a slightly worse job and that Gav’s career highlight had remained as fireplace salesman of the year 2006. There was still just time for him to land Sally Collier, the outgoing Ofqual chief executive, in the brown stuff before he was done for the day. She had been a goner since the moment he had expressed his full confidence in her and surely no one would ever find out that his department had been more concerned about grade inflation than the impact of an algorithm that disadvantaged pupils from poorer areas? And even if they did, they would assume he had meant the opposite. Gav also considered mentioning that Jonathan Slater, the most senior civil servant in the department for education, would also be getting the sack later in the day for the exams chaos. Heads must roll. It was time for someone to show real leadership in the department, the prime minister had told him earlier in the day. And there was no chance of that real leadership coming from Gavin or Boris. Their only real discernible function was to be at best a distraction and at worst a waste of space. Still, at least he wasn’t the only one having a tricky day, as around lunchtime Boris found himself addressing a group of students in a school library. All of whom looked unimpressed and blank throughout. Every one of the PM’s gags fell flat, and his attempt to blame their exam results on “a mutant algorithm” – one that he had previously championed – was met with outright hostility. It’s not just Walker and Husain who know bullshit when they hear it."
2020-08-26T14:16:35Z,politics,Politics,Top DfE civil servant Jonathan Slater to step down after exams row,"Jonathan Slater, the most senior civil servant in the Department for Education (DfE), is to step down from his post in the wake of the exams fiasco. Slater will step down on 1 September after the “prime minister concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership” in the department, the DfE said. Slater’s departure follows that of Sally Collier, the chief executive of exams regulator Ofqual, whose resignation was announced on Tuesday. Slater is one of several senior Whitehall figures to have stepped down in recent months, including the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, and the Foreign Office permanent secretary, Simon McDonald. He has been permanent secretary at the DfE since 2016. His departure is likely to infuriate civil service unions, which reacted angrily to Gavin Williamson’s attempts to blame officials for the exams U-turn. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “It’s just a scorched-earth policy for civil servants. The ministers who should be resigning because of their political decisions have just refused to take responsibility and are laying into these civil servants, the unfortunate fall guys and galls for ministerial incompetence.” The prime minister on Wednesday suggested the exams fiasco, which saw thousands of results reversed, had been caused by a “mutant algorithm”."
2020-08-26T14:09:53Z,politics,Politics,Tony Abbott: an odd UK trade champion but feted by the British right,"The reported appointment of the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott to join Britain’s board of trade has left Whitehall dumbfounded and Australian opposition politicians even suggesting the idea might be a hoax. Abbott was forced to renounce his British citizenship as a condition of entering the Australian parliament in 1994, but he has excellent connections with the Conservative party through figures such as Rupert Murdoch, the pollster Lynton Crosby and the trade secretary, Liz Truss. British right-of-centre thinktanks such as the Policy Exchange and the Centre for Policy Studies have also feted Abbott, despite his controversial two-year premiership. He has been given a regular platform to praise Thatcherism and Brexit, speaking alongside the former Australian high commissioner Alexander Downer. Not all former Australian high commissioners, however, view Abbott’s apparent appointment as a sign that British headhunters cast their dragnet in the right waters. Mike Rann said appointing Abbott to run Britain’s trade negotiations was the equivalent of Australia asking the UK’s education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to run the Australian school system. There is a strand of Conservative Brexit thinking that sees departure from the EU as a chance to revive the old anglosphere, including the countries which make up the Five Eyes intelligence alliance - Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US. It is not entirely a coincidence that the Department for International Trade, led by its politically aware permanent secretary, Antonia Romeo, chose Crawford Falconer, a seasoned New Zealand trade negotiator as its second permanent secretary and chief trade negotiation adviser. Falconer’s appointment in 2017 on a salary of more than £260,000 was a sign that the government was unable to find true Brexit believers or experienced non-Europeans in its own ranks to be trade negotiators. Abbott, like Falconer, is also more patriotic about Britain than most Britons. Extolling the virtues of Brexit last year, Abbott told the Policy Exchange: “This is the country that has seen off the Spanish armada, the French emperor and the German kaiser. Against Louis XIV, against Napoleon, against Wilhelm II and then against Hitler, this country didn’t need Europe. It saved Europe, helped – as it always should be – by its friends and family, the Commonwealth across the sea. “This is the home of the mother of parliaments, of the Industrial Revolution and of the world’s common language. That’s right, the modern world has been made in English, so no country on Earth should be more capable than Britain of standing on its own two feet. That, surely, is what’s crying out now for remembrance, amidst all the decline-ism and defeatism, because if Brexit fails, Britain fails.” For a country such as Britain, however, that tries to trade on its liberal values, Abbott cuts a strange champion. He has been accused of misogyny and is known for his oppositon to same-sex marriage, deep scepticism about climate change and antagonism toward labour rights. He also has a reputation for political gunslinging, and an inability to command loyalty. His directionless leadership collapsed in 2015 in a welter of leaks, recriminations and dire opinion polls. Australia’s former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd recently wrote: “Abbott has never cared about policy. He has only cared about politics and winning at any cost. I cannot remember a single positive policy initiative that Abbott has championed and then implemented. “As a result, unconstrained by policy, the entire energies of this giant wrecking ball of Australian politics has been focussed on destroying his opponents.” He also pictured Abbott as dependent on Rupert Murdoch, the owner of News International, and a man he both reviles and attributes enormous powers. He wrote: “In Britain, Murdoch made Brexit possible because of the position taken by his papers. In the United States, Murdoch’s Fox News is the political echo chamber of the far-right which enabled the Tea Party and then the Trump party to stage a hostile takeover of the Republican party. In Australia, as in America, Murdoch has campaigned for decades in support of tax cuts for the wealthy, killing action on climate change and destroying anything approximating to multiculturalism.” Abbott may not be Murdoch’s greatest or final bequest to Britain, but he is one of the most unnecessary."
2020-08-26T13:21:43Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson blames 'mutant algorithm' for exams fiasco,"Boris Johnson got an angry response after telling school pupils that the exam results crisis was caused by a “mutant algorithm” and he was glad it had been “sorted out”. The National Education Union (NEU) called the prime minister “brazen” after he appeared to shrug off responsibility for the fiasco. Johnson was giving a speech to students on Wednesday at Castle Rock school in Coalville, Leicestershire. As well as welcoming them back to school and reassuring them it was safe, he said: “I’m afraid your grades were almost derailed by a mutant algorithm and I know how stressful that must’ve been for pupils up and down the country.” He added: “I’m very, very glad that it has finally been sorted out.” This month, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, ditched the algorithm for moderating A-level and GCSE grades in England after a week-long outcry from pupils, parents and teachers. Days earlier, Johnson had said the results were “dependable” and “robust”. Even after the U-turn, Nick Gibb, the schools minister, said of the algorithm: “The model was a good model, and we continued to refine it.” Kevin Courtney, a joint general secretary of the NEU, criticised Johnson’s comments on Wednesday, saying: “It is brazen of the prime minister to idly shrug away a disaster that his own government created. “Parents, students, teachers and heads will be horrified to see the leader of this country treat his own exams fiasco like some minor passing fad. The public will not easily forget the emotional rollercoaster of this year’s results season. It is certain to put a long-lasting dent in the government’s reputation on education.” The shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, tweeted: “Boris Johnson just told schoolchildren their grades were ‘almost derailed by a mutant algorithm’. Could someone please gently remind him of the identity of the prime minister who is supposed to be in charge?” The algorithm was devised by the exams regulator Ofqual in accordance with Williamson’s instruction to avoid grade inflation after the coronavirus pandemic caused the closure of schools and the cancellation of exams. Ofqual’s chief executive, Sally Collier, resigned on Tuesday."
2020-08-26T12:06:05Z,politics,Politics,"Racism endemic at DfID, staff claim","Many black, Asian and minority ethnic men working in the Department for International Development claim to have experienced prejudice at work, including racist jokes and doubts about their legality as UK citizens. The government’s aid department has also been severely criticised for signing off an anti-sexual harassment campaign that portrayed BAME men following or restraining white women, in a report seen by the Guardian. The findings, including a survey of BAME staff and published in March this year, were uncovered as the department faces a merger with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The report, which was published on 21 March, the international day for the elimination of racial discrimination, was commissioned by Whitehall’s Race Network, which connects BAME staff. It focused on BAME men because their voices had been “silent’ in previous examinations of Dfid’s attitude towards race, the report said. Prejudice against black men in the department came to the fore last year after Dfid published two images that appeared to portray black, Asian and minority ethnic men as sexual predators, the report said. “Whilst black male voices have largely been silent on the issue of race, that changed in August 2019 when an image was posted on the front page of Insight [Dfid’s intranet] to publicise Dfid’s new sexual harassment guidance, showing a black male aggressor’s hand over [the hand of] a white woman,” it claimed. A few weeks later, another image warning of sexual harassment appeared again on the font page of the department’s magazine, this time showing a white woman being followed by a BAME man, prompting further anguish. “This time, the BAME male voice spoke up and was amplified by the RN co-chairs and champions to the very top of the organisation,” the report said. Entitled “Coloureds Need Not Apply: the experiences of black Asian and minority ethnic men in Dfid”, the report said 20 BAME male staff were approached and asked whether their ethnicity had affected them at work. A majority said they had direct negative experiences, ranging from subtle behaviours such as exclusions from networks to sustained discrimination that halted their careers. One member of staff, a British Asian man who has worked in Dfid for nine years, said he was expected to endure racist comments from white staff members when working overseas. “I remember being invited to a social occasion and the language used from Dfid colleagues became increasingly prejudiced towards local people and minorities in the UK including racist jokes,” he said. Another BAME staff member said his confidence and sense of Britishness was damaged while working overseas when his daughter was born and the UK authorities questioned his British status. “Unlike other white HCS [home civil servant] families in similar circumstances, our application for her British passport was rejected because HM Passport Office questioned the legality of my father’s entry to the UK (which he had done so legally) – but they would not accept the evidence we provided, instead insisting on a passport entry stamp from 40 years ago which we were unable to provide. This despite both my wife and I being born in the UK and [being] British diplomatic passport holders. “Dfid HR took a long time to intervene with considerable personal expense incurred on solicitors and not to mention the impact on our mental health as our daughter was rendered stateless and we were unable to visit family in the UK,” the man said. The report concludes that racism is endemic in Dfid’s headquarters and a network of offices abroad. “At best it is denying equal rights to BAME staff and at worst enabling toxic and hostile environments,” it says. “Whilst many BAME men reported a real commitment to the work of Dfid, they also reported feelings of fear, disillusionment, anger and damaging impacts on their confidence and mental health. “Almost all respondents felt that the organisations’ work on diversity and inclusion had little or no impact and some felt it was going backwards.” A department source claimed that since the report was published, the department had organised discussions with BAME men to determine possible changes and had created a working group to address racism and equality in the new Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). A Dfid spokesperson said: “We will not tolerate any form of racism, discrimination or harassment. We have guidance in place for staff to report any such issues and robust policies for investigating them.”"
2020-08-26T09:06:41Z,politics,Politics,Education secretary defends school face masks U-turn after Tory backlash,"The UK education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has defended the government’s U-turn on pupils in England wearing face masks in schools after coming under fire from Conservative MPs over the move. Just hours after the cabinet minister Alok Sharma said on Tuesday morning there were no plans to review the policy amid pressure from headteachers, the government performed an about-turn and said pupils would no longer be advised against using face masks in secondary schools.
Instead, in places with high levels of Covid-19, such as lockdown areas including Greater Manchester, children in year 7 and above are now being advised to wear face coverings in school corridors where social distancing is more difficult. The move – which came after Scotland confirmed secondary pupils must wear masks in communal areas, such as corridors, and on school buses from Monday – has prompted criticism from Conservative MPs, with one saying he is “sick and tired of the way that we are treating our young people”. On Wednesday, Williamson – who has faced a bruising few weeks over his handling of the A-level and GCSE exams fiasco – claimed the government had been clear that guidance over the return of schools had always been under review, telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We always listen to the best scientific and medical advice.” Pressed on England’s deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, saying on Monday that the evidence on whether children over 12 should wear masks in schools was “not strong”, Williamson said: “You would always hope that politicians don’t take a dogmatic or brittle approach to anything. “I think it’s incredibly important that on everything that we do that we actually look, and this has been our approach from the start, of taking a really careful cautious approach about welcoming children back into schools. “And we’ve looked at some of those areas that are under local lockdown and what the prime minister has said and what I’ve said, and what every government minister has said, about the importance of getting every school open and that includes in areas that are subject to local lockdown because we don’t want to see those areas falling behind in terms of educational attainment because those schools aren’t open.”
Earlier on the programme, the senior Tory MP Huw Merriman said the government needed to “get a grip”. “I think we need the firm smack of government behind this. We need to send a message out that schools are a safe setting,” he told the BBC, adding: “The worry is that if we’re saying it’s unsafe in the corridors, the next thing it’ll be unsafe in the classroom and that will really prove an impediment on people’s learning. “And, quite frankly, as a Conservative MP that came into politics to try to help people’s life chances through school, I am sick and tired of the way that we are treating our young people. “I feel it’s an absolute disgrace and I really feel the government needs to get a grip and just be certain, get on with it and inspire confidence rather than just completely changing its mind.” Asked about Merriman’s comments, Williamson said: “That is why we’ve been absolutely clear that it isn’t necessary to be wearing face coverings in the overwhelming majority of education settings, in schools, whether it’s primary schools, whether it’s secondary schools. “But what we are saying, where there’s a high transmission rate of coronavirus, where communities are subject to local lockdown, having that extra layer of protection on top of all the other layers of protection that we’ve already asked schools to put in place.” The Tory backbencher Marcus Fysh was also among Conservatives critical of the move, tweeting on Tuesday afternoon before the policy shift was formally announced: “No @BorisJohnson this is utterly wrong. Masks should be banned in schools. The country should be getting back to normal not pandering to this scientifically illiterate guff.” The policy U-turn came after the World Health Organization and Unicef, the UN children’s agency, said those aged 12 and over should wear masks to help tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, “under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area”."
2020-08-25T23:01:07Z,politics,Politics,"Scrap fines for school non-attendance in England, say psychiatrists","Hundreds of psychiatrists have urged the government not to fine families for refusing to send their children to school in England, warning of anxiety if young people are asked to return to classrooms before they are ready. In a letter to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, the chair of the faculty of child and adolescent psychiatry at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Dr Bernadka Dubicka, said: “The threat of fines could force parents of children who feel anxious to send them back to school, even if they’re not ready. “This could have serious consequences on their mental health, especially if they are worried about family shielding. Fines could bring more financial stress on families as we’re entering a recession, severely affecting children’s and parents’ mental health.” The letter was signed by 250 child and adolescent psychiatrists. It follows the news that fines could be imposed on families who do not send their children back to school in England from next week. Before the pandemic, fines for not having a child in school were £60 if paid within 21 days, and £120 after that. During the health crisis they were, in effect, suspended. Williamson said fines would be used as a last resort if parents refused to send their children back. He said: “In terms of fining, we would ask all schools to work with those parents and encourage them to bring those children back.” Dubicka said returning to school would be a “cause of significant anxiety” for some children. “As child and adolescent psychiatrists, we have seen the devastating impact the Covid-19 crisis has had on the mental health of many young people … That is why we are calling on the government to suspend the threat of fines for parents of children who miss school and instead increase provisions to support the mental health of all children.” She said the college did not believe fines were the best way to get children to return and, while the physical risks from the virus were low, the risk to young people’s mental health remained high. The Department for Education said: “Schools should work with families to ensure children are attending full time from September. As usual, fines will sit alongside this, but only as a last resort and where there is no valid reason for absence.”"

The senior backbencher – an increasingly vocal critic of Boris Johnson’s government – complained of a lack of transparency at the heart of decision-making as the defence and foreign policy review gears up towards its conclusion in November. “I don’t see a defence strategy here, I see a cost-cutting exercise,” the MP, a former defence minister, said. “We need to be asking what role do we want Britain to play in the world before we make decisions about land warfare.” Defence sources confirmed the British army was considering simply not buying a replacement for the ageing Challenger 2 tank, and potentially switching investments into cyber-warfare, information systems and attack helicopters. It was one of a number of related options under consideration, which also included abandoning the British-designed Challenger after 20 years and buying the widely used German Leopard 2 tank off the shelf. The defence review has been plagued by accusations that it is being driven by Johnson’s chief aide Dominic Cummings, who has in the past criticised the military’s investment in heavy equipment and argued that Britain should focus on drone and cyber-warfare.
But Ellwood said he was “concerned that we seem to be retreating from the global conversation” and argued that the UK risked damaging its standing within Nato if it stepped back from heavy equipment, some of which is deployed on the Russian border in Estonia to protect the Baltic states from Kremlin incursion. Citing the ongoing crisis in Belarus, the Conservative MP said: “We are entering a decade of huge instability, with a growing number of failed states and a terrorism threat … Mass matters and our presence with tanks and armoured personnel carriers will be respected by Russia.” Ministry of Defence insiders hit back at Ellwood’s criticism. Responding to the backbencher, a defence source said: “Of course we have a defence strategy. We don’t expect people to make judgments on an unpublished integrated review based on partial information”. The UK nominally has 227 Challenger tanks, which after two decades are at the end of their natural life, although the total deployable force is understood to be half that. The Kremlin has 12,950 at its disposal and military experts fear Russian tanks may be impervious to British guns, because of armour upgrades. However, the UK last used its tanks in battle during the 2003 Gulf War, and there has been a growing political unwillingness to deploy British troops on the ground in recent conflicts, most notably the Syrian civil war. Trade unions said they were concerned that a decision to abandon tanks would be a blow to the Rheinmetall BAE Systems factory in Telford, Shropshire, where it was expected any Challenger 3 would be built. Rhys McCarthy, a national officer with Unite, accused the government of “blue sky, harebrained thinking” meaning “bye, bye UK, whilst we buy elsewhere” and said France and Germany were using defence spending as a way to support manufacturing to recover economically after the coronavirus pandemic."
2020-08-25T17:01:06Z,politics,Politics,Top Scottish civil servant: my choice to include ex-ministers in anti-harassment policy,"The senior civil servant who drafted the policy used to investigate the former first minister Alex Salmond for alleged sexual misconduct has said he did so on his own initiative, without any political direction. James Hynd, the Scottish government’s head of cabinet, parliament and governance, told MSPs on Tuesday he realised its personnel policies needed tightening up in October 2017 after seeing “rather unsavoury headlines” about alleged misconduct at Westminster and in Whitehall. Giving evidence under oath, Hynd conceded he knew of rumours about alleged misconduct involving Salmond, which Salmond has repeatedly denied, before choosing to include former ministers in the new anti-harassment policy. Hynd said that decision was not made by the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, or by Leslie Evans, Scotland’s chief civil servant, who asked him to draw up a new policy on sexual harassment covering serving ministers on 31 October 2017. He insisted he alone decided to make former ministers the focus of his first draft of the policy, partly because he was in charge of the Scottish government’s ministerial code. He said he thought it was a “gap” that needed to be closed. “Those concerns were generated by, frankly, the rather unsavoury headlines which were emanating from Westminster and from Whitehall about alleged behaviour down there,” he told Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader. “Given my ministerial code responsibilities, I was already thinking about if we had the same kind of allegations surfacing in Scotland, what would we do here?’ Hynd was the second witness to appear before a Holyrood committee’s inquiry into the Scottish government’s mishandling of its inquiry into allegations of sexual misconduct brought by two female officials against Salmond in January 2018, dating back to his period as first minister. Salmond has repeatedly denied any criminal misconduct. The Scottish government investigation into the claims was quashed by the court of session, Scotland’s civil court, in January 2019 after he sued. Evans admitted the government’s handling of the investigation was unlawful and had the appearance of bias because it was led by a senior personnel official, Judith Mackinnon, who had had prior contact with both complainants. In March 2020, Salmond was acquitted of 14 sexual offence charges, including one of attempted rape, after a trial at the high court in Edinburgh. He is due to give evidence to the Holyrood inquiry later this year. He alleges that both the internal inquiry and the subsequent Police Scotland investigation were inspired and driven by senior figures in Sturgeon’s government and the Scottish National party, which he once led. Sturgeon has described his claims as “a heap of nonsense”. Asked by Alex Cole-Hamilton, a Liberal Democrat MSP, whether he had heard “the scuttlebutt” about alleged bullying or sexual misconduct by Salmond, Hynd replied: “Well, yes, I mean things were said. Whether they were true or not, I have no idea.” Nicola Richards, the government’s director of people, giving evidence immediately after Hynd, did not deny she had also heard “chatter” about allegations against Salmond. “I couldn’t give you a specific answer to that,” she told Cole-Hamilton. She confirmed that two civil servants who had flagged concerns about Salmond were given advanced sight of the new anti-harassment policies in mid-December 2017, before they were approved by Sturgeon and Evans. One of those women made formal complaints against Salmond in January 2018. Richards and Hynd insisted the anti-harassment policy was robust, lawful and appropriate, and said it was still in force. Richards admitted, however, that Salmond’s court challenge had established it had not been properly applied during the Salmond inquiry."
2020-08-25T16:34:20Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson will quit in six months, Dominic Cummings' father-in-law reportedly says","Downing Street probably hoped Dominic Cummings’ family would not provide any more headaches after the furore prompted by Boris Johnson’s adviser’s lockdown dash to his parents’ Durham farm this year. But, in a fresh blow to No 10, the top aide’s father-in-law has reportedly said Johnson will stand down as prime minister in six months. The claim – strenuously denied by Downing Street and, later, Johnson – was apparently delivered by Sir Humphry Wakefield to a visitor to the family’s 13th-century Grade I-listed Chillingham Castle, in Northumberland, last week. The 84-year-old baronet, father of Cummings’ wife, Mary, told visitor Anna Silverman Johnson was still struggling badly after having coronavirus and would step down in six months, according to a report in the Times. Wakefield, a lifelong horse rider, is said to have likened the virus to being gone in the fetlock, a horse’s joint. “If you put a horse back to work when it’s injured it will never recover,” he reportedly said. Asked during a visit to a shipyard in north Devon on Tuesday about the claim he would be standing down as prime minister, Johnson told a Devon Live reporter: “It’s absolute nonsense! I am feeling, if anything, far better as I’ve lost some weight. Not enough, but I have lost at least a stone and a half. “I feel much much better for having lost, by my standards, quite a lot of weight.” No 10 had earlier also dismissed the claim as “utter nonsense”. Wakefield could not be reached for comment. According to research released this month as part of the preliminary results into a study of the long-term effects of coronavirus, nearly three-quarters of a sample group of Covid-19 patients admitted to hospital had ongoing symptoms three months later. Johnson contracted coronavirus in March. The following month, after his condition deteriorated, he was admitted to St Thomas’ hospital in London where he spent a week, including three nights in intensive care, before being discharged. In a later interview, Johnson revealed that while he was in hospital, he worried he would not live to see his new son, Wilfred, who was born at the end of April after the prime minister left hospital. Johnson told the Sun: “Well, yes, of course. We’ve all got a lot to live for, a lot to do, and I won’t hide it from you, I was thinking about that, yes.” He added: “I was deeply frustrated that I couldn’t see the path to … do you know what I mean? I just couldn’t see the way out of the skip. But, yeah, I suppose there was some terrible, as I say, some natural buoyancy or refusal to give in or harbour negative thoughts. I never really thought that I wouldn’t come back from it. It was more frustration.” A joint investigation by the Guardian and the Mirror in May revealed that Cummings travelled 264 miles from London to Durham with his wife and child during lockdown, leading to calls for him to be sacked. Cummings later said he did not regret the trip, explaining during a press conference that he stayed in a cottage on his parents’ farm. In a now infamous excuse, he claimed a separate 30-mile trip to Barnard Castle on Easter Sunday was to test his eyesight to ensure he would be OK to drive back to London."
2020-08-25T05:00:46Z,politics,Politics,Justine Greening: exams crisis could be Boris Johnson's Black Wednesday,"The exams debacle could fatally undermine Boris Johnson’s claim to be a champion of “levelling up”, a former education secretary has said. Justine Greening, who was education secretary for two years under Theresa May, said that more had to be done to ensure young people were not failed again by the government. She said the fallout from the crisis, in which poorer pupils suffered disproportionately as A-level results were downgraded by algorithm until a humiliating government U-turn, could do to Johnson what Black Wednesday did to John Major.
“The exams crisis this summer threatens to be as damaging for the public’s confidence in Boris Johnson’s government’s ability to level up Britain, as the ERM crisis was for John Major’s government’s competence on economic management,” she said. Greening, writing for the Guardian, also said she believed the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, would have been aware of the risk to disadvantaged pupils before the exams crisis unfolded and that more must be done to help disadvantaged students as schools reopen next week. “While talk about levelling up has continued, levelling down is what’s happened in reality,” she said. Greening said she hoped the class of 2020 would be a catalyst for employers to place less value on exam results and more on potential. Greening lost the Conservative whip under Johnson, along with a number of former cabinet ministers, over a series of Brexit rebellions, but had previously quit May’s cabinet after she refused to move from the DfE to be business secretary. She said Williamson would have been aware of the potential of the system to inflict damage on the life chances of poorer pupils – and that they would need the most support after schools closures. “It was clear when life-defining exams were cancelled that there would also be a need for a plan to ensure university places, apprenticeships and wider employment opportunities wouldn’t become even further out of reach for young people,” she said. “Gavin Williamson was right to say sorry to young people for the school exam disruption they’ve had to suffer, but ultimately actions speak louder than words.” Greening said that as well as ensuring schools return next week, the government had to have a targeted plan to help those in education worst affected by lack of schooling. “There must be a properly resourced plan to support every child to catch up on lost time, and more personalised tutoring and support for those worst affected,” she said. “The government has had long enough to work through the challenges. We cannot have ‘Soino’ – schools open in name only, but children still falling behind.” Greening said the chaos over the 2020 exam results should speed up moves to place less emphasis on exam grades, for universities, apprenticeships and employers. “A smarter approach means assessing the rest of a young person’s wider potential beyond purely academic attainment assessed through an exam,” she said. “Academic exam grades end up being an overly narrow, traditional measure or proxy of a young person’s potential that can be gamed by the extra investment in outcomes for children in private education.” Greening said the government would continue to fail a generation of young people unless it could show there was a proper plan to prevent mass unemployment after the pandemic. “The chancellor and his Treasury department must bring forward a plan for the economy so it can generate enough high-skilled jobs for these diverse, talented young people as they graduate in the coming years,” she said. “Delaying the budget planned for September would be a recipe for even more of the same chaos – a government continuing to be shaped by events, rather than shaping them. If ministers should have learnt one thing from the exams chaos this August, it is that you don’t fix problems by pretending they don’t exist, it only lets them get worse.” Other former education secretaries have also been highly critical of Williamson’s approach in the months leading up to the A-level results. Almost 40% of pupils had their results downgraded, the majority from colleges or underperforming schools with larger class sizes. Alan Johnson, education secretary under Tony Blair, said it would have been a political decision to allow efforts to stop grade inflation to override risks to pupils’ life chances. David Blunkett, another Labour education secretary, said the lack of direction from Johnson had left Williamson floundering."
2020-08-24T21:30:36Z,politics,Politics,Headteachers launch stinging criticism of education secretary,"Thousands of headteachers have written to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, accusing the government of repeatedly failing to listen or collaborate as schools prepare to reopen to millions of children across England. In what appears to be a damaging breakdown in relations, headteachers say they are facing some of the most significant challenges of their professional lives but feel they are “working in isolation”, unsupported by the government. School leaders, who are still picking up the pieces after the recent exams fiasco, say their confidence in government has been “significantly knocked”. They are calling for urgent changes to current ways of working to help ensure a safe return to school. The intervention by the Worth Less? lobbying group, which represents thousands of headteachers across 75 local authorities from Cumbria to Cornwall, came as Boris Johnson said it was a “moral duty” to get children back into education after five months of absence. The prime minister, who was criticised for keeping a low profile as the A-levels fiasco unfolded, insisted that the risk of contracting coronavirus in school was low and that it was damaging for children to stay out of education for any longer. The success of the prime minister’s campaign will, however, depend on headteachers, who say they are not listened to and are not trusted by the government. Instead of meaningful collaboration, the letter says school leaders are at the mercy of ever shifting policy directives and “myriad changes”. “In a time of unprecedented challenge, we need some clarity and purpose,” said Jules White, head of Tanbridge House school in Horsham, West Sussex, and the leader of Worth Less?, which cut its campaigning teeth on school funding and organised a headteachers’ march on Downing Street to press for more money. White said: “The majority of heads feel let down by the Department for Education and indeed Ofqual [the exams regulator in England]. Whilst we support the government’s aspirations to get every child back to school safely, heads require more than just vague words to deliver effectively for every child.” School leaders who signed up to the letter described recent events as “farcical” and variously expressed anger, frustration and anxiety about how the government has handled the response to Covid on schools and plans for reopening in September. Their letter is also disparaging about assumptions that, once opened, schools will be able to carry on as before. “The pandemic has already created far-reaching problems for many children,” the letter states. “The notion that schools will find a ‘new normal’ that allows provision to simply carry on as before is unhelpful in the extreme. New priorities have emerged and they will need to be tackled quickly and effectively.” As the clock ticks down to the start of the academic year, the letter lists a series of headteachers’ pressing concerns, including fears about whether there will be sufficient resources to support children’s mental health. Worth Less? is also concerned about unrealistic expectations for next year’s exams. The government and Ofqual have made a number of modest changes to GCSEs and A-levels due to be taken in 2021, but teachers say they do not go nearly far enough and would like a radical rethink. Headteachers have also expressed fears about the lack of contingency planning for short-term school closures and local lockdowns in response to infection outbreaks. Downing Street admitted on Monday that schools could be forced to close again if stricter local lockdown measures are needed to prevent the spread of coronavirus, and teachers must prepare remote learning for pupils. “The complexity of the challenges that lie ahead must not … be underestimated,” the letter states, “and if children and their families are to be most effectively served, urgent improvements to current ways of working are required. “As headteachers face some of the most important challenges of our professional lives, all too often we feel that we are working in isolation from government rather than in harmony with our political masters. “Collaboration, consultation and partnership have felt in short supply and this caused immense frustration as time, energy and resources have been wasted by headteachers as we respond to shifting policy directives and myriad changes.” Pupils in England and Wales are due to return to schools from next week, following Northern Ireland, where children began the new term on Monday, and Scotland, where pupils have been back at school for a fortnight. In one Dundee special school, 17 teachers and two pupils tested positive for Covid. The DfE has been contacted for comment."
2020-08-24T14:33:56Z,politics,Politics,Labour launches study of possible reforms to UN institutions,"Labour has launched a review of possible reforms to United Nations institutions, in a move that will inevitably raise questions about the continued merits of Britain’s veto as one of the five permanent members of the security council. The review, ordered by the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, and led by Ray Collins, the shadow foreign minister in the Lords, will study the structure of the security council, the role of the general assembly and the powers of the World Health Organization. It will also look at the UN’s efficiency, its links with civil society and the ways in which UN bodies such as the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons OPCW and the international court of justice can better hold national governments to account for crimes against humanity. “If Covid has shown us anything it has shown the need for multilateral solutions, and the UN is the premier multilateral institution in the world. But we need to acknowledge its shortcomings. The UK, as one of the chief funders of the UN, could have great influence on how it can be made more effective,” Collins said.
The security council has been widely criticised as having been sidelined as China, Russia and the US have vied in their threats to use their vetos. Known collectively as the P5, he five permanent members - China, France, Russia, the UK and the US - reflect the outcome of the second world war, but exclude many major economies including Brazil, Germany, India and Japan. Collins admitted that numerous past attempts to reform the council, including the expansion of its permanent membership, had foundered on the vetos of the P5. He recognised that entrenched interests made fundamental reform of the council extremely unlikely, but said he was optimistic that multilateralism could be revived, including by changing the powers of the general assembly, or by building from below to make the UN more effective on issues such as climate change, trade, health and labour standards. “I do not think we should be trapped by some of these seemingly insurmountable geopolitical barriers between the US and China,” he said. Flaws in the World Health Organization had also been revealed, he said, many of them stemming from the UN’s reliance on member states for information. Collins said the review came at a critical time because the two pillars of British foreign policy – its alliance with the US and membership of the EU – had been undermined by Donald Trump and Brexit. “There has been a lot of talk in the UK about regaining national sovereignty, and of course we need to act in the national interest, but often that national interest can only be protected by international norms and cooperation, he said. He also said he was troubled that the UK did not seem to want to engage with multilateral initiatives such as the alliance for multilateralism backed by France and Germany, or Joe Biden’s plan to hold a conference of democracies. He suggested the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, was instead overly focussed on framing the five-eyes intelligence alliance as the main body through which Britain would build its alliances. He said the UK’s influence at the UN was waning. He noted that the country had led on the 2030 agenda on sustainable development , but had contributed little since on how to implement its goals. Collins believes the UK also needs a more consistent approach to human rights and international accountability. “It is not good enough that 11 Saudi officials are sanctioned on one day for their role in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, and then the arms sales to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen are renewed the next day,” he said. The review has parallels with the UK government’s review of foreign and security policy, which has just called for public evidence."
2020-08-24T13:13:12Z,politics,Politics,Schools in England will have to provide remote learning if closed again,"Schools in England could be forced to close again if stricter local lockdown measures are needed to prevent the spread of coronavirus, but teachers must prepare remote learning for pupils, Downing Street has said. Boris Johnson spoke of a “moral duty” to get children back into education after five months of absence and said the risk of picking up the virus in schools was small. On Monday parents were warned they could be fined if they decide to keep children off. In any future lockdown that requires schools to close, teachers would be mandated to keep learning ongoing at home. Asked if there would be mass closures of schools again, even on a localised basis, a Downing Street spokesman said: “We would need to look on a case-by-case basis at the local area … it would depend on the local lockdown in question and the circumstances around increasing cases. If that was the case and that needed to happen, we would expect the school to provide a remote education.” Outbreaks around schools would be dealt with by deploying mobile testing units, testing staff and potentially isolating some pupils or groups, Downing Street said. The schools minister, Nick Gibb, said financial penalties would be a “last resort” but were still available to local authorities if pupils were kept away from the classroom. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Gibb said: “Fines for non-attendance have always been a last resort for headteachers in schools. What matters is that young people are attending school. “We live in a country where education is compulsory and I think parents can be reassured that the measures that schools are taking to make sure that we minimise the risk of the transmission of the virus are very effective.” He said he had visited schools preparing for the return next week that had devised safety measures such as “bubble zones” to keep groups of children together.
Other measures might include installing more hand basins and hand sanitiser points, different entrances being opened around the school, and pupils having their own designated keyboards. No 10 said it was not changing its guidance on mask usage in schools. “Our guidance does not recommend face masks in school, we acknowledge face coverings could obstruct communication between teachers and pupils,” Johnson’s spokesman said. Scotland’s education secretary, John Swinney, is consulting with teachers and councils on the possibility of bringing in guidance on masks in secondary schools there. Gibb suggested headteachers in England should be able to reassure families that the measures they had taken meant it was safe for children to come back without the need for local authorities to issue penalty notices. “If they have got extra concerns, that’s a matter between the headteacher and the family,” he said. Fines for unauthorised absences are £60, rising to £120 if there is a delay in paying. They are often applied to people who take their children out of school in term time for holidays. Gibb suggested there would be no change to this system in light of the pandemic.
In a second interview with BBC Breakfast, he said: “Fines are available. We haven’t suspended the law on that issue from September onwards, but, knowing headteachers as I do, they use that measure absolutely as a very last resort, and in the current climate they will want to be talking to parents to allay their concerns.” The deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries, said in an interview with Sky News on Monday that children were more at risk from seasonal flu than coronavirus. Child deaths from coronavirus were exceptionally rare, and when children did get an infection it was very mild and sometimes asymptomatic, she said. The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, accused the government of going “missing in action” and being “asleep at the wheel”. She told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “The guidance that’s been given to schools is one-size-fits-all. It doesn’t take account of the fact that a small school, perhaps in very constrained premises, will have to make different arrangements from a large inner-city school. “There hasn’t been information for school leaders, so that they can’t plan what they might have to do if there was a sudden spike in the local infection rate and the guidance that has come out I think has been – it’s been contradictory, it’s been confusing, it came very late, shortly before the summer holidays.” Many pupils in England have not attended classes since March, when schools were closed except to look after vulnerable children and those of key workers. Schools in Scotland reopened this month, while those in Northern Ireland were welcoming pupils again on Monday. English and Welsh schools will follow suit in September."
2020-08-24T05:00:16Z,politics,Politics,My blue passport has arrived â€“ and with it a crushing new sense of our Brexit nightmare | Zoe Williams,"In February, I lost my passport in the stupidest way yet. I was not mugged, pickpocketed or burgled (passports one to three), I did not drop it in a pond (passport four), or lose it in a house move (passport five), I just walked through a station in a bit of a daze, and by the time I got to my platform, it was gone. I tried to self-soothe with the fact that, at least I now had time to renew before the blue ones came in, but that plan did not square with the global pandemic, and the document arrived today, as blue as midnight and also as dark. Some observations: we definitely are not in the EU any more. There are no stars, just a lion, a unicorn and a peculiar and bereft illustration of the UK, with Northern Ireland a floating blob, the rest of the landmass etched out like Trotsky’s face. I don’t know why I should find this so disappointing. Obviously on some subconscious level, I thought it was all a dream, or a joke. The colour, meanwhile, is not the nostalgia kick you might have hoped for, if that was your thing, since it genuinely is blue, while the pre-EU ones looked more like black. This somehow says it all about the Brexit project, that it would fight to the death over a principle that was trivial and wrong. Three flowers and a shamrock are embossed on the back, for poetry I suppose, except the daffodil could be any flower, and the overall effect is of someone finding free graphics on the internet for a superbly boring PowerPoint presentation. Yet by far the worst thing about it was my own photo, as ever, contriving to look meaner and more like Myra Hindley than the last, which was itself the worst picture I had ever taken. Remarkably, and powerfully, this lifted my spirits. Some things never change. Every passport has a worse photo than the last – even, mysteriously, one you lost after only six months. But everything else can change, and who knows, by 2030, the blue years could be over. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"
2020-08-23T23:04:28Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson moves to seize control of schools agenda after exams chaos,"Boris Johnson attempted to reassert his grip over education after days of chaos by making a personal plea to parents to send their children back to the classroom in England in September. The prime minister, who was criticised for going on holiday to Scotland during the A-level debacle, has spoken out to say the risk of contracting coronavirus in school is low and that it is damaging for children to be out of education for any longer. His decision to personally front the return-to-school drive rather than Gavin Williamson, the beleaguered education secretary who has faced calls to quit over the fiasco, is part of a deliberate attempt to switch the “messenger” and win back the public, a senior Tory suggested. Johnson’s intervention comes after the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said children could be at greater harm by staying at home than attending school. Regarding the expected return on 1 September, Johnson said: “I have previously spoken about the moral duty to reopen schools to all pupils safely, and I would like to thank the school staff who have spent the summer months making classrooms Covid-secure in preparation for a full return in September. “We have always been guided by our scientific and medical experts, and we now know far more about coronavirus than we did earlier this year. As the chief medical officer has said, the risk of contracting Covid-19 in school is very small and it is far more damaging for a child’s development and their health and wellbeing to be away from school any longer. “This is why it’s vitally important that we get our children back into the classroom to learn and to be with their friends. Nothing will have a greater effect on the life chances of our children than returning to school.” Williamson faced calls to quit after pupils were given downgraded A-level results because of an algorithm applied by exams watchdog Ofqual, despite being warned of flaws in advance. This meant some pupils missed out on places at university and the government was forced into an embarrassing U-turn to allow teacher-assessed grades to be used instead. Tory poll ratings also narrowed to just two points ahead of Labour for the first time since Johnson became prime minister. Johnson was criticised for not publicly addressing the A-level issue and continuing with his holiday in Applecross in the Highlands until his location was discovered and the trip reportedly cut short. The chief medical officers and deputy chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales said in a joint statement they were confident the evidence showed an exceptionally small risk of children of primary or secondary school age dying from Covid-19. Schools in Scotland reopened earlier this month, while those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to welcome all pupils from the beginning of September. Tory MP Robert Halfon, who is chair of the education select committee, said he understood parents would be worried but it would be a significant risk to keep children at home. He warned of an “epidemic of educational poverty”, while former minister Theresa Villiers said the prime minister was sending a strong signal that getting children back to school was a priority. “He’s gripping this and determined to get it done,” she said. Ahead of a delicate few weeks for the government, one senior Tory said: “Lots of Tory MPs think Gavin is now discredited so a different and better messenger was needed.” But another said: “Boris Johnson making these comments isn’t to do with Gavin although that will have had an impact. Education is the centre of everything that we are doing, so it’s got to come from the top and the clearer message the better.”
Keir Starmer, however, said government incompetence and the chaos caused by the exams fiasco was putting the plans to get all children back to school at serious risk. In an interview with the Observer, the Labour leader said two crucial weeks were wasted dealing with a self-inflicted mess that has destroyed public confidence in government. Starmer said: “I want to see children back at school next month, and I expect the prime minister to deliver on that commitment. However, the commitment is now at serious risk after a week of chaos, confusion and incompetence from the government.” The Liberal Democrats’ education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said parents were worried and the government must rapidly upscale test and trace, and ensure schools had the mental health support, financial resources and the use of community spaces they needed before fully reopening. She said Williamson should be fired. “The country, and seemingly the prime minister, has lost faith in Gavin Williamson,” Moran said. “To restore confidence among parents, pupils and teachers the best thing the prime minister could do is sack him, rather than try to speak for him.” Teaching unions share the government’s ambition to get all children back to school, but remain concerned about safety and have called on ministers to draw up a plan B in the event of Covid-19 outbreaks affecting schools. Responding to the joint statement by UK chief medical officers about school reopening, Unison, which represents school support workers, said it was vital for staff to be allowed to wear face coverings, especially given the acknowledgement of a transmission risk between staff. “It’s still unclear why government guidance won’t allow them, when they’re recommended for other workplaces,” said Unison’s head of education, Jon Richards, who also called for more money to pay for specially trained cleaners to carry out regular deep cleans. He also requested proper social distancing measures in cramped conditions such as school kitchens. The National Education Union accused the government of being “negligent in the extreme” with no plan B in the case of further outbreaks and an insufficiently robust test and trace system. NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said: “Today’s report by Public Health England shows that there were only a small number of outbreaks in schools after the partial wider opening in June, but as the report itself acknowledges there are limitations on the generalisability of its findings. “Schools and colleges need to know what should happen if an outbreak of the virus occurs in individual schools or more widely with either national, regional or local spikes.” The government has already promised a £1bn catch-up fund for schools and on Monday will unveil a package targeted at children in their first year of primary to boost their early language skills. Priority will be given to schools with a high proportion of disadvantaged pupils. Schools in England will be encouraged to apply for a share of a £9m early years programme to help reception-aged pupils whose education has been disrupted by coronavirus, and deliver one-to-one and small group support for five-year-olds. Children’s minister Vicky Ford said: “We cannot afford for our youngest children to lose out, which is why this package of support is focused on improving early language skills for the reception children who need it most, and especially those whose long-term outcomes have been affected by time out of education.”"

Tory heartlands in revolt over planning reforms,"In the lane beside the 12th-century church in Earnley, West Sussex, Robert Carey spotted a flattened toad. “There’s a picture of what’s happening to local residents,” he said. “Squashed.” Boris Johnson’s reform proposals for the English planning system – widely seen as tipping the balance of power in favour of developers and away from local objectors – have gone down badly in this corner of the Conservative heartlands. Voters like Carey fear not just a loss of local power, which is already angering some local Conservative politicians, but the threat of “rural sprawl” creating new landscapes of unbroken low-density development across the shires. It means, one local objector said, the “suburbanisation” of the countryside. It took less than 24 hours for the threat to become real after the planning white paper was unveiled. An application landed the next day with the parish council from an emboldened developer to build 100 homes on a stubbly wheat field on the edge of Earnley. It is exactly the sort of site that could be zoned for growth under the government’s new planning system, meaning that builders automatically get outline planning permission as long as the designs broadly meet a pre-agreed local plan. Steve Culpitt, the managing director of the site’s developer, Seaward Properties, was understandably happy with the new policy, which he said “pulls the rug from beneath” opposition. “The major problem with all these sites is the objectors,” he said. “You always hear from them but never the supporters.” If the scheme goes ahead, the flint cottages of Earnley will merge with the modern housing estates of the neighbouring beach settlement of East Wittering. It is not a unique scenario. East Wittering is ringed with fields where housebuilders including Barratt Homes have plans for 1,450 homes which could all be built under the new zoning system. It would increase the settlement’s size by 60%. Opponents like Carey fear they could be almost powerless to prevent it if the white paper becomes law.
Another rebellion is brewing 20 minutes east along the already busy A27. Four days after the planning reforms were launched, the UK’s largest housebuilder, Persimmon, lodged an application to erect 475 homes on wheat fields that would blend the settlements of Ferring and Goring-by-Sea. “If and when this new planning regime comes into force this will be vulnerable,” said Ed Miller, the secretary of Ferring Conservation Group, who described the reforms as “an absolute attack on local government and local democracy”. Miller filled out his consultation response last week, describing the plans as “a betrayal of localism” and authoritarian. The local MP, Peter Bottomley, has previously alerted Johnson to the development, saying that people must not be deprived of “the green lungs between them”. Despite the concerns, the planning white paper is an attempt to tackle serious problems. It is billed as supporting the prime minister’s drive to “build, build, build” Britain’s way out of the Covid-19 recession while meeting an urgent need for more housing. English housing stock grew by 241,000 homes in 2018/19 but 340,000 new homes a year are needed over the next decade, according to research commissioned by the National Housing Federation. More are needed in West Sussex than in most other areas of the country, with 51,000 new households expected to be created in the next 15 years, according to Office for National Statistics projections, a 14% increase. There are also 3,800 homeless people in Brighton & Hove, according to a 2019 analysis by the housing charity Shelter. “Thanks to our planning system, we have nowhere near enough homes in the right places,” said Johnson in hisforeword to the planning white paper. The time has come to “tear it down and start again”. The paper proposes that instead of each application being decided through an individual democratic process, councils will be asked to draw up multi-year plans that divide land into zones for development and protection. Outline approval would be automatic in growth zones and there would be a statutory presumption in favour of development in renewal zones. Local voices must be heard when the local plan is drawn up, the policy states, but how this plays out remains to be seen. Once the plan is fixed, the only say local people will have is over detail of developments, so-called reserved matters. There would be protection for greenbelt and areas of outstanding natural beauty, but the new system looks certain to tilt the battlefield in favour of developers such as Barratt Homes. Its chief executive, David Thomas, said he welcomed “any proposals to speed up the planning system and provide transparency and certainty for both communities and housebuilders”. The CPRE, the campaigning countryside charity, sees the proposals in more dramatic terms. “Policies that have allowed major housebuilders to trample over the wishes of local people will be reinforced with binding land release targets and reduced affordable housing contributions,” said Crispin Truman, its chief executive. “Developers will be able to build what they want, where they want and for the most part when they want.” A planning liberalisation that takes control from local voters could, however, create an electoral headache for the government.
Cllr Louise Goldsmith, until last year the Conservative leader of West Sussex county council, said local voters in the Tory strongholds were “very hacked off” with the plans. Alongside refuse collection and potholes, planning is often the issue on which local voters are most likely to regularly engage. “People want a greater say, but this is greater centralisation,” said Goldsmith. “It worries every councillor because we want a happy community doing things in their community, but if they feel they are being done to ... that’s quite a dangerous thing to happen.” One voter the Conservatives might lose is Martin Silcocks, the landlord of the Thatched Tavern pub, a 16th-century inn overlooking a maize field where developers are poised to submit an application to build 226 homes. “Oh good lord!” he said when he saw the plans. “It would destroy everything this pub stands for.” That includes his customers’ uninterrupted view of the sunset.
Silcocks used to vote Ukip. He switched back to the Conservatives in 2019, but is not happy with Boris Johnson. His daughter and her young family are looking for a home, but they do not expect to be able to afford the new houses. Another Tory in rebellious mood is Libby Alexander, part of the Save Our South Coast Alliance, who feels the planning liberalisation would create expensive housing that was not needed and fail to deliver the cheaper accommodation that is in short supply. “We are constantly being labelled as selfish and nimbyish when all we are doing is pointing out the obvious,” she said. “Local democracy is in danger of being slowly shut down.” Alexander and her fellow campaigners fear new homes will be taken by elderly incomers rather than the local priced-out familiesThey are also concerned the houses will be at flood risk, destroy prime agricultural land and transform a rural landscape that is a key lure for tourists, who make a vital contribution to the local economy. “If Boris just shut up and did nothing but help developers build affordable housing, that’s all we need in this country,” she said. “This is a Conservative speaking, but I am fed up with what is going on.”"
2020-08-23T16:40:00Z,politics,Politics,Revealed: London councils take funds from developers to pay for planning guidelines,"Councils have accepted hundreds of thousands of pounds from property developers to fund planning guidelines designed to help govern their own schemes, a Guardian analysis has found. In deals that have been criticised for allowing unfair influence and marginalising local residents, bodies including housing developers, landowners and urban regeneration companies paid large sums to draft supplementary planning documents (SPDs), which councillors must then consider when determining planning applications. The planning documents subsequently published set out major and potentially lucrative development strategies for the sites in which they have an interest. The payments are not declared in the documents. Councils, which normally fund SPDs, and developers have denied allegations of conflicts of interest, but critics fear the arrangements mean “poachers become gamekeepers”. The practice has emerged less than two weeks after ministers announced a wholesale reform of the planning system which campaigners and voters fear will hand greater powers to developers in order to speed up building. According to responses the Guardian obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Conservative-run Barnet council in north London received £223,000 from the housing association Notting Hill Genesis to cover the costs of a planning brief for Grahame Park, a 3,000-home estate regeneration. The borough accepted the money via its joint venture company with Capita. The SPD for Grahame Park specified additional social housing only “where viable” and the housing association later proposed cutting the number of affordable homes by 257. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, described it as “a classic example of how not to do estate regeneration”. In Hounslow, west London, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) paid the Labour-run council £20,000 to fund supplementary planning guidance for a barracks site it is planning to sell for the development of 1,000 homes, which critics have attacked as over-development. In response to a freedom of information request to all English councils, none outside the capital said they engaged in the practice. The London councils insist the arrangements afford developers no unfair influence over what is permitted on the sites, but some cited budget shortfalls as the reason for needing to take the money. Critics, however, attacked the practice. “It is blatant collusion between planning authorities and developers,” said Bob Colenutt, the head of research the Northampton Institute for Urban Affairs and author of The Property Lobby. “Is this what the government means by cutting planning red tape? ... Poachers have become gamekeepers with local councils ceding yet more influence over planning to vested interests in speculative development.” Steve Reed, the shadow communities and local government secretary, said: “Government cuts to council funding have left town halls without the resources to develop full planning guidelines so developers have been allowed to write their own. This appears to be part of a strategy to diminish the voice of local communities and let wealthy developers bulldoze and concrete over local neighbourhoods and green spaces increasingly at will.” Reed said it was a harbinger of the “anti-democratic planning reforms” the government proposed earlier this month, which could fast-track development without a requirement for detailed planning consent. Councils usually pay for and draw up SPDs to provide guidance for what developers will be allowed to do. Councils said that plans drawn up using developer cash must still be meet wider planning rules. They are a material consideration in planning decisions. “It is often said that ‘he who pays the piper calls the tune,’” said Steve Goodrich, a senior research manager at Transparency International UK. “Any planning guidance developed which then contributes to council policy should be drafted in the public interest, not that of landowners and developers. Accepting payments for this work from those with a clear financial interest in the outcome risks exposing the authors to heavy and undue influence.” Barnet council also received £140,000 from the development company Joseph & Partners to draft a strategy for the renewal of North Finchley town centre. It then entered into a partnership agreement with the firm. The planning document included a proposal to demolish an art deco shopping arcade and replace it with an 12-storey apartment building. Campaigners including Dave Davies, the Kinks guitarist who used to buy guitar strings at the arcade in the 1960s, are opposing the scheme. Jonathan Joseph, the head of Joseph & Partners, denied there was any conflict of interest. “If and when any proposals do come forward for North Finchley, a full consultation and engagement process will be undertaken,” he said. Barnet denied the arrangements gave developers the role of poacher and gamekeeper. An SPD cannot be in conflict with wider planning policies in the borough, it said. Notting Hill Genesis stressed that Barnet “retained responsibility for final decision-making both on the SPD and subsequent planning decisions” for Grahame Park. On the Greenwich peninsula, the landowner Scotia Gas Networks (SGN) paid the council almost £30,000 for a planning brief for a gas-holder site. The brief concluded the area could accommodate high-rise buildings including as many as 1,200 homes, offices, a hotel, shops and restaurants. The council cited “a decade of government cuts” as a reason for needing to accept the funds, but said the landowner had no unfair influence over the planning brief. Dan Brown, a spokesman for SGN, said: “We had no role in producing the planning brief and the brief does not necessarily reflect the most favourable possible outcome for us.” In Hounslow, the MoD’s property arm spent £20,000 to fund supplementary planning guidance for its 18th century cavalry barracks, which it plans to sell as a site for 1,000 new homes. When Hounslow formally adopted a version of the planning strategy drawn up by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation, it made clear it “will be a material planning consideration in the determination of future planning applications”. Some local campaigners who oppose the plan say it amounts to “over-development” and want the buildings turned into a military museum. “The draft planning brief underwent full public consultation,” said Lily Bath, the deputy leader of Hounslow council. “The brief is in no way a guarantee for planning permission, but provides a framework for consideration of future planning applications.” An MoD spokesperson said it works “collaboratively with councils to draft guidance that ensure a quicker, and more cost efficient process for planning, design and development.” • This article was amended on 24 August 2020 because an earlier version misspelled Grahame Park estate as “Graeme Park”."
2020-08-23T13:23:41Z,politics,Politics,Gavin Williamson defends trip to Scarborough a week before A-levels fiasco,"The beleaguered education secretary has defended taking a trip to Scarborough the week before the A-levels fiasco in England that left pupils devastated and threw university admissions into disarray. Gavin Williamson, who is facing mounting pressure to resign over his handling of the exams debacle and failed attempts to get children back to school before the summer holidays, said he remained in “constant communication” with his department throughout his visit. He also shared on social media that he had cancelled his family holiday abroad in order to be able to focus on the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic on schools and education.
The trip to the North Yorkshire seaside resort of Scarborough, reported to have taken place the week beginning 3 August as Scottish results were published to widespread uproar among disappointed pupils, was to visit members of his family that he had not seen since lockdown began. According to the Sunday Times, Williamson cancelled what it described as “a crucial meeting” with school leaders to discuss the return of children to school in September, but took part in Zoom calls with Boris Johnson and other ministers while he was away. In a post on Twitter on Sunday morning, Williamson said: “I cancelled our family holiday abroad this year to focus on the challenges Covid-19 created for the education sector.” He added: “Over the summer, I went to see family in Scarborough for the first time since lockdown, and while there I was in constant communication with the department.”
A few responses were supportive, saying Williamson and other government colleagues who have been pictured on their holidays – including the prime minister, who was photographed in Scotland, – should not have to justify taking a break. Others were scathing and called on him to resign. Williamson, who has been nicknamed the “useful idiot” by some union leaders, is said to have lost the trust of his officials to such an extent that he can no longer serve effectively in the cabinet. Sir Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the powerful Commons liaison committee, told the Observer that after Williamson’s humiliating U-turn over A-level and GCSE results, the secretary of state made a bad situation worse and caused a “complete breakdown” of trust in his department by seeking to blame officials for the crisis. The Guardian revealed that the chair of Ofqual threatened to quit unless Williamson publicly backed the exams regulator and admitted it was behind the U-turn that salvaged millions of student grades. Roger Taylor’s ultimatum came after the education secretary tried to lay the blame for the exams fiasco at the door of Ofqual after a humiliating climbdown that scrapped A-levels and GCSEs awarded by algorithm, and reverted to school-assessed grades instead. Another of the most senior and influential Conservatives on the backbenches said he would be amazed if Williamson survived for long, and that his reputation in the education world had been irreparably damaged. Williamson’s fate is expected to be discussed by the executive of the backbench 1922 Committee of Tory MPs when parliament returns from the summer break on 1 September. His cabinet future depends on the success of the full reopening of schools to all children from the beginning of September. The prime minister said the reopening of schools was a national priority. He has been supported by the chief and deputy chief medical officers from across the UK, who said this weekend that while there were no risk-free options, further time out of the classroom would increase inequalities and reduce the life chances of children, and could exacerbate physical and mental health issues. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said plans to get all children back to school in early September were at serious risk because of government incompetence and the chaos caused by the exams fiasco. Starmer said that two crucial weeks, which should have been spent preparing for schools to reopen, have been wasted dealing with a self-inflicted “mess” that has destroyed public confidence in government."
2020-08-23T08:30:51Z,politics,Politics,'It was an act of principle': The Covid doctor who quit over Cummings,"On 24 May, a couple of days after it was revealed that Dominic Cummings had travelled to Durham during the lockdown, a British cardiologist, Dr Dominic Pimenta, published a tweet in which he threatened to resign if Cummings did not. For Pimenta, news of Cummings’s trip had landed like a blow. In March, he had been drafted on to a Covid-19 intensive care unit, where, every day, he had witnessed suffering and death, struggle and recovery: “This sheer volume of human capacity that had been devoted to trying to save lives.” His tweet came at the end of a terrible weekend of intensive care shifts during which he had watched patients die, their loved ones absent. And now this. “If we are going to be asked to risk our lives,” he wrote later, “the least we can expect is to be treated like people.” Pimenta’s tweet was widely shared. By the following morning he’d become a national news story, and he was invited by the media to share more of what he wanted to say: how he hoped that by making a stand he might highlight the recent sacrifices of healthcare workers while reassuring the public that their own sacrifices had not been in vain, that the lockdown was saving lives, that they must maintain faith in it. Catherine Calderwood, Scotland’s former chief medical officer, had recently resigned for a minor lockdown transgression. Pimenta wanted Cummings to do the same. “It was an act of principle,” Pimenta says, of his decision. “And the principle was: this isn’t acceptable, I will not accept it. All I ever wanted was for the government to underline the importance of the lockdown.” On social media, strangers congratulated Pimenta for making a stand. But much of the reaction he received was negative. People asked, How could he quit now, in the middle of a pandemic? Wasn’t he letting others down? He had hoped his superiors might make a stand, but nobody did. So when he was asked why he felt this was his responsibility, he replied: “If not me, then who?” He thought: “If everyone accepts this, then it becomes acceptable.” In medical school, he had been encouraged to speak up whenever he felt something was wrong. And maybe he took this too personally, he admits, but he considered making a stand a moral obligation. “There was almost a duty of public health to draw attention to the fact that this was not OK,” he says. “There had to be a line.”
When Pimenta realised that Cummings had no intention of handing in his notice, and that the government would not force him to, he understood what had to come next. His family was supportive, but apprehensive. His colleagues were mostly confused. What would he do now? He could still work as a doctor, but giving up his cardiology post meant significantly stalling his career – would it ever recover? He had had no intention of resigning before the pandemic, and yet here he was. When he handed in his notice, he agreed he would continue to work in the intensive care unit until October, by which point, he hoped, the coronavirus would have been contained and many of the patients he was caring for would have recovered. After that, he would be free to do something else. Pimenta is 33, with dark hair shaved close to the scalp. We are meeting in his north London garden, while his sister cares for his young children, to discuss these past few months: the controversial decisions he has made, the decisions that turned him into a quasi celebrity and led to his resignation. On the morning of 28 February, long after the coronavirus had escaped Wuhan and spread to other parts of the world, but before life in the UK began to change inconceivably, Pimenta published an urgent opinion piece on the Huffington Post in which he described Covid-19 as “a spectre on the horizon”, shared terrifying national infection estimates, and requested that the UK government act more decisively to ensure the NHS was prepared for the coming storm: more intensive care beds, more staff, immediate containment measures. Britain had yet to enforce lockdown – it wouldn’t do so until 23 March, despite confirmed cases in the UK as early as January – and even with significant warning, government reaction seemed sluggish. “Everybody kept saying, in that typically British way, ‘The NHS is ready,’” Pimenta says, “and I was like: ‘It’s really not!’”
He had watched with morbid fascination when Covid-19 first appeared in China, and then with terror and awe as it raged across the world. Soon, the bad news came in an endless flow. Pimenta’s wife, Dilsan, is also a doctor, and they began sharing emerging research with increasing frequency. It did not paint a pretty picture. A week before Pimenta published his opinion piece, while the pair sat at their kitchen countertop eating soup to stave off the February cold, Dilsan shared worrying news. “It’s in Italy now,” she said. Both of them sat sullen. “If it can happen in Italy, why not here?” The news came as “an explosion”, Pimenta says. What was once “a distant earthquake” had suddenly moved much closer. They watched as Italy was torn apart – the overloaded intensive care units, the shocking number of body bags, the confusion and terror and tragedy. Pimenta was troubled. At work, a large London teaching hospital, his colleagues discussed the coronavirus anxiously, aware it was coming if not already silently among them. But they seemed prevented by procedure to put into place measures that would contain the spread. Until mid-March, hospital guidelines restricted Pimenta from testing patients for coronavirus unless they had recently travelled to affected areas, even though the virus was known to be already out in the community. Pimenta struggled to understand why more action wasn’t being taken. Once, when he suggested replacing face-to-face appointments with phone consultations to reduce contact, he was overruled. He spoke to doctors at other London hospitals who had been asked by management to remove their masks because the sight of them panicked patients, placing their health at risk. (Some later contracted the virus.) He found that though many of his superiors appeared worried, others were blasé, driven by “a combination of naivety and optimism”, and unable to face an uncomfortable truth. Worse, the seriousness of the situation had yet to sink in at government level, Pimenta thought, and the trickle-down effects of its inactivity meant that the danger hadn’t fully permeated the public consciousness. The atmosphere in the hospital, as well as in public spaces he still visited, was one of inertia. Often, a kind of wait-and-see attitude prevailed. Pimenta began to return home from work in a funk. He was unable to sleep. He thought: “Shouldn’t we be doing more? Why aren’t we preparing?” Anxious, he recorded observations on his way to and from the hospital. Just before he published his opinion piece, he noted: “There are now two obvious and inescapable truths. That the virus can no longer be contained, because we aren’t testing or finding contacts anymore, and that without widespread measures it will continue to double every two to three days. And yet still nothing changes.”
As soon as Pimenta published that first opinion piece, he was roundly described as sensationalist and irresponsible, both on social media, by strangers, and at work, by many of his hospital colleagues. His co-workers thought he was inciting panic unnecessarily. “A lot of them thought, ‘Why is it you that’s saying this? What right do you have?’” Colleagues asked: “Isn’t there someone up the chain who should speak out instead?” Because Pimenta is active on Twitter, he began to be labelled a “media doctor”. People questioned his ambitions, as though he were using his medical position as a platform to celebrity. Was he performing his duty? Or was he self-promoting? Pimenta was undeterred. “I just kept doing the numbers,” he says. “OK, if we have this many cases one week, then we’ll have double the week after, and so on and so on. All I could see was that this was going to get much, much worse. And people would say: ‘Oh no, that won’t happen.’ But nobody could actually prove to me that it wouldn’t!” In the middle of March, Pimenta appeared on Channel 4 News to reassert his opinion that government should enforce a national lockdown as quickly as possible in order to contain the virus. By then, the UK had recorded 53 Covid-19-related deaths, according to the World Health Organisation, and confirmed case numbers were soaring. Other countries had shut down already. But again his appearance was described as attention-seeking and alarmist, even though prominent scientists, including Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, had suggested doing the same. At work, he became “horribly isolated”. Weeks later, he resigned. In June, Pimenta started writing a book. He had been approached by a publisher to write an account of his personal experience on the frontline of the pandemic: about those anxious early days, when the wave was coming but nobody seemed prepared; about life in a Covid-19 intensive care unit; about his resignation. When he started writing, he looked back through the notes he had jotted down as the coronavirus spread and then, to help with chronology, at his Twitter feed, which he used throughout the first wave like a personal blog, and which threw up the raw emotion of the past few months.
Pimenta’s book, Duty of Care, is a startlingly personal account. It can be described as a memoir, a thriller or a horror story, but really it is all at once. He thinks of the book as a corrective. “For lots of people, lockdown was this intangible inconvenience. You just stayed at home until you were told not to. You didn’t see it. But we did. We saw the wave hit. We saw people sicker than we’ve ever seen – a huge loss of life. And what I worry about is this whole episode has gone undercover. The ITUs were closed. Relatives couldn’t visit.” He hopes that by describing his own experience, the book will provide “an idea of what it was like, what it achieved, what your sacrifice achieved”. Pimenta will receive a writer’s fee for the book, but its royalties will be donated to Heroes, a charity he set up in March in response to the UK’s critical shortage of PPE. Heroes has since developed into a support network for the welfare and wellbeing of NHS workers, partly because Pimenta is concerned about the long-term emotional toll the outbreak will have on them – the pressure and agony of the situation, of so often being helpless while patients suffer. A recent Chinese study found that front-line nurses in Wuhan experienced “a variety of mental health challenges, especially burn-out and fear”. He fears a similar wave will hit the NHS. “One of the drivers of PTSD is being out of control,” he says, so “there’s going to be a massive toll on people who felt dumped in it. Everybody, to some extent, was taken unawares. Everybody stood up and did their best. Nobody said: ‘No, this isn’t for me.’ But the sacrifice was huge: 540 UK healthcare workers dead.” In many ways, Pimenta had been right to speak out, publicly, on all the occasions that he did. A study recently published in the Lancet found that Cummings’s trip eroded public trust in the lockdown and the government’s handling of the pandemic. Several reports have found that imposing an earlier lockdown in the UK, even by a week, as Pimenta suggested, would have saved thousands of lives. A recent Amnesty report found that the number of healthcare worker deaths in the UK during the pandemic is the highest per million in the world, a tragedy Pimenta believes was preventable. “If we’d had the capacity to cope,” he says, “all of that was so avoidable.” He blames the government: “A failure to prepare from the top down, a failure to build stocks, a failure to train and a failure to do it all on the hoof.”
Throughout the first wave, Pimenta watched as his colleagues were asked to risk their lives. “There were a lot of fractious moments when people were worried, and they were told not to worry, or that their worry was inducing other people to worry.” Since the outbreak of the pandemic, many people have asked: “Is it a doctor’s moral obligation to put his patients’ lives ahead of his own?” “You have to accept in your mind that it is a job, that it pays a wage, that you don’t have to stick it out,” Pimenta says. He thinks referring to healthcare workers as “heroes” can be problematic, because it suggests they have inhuman ability, that they are driven by some higher moral obligation or force, as if it is their duty to serve the rest of us, when really they are just normal people trying to get through the day. Pimenta is “still processing” all that has happened to him. The past months have been “scarring” and “emotionally wearing”. He says he is unsure whether his decision to resign was worthwhile, that perhaps there might have been a different way, a more measured response. “Obviously, it didn’t make a tangible difference,” he says. “But on the other hand, opinions were changed. People understood that there was still an importance to the lockdown. Maybe it brought attention to that? So in many ways, yes, it was worth it. Was it worth it personally? Probably not.” After he resigned, a friend asked Pimenta if he would be interested in getting into politics. It was a logical question – strangers on Twitter had asked the same – to which Pimenta replied, “Hell, no.” The pain inflicted on his family by negative reaction to his decision means he will engage in “public life no more than necessary”, he says. But he does have an interest in affecting policy, particularly within the NHS. His resignation catapulted him into “the national conversation”, he says, and he can see the seductive power in that, in being able to do more than “just shout at the TV” when he feels something is wrong. Maybe he’ll become a media doctor after all. “If I had 10 followers on Twitter, we wouldn’t be having this conversation,” he says. “But having access to that platform, and believing you have something to say that can change the national conversation… How could you not say something? Isn’t that duty?” Duty of Care: One NHS Doctor’s Story of the Covid-19 Crisis by Dr Dominic Pimenta is published by Welbeck on 3 September at £8.99"
2020-08-23T06:19:48Z,politics,Politics,Senior Tories turn on Gavin Williamson over exams fiasco,"The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has lost the trust of his officials to such an extent that he can no longer serve effectively in the cabinet, one of the most senior Tory MPs said last night as pressure grew on Boris Johnson to sack him. Sir Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the powerful Commons liaison committee, which will grill the prime minister on 16 September, told the Observer that after Williamson’s humiliating U-turn over A-level and GCSE results, the secretary of state made a bad situation worse and caused a “complete breakdown” of trust in his department by seeking to blame officials for the crisis. With Tory anger over the episode at boiling point, another of the most senior and influential Conservatives on the backbenches said he would be “amazed” if Williamson survived for long, and that his reputation in the education world had been “irreparably damaged”. Williamson’s fate is expected to be discussed by the executive of the backbench 1922 committee of Tory MPs when parliament returns from the summer break on 1 September. So far Boris Johnson, who is expected to return from a holiday in Scotland this week, has said nothing publicly about the crisis. He has stood by Williamson after the education secretary at first defended the use of a controversial algorithm which led to huge numbers of A-level students receiving lower than expected grades, then ditched it altogether for both A-level and GCSE assessment. While the Guardian had reported that Ofqual’s algorithm would downgrade 39% of grades recommended by teachers, the scale of the disaster became apparent when results were issued and students reported bizarre and inexplicable results. The U-turn came after days of confusion and distress for millions of pupils, parents and teachers. While the climbdown came as a relief to many pupils, it unleashed fresh chaos across the education sector as universities and colleges were faced with more students who had gained the required grades than the number of places they could offer.
Jenkin suggested that the implications of Williamson’s behaviour in blaming officials rather than taking the blame himself were serious for the wider working of government, and should not to be ignored. Williamson did apologise and eventually gave his backing to Ofqual but only after clear efforts had been made to shift blame on to others. Jenkin said: “The deal between ministers and officials is that officials give their best advice and ministers get to make decisions. This means that when something goes wrong ministers take the blame, and that is the reason why officials will be free to speak and give the best advice. But if officials feel they are going to be blamed in public they will not give the best advice to ministers. “In the Gavin Williamson case there has been briefing against the permanent secretary (at the Department for Education) and Ofqual. This is not likely to engage enthusiastic co-operation from the department and it permanently disables Gavin Williamson as secretary of state because there will have been a complete breakdown of trust.” The Williamson episode has fuelled a growing sense of resentment among many Tory MPs who feel their views are being ignored by a centralised operation run from No 10, and that ministers and officials with previous records of backing Johnson both in the Brexit referendum, and in his campaign for the leadership, are being protected however badly they perform. Another former minister said: “There are so many capable people on the backbenches, yet we hang on to Gavin Williamson. Look at Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt. The parliamentary party is split. If you backed Vote Leave and backed Boris for leader, you are protected. The rest of us are not listened to. In fact, we are completely ignored.” Tory unrest over Williamson’s position has added to pre-existing frustration over why he held the education post in the first place, having never shown a particular interest in the issue.
The cabinet post came as a reward for his help in ensuring Johnson secured enough MPs’ support to win the leadership. One Tory minister said that Williamson’s survival was “shocking”, before adding wearily: “But nothing surprises me.” Williamson has also been protected by the reluctance of Mark Spencer, the chief whip, to back a reshuffle, concluding that it could leave Johnson with more enemies than new friends. The positions of both Williamson and Ofqual officials will again be in the spotlight when parliament returns. Both will face a grilling by MPs on the education select committee, which is led by Robert Halfon, the independent-minded Tory MP who has been hugely critical of the exams fiasco. Whitehall insiders said that there was already a scramble taking place to examine notes, memos and emails, to decipher who knew what, and when."
2020-08-23T05:50:48Z,politics,Politics,Labour ramps up Facebook advertising in wake of exams fiasco,"Labour ran more Facebook adverts last week than during the entirety of last year’s election campaign, it has emerged, as part of attempts to overhaul its online and digital operations. Party insiders said that it had about 2,700 Facebook adverts running over the past week as it tried to exploit the exams fiasco that engulfed the government. They said that only about 2,400 such adverts were run by the central party during last year’s election. Labour has been using the exams issue as a dry run in its attempt to overhaul its digital operation, with particular focus on targeted Facebook ads in marginal, Tory-held seats. An internal review of its digital operations is already taking place. It comes after a party post-mortem of the 2019 election concluded that a complete digital overhaul was required. “If we are going to get back into power we need to win the ground war and the online war,” said a party source. “We need to be smart, innovative and effective. It will take time, but this week was about demonstrating what we are capable of.”
Adverts have been sent to Facebook users in target seats, stating that the exams fiasco is “robbing young people of their future” and calling on constituents to contact their local Tory MP, who is named and pictured. The party is also switching to greater “social listening”, deploying MPs and regional offices to monitor social media to see how political issues are playing out in practice in Facebook groups. “There was clearly a groundswell of anger among parents, teachers and young people – and they were all sharing their stories,” said the source. Labour’s attack videos have focused on using ministers’ own speeches against them and third-party voices, such as pupils who had had their grades downgraded, rather than predominantly featuring Labour frontbenchers. There are also plans to deploy more online petitions. However, there have been complaints from the party’s left over the quality of Labour’s social media campaigning, which was used so effectively by Jeremy Corbyn’s supporters to help him win the party leadership in 2015. Some have complained that the new adverts are outdated and too reserved. Under Corbyn, a lot of the most popular Facebook and Twitter content backing the party came not from the party but Momentum, the grassroots group that developed from Corbyn’s leadership campaign. The new drive comes after a review of the 2019 campaign by the Labour Together group called for a “wholesale transformation of our digital and online campaigning”. Labour Together’s former director, Morgan McSweeney, is now Keir Starmer’s chief of staff. The review concluded that the party’s social media channels “became simply an additional broadcast platform rather than a dynamic and responsive tool for targeting, engaging and persuading groups of voters”. It added: “Labour’s supporters online spent too much of the campaign talking to themselves rather than reaching out to convince swing voters to support Labour. In contrast, the Tory online presence was vastly improved from 2017, at national and local level, using proxies to attack Labour and build support for the Conservative campaign in key seats. The Conservatives’ central message of ‘Get Brexit done’ lent itself to their very effective approach to organic shares and ‘distributed spin’ online.”"
2020-08-21T16:54:00Z,politics,Politics,MPs call on UK to help whistleblower facing extradition to Monaco,"A cross–party group of MPs is urging the Foreign Office to support a corruption whistleblower who says he is the victim of “political persecution” in Monaco. Margaret Hodge, a former Labour minister, Andrew Mitchell, a former Tory minister, and other politicians are calling on the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, to help Jonathan Taylor, a 51-year-old British lawyer who was recently arrested while on holiday in Croatia. He was arrested at the request of the authorities in Monaco. The MPs are pressing the British government to help bring Taylor back to the UK because of the “high-level corruption” he has exposed. Taylor, from Hampshire, has been ordered to remain for weeks in Croatia as he faces extradition to Monaco. Eight years ago Taylor blew the whistle while working for a Dutch multinational firm, SBM Offshore, in Monaco. He helped reveal how the Monaco-based firm had paid large-scale multimillion dollar bribes to secure contracts in the oil industry around the world. His information helped prosecutors in the Netherlands, the US and Brazil to force SBM to pay huge penalties to settle the corruption allegations after admitting its wrongdoing. Three weeks ago, he was arrested at Dubrovnik airport when he arrived there with his wife and three teenage children for a holiday. Croatian legal papers seen by the Guardian show he was arrested at the request of the public prosecutor in Monaco for alleged “bribery/corruption” committed in 2013. It is understood that this allegation relates to a complaint from SBM Offshore that Taylor attempted to extort money from the firm when he was negotiating compensation for leaving the company. The firm had alleged that he threatened to inform prosecutors about the corruption unless he was given more money. Taylor denies the allegation, adding that a court in Monaco threw out the extortion claim two years ago. He said he was the victim of “clearly political persecution” by the Monaco authorities in what amounted to “a form of revenge”. A Croatian court has released Taylor on bail but told him to remain in the country while the extradition proceedings are resolved. His case has been taken up by Hodge, Mitchell and other MPs on the all-party parliamentary group on anti-corruption and responsible tax. In their letter to Raab on Friday, they called on the UK government to help Taylor who they said was “facing international retaliation”. They wrote: “The public rely on the bravery of whistleblowers but far too often, they suffer from vengeful action by their former employers. To encourage whistleblowers to speak out they must be given the appropriate protection. Failure to do so would make others less willing to come forward to expose serious crimes and so undermine the fight against corruption.” An FCO spokesperson later said: “We are supporting a British man and his family following his arrest and detention in Dubrovnik, and are in contact with the Croatian authorities.”"
2020-08-21T15:11:40Z,politics,Politics,Inside the tent: who was Boris Johnson's holiday guest?,"The last time Boris Johnson went on a proper break, in January, he chose the Caribbean and stayed in a luxury villa on the island of Mustique that rents for £15,000 a week. His summer holiday, it emerged on Friday, had a studiedly different vibe: a remote three-bedroom cottage on the coast of Scotland – with a tent in the garden. In some ways, the property fits the bill for the prime ministerial getaway: chintzy furniture, log-burner, a cot, pets allowed, will comfortably accommodate his family of three. It also appears ideally located to avoid passersby (or, at least, it must have done until a long-lens photographer for the Daily Mail showed up – a development which, it transpired on Friday, forced Johnson to cut his holiday short on Thursday night).
But what about the tent? With Downing Street reluctant to be drawn on any aspect of the holiday, speculation about the canvas yurt abounded. Not least – who put it up – and why did it have to come down? A few possibilities present themselves: Guest quarters? If Johnson had guests staying, it may be that some poor unfortunates (unlikely to include the PM himself, you feel) have been exiled from bricks and mortar to canvas and guy ropes, possibly to avoid any Dominic Cummings-style scandal over adherence to coronavirus protocol. But this literalised support bubble would only be necessary if more than two households were present on the trip. Possibly the security guards were bedding down outside. But if so, the fact that their temporary HQ was facing away from the principal appears less than totally secure, and surely not even Britain’s clumsiest enemies are likely to have contemplated an attack from the sea. Also, there are six in the security detail – and they are presumably massive, so it would have been a squeeze. Maybe it’s where the political staff were based – Spads on tour, so to speak. This is roughly in keeping with the indignities suffered by the advisers terrorised by Malcolm Tucker in The Thick of It – and after all, we know that Cummings is used to staying in an outhouse separate from the main property.
Retreat for an afternoon nap? If it’s none of the above, it’s possible that Johnson – or Carrie – used the tent as a daytime bolthole to escape the grousing of Dilyn (dog) or Wilfred (baby). A quiet place, perhaps, to read through the documents in his red boxes. At that distance from the house, he wouldn’t hear the wailing of his infant son, or indeed his education secretary, Gavin Williamson, whose difficulties this week would have kept anyone up at night. He may, on the other hand, hear the wailing of the quite angry farmer who turns out to own the land the tent was pitched on, and came forward on Friday to accuse Johnson of having a bonfire in his field as well as kipping in it. As Kenny Cameron told the Mail about his concerns, the prime minister’s security team arrived to dismantle the tent and clear away any rubbish.
Just how posh is the tent? Well, it’s not that posh, says Stephanie Keates, of Moray Bell Tent Hire (on the other side of Scotland, and no, she didn’t rent the prime minister his, sadly). “It’s a normal bell tent,” she observes. “We also do a star emperor” – which is massive – “or a luna bell”, which resembles a meringue. Keates hires hers out furnished for £110 a night (and is sold out for the summer, which success she partly attributes to holidaymakers like the prime minister seeking options closer to home). Still, even if it’s not top of the range, it’s large and spacious enough to contain a prime minister, a beanbag and a stack of BTec regrades to get on with. Was it suitable for the Scottish coast? Coastal gales, pouring rain and endless midges might make the less stoical among us long for the roaring fire inside – but Keates says bell tents are made of tough stuff. “They’re quite durable, they withstand the wind quite well, they’re well supported, with the guy ropes and everything,” she says. “We tested them out in the worst weather to make sure they’re up to it and we’ve never had a leak or problems in high winds.” Compare the tautly pristine ads online to the sagging reality as captured in the photo. His critics may see in this image the inevitable tint of a Brexit metaphor. Why does he always wear his hat like that? Nobody knows the answer to this."
2020-08-21T14:04:33Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer plays long game to label Boris Johnson as incompetent,"While the government was flailing over the exams fiasco last Sunday, a corner of leftwing Twitter was aflame with indignation at Labour’s role in the crisis – captured in the hashtag #starmerout. Instead of joining the students on the streets of Westminster shouting “fuck the algorithm”, the Labour leader had used an article in the Mail on Sunday to toughen up his insistence that children must return to school next month. The education chaos was perhaps the clearest example yet of how Starmer’s style of opposition differs from that of his predecessor. After he wrote that getting kids back to school was a “moral duty”, furious keyboard warriors attacked his cooperation with rightwing newspapers, asked why he hadn’t called for Gavin Williamson to resign, and dubbed him Captain Cardboard. This was against a backdrop of continued internecine tension, after Jeremy Corbyn himself joined a group claiming that party officials had sought to sabotage Labour’s chances in the general election of 2017 because they objected to his leadership. But Starmer’s allies are relaxed. “A thousand people on Twitter are just a thousand people on Twitter,” said one shadow cabinet member. “We know that from 2019.” Instead of placating Starmer’s leftwing detractors, Labour strategists believe the party’s best hope of unseating the Tories at the next general election lies in hammering home the gap between Boris Johnson’s promises and reality – and convincing the public that Starmer would do a better job.
They know from their frequent focus groups that many voters find Johnson likeable – so rather than attack him personally, they are keen to demonstrate that he is not up to the job of being prime minister. That approach was evident in the attack ads Labour launched at the height of the exams’ mess, juxtaposing black and white footage of Johnson promising the A-level results were “robust” and “dependable”, with a frazzled-looking Gavin Williamson announcing the U-turn. Almost every intervention Starmer and his senior colleagues makes includes the word “competence” as they try to chip away at the Tories’ reputation. “The Tories’ handling of these results sums up their handling of this pandemic: incompetent,” as he put it last week, after the discredited marking system was ditched. Starmer also frequently accuses Johnson of lacking “grip” – leaving it to his punchy deputy, Angela Rayner, to challenge the prime minister to “get off your backside”, as she did over the evictions ban. Rather than call for resignations – they have not demanded Williamson’s, even after the events of the past week – Starmer’s Labour favours calling for practical fixes. Recent polling suggests the public may be starting to share Labour’s analysis of the government’s performance. After a summer of bodges, late-night announcements and last-minute U-turns, a YouGov poll for the Times showed the Tories’ lead cut to just 2 percentage points, its lowest in more than a year. Starmer was also 4 points ahead of Johnson, by 35 to 31, on the question of who would make the best prime minister. It’s welcome information for team Starmer, after a separate ComRes poll for the same week saw Johnson leading with 43% to Starmer’s 30%. Frustrated Corbyn supporters feel Starmer’s approach lacks passion. The former party chair Ian Lavery says Labour needed to “get on the front foot”, both over the exams crisis and other issues. “We need to be challenging: we need to be the official opposition,” he said. One senior Corbyn ally complained of what they called a “lack of campaigning nous”, in Starmer’s operation. They argued that of the nine or 10 U-turns carried out by Johnson’s government, perhaps just one – the removal of the migrant visa surcharge – could be chalked up as a Labour victory. “Competence is all very well as a frame, and it seems to be working a bit: but at some point you’re going to need something deeper,” they said.
Starmer’s detractors complain that it was the footballer Marcus Rashford who was the face of the successful campaign to persuade the government to extend free school meals through the summer: though Labour’s plan to call a vote on the issue, forcing Tory MPs to take sides, may have helped focus minds in Downing Street. Corbyn set his attacks on the Tories in a narrative about the “rigged” system, disadvantaging working people – the opposite of his “for the many” slogan of 2017. But Labour strategists say before building an ideological story, let alone a manifesto, their first task is to get the party a hearing among groups of voters who rejected it last year, and have been drifting away for more than a decade. “You can set out a different ideological view once you’ve established competence – that comes first,” said one."
2020-08-21T12:23:42Z,politics,Politics,MPs pushing for Russian interference inquiry threaten to sue Boris Johnson,"A cross-party group of MPs is threatening to sue Boris Johnson unless he orders an independent investigation into Russian interference in recent UK elections and the 2016 Brexit vote. The MPs say the government’s refusal to investigate Kremlin meddling is a breach of the European convention on human rights, which enshrines the right to free elections in protocol 1. The group says it will take the prime minister to court if he fails to implement what it describes as essential steps to protect future elections. It has sent him a pre-action letter, to which Downing Street has two weeks to respond. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton, said: “Democratic processes are clearly at risk. It seems that the integrity of our elections is being deliberately undermined. Nothing could be more serious for our democracy. “Ministers’ behaviour to date has been shockingly complacent and negligent. The government cannot be allowed to shirk this because Tory party coffers are topped up with Russian money.” The MPs call on the government to implement the recommendations of parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC). Its long-awaited Russia report, which Johnson suppressed, before the last general election, was finally published last month. The government says it has seen no evidence of “successful” Moscow interference. The ISC, however, said Johnson and his predecessor Theresa May made no effort to look for it, and nor did Britain’s security agencies, with MI5 providing the committee with just five lines of text.
The ISC described the UK as a clear target for Russian disinformation and money laundering, and called on Johnson to launch a full inquiry. He dismissed the request last month. The group of MPs has called for a series of legislative reforms. It wants a single body to be legally responsible for combating foreign influence and a ban on donations from abroad. It says online political adverts should make the source of funding clear, and that agents who work for foreign states should be forced to register, as in the US. All the Citizens, a new non-profit group, is a co-claimant in the legal action, which is being brought by the law firm Leigh Day. All the Citizens has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money to cover legal costs and has released a video. Other claimants include the Labour MPs Chris Bryant and Ben Bradshaw, the non-affiliated peer Patience Wheatcroft, the Lib Dem peer Paul Strasburger and the SNP MP Alyn Smith. Bradshaw said voters deserved to know the extent of Russian interference in British politics and accused the government of looking the other way. Strasburger said: ‘The prime minister’s refusal to even ask our intelligence services what the Russians did to influence the referendum is a total dereliction of his duty to protect us.” Downing Street has been approached for comment."
2020-08-21T10:46:10Z,politics,Politics,"Time-wasting UK makes post-Brexit deal unlikely, says Barnier","Michel Barnier has accused the British government of “wasting valuable time” and warned that a post-Brexit deal between the EU and the UK looks “unlikely”. With two months to go until the EU-imposed deadline of October, the EU’s chief negotiator said: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.” Barnier said he was “a little surprised” because Boris Johnson had told EU leaders earlier this summer he wanted an outline deal by July. After two days of talks with the British, Barnier said: “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards.” At this stage an agreement seemed “unlikely”, he said. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” His opposite number, David Frost, struck a more hopeful note, while acknowledging there had been little progress.
The UK’s chief negotiator said: “Agreement is still possible, and it is still our goal, but it is clear that it will not be easy to achieve … We have had useful discussions this week but there has been little progress.” Privately the UK rebuffed Barnier’s accusation of time wasting and blamed the EU for slowing down talks. “The process block now is the EU’s insistence that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else,” said a senior UK negotiating official. “I mean obviously we’re not going to do that. So it’s frozen.” The downbeat assessments came after two days of talks in Brussels and a private dinner between Barnier and Frost. On Thursday, Frost gave Barnier a fresh draft free-trade agreement in an attempt to break the deadlock. Known as a “consolidated legal text” the document merges existing EU and UK draft texts, in an attempt to speed up an autumn agreement. The British official said they had not expected the text to be discussed this week, but hoped “to inject a spark” in the process. “Really, it’s to make the point that we have been saying that it’s time to move to text-based discussions,” they added. Barnier said the document had been “useful” to understand the UK position, but added that it failed to understand the EU’s red lines on the “level-playing field”, common standards on environment, workers’ rights and state aid to give Britain tariff-free access to the EU single market. Sticking to the EU’s well-established position, Barnier rejected any attempt to fast-forward trade negotiations, ahead of other parts of the talks, such as fishing rights and British hauliers’ rights to deliver goods in the EU. Barnier’s insistence on “parallelism” has long frustrated the British. The EU’s approach “makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress”, said Frost. Frost, who said last week a deal could be reached in September, added there were “significant areas” to resolve. “Even where there is a broad understanding between negotiators, there is a lot of detail to work through. Time is short for both sides.” The EU has said there will be no trade deal without an agreement on fishing, as it insists European boats maintain access to British waters. On the subject, Barnier said: “We have made no progress whatsoever on the issues that matter.” British negotiators share this view, but accuse the EU of failing to understand that the government wants a major change from the status quo. EU member states, which claim centuries-old fishing rights in British waters, want to maintain current access, although Barnier has hinted he is open to compromise. Similarly, the UK negotiators are frustrated by the EU’s wish to bind Britain tightly to European rules on state aid in exchange for a free-trade deal. The EU fears generous subsidies to UK companies could tilt the playing field against EU firms. “Things are focussing down, not necessarily helpfully, on the issues of state aid, subsidy policy and fisheries policy,” said the UK official. “What’s frustrating here is that Michel Barnier said in his press conference just now, ‘Brexit means Brexit’, which is of course correct. They don’t apply that in this area where they want to see us continuing arrangements that are very like those that we’re bound by as members of the EU,” they added. “When the EU realise that that needs to change it will be much easier to make progress.” The two sides also failed to make progress this week on long-standing disagreement over lorry drivers’ rights after Brexit. Barnier expressed surprise about the UK debate about the loss of haulage rights after Brexit, while stressing that any future access would depend on accepting EU standards on hauliers’ working time and other regulations. Citing recent press reports, he said: “We have seen an emotion that surprised me four years after the Brexit vote … the UK has decided itself to lose the benefits of the single market. It was their choice. It was not our choice.” The talks are scheduled to resume on 7 September in London."
2020-08-20T14:15:35Z,politics,Politics,Scottish Tory leader refuses to back Gavin Williamson over exams chaos,"The new Tory leader in Scotland, Douglas Ross, has increased the pressure on Gavin Williamson to resign over the A-levels fiasco. He said the education secretary should reflect on what had happened to pupils in England, considering the fact Scotland had been faced with a similar grades fiasco earlier in the month. Ross is the most high-profile Tory to speak out publicly on Williamson’s future since the grades debacle erupted. Asked whether he supported Williamson staying on in his job, Ross told BBC Radio Scotland: “That is a decision for Gavin Williamson. It’s a decision for the prime minister, if he continues to have the trust of the prime minister.
“I’m not here to say in your report that I think Gavin Williamson has done a great job and he should continue. I think he has to reflect on what happened to so many pupils in England, students who were concerned for four days, because we had the exact same up here in Scotland for a week.” While there have been strong briefings against Williamson behind the scenes from senior Tories, and he is now expected to be reshuffled away from the education brief this autumn, Ross is the first to refuse to publicly back him. On Thursday, pupils in England received GCSE results based on teacher assessments instead of grades moderated by an algorithm developed by Ofqual. On Monday, the government announced a U-turn on how A-level results would be awarded after thousands of pupils in England were downgraded and some missed out on university places.
Ross, who was elected as the MP for Moray in 2017, quit as a Scotland minister earlier this year over the Dominic Cummings controversy. He was the only minister to do so. He said at the time that Cummings’ interpretation of the government’s lockdown advice was not shared by the vast majority of people. Meanwhile MPs are calling on Williamson to urgently respond to two petitions that have been signed by more than 170,000 people about the A-level grades fiasco. Catherine McKinnell, the chair of the Commons petitions committee, has written to the minister asking for him to reply to an e-petition signed by 144,000 people urging the government to review the decision to use previous data to calculate exam grades. More than 30,000 people also signed a petition that called for students to be given the grades predicted by their teachers. McKinnell said: “It is vital that the government expedites its responses to these petitions. We as MPs are hearing directly from affected students and parents in our constituencies and they deserve clarity on the government’s position and its plans to ensure that students are not unfairly disadvantaged at such a crucial stage in their lives.”"
2020-08-20T11:33:07Z,politics,Politics,EU rejects British plan for post-Brexit return of asylum seekers,"EU negotiators have rejected a British request for a migration pact that would allow the government to return asylum seekers to other European countries. When the Brexit transition period expires on 31 December, the government will lose the right to transfer refugees and migrants to the EU country in which they arrived, a cornerstone of the European asylum system known as the Dublin regulation. The government is seeking to replicate the European system outside the bloc, although the Home Office has complained that the EU rules are “rigid, inflexible and abused by migrants and activist lawyers”. The Guardian has learned that EU member states have ruled out a British plan to recreate the Dublin system outside the EU. Talks on a post-Brexit deal continue this week amid rising tensions between the UK and France following the death of a Sudanese teenager while attempting to cross the Channel in an inflatable dinghy. A British plan presented to Brussels would allow the UK to return “all third-country nationals and stateless persons” who enter its territory without the right paperwork to the EU country they had travelled through to reach British shores. The British government would have a reciprocal obligation to take in undocumented migrants arriving in the EU via the UK, excluding airport arrivals. At a time when southern Europe has nearly 10 times more refugees and migrants arriving by sea, the UK plan has been described in Brussels as “very unbalanced” and “not good enough”. More than 4,100 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year, compared with 39,283 who traversed the Mediterranean to Italy, Greece, Spain, Cyprus and Malta. At the height of the migration crisis in 2015, more than a million people arrived on the continent’s southern shores. “The assessment is that this is very much picking and choosing aspects of the current EU system,” a European diplomat said. An EU official said: “The proposal, from the EU perspective, isn’t very operational and doesn’t bring a lot of added value.” European diplomats stress that the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has no power to negotiate a readmission agreement on migrants with the UK. The Frenchman’s negotiating mandate, laid down by 27 governments, makes vague proposals for cooperation and “regular dialogues” on managing the thousands of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. While the UK could strike a new bilateral agreement with France, one former EU lawmaker was sceptical about mini-deals with other EU countries. “It’s a non-runner,” said Claude Moraes, a British former MEP who has co-drafted EU asylum law and chaired the parliament’s justice and home affairs committee. “They [the EU] are very sensitive to the UK cherry-picking justice and home affairs policy.” The Labour politician accused Boris Johnson of making political statements that did not match the reality of what the government is trying to negotiate. “Politically [the prime minister] is saying we are going to have UK legislation to take back control, but privately what they are going to have to do is replicate Dublin or have some sort of agreement with the EU.” The UK immigration minister, Chris Philp, said after talks with French officials this month that Britain and France were working “at pace” on a new plan to deter people from crossing the Channel in small boats, but he provided few details. The French interior ministry did not respond to questions on French objectives for any bilateral plans with the UK, or EU-wide policy. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Dublin III regulation is inflexible, rigid and is abused by both migrants and activist lawyers to frustrate the returns of those who have no right to be here. Whilst we are bound by Dublin for the duration of the transition period, the UK will be able to negotiate its own bilateral returns arrangements from the end of this year.” Home Office figures show the UK returns few asylum seekers to other EU countries. In 2018 it transferred 209 people under the Dublin regulation, while accepting 1,215 migrants from the rest of Europe. While Johnson has complained about the difficulty of returning asylum seekers to the EU, European nations are unsympathetic to a country on the north-western fringes that receives relatively few asylum applications. In 2019, Germany registered 142,450 applications for asylum, France 119,915 and Greece 74,905, according to the European Asylum Support Office. The UK recorded 44,250 asylum requests."
2020-08-19T19:18:15Z,politics,Politics,Ofqual ignored exams warning a month ago amid ministers' pressure,"Ofqual was warned at least a month ago of flaws in the exams algorithm that left thousands of students devastated, but the regulator pressed ahead amid longstanding ministerial pressure to prevent grade inflation, the Guardian understands. External advisers told the regulator that its formula for deciding England’s pupils’ A-level and GCSE results after the cancellation of exams was “volatile” and risked producing erratic outcomes, sources said. Despite the warnings, that formula was kept in place, leading to a fiasco that saw disadvantaged students worst hit by downgrades, until the government was forced into a U-turn on Monday.
The disclosure raises questions about the extent of ministers’ knowledge of the concerns. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has claimed he only became aware of the scale of the unfairness of the algorithm “over the weekend” when the full detail was published, though a government source said he had raised earlier concerns about the model and sought reassurances from Ofqual. Universities have warned of mounting chaos as students scramble for places armed with new teacher-assessed grades. Ucas revealed on Wednesday that 15,000 pupils originally rejected by their first-choice university now have the grades to meet their offer, with 90% of them aiming to study at top-tier universities. With at least one over-subscribed university resorting to the offer of financial sweeteners to persuade students to defer until 2021, the National Union of Students (NUS) organised protests in six cities over ongoing inequalities in the fallout of the crisis and concerns that disadvantaged students will be forced to take gap years. In late March, with schools closed and the pandemic gathering pace, Williamson publicly warned Ofqual it “should ensure, as far as is possible, that qualification standards are maintained and the distribution of grades follows a similar profile to that in previous years”. The demand was made in a letter to the head of Ofqual, Sally Collier, on 31 March, issued as a ministerial direction under the Children and Learning Act of 2009.
The diktat from Williamson is understood to have been the overriding concern that led Ofqual to reject warnings from its external advisers before the algorithm was finalised in July. The schools minister, Nick Gibb, was also identified by one senior Conservative source as having piled on pressure to keep grade inflation down. “Nick must take some of the blame. He has a tin ear, and he’s obsessed with avoiding grade inflation,” the source said. The Times also reported that Jon Coles, chief executive of the United Learning schools trust, warned Williamson last month that Ofqual’s system would unfairly grade pupils, in a letter and a subsequent call. But Williamson declined to act after receiving “reassurances” from Ofqual, according to a source quoted by the paper. Williamson finally admitted on Wednesday that Ofqual was responsible for the climbdown – for which he originally took credit – and insisted the regulator had his “full confidence”. He had previously refused to back Collier. “The decision they [Ofqual] took to move from moderated grades to centre-assessed grades was one that we agreed with,” the Department for Education (DfE) said. That statement appeared to contradict an assertion from Williamson in interviews on Tuesday, where he originally said there were “large numbers of youngsters … [who] wanted to see action taken, that’s what I’ve done”. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, welcomed Williamson’s change of tone in respect of Ofqual. “Throwing the very people you need to fix the issue under the nearest bus, simply to affect the next morning’s headline, is no way to run any organisation successfully,” Penman said. “This government already has an instinct to brief and undermine the very public servants who are delivering public services in the most extraordinary of circumstances. Watching ministers scapegoat them live on the news channels will only have further undermined the trust that is so vital between ministers and civil servants.” A Whitehall source said there had been agreement across government – and cross-party – about the need for moderation of exam results, rather than pressure coming solely from ministers. “There was agreement from the sector, from teaching unions, from the SNP, from Labour in Wales, and there was a full consultation, everyone was aligned on the need to protect the integrity of grades,” the source said. “There were challenges made to Ofqual and assurances were received but ultimately everyone was working together to try and get a fair system and try and avoid grade inflation. And now it is down to a choice between inflation and equality – but we are in a pandemic and [pandemics] cause havoc.” In another potential headache for the department, Labour’s Charlie Falconer, the shadow attorney general, said the algorithms formula was unlawful, and ministers should have been aware under the 2009 act which set out Ofqual’s obligations and under anti-discrimination legislation. Lord Falconer said Williamson’s claim to have only become aware of the issues around the algorithm at the weekend was concerning, citing an education select committee report in July that had raised concerns over pupils from “well-heeled and sharp-elbowed” families benefiting. He said Williamson must now confirm when exactly the DfE was made aware of concerns about the algorithm and publish any legal advice it had received about the formula. The NUS has organised protests for 1pm on Thursday outside DfE buildings in London, Bristol, Coventry, Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester. The deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, said students should remember the anger they felt when they got their results and use it to mobilise politically. On a Zoom call hosted by Young Labour with more than 100 young people, she said: “Remember and keep hold of that anger, that upset, about the injustice this government tried to get away with. Ruining the dreams of thousands. “Remember how you felt when the government made it clear they didn’t care about our young people. Take that and don’t forget about it.” Ofqual was approached for comment."
2020-08-19T18:18:10Z,politics,Politics,UK could drop Croatia from travel corridor amid rise in Covid cases,"Croatia faces being removed from the UK’s travel corridor list, with imported Covid-19 infections from the country having been identified, the Guardian understands. Ministers are likely to remove the country from the list after logging a recent surge in coronavirus cases. If the measures are formally signed off, it would mean people arriving from Croatia will have to quarantine for 14 days in Britain. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, met ministers on Wednesday afternoon to discuss plans. An announcement could come as early as Thursday. If Croatia is removed the change could affect thousands of British holidaymakers in the country at the moment. The Guardian has been told that officials at the government’s Joint Biosecurity Centre have flagged specific coronavirus cases imported to the UK from Croatia. It is not known how many cases have been identified or where in the country, but it is understood that the number of imported cases is at a similar level to that shown by Spain when it was removed from the travel corridor last month with just a few hours’ notice, prompting chaos for holidaymakers. However, when France and five other locations were removed from the travel corridor list last week ministers allowed 30 hours’ notice before the measures were imposed on arrivals to the UK, from Saturday at 4am. It is likely that any move to remove Croatia could come with a similar notice period. On Tuesday, Croatia reported 199 new Covid cases. As of Wednesday, according to the European Centre for Disease Control, the 14-day cumulative number of Covid-19 cases in Croatia was 37.7 per 100,000 people, compared to the UK’s 21. According to the aviation data analysts Cirium, from Wednesday until the end of September there are 767 flights run by large airlines scheduled to fly from the UK to Croatia, with a total seat capacity of nearly 130,000. Paul Charles, the CEO of the travel consultancy PC Agency, which has been monitoring travel corridor developments and estimates there are 20,000 British holidaymakers in Croatia at the moment, said he believed Croatia would be removed “based on the government’s own criteria”. But he said he thought Croatia would be the only country affected by such changes this week. Portugal, which ministers last week agreed to monitor after infection rates improved there, is under consideration to be added to the quarantine exemption list. Locations understood to be under close watch amid rising infections are Greece, Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Austria, Switzerland and Gibraltar. Individual decisions on whether or not to remove destinations from the travel corridor are taken by devolved administrations, but last week’s removal of France from the list was taken in unison by the four UK nations. The Department for Transport has been approached for comment. The aviation industry has been lobbying for the UK government to agree to use airport testing to reduce the 14-day quarantine period. Under the proposals passengers would take a test on arrival at airports, then a second test several days later with a view to being allowed to break their quarantine early if each test returned negative results. Heathrow unveiled a multi-million pound testing facility this week which awaits the go-ahead from ministers. The government has resisted use of the facility to date. Asked on Wednesday whether the government would bring in airport testing to reduce quarantine times, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “We’re working on that.” This article was amended on 20 August 2020. The original incorrectly spelled the aviation data analysts Cirium, as Cirum. This has been corrected."
2020-08-19T14:16:51Z,politics,Politics,Jeremy Corbyn: government lectured me about herd immunity,"Jeremy Corbyn has said the government “lectured” him about herd immunity during cross-party coronavirus talks, a policy he described as “eugenic”. The former Labour leader said he was invited to a meeting with Cabinet Office officials in the spring with the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, where a talk was held on the topic. The government has repeatedly denied that pursuing herd immunity in tackling coronavirus was ever its aim and it was not immediately clear from Corbyn’s comments if that is what he was accusing it of. Controversy around the issue erupted when the government’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said in March that it was necessary to broaden the peak of the illness but not suppress it completely, and to achieve herd immunity about 60% of the population would need to get the illness. In an interview with the podcast A World to Win, Corbyn said: “We were involved in meetings with the government throughout the spring of this year and Jon Ashworth and I remember distinctly going to a meeting at the Cabinet Office, where we got a lecture about herd immunity. “The last time I discussed herd immunity was when I worked on a pig farm 40 years ago. It was absurd that actually [you] would build up herd immunity by allowing people to die. “And so, while the government was going into eugenic formulas and discussing all this stuff, they were not making adequate preparations.” On 15 March the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said herd immunity was not the government’s goal. He said at the time: “Our goal is to protect life. I want to be absolutely crystal clear that we will do what is necessary to protect life.” A government spokesperson said on Wednesday: “It is categorically wrong to suggest herd immunity was the government’s aim.” Corbyn said Britain’s response had been poorer than countries such as South Korea, and money wasted on the emergency Nightingale hospitals programme that he claimed had “largely gone into the private sector”. He said: “The idea that an epidemic or pandemic could cause a real problem in Britain was actually mooted in 2008 and even then they identified Britain’s lack of preparedness for dealing with it. “We get to this year, lack of PPE, 94% bed occupancy in hospitals, insufficiency of space in care homes, and the whole thing got worse and worse and eventually the government got around to saying there would have to be restrictions on movements. “Compare that with the response with South Korea and New Zealand …” He said the Nightingale hospitals had hardly been used, and questioned their financing. He claimed they “cost a great deal of money, much of it into the private sector. What has been going on? Except an exposure of a lack of preparedness for the NHS.” A government spokesperson said: “Our goal is to reduce the impact of coronavirus – protecting the most vulnerable and ensuring our NHS and social care system has capacity to cope while leading the world on scientific research into therapeutics and a vaccine. “This is an unprecedented global pandemic – our strategy was clearly set out and guided at every stage by the advice of scientific experts. “Our response ensured the NHS was not overwhelmed even at the virus’s peak, so that everyone was always able to get the best possible care.”"
2020-08-19T12:37:32Z,politics,Politics,Met closes inquiry into Alex Salmond with no further action,"The Metropolitan police has closed its investigation into historical allegations against Alex Salmond after its review this year. The force said it first opened an investigation into alleged misconduct by the former first minister of Scotland in January 2019 and had pursued one case after reassessing the allegations in March this year. Salmond, former Scottish National party MP, has repeatedly denied committing any offences. He was acquitted, by majority verdicts, of 14 sexual offence charges, including one of attempted rape, in March 2020 after a two-week trial at the high court in Edinburgh. He had been first charged with alleged sexual and criminal offences in January 2019, two weeks after he won a legal action against the Scottish government over its mishandling of an internal investigation into sexual misconduct complaints from two civil servants. The court of session, Scotland’s civil court, quashed the findings of that internal review, but Police Scotland had already launched its investigation into Salmond when the Scottish government inquiry originally upheld the complaints, in August 2018. Leslie Evans, the government’s permanent secretary, told a Scottish parliament committee on Tuesday that three complaints were passed to the police. It is believed Police Scotland received reports of alleged historic incidents in London, where Salmond had lived as an MP from the late 1980s onwards, and passed those on to New Scotland Yard. The Met said: “In January 2019 the Metropolitan police service (MPS) was passed information linked to an ongoing investigation in Scotland. “Specialist officers launched a review of the information to ascertain if any criminal offences had been committed within the Metropolitan police district. In consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service no further action was taken in relation to the information provided. “In March 2020, MPS carried out a further review of the information and one allegation of crime was recorded. The complainant was contacted by officers. Following this contact, the investigation was not proceeded with and no further action was taken.” The Times reported on Wednesday that the complainant had asked for no further action to be taken because she feared the consequences; complainers in Salmond’s trial had been subjected to attacks and threats on social media. She was quoted saying: “Following careful and difficult deliberation, and after having sought advice from experts, I wrote to the police to say I did not feel safe to proceed with a possible trial at that time. “The scale of the backlash, intimidation, misinformation and threats that followed the trial in Scotland was highly distressing, and created an environment where I did not feel safe to seek a trial.” Salmond declined to comment."
2020-08-18T19:37:16Z,politics,Politics,"Parents and teachers have lost faith in Gavin Williamson, government told","Parents and teachers have lost faith in Gavin Williamson’s competence to lead a safe return of pupils to England’s schools within two weeks, trade unions and senior MPs from across the divide have warned. Following the education secretary’s role in the exam results fiasco, Robert Halfon, the Conservative chair of the education select committee, said the prime minister must personally lead the back-to-school campaign in order to ensure confidence. Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said parents and teachers needed to see improved plans if parents were to feel safe about 9.5 million children going back to school. On Monday the government announced it would reinstate teachers’ recommended grades for A-level and GCSE pupils after an algorithm downgraded up to 2.3m marks and left disadvantaged students worst hit. Two days earlier Williamson had promised “no U-turn”. In a series of halting interviews on Tuesday he appeared to concede he had not been fully apprised of issues with the standardisation algorithm until after A-level results were published on Thursday.
Bousted said: “I don’t like to kick someone when they’re down, but Gavin Williamson does not have the confidence of parents or the profession, and that’s the truth. Everybody wants schools to reopen. Children and young people have been out of education over five months. Is he a competent pair of hands that parents are going to put their trust in? I think that’s unlikely. Would you?” The government launched its “back to school safely” drive over the weekend. Halfon said the best way to regain confidence was for parents to see ministers had a firm grip on English schools reopening to all children in September for the first time since they were closed amid the Covid pandemic in March. “We have to reassure parents to get our kids back into school. The PM should lead this. The best way of restoring confidence in the country is if we deliver now on that promise to get our children learning again,” he said. “We must have a proper campaign – as good as stay home, save lives, protect the NHS – to make sure parents feel safe and confident sending their children back to school.” Some Tory MPs suggested Williamson was being lined up as the fall guy for any mishandling of the schools reopening programme. “He will be used as a human shield and will be the face of it. Lots of Tory MPs feel he can’t go on much longer but as a matter of pragmatic politics he will be kept on for GCSEs and school openings then most people think that will be the end,” one senior Tory said. “There’s no expectation he would be able to stay on for another exam cycle.” Labour and the Lib Dems said Williamson should not front any campaign designed to restore parents’ confidence. Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, said: “The incompetence and chaos surrounding exam results will leave parents, school leaders and teachers with little or no confidence in this government’s ability to protect the interests of children across the country. The delays, incompetence, and chaos of exam results cannot be repeated in our schools.” Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, said Williamson should resign: “If the government are serious about getting children back to school next month, there needs to be an education secretary in place who people can trust.” A No 10 source said Johnson – who is holidaying in Scotland – would take the reins alongside Williamson as the government geared up for schools returning. “There is barely an issue he has been more personally associated with,” the source said, adding that the PM had “full confidence” in Williamson. A taskforce of university chiefs met the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, on Tuesday to discuss the implications of the U-turn on the sector amid a scramble for places. One vice-chancellor said there were no answers to questions about extra support and only “platitudes”. The government was pressed for more teaching grants to expand student numbers on high-cost courses, such as medicine. The taskforce will meet daily for the rest of the month. Donelan said after the meeting: “We are supporting universities, including by announcing our intention to remove temporary student number controls and working with them to help them prioritise students and uphold their first choice either this coming year, or as a last resort the following year.” Another vice-chancellor said: “I would be happy to see Gavin Williamson resign. He’s fucking useless.” Another said: “This is the worst debacle I’ve ever seen in higher education. There seems to be a blame game going on – the responsibility lies squarely with the minister.” Most agitated Tory MPs have been partially pacified by Monday’s government climbdown but several told of chaos on internal WhatsApp groups over the course of the weekend. The schools minister, Nick Gibb, usually well-liked, has also been the target of some colleagues’ ire. “Nick Gibb is obsessed with grade inflation, he would have thought this system would lead to dumbing down and so you have to wonder – were the right questions asked of Ofqual by Gibb?” one MP said. “There are so many villains in this piece, Williamson, Gibb, the civil servants, the permanent secretary, Ofqual … it’s like a Ben-Hur movie.” Tobias Ellwood, a former minister who is chair of the defence select committee, said: “Moving forwards in the long term, ultimately we need to see the cabinet as a whole occupied by people who have the talent and drive to lead their departments and freedom to express their views privately.” Another senior Tory MP said Williamson should have seen the problem coming and the fiasco was a wider sign of a cabinet devoid of experience and clout. “This really worries [the party]. There are already rumblings on our WhatsApp groups. Letters of confidence won’t go in but there will be lots of concern about decisions and the way government works. Boris will be hurt by this.” The exams regulator Ofqual, responsible for the design of the algorithm, is also in the crosshairs. Halfon said ministers should have “proper control and accountability” over qualifications, rather than an independent body. “It is worth considering abolishing Ofqual in its current form and bringing it back within the Department for Education (DfE). It is not fit for purpose,” he said. “All the minutes and internal documents between Ofqual and the DfE now need to be published to find out what’s gone on, how much this has cost the taxpayer and what questions were asked by the department and what actions were taken by Ofqual to ensure a level playing field for all students. “Why was the appeals system not set up properly with a much wider base for appeal from the beginning, as recommended by the education select committee? Why wasn’t this all decided in advance?” Williamson refused to back the head of Ofqual, Sally Collier, on Tuesday, saying only that Collier – who has not spoken publicly since students’ results were published last Thursday – had worked hard. The Office for Statistics Regulation announced a formal review of Ofqual’s statistical model after a complaint by the Royal Statistical Society that it ignored offers of help. • This article was amended on 19 August 2020.

2020-08-18T18:38:19Z,politics,Politics,'Shifting deckchairs' and scrapping PHE all part of Covid-19 blame game,"“There is nothing in this proposal that would enable him in my mind to do anything that he can’t already do with his existing powers.” That was Andrew Lansley, the last health secretary to push through a controversial shake-up of public health in 2012, on his successor Matt Hancock’s justification for abolishing Public Health England. He is not the only one questioning the logic, purpose, timing and potential effects of PHE being merged – via a reorganisation in the midst of the coronavirus crisis – into the new National Institute for Health Protection alongside NHS test and trace and the joint biosecurity centre. It is unusual for a government initiative on health to attract such a wide range of scepticism and criticism, from ex-Conservative MPs, senior doctors, scientists, public health experts and thinktank bosses. But what the NHS Confederation dubbed an exercise in “shifting deckchairs” yielded that consensus of concern. Dr Sarah Wollaston, until December the Tory chair of the Commons health select committee, said that “seeking to scapegoat them [PHE] is extraordinary after cutting public health funding and excluding local directors of public health from decision-making on Covid.” The move seems rushed, poorly timed and potentially part of an emerging Covid-19 blame game. It is easy to see why some critics see the shake-up as both the government’s revenge on PHE for all the negative publicity early on in the pandemic around the inability to test more than 2,000 swab samples a day and the abandonment of contact tracing on 12 March, and as a pre-emptive strike on the agency’s reputation ahead of a public inquiry even Boris Johnson agrees is coming. The former was a consequence of PHE’s limited laboratory capacity, as both England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the government minister James Brokenshire have acknowledged, while it was ministers, not PHE, who ordered contact tracing to stop.
As Lansley added on LBC radio: “Some of the blame has been placed upon PHE in circumstances where the decisions concerned were the decisions of government.” Hancock’s move raises many questions. The new body will, like PHE, be an executive agency of his own Department of Health and Social Care. So why not just give PHE clearer orders instead of scrapping it, given all the time and loss of focus involved? And, to quote the Nuffield Trust chief executive, Nigel Edwards: “If PHE’s disease control arm has struggled at times, why should merging it with [the] equally struggling test-and-trace programme lead to an improvement for either one?” The government has twisted itself into ever more illogical knots over public health since 2010. It wanted “big food” to help tackle obesity – but let an industry whose profits depend on fat, sugar and salt decide how much of those their products should contain. Ministers have regularly stressed the importance of preventing illness and helping people lead healthier lives in order to help the NHS but then cut both PHE’s budget and the public health grant to local councils. Now it is axing a body with a good reputation internationally that Hancock in his speech on Tuesday lauded as “brilliant” for its role in combatting the coronavirus, and replacing it with an untried hybrid new set-up that carries obvious risks."
2020-08-18T18:07:59Z,politics,Politics,"Sturgeon told of Salmond allegations earlier than thought, inquiry told","Nicola Sturgeon was warned about allegations of misconduct against Alex Salmond in November 2017, five months earlier than previously thought, Scotland’s chief civil servant has said. Leslie Evans, permanent secretary to the Scottish government, told a parliamentary inquiry she warned the first minister that Salmond had been calling civil servants in connection with a Sky News investigation into an alleged 2007 incident at Edinburgh airport. Questioned under oath, Evans told the inquiry “a whole range of people” inside the Scottish government had been raising concerns about alleged sexual misconduct involving ministers and former ministers. She said they began surfacing in early November 2017 at the height of the #MeToo movement and the crisis about alleged harassment at Westminster and the Scottish parliament, and soon after John Swinney, the deputy first minister, announced a new zero-tolerance approach to sexual misconduct. The inquiry is investigating the Scottish government’s handling of a botched internal inquiry that upheld two complaints of alleged misconduct against Salmond in August 2018, and when Sturgeon knew about those allegations against her former mentor. Salmond sued the government over its handling of the allegations in August 2018 after its conclusions were leaked to the media, and won. In January 2019 the government admitted in court that the inquiry was unlawful and had the “appearance of bias” because the official in charge had discussed their cases with two of the complainants before they made formal complaints. It later paid Salmond £512,000 to cover his legal expenses. Salmond has repeatedly denied any criminal misconduct, and in March this year was cleared of 14 charges of sexual misconduct, including one of attempted rape. Salmond was not prosecuted over the alleged incident at Edinburgh airport in 2007, which he also denied.
He accuses former allies in the Scottish National party and Scottish government of conspiring against him, and is due to give evidence to the parliamentary inquiry this autumn. Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament in late 2018 she first learned Salmond was being investigated when he told her during a meeting at her home in April 2018. The government confirmed earlier this month that she actually met one of Salmond’s closest former aides, Geoff Aberdein, in connection with the case in her ministerial office on 29 March 2018. Questioned on Tuesday about the events of late 2017, when the new anti-harassment policy was being drafted, Evans said two people had told her staff were being contacted by Salmond, who had quit as first minister in November 2014. Those officials were “a bit bewildered and unhappy about it”, she told the committee. She told Alex Cole-Hamilton, a Liberal Democrat MSP, that she had raised the issue with Sturgeon. “I said I was concerned, I was concerned mostly because the staff were anxious about it; I was also concerned that it could become a story,” Evans said. “I didn’t know and I was concerned that we would be ready in whatever form that story might blow because the media was very volatile at that point in reporting on everything.” Asked by Cole-Hamilton whether the new sexual harassment policy was “targeted [and] designed to get Alex Salmond”, she vehemently denied that was the case. “No. Absolutely not,” she said. Evans was then asked by Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, when she was made aware “of the likelihood of concerns or complaints made against the former first minister”. Evans replied: “I was first aware of the issue being raised through a different route, which was Mr Salmond getting in touch with our staff about Edinburgh airport. After that I was made aware of a range of people – I didn’t know who – who were raising concerns.” Evans also revealed the Scottish government had passed on three complaints of alleged misconduct to the police when its internal inquiry ended in August 2018. Until now it was thought only two cases were passed on to detectives; the Scottish government said later two of the complaints related to one member of staff. Evans also confirmed that one of the complainants had been shown the draft sexual harassment code before it became policy, and before she had made an official complaint. Evans said this was normal practice, saying civil servants wanted people to share their “lived experience” and “relevant experience” when policies were being written."
2020-08-18T17:37:06Z,politics,Politics,Health chiefs attack 'risky and unjust' decision to scrap PHE,"The abolition of Public Health England is hugely risky and will distract staff who are working hard to stop a second wave of Covid-19, major health bodies have warned ministers. The government’s decision to axe PHE and replace it with a new National Institute for Health Protection prompted widespread criticism and claims that it was simply “shifting deckchairs”. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is scrapping the agency after weeks of speculation that ministers, including Boris Johnson, were unhappy with its performance over the testing of coronavirus swab samples and tracing of people suspected of being infected, especially early in the pandemic. However, doctors and hospital bosses have leapt to PHE’s defence and branded the move unfair, unjustified, and part of a government effort to distract from its own failings over Covid-19. “Public Health England appears to have been found guilty without a trial,” said Richard Murray, the chief executive of the King’s Fund, the influential health thinktank. “Undoubtedly there are questions to be answered about England’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis, but the middle of a pandemic is not the time to dismantle England’s public health agency.”
The shake-up is being pushed through even though the government admits it does not know who will take forward PHE’s work in tackling obesity, reducing smoking and tackling health inequalities, as the new institute will not be responsible for them under the current plans. It will be formed from a merger of PHE, NHS Test and Trace and the Joint Biosecurity Centre, the last two of which were only set up in recent months as part of the response to the pandemic. The failure to spell out who will drive forward the prime minister’s new anti-obesity strategy just two weeks after its launch drew a warning that without a government agency taking responsibility, the country’s battle to lose weight could be lost. Christina Marriott, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said: “Covid-19 makes it vitally important that prevention is not sidelined – but so does every year when 40% of avoidable deaths are as a result of tobacco, obesity, inactivity and alcohol harm. Clear national leadership on this is critical for the public’s health. The uncertainty created by today’s announcement is not acceptable.” “The reorganisation will be a distraction at the worst possible time,” said Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation. “Setting up and abolishing or merging national agencies like PHE is all too common and frequently demoralising, wasteful and lacking justification.” Ministers cut PHE’s budget from £397.9m in 2015 to just under £300m this year and cut the public health grant that local councils in England receive by 22% over the same period. They must look at their own record on those decisions when apportioning blame for public health failures, Dixon added. Outgoing PHE chief executive Dun Selbie is becoming a senior adviser to the Department of Health and Social Care. Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust thinktank, said: “There is no clear argument as to why this rebranding and reshuffling will solve some of the problems highlighted [by Hancock]. “The government risks making a major misstep by dismantling its own public health agency at such a crucial time, creating a huge distraction for staff, who should be dedicating themselves to the next stage of the pandemic,” added Edwards, who labelled PHE’s abolition “disproportionate”. In a speech on Tuesday at the Policy Exchange thinktank, Hancock insisted that the creation of the institute would “put us in the best possible position for the next stage of the fight against Covid-19 and for the long-term”. It will focus on external threats to the UK, pandemics and infectious diseases. He confirmed that Dido Harding, the Conservative peer who already runs the widely criticised NHS Test and Trace programme, will chair the new body, as the Guardian revealed on Monday. Liberal Democrat leadership contender Layla Moran MP dubbed Harding’s appointment “a reward for failure”, given Test and Trace’s poor record in ensuring that coronavirus carriers and their close contacts were found, tested and urged to isolate to reduce the risk of transmission. It has so far only managed that with 78% of identified cases of the virus and 72% of their contacts, despite being handed £10bn by the Treasury, much of which is going to the private firms carrying out the work, Serco and Sitel. Harding, who also chairs the health service regulator NHS Improvement, said the coming together of the three organisations would “strengthen our response [and] radically ramp up our fight against this disease”. She will lead PHE’s successor until a permanent chair is recruited. Dr Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet medical journal, tweeted: “So. Farewell then, PHE. You stood up for public health against governments that slashed public health budgets over a decade. And now you have to take the blame for one of the worst national responses to Covid-19 in the world. Strange, no?”"
2020-08-18T16:41:58Z,politics,Politics,"Exams, Williamson and the lash: whip photo sparks Twitter intrigue","With his hands clenched and gaze fixed, it was a picture likely intended to show the education secretary’s steely determination to fix the exams fiasco. But the image of Gavin Williamson, taken in his office after he announced a major reversal on A-level and GCSE grades, only served to trigger bewilderment – because of the whip positioned on the desk in front of him. Williamson, who has faced calls to resign over the results crisis, confirmed on Monday that pupils in England could be graded on teacher assessments rather than a computer algorithm, two days after he had pledged “no U-turn, no change”.
The picture, posted on Twitter by Press Association photographer Stefan Rousseau, prompted Twitter users to reach for a deeper meaning. Former Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who defected to Change UK before joining the Liberal Democrats, tweeted: “So much immaturity & poor judgement summed up by the secretary of state for education #Williamson posing with a whip & a mug. In a crowded field, the most under-demoted of inadequates in government.” Some suggested the picture was an attempt to convey a message that, given his previous role as chief whip under Theresa May, he knows where the bodies are buried and will not go quietly if he loses his place in the cabinet. One caller to LBC on Tuesday elaborated on the theory: “The photo that was released yesterday is just a key example of them trolling us because that whip on the desk, with his little red book placed handily on it, is … a sign to say, ‘You come after me and I’m coming after you.’”
The whip in question is understood to have been a gift from a friend of Williamson to mark his time as chief whip and was said to typically sit on his desk rather than having been placed there specifically for the purposes of the photo. It’s not the only unexpected object kept by Williamson; he previously housed his pet tarantula in a glass tank on his desk."
2020-08-18T12:53:59Z,politics,Politics,Senior Tory MP calls for abolition of Ofqual over exam grades crisis,"Ministers should seriously consider abolishing the beleaguered exams regulator Ofqual so ministers have direct accountability, the chair of a powerful committee of MPs has said. Robert Halfon, the Conservative chair of the education select committee, said the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation was no longer fit for purpose, but also that there were still significant questions over the way ministers handled the grades crisis, which led to a humiliating government U-turn. “It is worth considering abolishing Ofqual in its current form, it is not fit for purpose, and bringing it back within the Department for Education. Ministers should have proper control and accountability,” he told the Guardian. On Monday the government announced it would allow A-level and GCSE pupils to use grades awarded by teachers, after the computer moderation process downgraded marks, leading to some pupils missing out on university places. The committee warned in July that “Ofqual’s standardisation model aims to adjust grades to ensure they are broadly in line with previous years … there are concerns about risks of using historic data, which might not be fair for … schools which are on an upward trajectory.” However, the under fire education secretary, Gavin Williamson, told Sky News on Tuesday problems had only “become apparent … when we were seeing the results directly coming out.” Halfon, a former education minister who has been deeply critical of the government and Ofqual’s handling of the crisis, said there needed to be full transparency of the correspondence between the department and Ofqual to see when concerns were raised. “All the minutes and internal documents between Ofqual and the DfE now need to be published to find out what’s gone on, how much this has cost the taxpayer and what questions were asked by the department and what actions were taken by Ofqual to ensure a level playing field for all students,” he said. Halfon said both ministers and Ofqual bore responsibility for the string of changes and U-turns made in the days shortly before and after results were announced, sending students, parents, teachers and universities into turmoil. “Why was the appeals system not set up properly with a much wider base for appeal from the beginning, as recommended by the education select committee? “We could have had appeals allowed simply and quickly with retired teachers, Ofsted inspectors examining them – so from day one appeals could have been turned around in a few weeks. But that never happened and it was only announced the day before that appeals could be made on the basis of mocks. And then only on Saturday the decision on not paying for appeals – why wasn’t this all decided in advance?” Williamson refused to personally back the head of Ofqual, Sally Collier, on Tuesday, saying only that Collier – who has not spoken publicly since students’ results were published last Thursday – had worked hard in her position as head of the exams regulator. Williamson is facing significant criticism over his own role in the results chaos. The Liberal Democrats have called on Boris Johnson to sack his education secretary, criticising attempts to pass the blame on to Ofqual. In a letter to the prime minister, the party’s education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said the government’s failure to take responsibility risks further eroding public trust in the exams system. “There must be consequences for this catastrophic failure of governance. Gavin Williamson must resign, and if he refuses to go Boris Johnson must sack him,” she said."
2020-08-18T12:29:07Z,politics,Politics,Andy Burnham on Covid: 'We're a clear voice telling the machine what it's doing wrong',"Eleven years ago, Andy Burnham stood up in the House of Commons and delivered a sombre statement about a pandemic sweeping the nation. Twenty-nine people in the UK had died from swine flu and the then-health secretary had been warned that 65,000 lives could be lost. Experts from Imperial College in London – including one Prof Neil Ferguson – were urging him to shut schools to slow transmission. Grim-faced, Burnham told MPs “the virus has now taken hold around the country, rather than in isolated pockets”. The government had ordered enough vaccine for everyone, he said, but it would be months before a mass immunisation programme would begin. Fast forward to August 2020 and Burnham, now mayor of Greater Manchester, is sitting on a bench overlooking Pennington Flash, a water park built on an old colliery in what was until 2017 his Leigh constituency. Having been assured a photographer would not be in attendance, he is wearing navy Birkenstocks and jeans. Almost everyone recognises him from his 16 years as MP. “Hiya Andy!” beams a speedwalking lady; “All right, mayor!” yells a topless man. Burnham’s children – aged 15, 18 and 20 – hate going to the supermarket with him, but he clearly loves the attention: “If you don’t like chatting to people, don’t become a politician.” The government announced last week that Greater Manchester would remain subject to enhanced lockdown restrictions for a third week, and Burnham is threatening to withdraw his support unless they compensate those who cannot work – either because they are told to by contact tracers or because their workplaces are shut. Much has changed since his ministerial days. Leigh has gone Tory for the first time in its 113-year history, lost in December to his successor, Jo Platt – “It’s a real lesson to everybody in life isn’t it? Nothing is a given and nothing lasts forever” – and Burnham is dealing with a second deadly virus outbreak in his 19-year career in frontline politics. It’s from this position – or more correctly, a makeshift study in his son’s old attic bedroom in the nearby village of Golborne – that Burnham has arguably shaped the government’s response to the pandemic more than anyone else in the Labour party. Though denied a place on the government’s emergency “Cobra” committee (unlike his London counterpart, Sadiq Khan) he has used a constant stream of media appearances, press conferences and dawn-till-dusk video calls to expose the literally fatal flaws in its centralised approach which for four key months deprived local experts of real-time infection data. With little executive power but his phone number in a lot of TV producers’ phones, he also lobbied successfully for more contact tracing to be done locally after pointing out that Greater Manchester’s team had a 98% success rate while the national call centres managed barely half; got the government to give huge life-saving subsidies to the area’s trams; and at the very start of lockdown persuaded ministers to give £5m to house 1,000 homeless people in hotels in the region, inspiring the national Everyone In scheme. Some might say he is better at calling for other people to do things than getting stuff done himself, but that could be the lack of hard power that comes with his £110,000-a-year job. “I like to think we are beginning to change politics,” Burnham says of himself and the other elected “metro” mayors, notably his friend Steve Rotheram in the Liverpool city region and Andy Street in the West Midlands – a Tory candidate who said last week it was “regrettable” he couldn’t stand as an independent. “We’ve not changed the government machine yet. I think it went into default mode: ‘We are running everything. We will find a place for London on Cobra but not you.’ But I think what’s happened during this is that we have provided a clear and consistent voice back to that machine to tell them what they are doing wrong.”
Though elected on a Labour ticket, Burnham considers himself now “outside of the main cut and thrust of party politics”. He says he stopped taking orders from party HQ after losing to Jeremy Corbyn in the leadership election in 2015. “Seumas Milne [Corbyn’s spin doctor] tried it a couple of times but I didn’t return the calls,” he says. “I don’t think the Labour party have treated me very well over the years, so I do feel a little bit distant from them, more so than I ever have done before.” He began the Covid-19 pandemic warning Boris Johnson that his experience handling swine flu had shown him the importance of clear communication. On 15 March, infuriated that the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had used a column in the Sunday Telegraph to announce that anyone with symptoms must isolate at home for seven days, he pushed for a daily press conference fronted by scientists and health experts. The following day Johnson held the government’s first daily televised briefing. Three weeks later, Hancock was left helping to steer the ship when Johnson was in intensive care with Covid. Burnham knew better than most how hard it must have been. “I don’t envy anyone in government dealing with this situation because I had a minor version of it with swine flu – a smaller health crisis which didn’t have the economic crisis along with it. I know how hard that was … so there’s no point me making a tribal point about it,” he says. Fewer than 400 people died from swine flu in the UK in 2009, compared with more than 41,000 Covid-related deaths in England alone. “Where I am less forgiving is having done things wrong, they have carried on doing things wrong – the way they have announced things, with no consultation, no explanation, late at night; constantly putting out very centralised contracts which don’t really work on the ground.” Yet Burnham admits he would happily swap places with Johnson, himself a former mayor: “There’s no point me saying I wouldn’t because I have tried to lead the Labour party in the past and therefore I wanted to be prime minister. What I have changed my mind on is the way power needs to be distributed around the country. The model of government doesn’t work … I think we need a massive reorganisation of the British state.” Until now, he has supported the extra lockdown measures in Greater Manchester and advocated for the entire region of 2.8 million people to be treated as one. But perhaps not for much longer. He is worried about the small print in the government’s latest announcement, which says: “Where possible the government will remove individual areas from these measures while maintaining or even strengthening measures in others as necessary.” The prospect of a sudden “proper” lockdown – closing shops and businesses with no notice – is a worry, he says: “I said I was nervous about it at the start and I am coming back to a big nervousness about local lockdowns. I am going to be seeking a very frank exchange with the government about it. Not an argument. But it can’t be done too easily.” The government can’t suddenly tighten restrictions without a package of compensatory measures for workers, insists Burnham: “How can I justify it to people when things like support for people to self isolate hasn’t been sorted? You can only try the most restrictive measures if you have tried everything else… We have hit a point now where local lockdowns cannot be the default thing that they slap on places where they get over a certain threshold – especially as they have refused to identify the threshold.” Having been health secretary, he knows that the clock is ticking for the government to get a grip of the virus: “I think the worst is yet to come, I’m afraid. I know that’s not a cheering message, but schools returning – not that it’s a bad thing, I think it’s really important – poses a whole new level of challenge. Colleges and universities returning. Flu season arriving … No vaccine.” Burnham believes England came out of lockdown prematurely, saying the government should have ensured an effective test-and-trace system was up and running first. He says he has hardly left the house since it began, apart from what he calls his “state-sanctioned” 5km daily run, two trips to the pub and, from the look of his toenails, certainly no outings for a pedicure. He has been to just one restaurant, last Wednesday, to calm his 18-year-old’s nerves ahead of her A-level results. He refused to take advantage of the government’s Eat Out to Help Out discount – “I can show you the receipt if you don’t believe me” – believing it to be the wrong way to help the economy. “Who benefits? The discounting benefits people who might have gone anyway. It doesn’t necessarily end up in the pockets of the staff. The business maybe gets some benefit. There would have been better ways of helping the industry and I just found it amazing that they could find that level of funds when you are not helping people isolate if they are ill or asked to do so. It’s a question of priorities, isn’t it?” In an alternative universe, Burnham would probably have won his second mayoral election in May. Despite the Conservatives gaining a third of Greater Manchester’s 27 seats in the general election, the party failed to find a high-profile candidate to oust him as mayor, fielding a former local councillor to nibble at his 230,00 majority. It was only when the mayoral elections were cancelled, on 13 March, that Burnham admits he understood the gravity of the situation. He will stand again next year, pandemic permitting. Some of his campaign pledges will have to be rethought – public transport was to have been his first priority. But Covid has sharpened others, such as the move towards a carbon-free future by 2038. “I think a legacy of Covid will be the acceleration towards a zero-carbon economy. It’s got to, hasn’t it? Partly a result of living differently, but also the economic imperative,” he says. “I look back at that world before lockdown it was a very different world and it’s a world that isn’t coming back.” • This article was amended on 20 August 2020.

2020-08-17T18:17:46Z,politics,Politics,"Despite exam fiasco, Gavin Williamson's job appears safe – for now","Gavin Williamson was already known at Westminster for his chutzpah, his meteoric rise to defence secretary followed by a dramatic fall from grace after being accused of leaking state secrets – and an equally rapid return to the front line a few months later. But Monday’s defiant performance, in which the education secretary laid the blame for the exams fiasco squarely at the door of the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation, raised eyebrows among even his most jaded colleagues. Nevertheless, Boris Johnson’s spokesman insisted that the prime minister had full confidence in Williamson, despite the education secretary’s promise that there would be “no U-turn, no change” falling by the wayside less than 72 hours after he made it. Some of Williamson’s party colleagues don’t share Johnson’s view. But despite the extraordinary reversal, on Monday evening Williamson’s job appeared safe – for now. There are three key reasons his head is not yet on the chopping block despite perhaps the most chaotic, excruciating and fury-provoking government climbdowns of more than 10 executed since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.
One reason is the presence of the exam regulator Ofqual, which devised the now discredited exam results algorithm, as a firebreak. One Tory backbencher said: “Gavin Williamson needs to step up to the plate and chop some heads off at Ofqual – that’s what’s expected here. It’s up to the secretary of state to take firm action. If that doesn’t happen, then he’s toast. “There’s an understanding that he’s not been involved in developing the algorithm but that it’s been left to the experts and it’s failed, and people are expecting the government to now sort this out.” MPs on the education select committee were unimpressed by Ofqual’s chief executive, Sally Collier, when she gave evidence to them, and the regulator’s refusal to publish more details of the standardisation system earlier, to allow it to be scrutinised. Giving Ofqual’s chair, Roger Taylor, the task of communicating Monday’s U-turn suggested a deliberate tactic of ensuring that the regulator, not Williamson himself, took responsibility. Had the House of Commons been sitting, Williamson would have been forced to make a statement to MPs about the abrupt change of policy and face a barrage of questions from colleagues. But while Taylor released an apologetic broadcast statement, Williamson initially said sorry to hundreds of thousands of affected students in an emailed press release before taking questions from journalists off camera and recording short TV clips. A second reason for Williamson’s survival is the seriousness of the challenges facing the education sector in the coming weeks: most pressingly, ensuring that all children in England can return to school next month. Swapping education secretaries so close to the start of term could throw those complex plans off course, as well as removing a potential lightning rod for criticism, should they go awry. Thirdly, Williamson – who hails from a family of Labour voters in Scarborough and became famous for having a pet tarantula – was an integral part of Johnson’s leadership campaign last summer, reaching into parts of the Tory party Johnson might not otherwise have accessed, threatening and cajoling MPs into line as chief whip. Downing Street may still hope those skills will serve Johnson well in the months ahead. Johnson may need them: one former 1922 committee executive member said there had now been so many U-turns and botched policies in recent months that there were growing rumblings of discontent. Extraordinarily, given the prime minister’s 80-strong majority, they even suggested that letters of no confidence in the prime minister could be delivered to the 1922 committee chair this autumn if the government does not start to appear more competent. “I heard lots of rumblings leading up to recess. There’s only so much people can take – you either start to deliver, or you are out. People are holding back [sending in letters] for now, but if you carry on having these disasters, these letters will go in before Christmas, there’s no doubt about it,” they said. Against that backdrop, Johnson may believe it is safer to keep his education secretary at his side for the moment – but Downing Street will also be watching very closely to see whether public fury over the exams fiasco dies down in the coming days."
2020-08-17T17:51:45Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: university admissions cap to be lifted in England – as it happened,"Right, thatâ€™s it from me. Weâ€™ll be winding this blog down shortly but do continue to follow all breaking coronavirus news on our global live blog here. Have a good evening. Gavin Williamson and Ofqual have apologised to students and their parents, as they announced that all A-level and GCSE results in England will be based on teacher-assessed grades. In a spectacular U-turn, the education secretary announced the government would scrap the controversial standardisation model drawn up by the exams regulator to award grades in lieu of exams. Instead, both A-levels and GCSE results will revert to centre-assessed grades, which were submitted by schools earlier this summer. Read our full story here. The about-turn by the UK government came after the Welsh government and Northern Ireland executive confirmed that they too would scrap the standardisation model, meaning the vast majority of post-16 students across the UK will now be awarded grades based on teachersâ€™ assessments. The announcement followed a day of mounting pressure on the UK government from a number of Tory MPs, including two serving ministers. Following the U-turn, the Tory chair of the Commons education committee, Robert Halfon, said the government has â€œserious questionsâ€� to answer over its handling of exam results. However, the announcement did not apply to BTec students, creating uncertainty for countless students of technical courses. Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, said he would not withdraw the threat of legal action until the government confirmed that BTec students would also be given teacher-assessed grades. Greater Manchester Police says it has seen an â€œunacceptable increaseâ€� in the number of breaches of lockdown restrictions since they were imposed on the region on 31 June. Between Friday and Sunday, it recorded 863 incidents related to Covid-19. Of these, 62 related to breaches at licensed premises, the force said. Another food processing plant has been closed down temporarily following an outbreak of Covid-19 among staff. Four members of staff at the 2 Sisters chicken processing site, near Perth and Kinross in Scotland, have fallen ill while a further two people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the community. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotlandâ€™s first minister, said she was concerned about an increase in outbreaks around the country, including 207 cases in the large outbreak in Aberdeen, and smaller clusters in Coatbridge, Lanarkshire and in north-east Glasgow, both of which included schoolchildren. She said a further 26 Covid-19 cases had been recorded overnight â€“ 13 of which were in the Grampian region which includes Aberdeen. That took Scotlandâ€™s historical total to 19,358, while the number of hospital cases rose overnight by five, to 248. Ryanair is to cancel almost one in five flights from its September and October schedules after a drop in bookings in the last 10 days, as Covid-19 cases have increased in Europe, leading to fresh quarantine restrictions. Europeâ€™s biggest carrier said forward bookings had â€œnoticeably weakenedâ€� and it would take 20% from its capacity to reflect demand, mainly cutting flight frequencies rather than routes."
2020-08-17T16:10:53Z,politics,Politics,Alex Salmond: Scottish government refuses to hand legal papers to inquiry,"The Scottish government has refused to hand over significant legal papers to a Holyrood investigation into the handling of harassment complaints against Alex Salmond, claiming they are too sensitive to disclose. John Swinney, the deputy first minister, told the specially convened Scottish parliament committee that the government would withhold its papers on the former first minister’s legal action against it, its own legal advice and key documents from its internal inquiry. Opposition MSPs on the committee are furious, accusing the government of sabotaging the investigation and muzzling civil servants. They are now considering applying to court for legal papers to be released and could invoke a clause in the Scotland Act 1998 which allows Holyrood to compel the disclosure of government documents and to compel witnesses to appear. The committee inquiry will start hearing oral evidence on Tuesday by calling Leslie Evans, the Scottish government’s permanent secretary, who oversaw a botched internal inquiry into two historic sexual harassment complaints against Salmond launched in early 2018. Salmond denied the allegations. Salmond sued the government in August 2018, accusing it of breaching natural justice by failing to allow him a proper chance to defend himself. He won the case after government lawyers admitted in court in January 2019 the inquiry had been mishandled, and called for Evans to resign. Evans will give evidence under oath, and has insisted on bringing with her the Scottish government’s most senior solicitor. Salmond, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon, and her husband, Peter Murrell, the chief executive of the Scottish National party, are due to appear before the committee later this year. The committee will also investigate Salmond’s allegations that Sturgeon’s close aides and civil servants orchestrated a witch-hunt against him – a charge Sturgeon has rejected. Those allegations intensified during Salmond’s subsequent court appearance on 14 charges of alleged sexual misconduct, including an attempted rape, although the Holyrood inquiry will avoid any discussion of those allegations or the evidence heard during the trial. Salmond was acquitted on all charges by a high court jury after his lawyer alleged there had been a conspiracy involving some of the 10 women involved in the case, senior figures in the Scottish government and the SNP. In a letter published on the eve of the Evans hearing on Tuesday, Swinney rejected the committee’s repeated demands for release of legal papers and internal reports on the original harassment inquiry, claiming the documents were legally privileged. Swinney added that ministers could not release reports or notes from civil servants who investigated the first two complaints against Salmond. Ministers would, however, support an application to the court to release its submissions to the judicial review taken by Salmond in 2018. Swinney and Evans also insist civil servants cannot be expected or compelled to offer opinions on what happened, claiming that would breach the civil service code. MSPs on the committee believe that is an attempt to muzzle officials, and have warned Evans and Swinney they will use their parliamentary powers to ensure transparency.
Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, and a committee member, said: “It is so disappointing that the Scottish government, having promised cooperation and transparency at the start of this process, now appears to be turning its back on that pledge.” Alex Cole-Hamilton, for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, added: “This committee must get to the bottom of a series of events that has cost Scottish taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds and left the Scottish government deeply embarrassed. “The committee has already faced challenges over securing documents and statements from persons of interest. That evasiveness does not serve the people of Scotland well.”"
2020-08-17T16:08:38Z,politics,Politics,Only proper planning will level up towns,"Simon Jenkins is right to say that the future of Britain’s economy rests in its towns, and I would add suburbs (The age of the office is over – the future lies in Britain’s commuter towns, 13 August). Unfortunately this will add to house price inflation, social disparities, congestion and pollution unless action is taken to mobilise under-used land close to railway stations and other infrastructure. Such sites can lie vacant for decades, while housebuilders focus on easier and more profitable sites in the countryside (as can be seen around Stroud where I am writing from). The solution does not lie in more roads, but in using the Covid-19 crisis to rebalance the way we live and move. This could in turn provide a much-needed boost to our struggling economy. My report on the state of London’s suburban town centres (Over the Edge?) highlighted contrasts with those in the surrounding areas. The disparities reinforce the need for regional and spatial planning, and for financial mechanisms to support planning reform. It would be folly to assume that somehow the property market will fix the problems without first levelling the playing fields. Dr Nicholas Falk Stroud, Gloucestershire"
2020-08-16T20:00:20Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings urged to release data to disprove claim of second lockdown trip,"Dominic Cummings has been asked to hand over mobile phone and vehicle tracking data to disprove claims that he made a second lockdown trip to Durham at the height of the pandemic. The request was made by Nazir Afzal, the former chief prosecutor for north-west England, who is leading a campaign for a full investigation into Cummings’ movements during the lockdown. It was prompted by allegations from Dave and Clare Edwards and two others, who told the Guardian and the Daily Mirror that they had seen someone whom they believed to be Cummings in woods south of Durham on 19 April, days after he returned to London following his now notorious 17-day trip to the north-east. The prime minister’s chief aide has denied making a second visit and says he has phone data to prove he was in London on 19 April. Boris Johnson says he has seen this evidence, but Downing Street has refused to make it available and regards the matter as closed. In separate letters to Cummings and his wife, Mary Wakefield, however, lawyers for Afzal say there is a public interest in settling the matter by verifying the true extent of their lockdown movements including over the weekend of 17-19 April. Explaining the move, Afzal said: “All we ask, on behalf of the law-abiding public, is that Mr Cummings, who has regularly spoken about the importance of data, provide the data that will evidence his whereabouts and prove he was telling the whole truth in the Downing Street garden. “We have written to Ms Wakefield too because she has yet to give an account of her whereabouts, which has become increasingly relevant as witnesses give their accounts. The public deserve the truth, nothing else.” The letters request location data from the couple’s mobile phones for their first trip to the north-east and for the disputed weekend. They also ask for tracking data from the two Land Rover Discovery vehicles the family were seen using in April and May. The models Cummings used record all the vehicles’ movements and share the data with the manufacturer. The letters also ask for the couple’s authorisation for police to check automatic number plate recognition records for the lockdown movements of the vehicles. Their authorisation is also requested for Land Rover and Google to release location data. At his press conference in the Downing Street rose garden in May, Cummings said it was untrue to claim that he had returned to Durham on 19 April. He said: “Photos and data on my phone prove this to be false, and local CCTV, if it exists, would also prove that I’m telling the truth that I was in London on that day. I was not in Durham.” The letter to Cummings from Afzal’s lawyers reads: “Having highlighted the importance of such evidence to the nation, you will no doubt agree that it is important that you ensure its provision, in light of the continuing controversy surrounding these matters. “Because you expressly made reference to and relied upon phone and other camera-recorded data that you said would corroborate your account and would show that the contradictory witness accounts were ‘false’, any unwillingness now to produce that data would be highly significant.”
Durham police found that Cummings probably breached health protection rules by travelling to Barnard Castle on 12 April, but made no finding on his decision to leave London because the three-day investigation was confined to County Durham. Afzal, whose older brother died of Covid-19 on 8 April, and senior Labour figures have called on the Metropolitan police to investigate all Cumming’s alleged lockdown breaches. Afzal’s letters also cite research that found a clear and lasting dip in public confidence in the government’s handling of the pandemic following the exposure of Cummings’ movements."
2020-08-16T17:38:33Z,politics,Politics,Tory MP accused of rape agrees not to attend Commons next month,"The Conservative former minister arrested on suspicion of rape has agreed not to return to work at Westminster next month after his bail was extended to November, his party announced on Sunday. With the House of Commons summer recess due to end on 1 September, opposition parties had called for the MP to be suspended from parliament. Instead it is understood he has voluntarily agreed not to attend the House of Common, but will continue to represent his constituents from home. He will not have the party whip suspended while the police investigation continues. In a statement released on Sunday, a spokesperson for the Conservative whips’ office said: “These are serious allegations and it is right that they are investigated fully. A decision on the whip will be reviewed once the police investigation has been concluded.” The accused MP, who has not been named, was taken into custody in east London on 1 August and subsequently released while investigations are carried out. The complainant, a former parliamentary aide, reported four incidents alleged to have taken place between July 2019 and January 2020 in Westminster, Lambeth and Hackney. She alleges that the MP assaulted her, forced her to have sex, and left her so traumatised that she had to go to hospital. The Sunday Times reported that the allegations were first reported to the Conservative chief whip, Mark Spencer. It is understood Spencer does not believe a sexual assault was reported to him in his conversation with the complainant, but acknowledges that she reported “abusive behaviour and threats”. He advised her to go to the independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS). The alleged victim made her claims to the ICGS this year.
Campaigners including the TUC and the Fawcett Society have called for parliamentary authorities to take action. “The House of Commons should be no different from any other workplace. Safety and the safeguarding of staff must be paramount. Failure to suspend is yet another example of minimising violence against women and girls and failure to believe victims and survivors when they bravely speak out,” they said. Jess Phillips, the shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, said: “Safeguarding can’t be done by half measures. To suggest that there is no safeguarding risk through online contact with constituents shows a worrying lack of understanding of how abuse manifests. “This halfway house of allowing him to work from home is a product of the Conservatives failing to take fair, clear and decisive action over this very serious issue, and we should expect better from a party of government.” A statement from the Metropolitan police said: “A man in his 50s was arrested on Saturday 1 August 2020. His bail to return date has been extended to early November 2020. The investigation is being undertaken by the Met central specialist crime complex case team.” News of the former minister’s arrest emerged days after Charlie Elphicke, a former Conservative party whip and married father of two, became the first MP in a generation to be convicted of sexual assault. He was found guilty of three charges of sexual assault dating back to 2007 and 2016, including one incident in which he forced himself on a woman at his Belgravia home, groped her and shouted: “I’m a naughty Tory.” The former prime minister Theresa May’s government faced criticism after removing the whip from Elphicke when allegations first emerged, only to return it before a crucial confidence vote."
2020-08-16T15:23:58Z,politics,Politics,Tory MPs press Hancock for 'postcode-level' Covid restrictions,"Conservative MPs have told Matt Hancock that businesses will suffer unless the government takes a more sophisticated approach to the blanket restrictions affecting 4.5 million people across northern England. Ministers announced on Friday that people across large swaths of the north and Leicester would remain under tighter restrictions for a third week as the coronavirus infection rate continued to rise in some areas. The measures, introduced with a few hours’ notice on 31 July, ban people in the affected areas from visiting family and friends and from socialising with other households in pubs or restaurants. The restrictions also prevent the opening of casinos, skating rinks, bowling alleys, exhibition halls, conference centres and indoor play areas, and the resumption of certain procedures in beauty salons, all of which were allowed to open in the rest of England from Saturday. Jason McCartney, the Conservative MP for Colne Valley in West Yorkshire, said on Sunday he would continue lobbying the government to ditch the one-size-fits-all approach to the measures and instead adopt a “postcode-level” method. McCartney said certain towns and villages that had not had a coronavirus case for weeks should be removed from the restrictions, with the proviso that any new outbreak would be acted on immediately. Public Health England data shows there have been few if any coronavirus cases in some of the more rural areas currently covered by the restrictions. In West Yorkshire, for example, there were 54 cases clustered in and around the town of Halifax in the week to 11 August, but none in the outlying villages of Hebden Bridge, Mytholmroyd and Sowerby Bridge. Officials have said it is difficult to lift one village, town or borough out of regional restrictions because people regularly travel across geographic boundaries. The infection rate is also constantly changing, so any easing of easing of restrictions may have to be reversed if cases surged.
McCartney is one of about a dozen Tory MPs, including some in “red wall” constituencies, pressing the government to release certain areas from the lockdown. He said ministers were “getting the message loud and clear” but they needed local authorities to join the push for a new approach. “We’re going to be in this situation for weeks and weeks and weeks unless we start reacting and releasing areas,” he said, adding that businesses such as beauty salons and restaurants would suffer in these areas unless restrictions were eased. “If there are measures where there are cases, no one will complain about that. But people don’t like it when they’re under the restrictions where there haven’t been cases for weeks.” Other Tory MPs, such as Craig Whittaker in Calder Valley and Mark Eastwood in Dewsbury, said after the restrictions were extended on Friday that they would continue pressing for a more targeted approach. Although infection rates remain highest in parts of Greater Manchester, east Lancashire, West Yorkshire and Leicester, officials are closely monitoring several areas in the Midlands and Swindon, in Wiltshire, where the proportion of cases is more than double England’s average. Restrictions have not yet been introduced in Swindon or other areas named as “of concern” in Public Health England’s latest weekly surveillance report, released on Friday, which include Northampton in the east Midlands, Newark and Sherwood in Nottinghamshire, Oadby and Wigston in Leicestershire, and Sandwell in the West Midlands."
2020-08-16T06:25:04Z,politics,Politics,"Is Rishi Sunak, the people's chancellor, about to lose his crown?","When Sajid Javid was thrown out of No 11 in February 2020, few outside Westminster had even heard of his successor. Rishi Sunak had been an MP for less than five years, a minister for two, and had just a few months of experience in the cabinet in the relatively junior role of chief secretary to the Treasury. Nor was Sunak helped by the manner of Javid’s departure – he resigned after Boris Johnson told him to sack all his advisers, a move Javid later said “no self-respecting minister would accept”. Sunak, in acquiescing to the decision, was portrayed as a young loyalist unlikely to ruffle any feathers.
Yet in the months since Sunak became chancellor, he has swiftly become the most popular politician in the UK, and Boris Johnson’s heir apparent. The 40-year old is considered by many in his party to be the only reason the Tories continue to dominate Labour on the question of handling the economy. While Johnson’s team dithered over how to react when Covid-19 cases began to spiral, the team in No 11 was quick to assemble a programme of subsidies and loans for households and employers that was essential to rescuing the economy from collapse. It has cost around £30bn to furlough 9.3 million workers, of which some 7 million were still at home last week. Business loans have cost the government upwards of £50bn. The most eyecatching initiative was the £500m Sunak devoted to his “eat out to help out” scheme, which runs to the end of the month and subsidises restaurant meals from Monday to Wednesday. Quickly dubbed “Rishi’s dinners”, it was plastered across the front pages, illustrated by a beaming Sunak delivering food at Wagamama’s. The scheme is not much more than a token gesture when the trade industry body UKHospitality estimates that sales at pubs, restaurants and hotels across the UK plunged by £30bn during lockdown, with revenues down by 87% between April and June compared with last year. But it has provided an injection of much-needed optimism, and was a highlight of Sunak’s summer statement in July, which was otherwise peppered with tragic forecasts of recession and job losses. The plan also fitted neatly with Sunak’s casual image, honed on Twitter and Instagram ever since he posted a picture of himself working at home in a grey hoodie and trademark black-rimmed glasses, propelling him to prominence under the hashtag #dishyrishi. Sunak’s appeal is no mere Westminster phenomenon. He has been the subject of numerous positive profiles in glossy magazines, including Tatler, and a fortnight ago, the Times even portrayed him with a halo. But while throwing money around has boosted his ratings, he may soon discover that dealing with a recession rarely helps a chancellor’s popularity. Last week, the Office for National Statistics turned everyone’s attention back to the broader economy. It confirmed that Britain’s gross domestic product had fallen by 20.4% in the second quarter of the year. This was the worst performance in Europe between April and June, as well the worst among the G7 group of rich nations. Sunak reacted by insisting his plan to end the furlough scheme in October and force companies to begin repaying government loans after a year remained in place, despite calls for an extension for the hardest-hit industries. Among the Treasury’s chief critics is the Resolution Foundation thinktank. Its research director, James Smith, says the plaudits won by the Treasury so far could easily turn into brickbats. “Given we suffered one of the biggest economic downturns of any country, there is a need for the Treasury to signal it is prepared to do more,” he says. “The big risk is that the end of the furlough scheme will coincide with a rise in unemployment. If more people are out of work, it will create a huge drag on consumer demand and GDP growth, making matters worse. “At the moment, there appears to be a ‘hope for the best’ attitude in the Treasury – a wait-and-see approach that poses a huge risk to the recovery.” Sunak’s allies are acutely aware that his current popularity is a double-edged sword, with the danger of a backlash just around the corner. All he can do, they say, is try to make the right decisions, whether or not they’re popular. “He’s not sitting there thinking ‘how can I keep a 90% rating or 84% rating on [the Tory website] ConHome’ – he’s doing what he thinks is the right thing,” said one.
“At the end of the day, no chancellor can be popular through this if they’re doing the right thing by the country. Let’s critique him on whether he’s done the right things or not, rather than whether he’s popular in polls, because that is just irrelevant to him.” In response to the GDP figures, the chancellor said: “We shouldn’t pretend that it will always be possible for people to go back to the job they had, and in those situations it’s more important that we focus on providing people with fresh opportunity and have them look forward.” That’s tough talk he may come to regret. It might sound friendlier than Norman Tebbit’s 1980s exhortation for the jobless to get on their bikes and look for work, but in midwinter, with the virus possibly wreaking havoc again, it might sound extremely callous. For the time being, a series of employment subsidies for training, and for small businesses that hire new workers, provide the backbone of his post-October approach. A recruitment splurge by the Department for Work and Pensions to double the number of Jobcentre career coaches to 27,000 is another feature, though one that has all the hallmarks of a test-and-trace-style failure. Only a few years ago, the DWP shed thousands of jobs advisers. Now ministers expect a fresh batch to be in position and aware of every potential career avenue within the next couple of months. Sunak has an opportunity to revamp his plans in the autumn budget. He has denied that a second wave of the virus could scupper his set-piece tax-and-spending speech, which is also expected to provide a three-year budget plan for Whitehall departments. However, such major reappraisals are not achieved overnight. And the chancellor is aware, Tory sources say, that some hard choices are now just weeks away. “We’ve got to take a sequence of decisions at different stages of the crisis that lead us back to a reality that’s sustainable,” said one. Tory MP and former Treasury committee member Mark Garnier argues that his party needs to ditch its traditional belief that government spending should be modelled on a household’s finances, an idea popularised by Margaret Thatcher. A former investment banker, he says: “After 17 years in the City, I know you need to take on debt to get things moving. And there is a unique opportunity at the moment to press ahead, especially now that interest rates are at historic lows.” Garnier believes the Bank of England’s willingness to lend the government what it needs should be used to full advantage. “Should we have a ‘family finances’ attitude to balancing the books? The answer must be no.” He says the Tory party should view the pandemic as a war, and recognise that debt will rise for some time while the country adjusts. According to the Institute for Public Policy Research, 3 million jobs will still be reliant on the government’s furlough scheme by the time it closes. Its research, published today in the Observer, has found that a million of those jobs simply no longer exist in practice, as a result of the fallout from Covid and other changes in the economy.
However, it believes that two million jobs in hard-hit sectors will be viable in the long term and could be saved with a successor to the furlough scheme. It says an initiative similar to one started in Germany, which encourages companies to bring back workers part-time rather than laying them off, would cost £7.9bn to roll over into spring. As well as the government paying 60% of pay for unworked hours, it would also provide a 10% subsidy for hours worked part-time. However, entry to the scheme would be stricter, with businesses having to give proof of their longer-term viability. David Bell, a professor at Stirling University and one of the country’s leading labour-market economists, says Sunak is unlikely to benefit from a V-shaped recovery because that would presume private-sector businesses in every industry can get back to previous levels of activity. “The only way you can have a V-shaped recovery is if the economy could return to the way it was. Yet we know the pandemic is already creating all kinds of new demands that will mean the economy looks very different in a few years time,” he says. “How people go to work, where they live, and many other aspects of their lives are going to change, creating new industries and shrinking others.” Bell believes the loss of 1 million employed and self-employed jobs since March is going worsen in the coming months, increasing the need for a well-funded scheme to retrain workers for those industries that will recover strongly and need staff. For the past fortnight, Sunak has spent much of the time promoting his discount dinners scheme, mostly in his Yorkshire constituency, arguing that it is a serious attempt to protect two million people in the hospitality industry. He has successfully batted away criticism that it contradicts the government’s new-found mission to tackle obesity. Whether the former hedge fund manager and alumnus of £40,000-a-year Winchester College, who has defied his privileged upbringing to reveal a common touch, has done enough to save the rest of the economy will only be clear in the autumn. Much hangs on his budget – the future of Sunak, his party and, most importantly of all, the economy.
Six items at the top of Sunak’s to-do list Furlough The subsidy that supported 9.6 million jobs began unwinding in August and ends in October. The £1,000 bonus to keep furloughed workers on until January is unlikely to be enough for many employers. Sunak has been under pressure for months to extend the scheme – how many viable jobs will be lost if he does not? Unemployment The UK has lost 750,000 jobs in six months despite the furlough scheme and 2.4 million began claiming universal credit in the first two months of lockdown, though not all of those will be out of work. Sunak increased the basic universal credit payment at the start of the pandemic, but that is due to run out next April. Will he give the likely record numbers of unemployed families a pay cut? Post-virus economy Repairing the economy and delivering the “build back better” plan will cost billions. Boris Johnson has ruled out tax rises, but will Sunak simply borrow and spend without backbench opposition? If he chooses a stealth option, who will he upset? Spending The spending taps are already being turned off, but the NHS, local government, social care and the “red wall” constituencies all expect attention. Sunak has already said no to some – but if Covid and flu combine to bring a deadly winter, what will he do? Approval “Dishy Rishi” has enjoyed sky high approval, which means there is a long way for him to fall. No politician has ever enjoyed permanent popularity. How can Sunak manage the inevitable fall when something goes wrong, or will he defy history and deliver an end to boom and bust? Downing Street Sunak is chancellor because Sajid Javid couldn’t stomach being told by Dominic Cummings which advisors he could employ. With Downing Street trying to wrest control of the levers of government, can he maintain the independence of the Treasury?"
2020-08-16T06:25:03Z,politics,Politics,"Rishi Sunak is riding high, but history shows No 11 can be a dangerous address","It never ceases to amaze me the way that the media, both reflecting and influencing public opinion, build public figures up – and then knock them down. The latest public figure to be rising, and riding, high is chancellor Rishi Sunak. This man was virtually unknown to the wider world until the duumvirate running this country – prime minister Johnson and his principal adviser Dominic ‘Eye Test’ Cummings – unceremoniously undermined the authority of his predecessor, Sajid Javid, to the point of provoking his resignation.
Sunak is, for the moment, in a strong position. It is difficult not to be popular if you are a rightwing believer in low public spending going against your instincts and doling out money as if there were no tomorrow. Chancellors whose predecessors have resigned or been sacked are in a strong position. One thinks of Roy Jenkins, who succeeded James Callaghan in 1967-70, and Norman Lamont, chancellor 1990-93. The latter’s appointment was so soon after Nigel Lawson’s emotional resignation in 1989 that people have almost forgotten the brief chancellorship of John Major, 1989-90. That was before Major became prime minister and appointed Lamont, his campaign manager, as chancellor.
Lamont inherited the recession that was the inevitable aftermath of the ‘Lawson Boom’ of 1988. That’s the traditional route to British recessions: an expansionary phase of the business cycle, exaggerated by over-ambitious mistakes in economic policy. In Lawson’s case, it was a belief that he had achieved ‘an economic miracle’. Instead he had stoked up the inflationary fire, which led to a recession. It turned out to be a serious mistake for prime minister Thatcher and Major to have put the pound into the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) just as reunification led to a burst of inflation in Germany, and the high interest rates within the ERM forced out the pound on Black Wednesday, 16 September 1992. It was only a matter of time before Lamont carried the can for Black Wednesday and the recession of 1990-92. Lamont was against the ERM policy, but this did not stop him from accepting the prestigious Cabinet role of chancellor, which had long since superseded the foreign secretaryship as the second-most important post in the cabinet. The 1990-92 recession had been the third under Conservative chancellors in 30 years. The first was under Tony Barber, chancellor 1970-74, who followed Labour’s Jenkins. When unemployment reached the previously unheard of postwar total of 1 million in the winter of 1971-72, all the brakes came off economic policy and we experienced what became known as the ‘Barber Boom’, followed by the first oil crisis of 1973-74. Barber’s reputation never really recovered.
But the mid-1970s recession was minor by comparison with that of 1980-81. The chancellor at the time was Sir Geoffrey Howe. The recession was aggravated by Howe’s first budget of 1979, and his 1981 budget, when he cut public spending while unemployment was still rising, has been controversial ever since. True, monetary policy was eased, and an overvalued pound edged down to more realistic levels, but unemployment went on rising to over 3 million by 1985. Howe hardly goes down in history as a great chancellor. He is remembered more for his spectacular fall out with Thatcher over Europe and his devastating resignation speech. Returning to the 1990s, Lamont’s successor, Kenneth Clarke, 1993-97, had a relatively easy ride, presiding over a marked economic recovery period, which stretched to 2007 under Gordon Brown’s 1997-2007 chancellorship, was associated with what became known as ‘sustained, non-inflationary growth’. It was of course too good to last, and along came the great recession of 2007-2009. The Conservatives tried to blame this on Gordon Brown’s spending policies. This was nonsense. Brown was not responsible for the recessions that swept the western world. It was, as Treasury permanent secretary Sir Nicholas Macpherson wrote at the time, “a banking crisis, pure and simple”. Alistair Darling was chancellor from 2007-10. He and Brown emerged creditably from that recession. Unfortunately, their well-engineered recovery was slowed by incoming Tory chancellor George Osborne’s austerity programme, and the impact of that policy has been seen in the unpreparedness of the British economy for the Covid-19 crisis. The important point about the present crisis is that it is not an unexpected, business-cycle recession, but the result of a deliberate clampdown on economic activity. So far, so good for Sunak’s reputation. But if he goes ahead with his plan to terminate the furlough rescue operation and unemployment soars, as forecasters expect, Sunak may find himself diving from hero to zero as fast as his reputation has risen."
2020-08-14T10:33:39Z,politics,Politics,Gavin Williamson under pressure to resign over A-level results 'fiasco',"Gavin Williamson is facing increasing pressure over the education department’s mishandling of this summer’s exam results in England, with the Liberal Democrats calling on him to resign and Labour demanding that the results be replaced by teacher assessments. Layla Moran, the Lib Dems’ education spokesperson, said Williamson should go because of the disruption caused when thousands of students were given lower grades than expected on Thursday. She said Williamson had “pushed ahead with plans which ignored teachers’ advice”, and she also cited previous blunders over free school meals and IT provision during the lockdown.
“Gavin Williamson is an education secretary out of his depth and out of excuses,” she said. “He must take responsibility for his mistakes and step down with immediate effect. Our young people and our country cannot afford these blunders to continue into September ahead of a potential second wave.” Ofqual, the exam regulator for England, designed the grades system around schools’ previous results, resulting in nearly 40% of grades assessed by teachers being downgraded by the statistical model. Private schools disproportionately benefited while pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were treated more harshly, prompting the Equalities and Human Rights Commission to publicly intervene.
Students reported losing places at universities, while a string of college principals and headteachers reported results dramatically lower than past exam performance. Williamson has ruled out following the example of Scotland which on Tuesday scrapped the results produced by its statistical model and said it would use teacher assessments to replace the exams cancelled during the coronavirus lockdown. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, called on the government to scrap Ofqual’s “fatally flawed” system. “Across the last 24 hours we have heard heartbreaking stories and the scale of the injustice caused by the fatally flawed results system has become clear,” he said. “The unprecedented and chaotic circumstances created by the government’s mishandling of education during recent months mean that a return to teacher assessments is now the best option available. No young person should be at a detriment due to government incompetence. “Time is running out. We need action in days, not weeks. That also means an urgent technical review of the standardisation model ahead of GCSE results next week. We need to end this fiasco.”
He accused the schools minister, Nick Gibb, of “grossly misleading” students after he promised that any downgrades would be “by just one grade”. Figures from Ofqual showed that around 24,000 results were lowered by more than one grade. Tory MPs also criticised Williamson’s handling of the controversy and his abrupt announcement that students could use results from mock exams to appeal. One MP told the Daily Telegraph: “He’s clearly seen the chaos in Scotland and is trying to move to prevent that scenario. Instead he’s just made himself look panicky and incompetent. In short, he’s justifying his own sacking.”"
2020-08-13T17:44:05Z,politics,Politics,No 10 pushes ahead with shake-up of Whitehall press offices,"Downing Street is pressing ahead with a radical centralisation of communications that will hand unprecedented control to No 10 and could lead to hundreds of job losses. Whitehall departments were given a deadline of Thursday to submit details of their communications operations to Alex Aiken, the senior civil servant overseeing the drastic shake-up, the Guardian understands. Boris Johnson’s team, many of whom are veterans of the tight-knit Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum, regard Whitehall press offices as bloated and want to take a firmer grip over the messages emerging from government. They have set an informal ceiling of 30 press officers in each Whitehall department. Some departments currently have well over 100. Unions are holding regular meetings with Aiken to discuss the plans and have vowed to resist what they see as an arbitrary cap on numbers, and asked for assurances there will not be compulsory redundancies. They estimate that 4,500 communications staff across government could be affected by the changes, in which reporting lines will shift from individual departments to the centre. Amy Leversidge, an assistant general secretary at the FDA union, said: “The way the centralisation of services was announced, in particular announcing the arbitrary figure of having a maximum of 30 staff per department before the Cabinet Office even started their audit exercise, has left staff feeling like decisions have already been made without their input or expertise. “This feels utterly disheartening for staff, especially when they have been working round the clock on the government’s response to coronavirus.” A grand former privy council room in 9 Downing Street is being refurbished to host televised press briefings from the autumn. A Downing Street source said the new studio would be “the best in the world”. Downing Street has confirmed that Johnson’s chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, and his head of policy, Munira Mirza, are moving to offices in 70 Whitehall with key officials and advisers.
Cummings has long had a preoccupation with what he has called “the extremely hard process of rewiring government institutions which now seems impossible for insiders to focus on given their psychological/operational immersion in the hysteria of 24-hour rolling news and the constant crises generated by dysfunctional bureaucracies”. The government has advertised for a £135,000-a-year data expert to set up a “skunkworks” that will sift and analyse data in an effort to improve decision-making. The changes follow news that Mark Sedwill is to step down as cabinet secretary. Johnson has already seen some candidates for the job, the Guardian understands. It was only advertised internally and is expected to go to a current or former permanent secretary. Sedwill’s other role, as national security adviser, will be taken up by Johnson’s Brexit negotiator, David Frost. The former prime minister Theresa May strongly criticised the appointment, saying Frost had “no proven expertise”."
2020-08-13T17:03:17Z,politics,Politics,Scotland's education secretary John Swinney survives no-confidence vote,"John Swinney, Scotland’s education secretary, has survived a no-confidence vote despite repeated accusations from opposition parties he is guilty of recklessly undermining trust in the education system. Swinney, who is also deputy first minister in Nicola Sturgeon’s minority government, survived after the Scottish Green party MSPs threw their six votes behind the Scottish National party, defeating the no-confidence motion by 67 votes to 58.
Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, said Swinney had to be held accountable for the Scottish exams results debacle, which led on Tuesday to the government reversing a decision to downgrade 124,000 exam results for 76,000 pupils. The most significant downgrading affected children from some of Scotland’s poorest areas, leading to demonstrations by teenagers, including in central Glasgow and outside Holyrood. Leonard said Labour’s no-confidence motion was not about retribution but about accountability to parliament. Ministers were appointed with the consent of the Scottish parliament, and parliament had the authority to withdraw that consent, he said. The exams “catastrophe” was the latest in a line of Swinney policy failures, Leonard said, a criticism echoed by the Scottish Tories and Liberal Democrats, who backed Labour’s motion. “Of course the restoration of pupils achievements [is] a victory for fairness and common sense [but] what it is not is a victory for the education secretary, who only jumped to action when his own job was on the line,” Leonard said. Sturgeon, speaking for the government, said Swinney was one “of the most decent and dedicated people” in Scottish politics who had had the courage to admit publicly he had got it wrong and had rectified it. Taking some of the blame for the crisis, Sturgeon urged MSPs to reject Labour’s “opportunistic” motion. “We took responsibility, we owned it and we fixed it. We have accepted the criticisms made of us,” she said. Fiona Robertson, the chief executive of the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), told MSPs on Wednesday that the moderation system used last week was designed on Swinney’s instructions “to maintain standards over time, to ensure the credibility of qualifications for the benefit of learners”. Swinney was given the original results on 30 July, five days before they were published. Robertson said the moderation process was blind to postcodes, and not based on which school children attended. The SQA would have changed any awards on appeal, she added, based on good evidence they had got them wrong. Ruth Davidson, recently appointed Holyrood leader of the Scottish Tories, said that while Swinney may be a “diligent and capable” man, his handling of the exams crisis had been lamentable. Addressing Sturgeon, she said: “If this isn’t a resignation matter for one of her ministers, what is?”"
2020-08-13T16:49:58Z,politics,Politics,"'Eat out' scheme muddles Covid messaging, says Leicester health chief","The public health chief managing the Covid outbreak in Leicester has raised concerns over the government’s “eat out to help out” scheme and called for more localised testing and tracing. Prof Ivan Browne, the director of public health at Leicester city council, said the messaging around Covid-19 needed to be clearer, given the potential for the infection rate to take off once more. “This has not gone away, it is still here,” he said at an online event hosted by the Royal Society of Medicine.” “I have huge issues with things like eat out to help out. I understand the economic issue of it, but when I am walking up my road and I am seeing people queuing up, it is a concern. “We have just got to get a very clear narrative of where we are, be in control, be cautious, make sure that we are not giving this virus the opportunity to pass on – because it will.” Browne said the balance between centralised and local responses to outbreaks was improving, but more could be done locally. “It is better than it was, but we are still not there yet – we have still got a way to go.” He likened public health directors handling local outbreaks to a group of people trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle. “We all have the pieces, but unfortunately the pieces are in different areas and we are trying to work out who has got which piece.” Browne raised concerns about testing and tracing, noting that while the details of people who test positive and cannot be reached within 48 hours by the national test-and-trace system system were now passed to local public health teams, their contacts’ details were fed back into the national system. “Test and trace has got issues … but we are trying to improve that,” he said, adding that he was pressing for cases to be passed to local teams sooner. He said the local approach was particularly useful as multiple members of a household could be spoken to at the same time. “The way the central system was set up was it takes everyone as an individual, which is ludicrous really,” Browne said. Dr Lilith Whittles, an infectious disease modeller from Imperial College London, said regional outbreaks could lead to a broader second wave if not managed correctly. She said results from a nationwide antibody study in England suggesting only 6% of the population was likely to have had Covid were concerning. “What that means is that we are nowhere near the level of population immunity that we would need to prevent the occurrence of a second wave,” she said. In Scotland, an incident management team is investigating whether a new cluster of nine cases in Orkney is linked to an ongoing outbreak in Aberdeen, while 47 new cases have been reported in the Grampian area and a cluster of eight cases are under investigation in Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said clusters of this kind were inevitable and “should not cause undue alarm”, but said they were a “stark reminder that this virus still poses a risk to us”. “We should become more used to hearing about several different clusters, because the virus hasn’t gone away. Covid is still present and it will spread really rapidly if it gets the opportunity,” she said."
2020-08-13T11:23:12Z,politics,Politics,'Hierarchy of racism' fears threaten Starmer's hopes of Labour unity,"When Keir Starmer approved apologies and six-figure damages last month for former Labour officials who had accused the party of antisemitism, he probably hoped to draw a line under a damaging issue that had dogged the party under its former leader Jeremy Corbyn. But rather than solving Labour’s problems, the settlements – regarded by some on the party’s left as principally about repudiating Corbyn’s leadership – could transform one racism row into another. On the eve of the settlement, the Guardian has learned, Labour’s BAME staff network wrote to Starmer to warn he risked undermining an inquiry into yet another issue that has divided the party. This involved an 860-page leaked report on the party’s legal and governance unit, which claimed to show instances of factionalism and hostility to Corbyn’s leadership, racism and sexism. It has since been claimed that private WhatsApp messages revealed in the report were selectively edited to give a false impression. In meetings with the leader, the Guardian has been told, members of the BAME staff network warned that the apologies to seven ex-staffers who appeared on BBC Panorama could further a perception of a “hierarchy of racism” in the party, with antisemitism seen as the most serious form of prejudice, while Islamophobia and anti-black racism were considered less important. The Guardian has spoken to BAME Labour MPs, officials and members who questioned the wisdom of the move when there are two outstanding inquiries into Labour’s handling of internal racism complaints, including the leaked report. Amid other concerns over the party’s response to the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, they expressed fears that black voters could be pushed away. Diane Abbott, Labour’s longest-standing black MP, alleged in the leaked report to be the target of racist abuse, warned Labour risked destroying the trust of black voters. “I knew the party bureaucracy was anti-Jeremy,” she said, “and they were not my best friends, but I was really shocked when the report revealed just how racist and abusive they were about me and other black MPs on the left, going so far as to work with journalists who were trying to doorstep me and harass me. I found that really shocking and upsetting.” One of Labour’s newest black MPs, Claudia Webbe, echoed Abbott’s concerns. She said: “I don’t know the details of the lawsuits against the party, but I am deeply concerned that the party would apologise … while the independent inquiry into [the report’s] contents is ongoing. “At a time when black members are saying they don’t feel safe and welcome in our party, this move by the leadership could undermine the very inquiry that they promised would restore the trust and confidence of BAME communities.” Before the general election, polling found that Labour under Corbyn led the Conservatives by 25 points among BAME groups, with more than half of BAME voters saying they could imagine Corbyn in Downing Street. “As much as Corbyn didn’t win, he’s very popular among some sections of black voters and leftwing voters,” said Maurice McLeod, a Labour councillor from south-west London, citing Corbyn’s antiracism work and policies concentrated on deprived communities. “He’s kind of like what some people used to say about [Bill] Clinton: he’s as close as you can come to a black candidate.” Unlike Clinton, though, Corbyn could not convince the rest of the nation. He lost to Boris Johnson, a man who had called black people “piccaninnies” and Muslim women “letterboxes”, and resigned. Starmer won the subsequent leadership race with a vow to rebuild Labour’s electoral coalition and reunite a party split by years of factional conflict. It was a mission that meant somehow reconciling the interests of BAME voters in Britain’s urban centres with white voters in the former “red wall”, whose concerns about immigration, support for Brexit and dislike of Corbyn had pushed them to the Tories.
Starmer’s first major setback came within days of him becoming party leader in April, with the leaked report alleging a “hyper-factional” environment. Produced under Corbyn’s leadership and intended for submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, it is seen by some on the right of the party as an attempt to deflect the blame over the handling of antisemitism complaints. But it was the allegations of racism and sexism in conversations between officials that antagonised black voters. The black writer Yomi Adegoke described how the alleged messages between senior officials regarding Abbott and fellow black MP Dawn Butler “left a singularly bitter aftertaste”. Abbott was allegedly described as “truly repulsive” and “a very angry woman”, while Butler’s claims to have experienced racism within the parliamentary party were said to have been dismissed. (Butler raised the alarm about institutional racism this week after being stopped by police for a third time while out in a car in London with a friend.) Adegoke wrote: “Society still fails to fully acknowledge the scourges of sexism and racism, but we are miles from reckoning with misogynoir – a combination of both that doubly penalises black women in distinct ways.” Labour staffers have since claimed the conversations were edited to give a false impression that racist and misogynistic exchanges had taken place. Behind the scenes, Starmer also faced a backlash from Labour’s BAME staff network, numbering about 40 workers. They held a series of meetings with him in which they shared their experiences of racism within the party and demanded action. They presented the leadership with a list of demands, including a diversity audit. One member of the network, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “There’s this thing about Keir where it seems he can’t really connect on a personal level … I think that is quite dangerous, because he’s got an office that is packed with white men under 35.” Starmer reportedly informed the Labour BAME staff network that of 27 staff in his office, nearly a third are BAME, with some roles still to be filled. Starmer ordered an urgent review into the leaked report, appointing a black barrister, Martin Forde QC, to lead the panel. He asked people to “refrain from drawing conclusions”. But reports began to emerge of black voters beginning to turn away from the party. In May, the killing of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis prompted worldwide BLM protests over endemic racism. The systematic marginalisation and oppression of black people was suddenly top of the political agenda.
As crowds of protesters took to the streets, Starmer’s response was initially ambiguous, vacillating between attempts to show solidarity with antiracists and doubling down on a law and order agenda. Protesters who tore down the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol were “completely wrong”, Starmer said, angering some members even as he conceded it should not have been there in the first place. He condemned the Labour MP Barry Gardiner for defying social distancing to join protests. Then, perhaps sensing he had underestimated the mood, he circulated a picture of himself and his deputy, Angela Rayner, kneeling in solidarity with “all those opposing anti-black racism”. Starmer appeared on BBC Breakfast, where he dismissed calls to defund the police, a key BLM demand, as “nonsense” and described the movement as a “moment” – though Starmer’s team insist he was striving to underline its seriousness, not dismiss it. Black Labour MPs, including Florence Eshalomi and Bell Ribeiro-Addy, publicly contradicted their leader. BAME members, too, were angry. Bess Oates, a Labour activist from Harrow, said Starmer’s comments made many in her network consider their future in the party. “Using the word ‘moment’ rather than ‘movement’ suggests that: ‘OK, these protests happened, but that’s the end of the conversation now we need to move on,’” she said. “And in regards to this completely dismissing the whole defund the police part of it … I think was kind of ignoring what the problem is. It’s not just a few bad cops, it’s the idea that the police as an institution are racist and how it ties into the capitalist system. So to just dismiss that point completely as rubbish really shows that he doesn’t understand the issue at all.” Facing a backlash, Starmer and his team called a virtual press conference exclusively for black reporters, in which Starmer appealed to black voters not to leave the party and expressed regret over his choice of words. Days later, he said he was signing up for a course in unconscious bias. Clive Lewis, one of three black male Labour MPs, said BLM had transformed the political landscape in ways the new leadership was ill prepared for.
“If it was soft lighting before, it is now a really harsh light that is on politicians,” Lewis said. “That means that what was acceptable before may no longer be acceptable now. There is a higher standard that’s being expected [by] black voters, black members; and if you can’t step up to that, if you struggle in that new reality, then you are going to be found wanting.” The impact on black voters is hard to quantify: the party does not collect ethnicity data from members. Labour’s national executive committee says membership is rising, as is the proportion of BAME voters, but it gives no detail or breakdown. David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, said he had seen no evidence of Starmer struggling to gain support from BAME voters – and backed his ability to make improvements within the party. In a statement released through Labour HQ, Lammy said: “I do agree there is much more the Labour party has to do to promote and support BAME staff. However, this has been an issue for successive Labour leaders.

2020-08-13T05:00:46Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel seeks advice on confirming legality of poppers,"The home secretary has sought to clarify the legal status of poppers, in a move campaigners said highlighted “the absurdity of current drug legislation”. Alkyl nitrite preparations, widely known as poppers, have resided in a legal grey area after being given a last-minute reprieve from inclusion in a ban on formerly legal highs in 2016, following an outcry from gay people, led by former Tory minister Crispin Blunt. In a letter to the Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), Priti Patel wrote that the group had said poppers did not fall within the scope of the Psychoactive Substances Act because they did not have a direct effect on the central nervous system. “However, a Court of Appeal judgment in 2018 confirmed that substances which have only an indirect psychoactive effect can still be captured by the 2016 Act,” she said. “As a consequence the lawfulness of the supply of poppers is uncertain. I am minded to remove this uncertainty by explicitly exempting poppers from the 2016 Act. I would seek the ACMD’s advice on an exemption. “My officials will work with you to provide more detail on the proposed wording of an exemption as you consider the issue.” In her letter to the ACMD, Patel also said she wanted the panel to investigate how to prevent sales of illicit drugs online and to research the reasons behind growing powder cocaine use among young people. Campaigners said the government was avoiding substantive change to reduce record drug-related deaths – 4,359 people across the UK in 2018 – and queried why the issue had suddenly reappeared. “This would be a useful technical clarification but one which highlights the absurdity of current drug legislation,” said Steve Rolles, senior policy analyst at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation. “To have a home secretary effectively request the formal legalisation of poppers, while deaths from other drugs spiral, shows misplaced priorities. “There are countless other issues the ACMD should more usefully and urgently address including the establishment of overdose prevention centres, drug safety testing, or programmes to divert people caught in possession away from the criminal justice system altogether” Crispin Blunt, the Tory MP and chair of the Conservative Drug Policy Reform Group, who made an impassioned intervention to prevent government “stupidity” in banning poppers in 2016, welcomed the move to clarify their status. “Many gay men will be grateful to the home secretary for this clear direction of policy, as indeed am I,” he said. “On other issues she seeks further information on how the dark and open web operates and around cocaine and GBL/GHB use among the young. More evidence is crucial to better policy making and I welcome her seeking it on areas important to improving public health.” Poppers, used since the 1970s largely for their muscle-relaxing effects, increases blood flow to the body and is particularly popular with gay men who use it for sex. It is also used as a club drug as it creates a head-rush and a sense of euphoria. Although many of the so-called head shops where poppers were formerly sold have closed, it remains openly on sale in some markets, cafes and shops – usually masquerading as a room odouriser. It can leave users feeling sick, faint and physically uncoordinated, with product quality not officially regulated. A Home Office spokesperson said: “As this letter sets out, we are continuing to work in consultation with the ACMD to consider any new evidence of misuse, harms and diversion.”"
2020-08-12T23:01:38Z,politics,Politics,MPs ask No 10 to clarify Dominic Cummings role in defence review,"A group of MPs has demanded Downing Street clarify Dominic Cummings’ role in the defence and foreign policy review, saying it is unclear who is in charge of the exercise. The defence select committee complained of a lack of “clarity and transparency” and called on No 10 to set out what role special advisers led by Cummings, the prime minister’s chief aide, will play in the review, which is designed to set national security priorities for the next five years. Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the committee, said the review “should not take place behind closed doors” and complained that there was little evidence that external stakeholders had been consulted so far. Although he did not name Cummings directly, Ellwood, a Conservative MP, said it was unclear who was directing the review’s conclusions. “A number of unknowns remain, including the key players at the heart of the review,” he said. The committee asked Downing Street to explain “how and when” Boris Johnson would become involved, as well as other senior ministers, and what role would be played by political advisers such as Cummings. “We seek clarity,” the committee members wrote. “What role the No 10 policy unit and specialist advisers will play in the review process?” The review has been beset by accusations that it is being driven by Cummings, who is being given a personal tour of the military’s most sensitive sites, including the SAS headquarters and Porton Down research labs, organised for him by Ben Wallace, the defence secretary. Before taking up his job at Downing Street, Cummings accused the Ministry of Defence in a blogpost of “continuing to squander billions” on the £6.2bn procurement of two aircraft carriers that he said enriched “some of the worst corporate looters”. He argued it would be better for the military to invest in swarms of tiny drones, causing alarm in the defence establishment which has long focused on expensive heavy equipment procurement programmes in land, sea and air. The cross-party group of MPs also asked how the prime minister’s newly appointed national security adviser, David Frost, would be involved in the process, and warned that the already complex exercise may not match up to its billing. “Number 10 has described the integrated review as the most comprehensive policy review since the end of the cold war; however, we are concerned that the gap between this expectation and reality is widening,” Ellwood said. The committee said it was unclear whether the review would produce “one, two or three documents” and whether it would include “a distinct foreign policy strategy or whether this will be combined with a national security strategy”. Members also expressed “surprise” that Johnson had taken the controversial step to merge the Department for International Development with the Foreign Office before the exercise had barely begun. Announced after the election and before the coronavirus crisis hit, the integrated review is the latest in a series of five-yearly defence reviews conducted by the government. It was paused at the height of the pandemic and gradually restarted with the expectation that it will conclude later this year. Apparently concerned at how No 10 would respond to criticism, Ellwood said he hoped that the defence committee would “not be viewed an adversary of government, but instead as a constructive critic and contributor”."
2020-08-12T18:25:53Z,politics,Politics,Gavin Williamson's apology to school pupils unlikely to be his last,"Gavin Williamson has told the nation’s schoolchildren he is “incredibly sorry” for the chaos and disruption of the past few months. Apologies are rare indeed from a government whose standard operating model seems to be “never apologise, never explain.” But with headteachers who have glimpsed the A-level results warning of widespread and inexplicable discrepancies, it seems unlikely to be his last. Conservative MPs’ WhatsApp groups were abuzz with alarm on Wednesday about the risk that the government could be forced into a Scotland-style U-turn once the results are made public. Determining grades for the Covid-19 cohort in a way that pupils and parents perceive as fair was always going to be a formidable challenge. But some colleagues believe the education secretary failed to get a grip on the issue. Boris Johnson handed Williamson an extraordinary get-out-of-jail card when he restored him to the frontbench less than three months after Williamson was sacked as defence secretary for leaking details about Huawei from a national security council meeting. He denied being behind the leak. But Johnson has never appeared to trust him as Theresa May once did. Williamson has been outside the inner circle of powerful decision-makers who have driven the government’s response to the pandemic, and occasionally the subject of hostile briefing. Williamson’s supporters say he has been landed with an extraordinary difficult set of circumstances, and kept on a tight rein by an interventionist Downing Street. But he has been blamed for several missteps, including the failure to ensure children received more remote teaching during lockdown – promoting Johnson to announce a “big summer of catchup”, which ultimately turned out to mean some funding for private tutoring in the next academic year. He has also appeared unable to win over teachers in the way that Rishi Sunak seemed to charm other trades unions, at least while the furlough scheme was in full effect. “The thing you have to know about Gavin is that he has a clique of people who he favoured as chief whip who are supportive of him, and there’s another group who think he’s completely useless,” said one former cabinet minister. “There’s a grand canyon of difference between the two groups. Recent empirical evidence would suggest the latter group are closer to the truth.” The cross-party education select committee highlighted the risks of botching the exams season a month ago, saying it was “extremely concerned,” about whether disadvantaged groups could be disproportionately affected. “Ofqual must be completely transparent about its standardisation model and publish the model immediately to allow time for scrutiny,” the MPs’ report said. The exams regulator will not do this until Thursday. The MPs also called on the government to ensure the appeals process would not just benefit “the sharp-elbowed and the well-heeled”. The latest changes to the appeals process, with mock results to be taken into account, were welcomed. But the manner of their announcement – late at night after Williamson’s Scottish counterpart, John Swinney, had given what Tory critics called “the longest resignation speech in history, minus the resignation” – smacked of panic. And by the time Williamson’s junior minister Nick Gibb had toured the broadcast studios, the reassuring “triple-lock” trumpeted in the announcement had been revealed to be a modest change likely to affect only a small group of people. Not only that, but Ofqual made clear it would not be able to say until next week how the tweaked appeals system will work, meaning days more of uncertainty for many thousands of anxious teenagers and their families.
Williamson insists the government’s approach to standardising grades has been robust and fair, and his department has been reassuring Conservative backbenchers that Thursday’s results won’t reveal the wide discrepancies between those with rich and poor backgrounds that were present in Scotland’s results. But in Scotland it was the drip, drip of egregiously unfair cases that ultimately prompted the SNP to change course – and early indications are that England’s results will provide many more. Aside from his sacking after May said there was “compelling evidence” of his involvement in the leak to the Daily Telegraph, Williamson’s tenure as defence secretary is perhaps best remembered for his telling Russia to “go away and shut up”. Some at Westminster believe it is only a matter of time before he receives the same message himself, from Johnson."

2020-08-11T18:40:55Z,politics,Politics,Scottish Conservatives appoint Ruth Davidson as Holyrood leader,"The Scottish Conservatives have appointed Ruth Davidson as their leader in Holyrood, hours before she was due to face Nicola Sturgeon again at first minister’s questions. The announcement on Tuesday evening comes nearly a year after Davidson quit suddenly as leader of the Scottish party, partly in protest at Boris Johnson’s election as UK leader and his stance on Brexit, and also to focus on her infant son. Douglas Ross, the Moray MP who was appointed without a competition as overall leader of the Scottish Tories earlier this month, has given Davidson the newly created title of leader of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist MSP group. Ross was crowned leader in a bloodless coup six days after his predecessor in the role, Jackson Carlaw, who had served previously as Davidson’s deputy, suddenly resigned following a surge in support for Sturgeon, the Scottish National party and independence. Since Ross does not yet have a seat in the Scottish parliament – he is standing for Holyrood next May – Davidson’s promotion is designed to head off criticisms about her having power without portfolio and that the Scottish Tories are leaderless at Holyrood. The announcement of her elevation, which included the disclosure that Carlaw’s erstwhile deputy, Annie Wells, had lost that post, came without any explanatory remarks from Ross or Davidson. Wells is now the party’s shadow cabinet secretary for communities and local government. Davidson’s Wikipedia entry now shows her appointment as Holyrood leader backdated to 5 August, the day Ross was elected. It was announced last month that she would get a peerage, but she has since postponed her elevation to the House of Lords until at least March next year, when she is due to quit her Holyrood seat of Edinburgh Central.
Many Holyrood observers believe Carlaw’s replacement was largely engineered by Davidson – who had been seen visiting Ross some days before Carlaw’s resignation – and her close allies inside the party. Johnson travelled to Moray and undertook constituency visits with Ross in July, his first since last December’s snap general election, ostensibly on a tour to promote “the sheer might” of the UK. Before Carlaw quit, the Tories had become deeply alarmed by a series of opinion polls from Panelbase, Survation and YouGov showing the SNP were building a commanding lead among voters in advance of next May’s Scottish parliamentary elections. The latest Panelbase poll put the SNP on 55%, enough on paper to win an overall majority in Holyrood, and also showed that backing for independence had reached 54% in two successive polls, excluding don’t-knows."
2020-08-11T13:44:52Z,politics,Politics,Justine Greening hits out at ministers over A-level awards process,"A former Conservative education secretary has hit out at this year’s A-level awards in England, accusing ministers of overseeing a system which will see students’ results downgraded based on background and school circumstances. Justine Greening, who was education secretary between 2016 and 2018, described the awards process this year as “levelling down in action” – a pointed reference to the Conservative government’s “levelling up” agenda. She said: “It’s been bad enough for students losing months of education but A-level students now face their grades being downgraded essentially because of background and circumstances of their school. That’s levelling down in action and it’s totally unacceptable when it hits getting into university too.” Her intervention came as pressure mounted on the Westminster government, and the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to address widespread concerns about the fairness of this year’s A-level results, which are due to be published on Thursday, followed by GCSEs next week. Analysis seen by the Guardian suggests that nearly 40% of A-level grades submitted by teachers in lieu of summer exams are set to be downgraded, amid concerns that disadvantaged students are likely to be hardest hit. “Everyone understands how challenging it has been for grading exams this year,” said Greening, “and teachers have worked very hard to provide grade assessments. But it’s important Ofqual now take seriously all complaints from schools, particularly in less privileged areas and on behalf of less privileged students to ensure the maximum fairness in grades.” She warned it would be a significant undertaking. “On the economic crisis, the Treasury said it would do ‘whatever it takes’. We need the same approach towards Ofqual to enable it to handle complaints and requests for regrading promptly and to avoid an unnecessary levelling down grades crisis.” Following the cancellation of exams due to the Covid-19 pandemic, teachers in England were told to submit the grades they thought each student would have received if they had sat their papers, alongside a rank order of which students they believed would do best within each grade for each subject. The data was then subjected to a standardisation process, including a school’s prior attainment, to try to ensure fairness across the system. But analysis seen by the Guardian of the algorithm and data used by the exam regulator Ofqual to distribute grades found that a net 39% of assessments of A-level grades by teachers were likely to be adjusted down before students received their results. That would mean nearly 300,000 A-levels issued would be lower than the teacher assessment of the more than 730,000 A-level entries in England this summer. The former higher education minister Jo Johnson warned that schools would face large-scale and legitimate demands for additional information from disappointed students. “Transparency is critical to maintaining trust. I welcome the decision to publish the algorithm on Thursday, but schools and colleges that have not been allowed to tell students their centre assessment grades and positions in the subject rank orders before results day will now face a barrage of requests for this information from disappointed students. “I’m not sure it’s sustainable to have each school come to an independent decision on whether to release predicted grades and rank orders in an ad hoc way after results day. The government needs to provide guidance to help schools and colleges handle what will be large-scale and legitimate demands for information from students wanting to understand whether and why any downwards moderation has affected their grades.” The Liberal Democrat education spokeperson, Layla Moran, called on ministers to make the appeals process straightforward and accessible. “Young people have already had their education derailed by the coronavirus crisis. They shouldn’t be further penalised by inaccurate grades. “The Liberal Democrats have been clear that ministers need to make the appeals process for A-Level grades straightforward, with individual pupils able to appeal directly to the relevant examination boards free of charge. They must also make clear the process for resits, again at no cost to pupils.”"
2020-08-11T04:50:34Z,politics,Politics,Love of Stilton drives wedge between UK and Japan in post-Brexit trade talks,"Having promised to rush through a post-Brexit trade deal, Japan and Britain made significant progress only to discover that the fate of Stilton has driven a wedge between them. During recent talks in London, international trade secretary Liz Truss and the Japanese foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, reached a “substantial” preliminary agreement on trade, promising to conclude a preliminary deal by the end of this month. But after reaching a broad consensus over auto tariffs and going “significantly” further than expected in sectors such as financial services, they reportedly reached a stalemate over Stilton after Truss insisted on making it part of the negotiations.
Truss is known for defending the UK’s cheesemakers, famously condemning Britain’s huge appetite for foreign cheese as a “disgrace” during the 2014 Conservative party conference. Britain is seeking more preferential terms for its blue cheeses amid pressure on Boris Johnson from British farmers concerned about the imminent loss of EU subsidies, according to the Nikkei Asian Review business newspaper. Japan is prepared to phase out tariffs on hard cheeses such as cheddar by 2033, but is refusing to go soft on fresh and blue-veined varieties, which would have duty-free access on an agreed quota by the same date, the Financial Times reported. Japan is reportedly reluctant to offer Britain better terms than it gave the EU, which has a combined population nearly seven times the size of Britain’s, in a free trade deal that went into effect early last year. But there is speculation that Tokyo could consider lowering the barriers to blue-veined cheeses given the relatively small costs involved. Britain exported £18m of blue cheese globally last year, the FT said, citing data from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, but just £102,000 of that went to Japan. And Truss is reportedly hoping to point to Japanese concessions over Stilton as proof that Britain has improved on the EU’s trade deal with Japan. While officials in Tokyo have not denied the Nikkei report, Motegi, making the first overseas trip by a Japanese minister since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, said he was confident the two sides would clinch a preliminary deal by the end of August, just four months before Britain is due to leave the EU. Truss, meanwhile, said the most recent round of negotiations, which began in June, had been “positive and productive”. She said in a statement: “We have reached consensus on the major elements of a deal, including ambitious provisions in areas like digital, data and financial services that go significantly beyond the EU-Japan deal.” Japanese business leaders have voiced alarm over the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit. Around 1,000 Japanese companies employing 180,000 people have a presence in the UK, according to the Japanese foreign ministry. Total bilateral trade was worth a total of £31.6bn last year, with 9,500 UK-based businesses exporting goods to Japan, according to British government figures."

2020-08-10T12:26:49Z,politics,Politics,"NHS test and trace will fail unless government pays wages, say unions","The government’s flagship test-and-trace system will fail unless ministers agree to pay the wages of those who are forced to isolate for two weeks, unions and regional mayors have warned. Millions of low-paid workers either do not qualify for the statutory sick pay of £95.85 a week or cannot afford to live on the allowance, leaving them unable to pay the bills if they have to quarantine due to coronavirus. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) and unions including Unison, GMB, Usdaw, Unite and CWU on Monday joined calls for the government to step in, with regional mayors warning that the test-and-trace scheme would collapse without the financial support. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “We all want test and trace to work. But it’s not viable to ask workers to self-isolate if that means they are plunged into financial hardship. Until ministers fix this problem, people will continue to struggle to follow official advice. “Wherever possible, employers should do the right thing and pay workers their full pay. But the government must also ensure that every worker gets financial support. Too many – including the 2 million who currently don’t qualify for sick pay, or the 7 million only getting SSP – will not be able to afford to isolate.”
In Germany, people who have to quarantine are paid their regular wage for seven weeks. Thereafter they get 70% of their salary in sickness pay. In China, people asked to self-isolate at home for two weeks have all their rent, food and bills covered by the government. Launching a campaign called Time Out to Help Out, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, said employees forced to self-isolate should be paid their full normal wage, which employers would then claim back from government. He has called for jury duty-style payments to anyone asked to isolate. Burnham said: “NHS Test and Trace will never work properly until all employees are supported to follow its requests. It’s right that everybody plays their part in helping to get Covid-19 under control. But what’s not right is forcing some of our workers – many doing the lowest paid jobs or self-employed – to make a choice between self-isolating or face a drastic loss of income.” Steve Rotheram, the metro mayor of the Liverpool city region, said: “We cannot beat this virus by asking people to choose between putting food on the table or keeping their communities safe.”"
2020-08-09T18:21:47Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson knows his summer break won't be a chance to relax,"In August 2010, when David Cameron became the first UK prime minister to take paternity leave as head of a new and largely untested coalition, switching off from work would not have been easy – unless you compare his situation to that now faced by Boris Johnson. Next weekend, the prime minister is due to set off for an undisclosed location in Scotland for a reported two-week August break with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, and their baby, Wilfred, who is approaching four months old. The trip is delayed paternity leave, which – as well as being perfectly legitimate – will help to insulate Johnson from the traditional media sniping about politicians taking time off during crises. Of course, prime ministers are never really off duty beyond hugely rare circumstances such as Johnson’s own stay in intensive care with coronavirus, and he will receive a steady stream of prime ministerial red boxes. In taking a Scottish break, Johnson both avoids the risk of being caught up in a sudden change of quarantine plans and shows his desire to keep the UK intact, in keeping with his self-appointed under-billing title of minister for the union. But at the same time, being in Scotland will grant him proximity to one of the key challenges he will face on his return: how to fully reopen schools without either bringing a new wave of Covid-19 cases or shutting down large parts of the economy and society to compensate. Scottish schools start returning from Tuesday, and while public health is devolved and thus a matter for Nicola Sturgeon, the prime minister will be keenly watching to see what impact the return of students has. He heads north amid calls for more government efforts to help schools contain the virus beyond the officially-mandated regime of more handwashing and splitting pupils into bubbles, for example routine testing and a better test-and-trace system. It will be test and trace that is perhaps key to how well the government and its scientific and medical teams can cap any surge in Covid, and prevent the much-mooted nightmare winter scenario of a new coronavirus peak adding to flu and perhaps other factors such as flooding. It will also be on minds in No 10 that the longer coronavirus seems to be a semi-permanent state of affairs, the harder it will be to argue against an immediate inquiry into the government’s handling of it. But it is a testament to the political bandwidth understandably taken up by coronavirus that Johnson’s secondary task will be to puzzle a way to a permanent trade with the EU in the coming weeks without alienating his pro-Brexit MPs and the leave-supporting voters who helped propel him into No 10. Successive waves of talks in Brussels and London involving Johnson’s chief negotiator, David Frost, have seemingly not come close to a breakthrough, amid predictions in Brussels that No 10 will need to take a more central role. If this does not happen, Johnson will have to factor in how much a no-deal departure from the transition period could add to the woes of already-struggling companies, and a country facing a once-in-a-generation unemployment crisis. When he headed off for time with baby Florence, Cameron was still six years away from his darkest political moment: the Brexit vote that cast him from office. Johnson does not know what will happen in coming weeks, but the number of potential crises at this crucial moment means that he and his aides must have entertained the possibility that his leave could be short-lived."
2020-08-08T14:16:30Z,politics,Politics,Big Labour donors returning to party under Keir Starmer,"Former Labour donors who had abandoned the party are already considering renewing their support under Keir Starmer’s leadership, it has emerged. Figures who have given the party large sums in the past said they had rejoined Labour, with one major donor saying they were already prepared to give again. Another former supporter said there was “a long road” ahead after allegations of antisemitism in the party, but that they had been impressed with Starmer’s start. “I would not give Labour money under Corbyn, but I would now be happy to give money to Labour,” said one significant former donor. “Previous donors need to meet Keir and Angela [Rayner, the deputy leader] and learn to trust them, because the history over the last four years has been horrific.” Juliet Rosenfeld, whose late husband Andrew was one of Labour’s most generous donors under Ed Miliband’s leadership, said she had rejoined the party to vote in the leadership contest. “I voted for Keir and am delighted he has won,” she said. “He is someone ‘without a side’. I trust him completely on the issues that matter, and I will, and have, encouraged others to come back to Labour.”
Another former backer said: “It will be a long road: it’s not going to happen easily to get rid of antisemitism. It’s deep in the party membership. Keir’s doing all the right things, but it’ll still take time.” Big private donations dried up almost completely under Jeremy Corbyn, although the party’s huge membership and union support put it in a strong financial position without the need for funding from wealthy backers. However, Unite, Labour’s biggest union backer and a major supporter of Corbyn’s leadership, has issued warnings over future funding. The union vehemently opposed the party’s decision to hand a six-figure payout to former staff who blew the whistle on the party’s handling of alleged antisemitism. More lawsuits are believed to be in the pipeline in relation to a leaked internal party report that revealed details of private messages and included names of people who had made official complaints. The report alleged that party staff had worked against the interests of Labour at the 2017 election and even directed money away from the control of Corbyn’s office. In its submission to an inquiry examining the leaking of the report, Unite again issued a warning about future funding. “Unite provided the vast majority of affiliate funding during the 2017 general election,” it states. “Failure to uncover exactly what happened with this secret project, and to take steps to ensure it can never happen again, will prejudice the party’s relationship with its affiliates and no doubt its wider fundraising capacity more generally.” Michael Levy, Labour’s leading fundraiser under Tony Blair, said that the party should consider having a mix of funding from private donors and unions. “It’s very early days, but whereas I would say major donors would have had no interest over this last period, I think there is a real possibility now that they will return to the fold. The party needs to be funded by people who believe in the cause and we need to work closely with the unions. Neither should be mutually exclusive.”"
2020-08-07T17:48:51Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Preston lockdown restrictions tightened amid rise in infections — as it happened,"Preston became the latest part of the north-west of England to have lockdown restrictions tightened following a surge in the infection rate. A ban on households mixing in homes or gardens in large parts of the north is to stay in place for at least another week, and has been extended into Preston from midnight. The reintroduction of restrictions for Preston follow its designation as an â€œarea of interventionâ€� by the government amid a significant rise in cases. The UK added more countries to its quarantine list. The chancellor Rishi Sunak said ministers will â€œnot hesitateâ€� in ordering travellers coming back from countries with high Covid-19 rates to isolate for 14 days, as Belgium, Andorra and the Bahamas lost their exempted status this morning. Travellers returning to the UK from listed nations must enter quarantine, and there are fears those coming back from France could be next, with cases there increasing. The growth rate and R value of coronavirus transmission in the UK has changed slightly since last week â€“ with early indications the value may be increasing, according to figures from Sage. The figures suggest the growth rate was between minus 5% to 0, slightly up from between minus 4% to minus 1% last week. The reproduction number, referred to as R, for the UK as a whole is between 0.8 to 1. In England, the R is between 0.8 and 1, but Sage has indicated it is not confident that R is currently below 1 there. The R value also appears to be close to 1 in all the other regions. Boris Johnson is facing calls to â€œset the record straightâ€� and prove his chief aide Dominic Cummings did not make a second trip to Durham during the lockdown. Labourâ€™s deputy leader Angela Rayner called on Downing Street to publish the evidence the adviser says he has to show he did not make the additional journey during the peak of the coronavirus crisis. A couple say they saw Cummings walking in Houghall Woods on 19 April, the weekend after he had returned to work in London, and have criticised Durham policeâ€™s investigation into the adviser. Pubs in Scotland will be required by law to take customersâ€™ details for contact tracing purposes from next week. Following localised outbreaks in Scotland, including one in Aberdeen where lockdown restrictions were reintroduced on Wednesday, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon said it will be mandatory for hospitality venues - pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants - to collect customer details from Friday 14 August. She said Police Scotland would enforce the measures if necessary. The Independent Sage group called for the UK governmentâ€™s test and trace contract with Serco to be scrapped. Sir David King, the former chief scientific adviser who now leads the group, said the funds should instead be used to support local systems based on existing Public Health England infrastructures. Swimming pools, indoor fitness studios, gyms and leisure centres will be able to reopen from Monday in Wales. The first minister Mark Drakeford confirmed childrenâ€™s indoor play areas will also be able to open their doors as part of the latest changes to Walesâ€™s coronavirus regulations, however, areas such as ball pits, which cannot be easily cleaned, should remain closed.

2020-08-07T17:22:06Z,politics,Politics,Where the battle lines are being drawn over leaked Labour report,"When Keir Starmer took over as Labour leader in April, it was no secret he was inheriting a party still split down factional lines. But even he might have hoped for more than eight days in the job before the scale and ferocity of the divisions were thrust back into the spotlight. This came with the release of a rambling 860-page internal report on party hostilities, compiled in the final weeks of the Jeremy Corbyn era by anonymous authors and leaked to Sky News and to Novara Media. Ostensibly intended as an annexe to an inquiry into Labour and antisemitism, the report was both broad in scope and clearly intended to present a pro-Corbyn narrative for posterity.
It claimed malcontented staffers in Labour HQ had not just obstructed efforts to combat antisemitism but hampered the leadership, including undermining the 2017 election campaign, potentially depriving Corbyn of a term in Downing Street. It also reproduced messages from staffers’ WhatsApp groups, a number of which were insulting or derisory about Corbyn allies and aides, and in some cases strayed into apparent racism and misogyny. Starmer set up an inquiry to examine both the contents of the report and how it was authored and leaked, which is not expected to report back until next year. While this buys Starmer some time and allows a one-remove distance for any conclusions and consequences, the inquiry has now become the turf for an ongoing proxy war between the opposing wings.
In their joint submission to the process, Corbyn and his former top colleagues spell out their endorsement of the claims made in the leaked report – which most presume was written by the former leader’s allies – including the notion of the undermined election. The response from the officials, some of whom were named in the initial report, is equally vehement: whatever anyone’s feeling about Corbyn, they say, there is simply no evidence to back up the idea that they frustrated the election campaign. There is certainly an argument that any evidence of election-scuppering is circumstantial rather than a smoking gun. While the leaked report does show hostility to Corbyn during the 2017 election, and even dismay among some officials when he did better than expected, there is seemingly no proof of active obstruction. The document does detail occasional confusion as the party debated how ambitious it should be, but the named officials point to other emails showing efforts by the leadership to put resources into seats held by loyalist MPs that then turned out to be safe. More potentially troublesome for the officials are the WhatsApp messages in the report. In their own submission to the inquiry, the officials said any apparent racism or misogyny was down to malevolent editing by the report’s authors. This argument has not impressed some of Labour’s BAME MPs, who were particularly dismayed to see transcribed messages seemingly insulting Diane Abbott, Corbyn’s shadow home secretary and a routine target of political and racist abuse. In turn, the officials say the messages were obtained in breach of data protection rules, and they are taking legal action against the party over this, as well as alleged libel and other complaints. Starmer is no stranger to managing Labour factions. He served as Corbyn’s shadow Brexit secretary for four years and yet still emerged as the anointed leadership candidate of the party’s centre. But there is no easy way through, however considered the response. Corbyn’s supporters are convinced by the election betrayal; many BAME MPs and members want more than just words from Starmer about tackling toxic attitudes at Labour HQ; and the officials are insistent the law will uphold their belief they have been maligned and defamed. If there are any compensations for Starmer, it is that this will likely play out amid the political noise of coronavirus and far enough away from an election that many voters will not notice. • This article was amended on 14 August 2020 to include a reference to Sky News as a recipient of the leaked report."
2020-08-07T17:15:44Z,politics,Politics,Fresh calls for Metropolitan police to investigate Cummings' Durham trip,"The Metropolitan police is facing fresh calls to investigate Dominic Cummings’ decision to leave London for Durham at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. The calls come after the Guardian and the Daily Mirror revealed that Dave and Clare Edwards, two of four people who claim to have seen Cummings on 19 April, have complained to the police watchdog, accusing the Durham force of not fully investigating their claims.
Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the public accounts committee, said: “There is also more evidence now that the police should look into, Durham police and, given the alleged travel from London, the Met police too.” Under questioning from Hillier at the liaison committee in May, Boris Johnson said he had seen evidence that proves his chief adviser did not make a second trip to Durham in April, as four witness have now claimed. But he refused to agree to release it to the cabinet secretary for independent verification. Cummings previously claimed that an allegation that he was in Durham on 19 April was false and that he had evidence to prove he was in London that day. On Wednesday Downing Street said it considers the matter closed. Hillier said: “If the PM just publishes the evidence he’s seen there would be no need for police time to be spent on this – the PM should put truth and public trust first and publish what he’s seen.” Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: “The public have a right to know whether the prime minister’s chief adviser made a second lockdown-breaching trip to Durham, and it is surely therefore only right that this evidence is produced.” She added: “If Dominic Cummings was in London during both the morning and afternoon of the 19 April, and not in Durham as has been alleged, I’m sure that the prime minister will welcome this opportunity to set the record straight.” The London assembly has also called on the Met to investigate Cummings. A detective-led inquiry in Durham found Cummings probably breached health protection rules by travelling to Barnard Castle on 12 April, but it made no finding on his decision to leave London because the three-day investigation was confined to County Durham. Unmesh Desai, the Labour assembly member who chairs city hall’s police and crime committee, said that new allegations “have come to light about Dominic Cummings’ movements during the lockdown which raise a number of unresolved issues. As Durham police is itself the subject of criticism and complaints, it is only logical that Cummings’ own police force, the Met, now investigates this matter, and answers legitimate questions from the public.” One of the other witnesses who originally complained to Durham police about seeing Cummings on his first trip to the north-east lockdown, has also called on the Met to investigate. The witness, who does not wish to be named, has written to Met commissioner Cressida Dick, saying there were a number of unanswered questions about why Cummings left his home when his wife was sick with suspected coronavirus. The witness said: “Durham police seem to have left all these questions open – if they were fully investigated it would help restore public confidence in officials at a time when compliance with the regulations is still critical.” Last month, the Met refused to investigate Cummings following a request by Nazir Afzal, the former chief prosecutor for north-west England. On Friday night, the force said: “As a matter of course the Metropolitan police service is not investigating Covid guidance-related issues retrospectively.” Afzal said the latest claims about Cummings’ movements underlined the need for a thorough investigation. He said: “My legal team and I have been sighted on these allegations and have no reason to disbelieve the clear, coherent and corroborative accounts from these witnesses. Mr Cummings stated that he was not in Durham at any time on the 19th, he and these witnesses cannot both be right. The failure of the police to investigate remains very disappointing given the public interest and concern.” Joy Allen, Labour’s candidate to become Durham’s police and crime commissioner (PCC) next year, has urged the force to check number plate data on Cummings’ movements on 19 April. She said: “Obviously PCCs can’t get involved in operational matters but, if I was Clare and Dave Edwards’ elected representative I would wholeheartedly support their request to review ANPR [automatic number plate recognition] data for that weekend to settle the matter once and for all.”"
2020-08-07T16:54:24Z,politics,Politics,Jeremy Corbyn accuses Labour officials of sabotaging election campaign,"Jeremy Corbyn and his former leadership team have openly accused disgruntled Labour officials of potentially costing the party the chance of victory by sabotaging the 2017 election campaign in a factional dispute. In a joint statement that shines a light on the scale of continued Labour splits, Corbyn, the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and seven other former shadow ministers and aides have for the first time formally endorsed claims made in a party report leaked in April.
In their submission to the party inquiry called to examine the leaked report, Corbyn and his former colleagues claimed the alleged diversion of some party funds during the 2017 election could even constitute fraud. The former opposition leader and his team said there was overwhelming evidence of sabotage from certain staffers in Labour headquarters. The officials, who are not named, were uncooperative and refused to allocate resources to winnable target seats, the submission said. Given Labour’s narrow loss in 2017, they argued: “It’s not impossible that Jeremy Corbyn might now be in his third year as a Labour prime minister were it not for the unauthorised, unilateral action taken by a handful of senior party officials.” The narrative is vehemently opposed by the officials concerned, one of whom called it “a mythical ‘stab in the back’ conspiracy theory to absolve themselves”, adding that all spending was legitimate, declared and accounted for. The row erupted when the 860-page internal party report, authored anonymously, was leaked to the media in April, shortly after Keir Starmer took over from Corbyn. It claimed that as well as undermining the 2017 election, internal opponents of Corbyn hampered efforts to tackle antisemitism within Labour, and it quoted WhatsApp messages from party officials insulting his allies, some with apparently racist or sexist overtones. Starmer set up the inquiry under lawyer Martin Forde QC. It had a deadline of Friday for accepting initial evidence. Corbyn’s claims, seen by the Guardian, are made jointly with Labour’s 2017 election committee, also comprising McDonnell, the former shadow ministers Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery, and five senior aides to Corbyn at the time: Karie Murphy, Seumas Milne, Andrew Fisher, Andrew Murray and Steve Howell. The claim that hostile Labour officials jeopardised the 2017 election campaign has caused fury among Corbyn’s supporters. His joint submission said: “We believe that there is clear evidence of factional activity by senior paid employees of the party against the elected leadership of the time.” They allege that in 2017 hostile officials set up a “shadow operation” in a Westminster office as part of efforts to plot their own election course, which included starving potential target seats of money and focusing resources on MPs not allied to Corbyn. If claims in the report of significant sums of money being spent on such actions without authority are correct, then the inquiry must consider “whether it may have constituted fraudulent activity”, the submission said. More generally, the joint statement condemns what it calls a “toxic culture” at Labour headquarters, saying this is demonstrated by the WhatsApp messages. One of the officials blamed by Corbyn told the Guardian the submission was not true. “The leaked report contains no evidence that party staff did not try and do the best they could to win the 2017 election. Not one piece of actual evidence,” the official said. “Pro-Corbyn staff inspected tens of thousands of former staff emails in January 2020 to try and find evidence of their ridiculous conspiracy theory. They found nothing because it is not real. They are trying to build a mythical ‘stab in the back’ conspiracy theory to absolve themselves of the consequences of their incompetence.” In contrast, the official said, there were emails showing Corbyn’s team tried to push election resources in 2017 towards protecting loyalist MPs in safe seats, at the expense of marginal constituencies. The Guardian has separately seen the formal submission to the inquiry by the officials accused of sabotage. They allege that the leaked report misused their WhatsApp messages to falsely make them seem racist and sexist, and confirm they are suing Labour for data protection breaches and libel over the document. Mark Lewis of Patron Law, who is representing some of the Labour officials, said: “It would not be appropriate to make comment at this stage. The matters are before the Forde inquiry and will be the subject of litigation.”
The Corbyn document also talks about a general “daily hostility and obstruction” by officials towards the then leader and his team. In a separate submission to the inquiry, a former Labour press officer and adviser to McDonnell made similar allegations. Joe Ryle said he witnessed a “constant battle” with Labour HQ over appointing staff, and routine briefings to the media against Corbyn. In his submission, also seen by the Guardian, Ryle wrote: “Work colleagues of mine would regularly turn up to meetings with party staff and by the time they got back to their desks the contents of the meeting had already been leaked to journalists.”"
2020-08-07T14:50:59Z,politics,Politics,"Two stories, different witnesses. So where was Dominic Cummings on 19 April?","The official version is Cummings’s own, and places him squarely in London. While the prime minister’s chief aide notoriously acknowledged a trip to Durham in late March, his denial of a second visit days after he returned was unequivocal. On a sunny afternoon in the Downing Street rose garden, he insisted the witness who said they had seen him admiring bluebells in Houghall woods was wrong, and he had the evidence. “Photos and data on my phone prove this to be false,” he said. “And local CCTV, if it exists, would also prove that I’m telling the truth that I was in London on that day. I was not in Durham.” Cummings has not wavered from that line, and the prime minister later said he had seen evidence himself. A witness in London has now come forward to support that story, telling the Guardian they saw Cummings with his family on Hampstead Heath on the Sunday afternoon. Case closed? Not quite. Since then, three other people have set out their own version of events. Like the first witness, who came forward in May, they say they saw Cummings in Houghall woods near Durham that morning, and say they are as sure as they can be it was him – but would accept they saw a lookalike if he showed them the proof. “It would be great to see if he could produce anything,” said Clare Edwards, 59, a nurse practitioner. “I just want the truth to be out there.” But even as those two stories conflict, the only people with the power to reconcile them appear reluctant to do so. When Downing Street was asked by the Guardian to produce the phone data that Cummings said could prove his story, it declined. Meanwhile, two witnesses who reported their alleged Durham sighting to police say they fear the investigation into their claims was cursory at best. The new accounts bring fresh scrutiny to how Downing Street and police handled the affair – and drag attention back to Cummings’s nightmarish few days in May, culminating in his unprecedented press conference.
Just as Cummings was speaking in the rose garden, Edwards and her husband Dave were making a statement of their own. They had gone to Durham police to report their alleged sighting. And while some of the public fury that Cummings clung on to his job without so much as an apology has abated, the couple are angrier than ever. After they went to the police, officers dismissed the evidence as “insufficient”. However, the couple say that the internal police communications they were shown at their request, under data protection rules, may indicate that the police’s investigation fell short. They have reported Durham constabulary to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct. Clare Edwards said in her statement to police that she saw Cummings just after 11.01am on 19 April – a detail she gave because of a timestamped photo she had taken moments before on her phone. Dave Edwards said the man was among a group of five adults and a child. His wife added: “I’m certainly sure that it was Dominic Cummings.” Durham police said in response: “As outlined in our statement of 28 May, Durham constabulary carried out an investigation into this matter led by a senior detective and found insufficient evidence to support the allegation.” If Boris Johnson had hoped the affair was behind the government, the Edwards’ account – along with those of two other witnesses – is a reminder of the unanswered questions that have lingered since the Guardian and Daily Mirror broke the story in May. There were concerns over the scope of the police investigation, which was confined to Cummings’s movements in County Durham and did not address why he left London in the first place with his sick wife, or whether hours earlier he had breached the rules by going back to work at Downing Street after tending to her. Cummings says he did not stop on the 264-mile drive north at a time when he and his wife were likely to have been infectious. But Durham police and forces along the route have refused requests to verify this. Police have refused to answer many questions about the investigation, referring inquiries to their 393-word press statement. There are other questions, too. Why did Cummings say he had warned about coronavirus last year, when he altered his blog to make it look as if he had? Was there really no one in London he could ask to look after his son, as he claimed? And were there “no taxis” on 3 April when he drove to Durham hospital to pick up the sick child? Taxi firms in the city insist plenty were available.
And is it possible for Cummings to have been seen in Durham and in London on the same same day? The London witness who came forward in support of Cummings’s claim said they saw the aide, his wife and their four-year-old son on Hampstead Heath that Sunday afternoon. The witness provided a distant photograph apparently showing them at 3.31pm in a meadow area on the northern edge of the heath. The last alleged sighting in County Durham was at 11.15-11.30am that day, near the Cummings family farm. A typical journey time between the two spots is more than four hours – but that is in normal traffic. In an attempt to replicate the emptier road conditions of lockdown, the Guardian drove from north London to Durham early on a Sunday morning, and back. Travelling in a 17-year-old Honda Civic, the journey one way was completed in well under four hours. So it is feasible that Cummings could have made the trip in that time in his Land Rover Discovery on the empty roads during lockdown. Such was the furore over the disclosure of his first trip to Durham, it will be difficult for the government to move on fully from the scandal without an adequate explanation. For critics, the episode has become an emblem of the government’s mishandling of the crisis. There is evidence, too, the affair damaged the nation’s unity during lockdown, a charge that may yet haunt ministers if there is a substantial second wave. A No 10 spokesman said: “Durham constabulary have made clear they are not taking any further action against Mr Cummings and that by locating himself at his father’s premises he did not breach the regulations. The prime minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and he considers the matter closed.” There was no comment on specific allegations that Cummings was in Durham on 19 April. With the new witness accounts, the pressure on Cummings and the government to supply phone and photographic evidence only grows. He is facing at least three legal challenges about his movements during the lockdown. In his own words: “I think that people like me who helped make the rules should be accountable for their actions.”"
2020-08-07T11:43:11Z,politics,Politics,Why are indoor settings higher risk for Covid – and are restaurants safe?,"In Aberdeen it was pubs, restaurants and golf courses. In Prague it was a nightclub. In California it was a church. Why does Covid-19 appear to spread more easily in some places than others? Prof Devi Sridhar, the chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, says there are some key factors that make indoor settings higher risk, in particular poor airflow, difficulties in distancing from others, and prolonged exposure. According to a study published in June by researchers including Dr Sebastian Funk of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, most clusters of infection are linked to indoor settings ranging from factories to shopping areas. The research also suggested that some settings may have particular risks: for example, in meat-packing factories the chilly climate, prolonged close proximity of workers and the need to shout over the noise of the machines may have increased the risk of transmission. Similarly, a research paper from Japan noted: “Many Covid-19 clusters were associated with heavy breathing in close proximity, such as singing at karaoke parties, cheering at clubs, having conversations in bars, and exercising in gymnasiums.” Meanwhile, the UK government is encouraging diners to return to restaurants through the “eat out to help out scheme”. How concerned should we be? According to data from the Office for National Statistics, nearly four in 10 adults (37%) said they would feel comfortable or very comfortable eating indoors at a restaurant this week, up slightly from 34% last week. Of the 92% of survey respondents who went out in the seven days to 2 August, one in five went to eat or drink at a restaurant, cafe, bar or pub. “Pubs and bars are quite high risk: it goes back to the conditions inside – poor ventilation and a crowded setting,” says Sridhar, adding that there is growing concern about the extent to which Covid-19 may be spread by fine particles known as aerosols as well as larger respiratory droplets. Clusters have been linked to restaurants, including a case in China where it has been suggested that droplets were blown between tables by the air conditioning. “It’s probably going to depend a bit on your ventilation and airflow, but I think a crowded restaurant is not a good idea,” Sridhar says. “Anything that is outdoors, even outdoor hospitality, I am quite relaxed about, especially if there is a breeze.” . Identifying the source of an outbreak is hindered by weaknesses in the current tracing systems in the UK . “We don’t currently do backward contact tracing on each case, so we don’t routinely know where each case picked up their infection,” says Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “Public Health England investigate the complex cases – these are the ones that are linked with an institution such as a workplace, school or care home. However, for the rest of the cases – the majority of them – we have rather poor information as to where they might have been infected. This obviously hinders evidence-based decision-making about how best to organise local restrictions when there is a community flare-up.” Funk says understanding where and how infections occur is important as it could make it easier to trace cases, advise the public where they may need to take extra precautions such as wearing face coverings, and decide what measures to take should an outbreak occur. For example, there have been few recorded outbreaks in schools. Funk says this may be because children are less likely to show Covid-19 symptoms than adults, meaning clusters may not be picked up. “Kids don’t get very ill if and when they get infected. What we don’t know is whether they also have a lower chance of getting infected and whether they are also not as good at transmitting the virus as others.” Dr William Hanage, a professor of the evolution and epidemiology of infectious disease at Harvard University, says more information on effective ways to prevent transmission is helpful, but he stresses that outbreaks tend to occur because of similar factors. “It doesn’t take much digging to find examples of outbreaks in all kinds of places, and there’s a tendency to cherry-pick from them according to political priorities. But it is a mistake to fixate on a single outbreak, and better to recognise that they become more likely whenever people gather together indoors in poorly ventilated spaces.” The key issue, he adds, is the degree to which authorities try to prevent or encourage such gatherings. “I don’t understand how the British government maintains the cognitive dissonance required to suggest that relaxing restrictions in Europe leads to ‘second waves’ while encouraging British people to go to work or school or pubs will not have a similar impact.”"
2020-08-07T09:55:54Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: UK government pledges £355m to cushion Northern Ireland businesses,"The UK government has announced a £355m package to cushion Northern Ireland businesses from the costs of trading with the rest of the UK because of Brexit. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said on Friday £200m would be spent on a trader support service (TSS) to help firms handle new bureaucracy to move goods across the Irish Sea, turning the government into a de facto customs agent for traders. A further £155m will be spent on digital technology to streamline processes required by the new internal border created by the Northern Irish protocol, part of the Brexit deal that aligns the region to the UK customs territory and the EU customs code. It means all businesses sending goods to the region from Great Britain will have to make formal declarations for the first time. First details of the new trading conditions across the Irish Sea emerged last month, with businesses obliged to complete customs, security and transit forms on all goods being transported to Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, was accused of misleading the public about the Brexit deal last November after footage emerged of him telling exporters in Northern Ireland they would not need to fill in extra paperwork. Downing Street continues to insist Northern Ireland will have unfettered access to markets in Great Britain.
Gove, who is to visit Belfast on Friday, will also announce £300m in funding for the Peace Plus programme, which promotes peace, prosperity and reconciliation on the island of Ireland. “Today’s £650m investment underlines our absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period.” Gove, who as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is de facto deputy prime minister, added: “As we continue to engage with businesses, and our discussions with the EU proceed, we will update these resources to ensure that traders are ready for the end of the transition period.” The trader support scheme, which is to start next month, will give free advice to companies and complete import declarations on their behalf, passing the administrative burden to officials and the taxpayer. Business leaders welcomed the supports as significant but said more help would be needed. “We’ve consistently said for a long time that the government should help with the cost of transition, because we’re facing the biggest change in how we move goods between GB and Northern Ireland in a lifetime and the burden of that shouldn’t fall on the shoulders on businesses here,” Seamus Leheny ,of the Freight Transport Association, told the BBC. Aodhán Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said the supports would help ease trade frictions but said the timeline was ambitious, details remained unclear and funding would need to be replenished. “This is finite. What happens when the money runs out?”"
2020-08-06T22:30:20Z,politics,Politics,The Cummings effect: study finds public faith was lost after aide's trip,"There was a clear and lasting “Cummings effect” on public confidence in the government’s handling of coronavirus after the prime minister’s senior aide appeared to break lockdown rules, new analysis has found. The research found a significant decrease in public confidence in the government after the Guardian and Daily Mirror revealed that Dominic Cummings had travelled 264 miles to Durham with his sick wife and child despite official advice that people “should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home”. The University College London paper, published in the Lancet, tracked more than 40,000 people’s views of the government’s approach to the epidemic over a six-week period. It also found that over the three weeks following the Cummings revelations, willingness to adhere to lockdown guidelines dropped more steeply in England than in Scotland and Wales. The data from UCL’s Covid-19 Social Study, which has not been peer reviewed, forms the most substantial evidence yet to back fears that Cummings’ actions – and the failure of Boris Johnson to remove him from his post – led to a sharp decline in faith in the official response to the crisis. The researchers asked respondents to rate their confidence in the government’s handling of pandemic on a scale from seven – lots of confidence – to one – no confidence. Before Cummings’ behaviour was exposed on 22 May the average score was 5, but it dropped to nearer 4.5 in England in the days afterwards. This was the sharpest drop in confidence recorded in the study. And there was no evidence of similar falls in Scotland and Wales on the same dates.
Considering the factors in the impact of Cummings’ behaviour compared with other high-profile lockdown breaches, the Lancet piece notes: “Although some other officials and senior figures had also broken the lockdown rules, this transgression was the first to not immediately be followed by an apology and resignation.” Dr Daisy Fancourt, lead author of the study, said that “public trust in the government’s ability to manage the pandemic is crucial as it underpins public attitudes and behaviours at a precarious time for public health”. She said that the change of 0.4 points on the study’s seven-point scale signified a significant dip in public support – in particular because it has proven to be lasting. “The thing in my mind is it’s the biggest step change without a rebound across the whole period,” she said. “There are other things, like the 10 May announcement that lockdown would be eased, which has a negative effect – but it started to bounce back within a week or two. Whereas with the Cummings incident, it’s a dramatic change, and it’s just continued.” That analysis echoes warnings from politicians, scientists and police leaders that Cummings’ behaviour and the subsequent lack of police action was being used as an excuse by those who were not following lockdown rules.
“People were actually using the word ‘Cummings’ in encounters with the police to justify antisocial behaviour,” Durham’s former chief constable Mike Barton said in July. “If the public don’t think the police are operating in a fair and impartial way, you won’t get their trust and you won’t get their support. People who make the rules shouldn’t break them. Otherwise, you can’t expect the little people to do it,” he said. Stephen Reicher, a professor of psychology at the University of St Andrews and a participant in the SPI-B governmental advisory group, said in May: “The notion of ‘a law for them and a law for us’ is about the clearest way that you can violate that bond of common identity and that bond of trust between the public and the authorities.” The UCL researchers ruled out the possibility that the “Cummings effect” was simply part of a wider decline in public faith in the authorities by comparing the answers of participants in England with those in Scotland and Wales. Scottish and Welsh respondents’ faith in their devolved governments did not show a similar decline.
Meanwhile, public confidence in the health service and confidence in the supply of essentials also saw no drop. The new research follows previous snapshots of evidence suggesting that the Cummings incident had a meaningful effect on public adherence to lockdown rules. Last week researchers said that focus group respondents had attributed a growing sense of public division to the saga, with one saying that because of Cummings “the vast majority of people see it as one rule for those in charge and one rule for everyone else”. A YouGov survey found that of those who had broken lockdown rules, one in three gave the Cummings story as a justification for their decision. The polling also found that 70% of people thought the incident would make life harder for the government to get future lockdown messaging across."
2020-08-06T18:06:50Z,politics,Politics,Affordable housing 'will diminish due to UK planning changes',"Big changes to the planning system that provides nearly half of England’s affordable housing were criticised on Thursday as “potentially disastrous”, as moves to radically overhaul planning also created unease among some in the Conservative ranks. Changes envisaged in a long awaited White Paper published on Thursday were criticised by the umbrella body for London councils, which joined others in warning that the amount of new affordable housing could be reduced. A fresh spotlight also fell on the Tory party’s relationship with developers as Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, found himself once again on the defensive over a recent personal controversy involving the billionaire Richard Desmond. The publication of Planning for the Future, a plan aimed at delivering a target of 300,000 new homes a year in England, kickstarted a 12-week consultation process.
Details revealed included a measure to exempt developers of smaller sites from payments to local infrastructure such as affordable housing and schools. The fees, called Section 106 payments, are often a condition for permission being granted but the proposals envisage temporarily lifting a “small sites threshold”, below which developers will not need to contribute to affordable housing, to up to 40 or 50 units. A new national levy would replace the system of developer contributions and be charged according to the final development value of the project. Insisting that more social housing would be the outcome, Boris Johnson told reporters on a visit to a housing development in Warrington: “This solution gives [builders] a much simpler infrastructure levy that enables them to go ahead and build a much bigger chunk of affordable housing and help people on to the property ladder.” But the National Housing Federation called for clarity on what would replace the Section 106 agreements, which last year delivered almost 28,000 affordable homes, about half of the total. Kate Henderson, the chief executive, questioned how a replacement national levy would enable the “levelling up” of communities. The local government association for Greater London warned that the changes were potentially disastrous and could reduce the amount of affordable housing built. “London is suffering the most severe homelessness crisis in the country and the chronic shortage of affordable housing is at the heart of this,” said Darren Rodwell, executive member for housing and planning at London Councils. He also warned that lower-quality and fewer affordable homes could arise from a “planning free-for-all”, as critics rounded on the plans for new homes, hospitals and schools to be allowed automatically in areas designated for “growth”.. Jenrick dismissed allegations that the proposals to speed up building could create a new generation of low-quality homes, calling them “complete nonsense”. He insisted local people would be able to make “a meaningful contribution”, despite confirming there was nothing that could be done to halt disliked projects in areas zoned for growth. Jenrick again admitted that he wished he had not sat next to the developer Desmond at an event which subsequently saw him embroiled in controversy this year. The tycoon donated £12,000 to the Tories after a new housing development was given a green light by Jenrick the day before a new community infrastructure levy was introduced. In court, the housing minister accepted that his decision was “unlawful by reason of apparent bias”. Labour sought to apply fresh fire to Jenrick on Thursday over the controversy, alleging he was “supremely arrogant to think he has any moral authority to lead these reforms, which put power in the hands of the developers that bankroll the Conservative party”. Steve Reed MP, the shadow secretary of state for communities and local government, said: “Robert Jenrick moved heaven and earth to help a multi-billionaire Tory donor, Richard Desmond, avoid paying vital infrastructure funding to one of the most deprived boroughs in the country – now he wants to legislate to prevent more of the Tories’ developer friends from paying their dues.” Jenrick told BBC Radio 4 he had no idea how much property developers had donated to the Tories in the past year. An investigation by Open Democracy found the party had received more than £11m from some of the UK’s richest property developers since Johnson became prime minister. Also flagged in the newly published document are proposals to fast-track buildings considered “beautiful”. A new body would be set up to help deliver design codes at a local level in line with the work of the late Conservative philosopher Sir Roger Scruton. But the Tory MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, who represents the Cotswolds, said he was concerned about the quality of new homes which could be built. He told BBC Radio 4’s World At One: “Whilst I’m all in favour of building more houses they need to be good-quality houses, we have got to be really sure that we are not building slums of tomorrow by building today at low quality.” Bob Colenutt, a housing expert, also suggested that new red tape might be produced with the addition of the administrative criterion of “beauty”. He added: “The design codes will be front loaded, so consultations take place at the outset, with local people having little chance to change them then over a 10-year period. It purports to create more democracy but actually it reduces it.” Other proposals promise to make greater use of technology to give individuals and neighbourhoods a greater say in the planning process, such as by standardising plans and applications and making them easy to access on smartphones. There was a warm welcome from the National Federation of Builders (NFB), which said the moves vindicated its evidence and solutions. Rico Wojtulewicz, of the NFB’s housing building division, said: “For the last five years we have campaigned for design codes, flat-rate planning contributions, better land assembly, especially through Homes England, digitised planning, a greater appreciation of what the best builders, our SMEs, deliver, and a certain planning system. This consultation delivers all that and more.”"
2020-08-06T18:00:14Z,politics,Politics,"Prove Dominic Cummings did not make second Durham trip, No 10 urged","Downing Street has been urged to provide proof that Dominic Cummings did not make a second trip to Durham during lockdown amid claims that police failed to properly investigate alleged sightings of the prime minister’s chief aide. Two of four people who claim to have seen Cummings on what would have been a second visit to the north-east of England have complained to the police watchdog, accusing the Durham force of not fully probing their claims. Cummings has consistently denied returning to Durham on 19 April, days after he came back to London from a trip that was subsequently exposed in a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Daily Mirror. The prime minister’s chief adviser has said that phone data and potentially CCTV would prove he was in London – and the Guardian has been told of one sighting of him on Hampstead Heath that afternoon. However, neither he nor Downing Street has gone public with the evidence they say they have – and which Boris Johnson says he has seen – and pressure is mounting again for full transparency to answer lingering questions about his movements. Cummings’ initial trip to Durham caused widespread uproar and is cited as one of the chief reasons for the public losing faith in the government’s handling of the crisis. Clare Edwards, a nurse practitioner, and her husband, Dave, say they saw a man they believe to have been Cummings on 19 April just after 11am in Houghall woods on the edge of Durham.
On 25 May they gave statements to police about the alleged sighting, just as Cummings was giving a press conference in Downing Street denying a claim by another witness that he was seen admiring bluebells with his wife in the same woods on 19 April, at about 8.30am. Since then, a fourth witness has alleged they saw the No 10 aide and a companion in between the woods and the home of Cummings’ parents that day, between 11.15am and 11.30am. A further witness told the Guardian that they saw Cummings back in north London, on Hampstead Heath, later the same afternoon. Durham police found “insufficient evidence” that Cummings was in Durham on 19 April. Following that assessment, Clare and Dave Edwards, both 59, made a subject access request under the Data Protection Act, asking the force to show them all the personal information it had about them as a result of their complaint, which they hoped might reveal how it was followed up. Most of the police correspondence about their original complaints was redacted and labelled “official – sensitive”. All pre-dated the statements given to police, which Dave Edwards suggests means the police did nothing more with those statements. Edwards said he believed the results, returned last week, suggested that their testimony was not taken seriously. On Wednesday the couple complained to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. They said: “Given the high-profile nature of this issue, it is inconceivable that this matter has not been followed up thoroughly. We have no personal issue with Mr Cummings or his family, but we do feel that Durham police’s handling of our complaint is below the standard we would expect from our local constabulary.” The Edwardses asked whether officers checked automatic number recognition cameras for the movements of Cummings’ car that weekend. This information would not typically be revealed under a subject access request, and the force did not answer. Dave Edwards, who works for a manufacturing company that supplied some of the Nightingale hospitals, remains convinced that he saw Cummings among a group of five adults and a child. “He was the dead image of Dominic Cummings. He was standing over a small child on a bike. As I got through the clearing, I said to my wife: ‘Did you see Dominic Cummings there?’ “He was identical to the TV footage: dark beanie hat, dark-rimmed glasses. If it was mistaken identity, the police could have ruled that out. If Cummings had the evidence, it would be very easy for him to say: ‘Here I am in Costa coffee in London at 10am on 19 April,’ or whatever, ‘so I couldn’t have been in Houghall woods.’ “I’m not politically motivated, I have nothing against Cummings. But we think what we saw was important given the circumstances of the lockdown, and we feel that our complaint has been airbrushed.” Clare Edwards said: “I’m certainly sure that it was Dominic Cummings.” In her statement to officers, she said she saw a man she thought to be Cummings just after 11.01am on 19 April. She said she was able to be precise after finding a timestamped geolocated photograph she took of the woods moments before seeing the man. The couple remember the date because they had a Zoom party and quiz for their son’s birthday the day before as they were not allowed to meet due to the lockdown restrictions. Clare Edwards also called on Cummings to release evidence proving he was in London at the time. A fourth witness, who does not want to be named, is convinced that they saw Cummings and a companion between 11.15am and 11.30am that day, between Houghall woods and Cummings’ father’s property. They made a digital note of the sighting, including location data, which was shared with friends at the time. That note has been seen by the Guardian and Daily Mirror. The witness said: “I do follow politics, so I know what people look like.” Asked whether they were sure it was Cummings, they said: “We know his parents do live locally, so we have recognised them before in the local area. I would recognise him again. At first I could not quite believe that I had seen him. I thought: ‘Why would he be up here?’ But I posted about it on the day. I was sure about it at the time.” A No 10 spokesman said: “Durham constabulary have made clear they are not taking any further action against Mr Cummings and that by locating himself at his father’s premises he did not breach the regulations. “The prime minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and he considers the matter closed.” No 10 did not comment on specific allegations that Cummings was in Durham on 19 April. Cummings has defended driving to his parents’ farm from London on 27 March after fearing that he and his wife were falling ill with coronavirus, to seek potential childcare for their four-year-old son. They made a 60-mile round trip to Barnard Castle on 12 April – Cummings said to test his eyesight – and drove back to London the following day. At his press conference in the Downing Street rose garden in May, he said it was false to claim he returned to Durham again after coming back to London on 13 April. He said: “There is a particular report that I returned there on the 19 April. Photos and data on my phone prove this to be false. And local CCTV, if it exists, would also prove that I’m telling the truth that I was in London on that day. I was not in Durham.” Cummings said witnesses who claimed they saw him in the bluebell wood on 19 April were mistaken. He said he had walked in woodland during his self-isolation period, but only on his father’s property. At the end of May, the prime minister was challenged by the Commons liaison committee about whether he had seen the evidence. After dodging the question three times, he said he had, but refused MPs’ requests to publish the evidence or pass it to the cabinet secretary for independent scrutiny. The Guardian asked Downing Street to provide the data to rule out a case of mistaken identity on 19 April, but it declined. A Durham police spokesman said: “As outlined in our statement of 28 May, Durham constabulary carried out an investigation into this matter led by a senior detective and found insufficient evidence to support the allegation.” • Additional reporting by Duncan Campbell"
2020-08-06T16:47:42Z,politics,Politics,Labour report 'misused private messages to portray party members as racist',"Labour staffers named in a leaked internal party report that claimed to show their private hostility to Jeremy Corbyn have alleged that the document misused private messages to falsely make them seem racist and sexist, an inquiry has been told. It has also been confirmed that officials accused in the report of insulting pro-Corbyn colleagues in WhatsApp groups are seeking damages from the party for misuse of data and libel, among other complaints. The leaked 860-page report emerged in April, just after Keir Starmer became Labour leader, reigniting party splits by claiming that Corbyn’s chances of success were scuppered by disgruntled party elements. Authored anonymously in the final months of Corbyn’s tenure, the report said opponents hampered his efforts to tackle antisemitism in the party, and cited WhatsApp messages insulting Corbyn’s allies. Some of the messages had apparent racist or sexist overtones, prompting disquiet among some of the party’s BAME members. Starmer has set up an inquiry led by Martin Forde QC to investigate both the claims in the report and how it was produced and leaked. In a formal submission to the inquiry, seen by the Guardian, lawyers for the accused officials say the WhatsApp messages were used selectively and edited to give a false impression. They also say the inquiry should be abandoned given the damage already caused by the leaked report. The 11-page submission claims that some WhatsApp messages sent months apart were joined together to create a false narrative, and others were removed, “so that by such editing a deliberately false impression that racist and misogynistic conversations had taken place”. It says the unnamed authors of the leaked report should not have had access to the WhatsApp messages, adding that one member of the WhatsApp group accidentally backed them up via their Labour email, and that a data misuse complaint is with the Information Commissioner’s Office. The leaked report also selectively ignores many thousands of other messages that do not back up a narrative of factionalism or prejudice, the lawyers write. They say the officials plan to take legal action against Labour over data protection issues and libel as well invasion of privacy and, for some staffers, breach of contract and employment, and will seek substantial damages. The party has recently paid significant damages to seven former party workers who spoke to the BBC’s Panorama programme about antisemitism in the party under Labour, who were accused of being anti-Corbyn, and it is braced for similar claims. Claudia Webbe, the Leicester East MP who oversaw Labour’s disputes panel under Corbyn, condemned what she called a playing down of the content of the WhatsApp messages. She said: “It’s disgraceful that anyone would attempt to justify racism towards black Labour MPs and misogyny towards women employees, which has driven many of our members, particularly BAME members, to leave our party in disgust. “If former officials thought quotes in the report – which are clearly copied and pasted from WhatsApp – were misleading, they would welcome the Forde inquiry having the chance to see the full texts. Instead, they seem to want to stop the inquiry from looking at the evidence because they fear it will confirm the accuracy of the WhatsApp messages.” One former Labour staffer said: “I don’t see how it’s possible for so many extracts to seem racist or sexist when that wasn’t their meaning, especially when discussions are quoted in full. “I’m sure if they want to show they were actually condemning racism, sexism and not obsessed with an imaginary war against ‘Trots’, they’ll publish their chats in full.” Another key claim made in the report, that disgruntled, anti-Corbyn officials sought to undermine the party’s chances in the 2017 election, is also dismissed as “simply is not true”. Calling for the inquiry to be scrapped, it says: “If the inquiry finds (as it must) that the leak was unlawful, then the inquiry should not have been instigated at all.” A spokeswoman for the Forde inquiry said: “The panel cannot comment on the investigation while it is ongoing.” The Labour party was contacted for comment."
2020-08-06T15:38:24Z,politics,Politics,"Trust me on housing, said Honest Bob Jenrick. Only it turned out nobody did | John Crace","Robert Jenrick has the Midas touch when it comes to house planning. Back in 2013, before Honest Bob became a Tory MP, he twice had planning permission refused to turn the roof terrace of his £2.5m London townhouse into an extra bedroom on the grounds that the extension would damage the character and appearance of the building and conservation area. Miraculously, just weeks after he was elected to the safe seat of Newark in a byelection, the planning permission – this time under his wife’s name – was pushed through with the help of Conservative councillors. Truly, the Lord works in mysterious ways. Since then, Honest Bob has effortlessly worked his way up the ranks of the Tory party, despite showing no obvious talent for anything except an air of excessive entitlement. He is a man who seems to have taken success as his birthright. He doesn’t know quite why he is so lucky, but then he’s never needed the self-awareness to ask himself the question. He lives, therefore he gets. Just about the only person not surprised to have found himself in the cabinet as minister for housing, communities and local government is himself. And it’s in this role that he has published a white paper that will transform the planning process. Only not for the better. Not that this is how Jenrick sees it. Despite the fact that 90% of planning permissions are granted – some 370,000 last year – and more than 1 million houses with planning consent remaining unbuilt, Honest Bob believes that the current system is broken. What is needed to provide the homes and infrastructure the country requires is a three-tier zoning system. A growth zone where pretty much anything can be built regardless of whether anyone likes it or not. A renewal zone where pretty much anything can be built providing local people have agreed on the colour of the brickwork. And a protected zone to stop any development anywhere near his third home, a listed manor house in Herefordshire.
Predictably, Honest Bob was upbeat and bullish as he went out on the morning media round to sell his proposals to a sceptical public. Then, he always is. He isn’t a man used to being challenged. So the government white paper, dreamed up by his 10-year-old assistant Jack Airey, would cut through all the blockages and Nimbyism created by the Attlee government – no chance to slag off a Labour government was to be missed, even one of the 1940s – to allow new homes to be built.
All talk of a bonfire of the regulations and an assault on local democracy was just scaremongering. For a start, it was obvious that developers would be desperate to build their fair share of affordable homes. It merely depended on your interpretation of the word “affordable”. To characterise developers as being interested only in getting the maximum return on their investment was a gross calumny. Most wanted nothing more than to build well-appointed new homes for people working on the minimum wage. The very idea that developers might try to get round any regulations by knocking up some box-like, slum dwellings in growth areas was unthinkable. Mainly because the regulations that were in place were being removed, so there would be none to get round. Though the government might think about reinstating some of the regulations being abolished, such as the community infrastructure levy, if some developers started to take the piss. But that was something for the long grass. And it was nonsense to suggest that local people would no longer have a say in what got built in their area. Providing they weren’t stupid enough to live in growth zones, in which case they deserved any monstrosities they got. As for people living in renewal zones, they were also being done a huge favour because they would have 30 months to think about all the things they could possibly dislike for the rest of their lives – and then would be free to forget about them. So if a building that no one had dreamed of got proposed, then tough. “Trust me,” said Honest Bob, his voice the liquid honey of someone who expects to be believed.
Only it turned out that Nick Robinson, on Radio 4’s Today programme, didn’t necessarily trust him. Didn’t Honest Bob have form? Hadn’t he sat at the same dinner table as Richard “Dirty” Desmond at a Tory fundraising dinner? And hadn’t Dirty Des showed him a video of his Westferry development proposal? And hadn’t Honest Bob given the development – despite the objections of the local council – the green light the day before Dirty Des would have had to fork out £40m for infrastructure projects? And hadn’t his decision later been deemed unlawful. So what bit of Jenrick’s planning proposals were we supposed to have faith in? “So what did you learn from the Westferry affair?” Robinson asked. For the first time all morning, Jenrick sounded distinctly ruffled. Er … he wouldn’t sit at the same table as a developer with an outstanding planning application, he said, conveniently overlooking the fact that was precisely what he had done. And he certainly wouldn’t do business with someone who was only going to donate £12k to the party. And he also wouldn’t swap text messages with Dirty Des again. Next time it would all be done via WhatsApp. Far harder to trace. “Do you know how much property developers have donated to the Tory party in the past year?” Robinson persisted. Honest Bob pretended not to hear him. So Robinson answered for him: £11m. Jenrick ignored him again. He wasn’t used to being spoken to like that and he would make sure it never happened again. Didn’t anyone at the BBC know who he was? As it happened, they did."
2020-08-06T15:05:46Z,politics,Politics,Why England's planning overhaul has sparked an outcry,"A once-in-a-generation transformation of planning law has been unveiled by the government as it launched a 12-week consultation on its Planning for the Future white paper. But the proposals, which promise to “replace the entire corpus of plan-making law”, have sparked an outcry. Here are some of the details and areas of controversy: ‘Streamlining’ of planning and three categories of land Substantial development will take place in “growth” areas, where approval would be secured automatically if specific types of developments are chosen based on locally drawn-up design codes. The other categories are “renewal” areas, where some development such as “gentle densification” can take place, and “protected”, where development is restricted. Local plans, the documents that planning authorities create to guide on the future development of the local area, and which are drawn up by the local planning authority, would be simplified and set “rules” rather than general policies. Greater digitisation and standardisation of planning Local plans should be shorter, online and based on a standard template. Councils would be supported to make it easier for people to express their views through social media and via their phones, no longer having to rely on notices on street lamps or trawl through lengthy PDF documents. Critics say this is no longer the case anyway, with most planning applications and documents readily available online. Beauty and standards A “fast-track for beauty” would make it easier for those who want to “build beautifully”, automatically permitting proposals for high-quality developments that reflect local character and preferences. Taking inspiration from the work of the late Conservative philosopher Roger Scruton, a body is to be established to support the delivery of binding “design codes” that would also cut red tape. Critics suggest this is ideological puffery that will have the opposite effect by creating a new administrative criteria and give lawyers a field day arguing over what is beauty. Changes to developer contributions and affordable housing provisions Developers of small sites would be exempt from payments towards local council infrastructure such as schools and affordable housing. This would be done by temporarily lifting the small sites threshold, below which they do not need to contribute to affordable housing, to up to 40 or 50 units. Section 106, the law that enables councils to impose affordable housing on developers, would be axed. The community infrastructure levy, the charge that can be levied by local authorities on development in their area, would also be replaced and the current system of planning obligations would be based on a nationally set, flat-rate charge. An “infrastructure levy” would be introduced, aimed at raising more revenue than under the current system and delivering at least as much on-site affordable housing. Critics view this is a grave erosion of local ability to benefit from the true values of new developments."
2020-08-06T14:34:49Z,politics,Politics,"Planning overhaul in England will damage nature, environmentalists warn","Radical changes to planning rules in England will damage nature, increase air pollution and leave local people with no say on protecting urban wildlife corridors, environmental charities say. Green organisations reacted angrily to the government’s plans to sweep away current planning restrictions and adopt what one NGO said was a “pervasively permissive” approach to development that would leave the environment unprotected.
Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said the carving up of land into growth, renewal and protection zones would leave nature less protected. He said that in zones labelled growth and renewal, existing site specific protections were being weakened, and in the areas reserved for protection there were no new meaningful safeguards for the environment. “There are some positives in these proposals,” said Benwell. “Of course it’s right to enrich data, improve strategic approaches, tree-line every new street and take advantage of new technology, but these improvements would be eclipsed by the damage done to nature by an over-simplified, pervasively permissive approach to development.” Others said the shake-up missed the opportunity to force developers to build carbon-neutral homes to meet help the government’s target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Paul Milner, the acting head of land use planning at the CPRE, said the changes did not enforce this on developers. He said despite the proposals saying streets in new development would have to be tree-lined, the plan “does not cut it for nature”.
“They do not address the real problems with the quality of new housing development,” he said. “Many new and proposed developments are being built on greenfield land in locations where people have to use cars to get around. This is making problems of air pollution worse and also requiring more space for car parking, leading to loss of more valuable habitat.” He said the changes would allow developers to ride roughshod over local community wishes to protect green spaces and improve them for wildlife. The changes come as environmentalists battle to halt a devastating loss of British wildlife. Populations of the UK’s most important species have plummeted by an average of 60% since 1970, according a comprehensive analysis published last year. A quarter of UK mammals and nearly half of the birds assessed are deemed are at risk of extinction, according to the report. The Wildlife Trusts, which represents 46 wildlife charities, said the new planning rules would only make the loss of habitats and species worse. “We live in one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world. The white paper proposes a planning system with three categories of land – earmarked for growth, renewal and protection – but this simplification brings risks of creating a disconnected landscape, one in which wildlife continues to decline because nature doesn’t slot into neat little boxes,” said Nikki Williams, director of campaigning and policy at the trusts. “Protecting isolated fragments of land is not enough to help wildlife recover, nor will it put nature into people’s lives – something that is now recognised as vital for our health and wellbeing.” She said it was essential that local people could have their say. “It is important that the voice of local communities is heard louder than ever, so that affordable housing can be surrounded by wild spaces, clean air and healthier surroundings.”"
2020-08-06T10:48:16Z,politics,Politics,Robert Jenrick says concerns over planning overhaul are 'nonsense',"Warnings that proposals for the biggest shake-up of planning in decades could pave the way for “the next generation of slums” have been described by the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, as “nonsense”. A long-awaited planning white paper was published on Wednesday envisaging land across England being divided into three categories: for growth, renewal or protection. Concerns have been raised that democratic oversight could be diluted and affordable housing cut back. In a round of morning interviews, Jenrick said the proposals would lead to more social housing through a new infrastructure levy and that there would be “a really serious debate” in communities when plans were being produced.
Critics of the proposals laid out in the Planning for the Future document say the measures would in effect strip away a whole layer of scrutiny at local level in which councillors, the public and others take part as applications make their way through the system. Facing criticism from Labour, which labelled the white paper a “developer’s charter”, Jenrick told BBC Radio 4 he had “no idea” how much property developers had donated to the Tories in the past year. “We’re actually asking developers to pay more,” he said. Asked about the Royal Institute of British Architect’s comments that the proposals were “shameful”, he told Sky News: “That I’m afraid is complete nonsense. I saw those comments and they were put out before we’d even published the document.” “Design and quality” would be at the heart of the new process, he told Talk Radio, adding that “every local community” would be able to create their own binding design code to which developers would have to adhere “More money is going to be spent on social infrastructure as a result of these reforms than has been in the past, and a much simpler system,” he said. “These reforms are going to really help smaller builders. This isn’t going to help the big volume house builders, this is designed to help smaller builders … in the market – they’ve declined significantly over the course of the last 20 or 30 years.” The white paper says the new system would “make it easier for those who want to build beautifully through the introduction of a fast-track for beauty through changes to national policy and legislation, to automatically permit proposals for high-quality developments where they reflect local character and preferences”. Areas identified as growth zones and “suitable for substantial development” would automatically be granted “outline planning permission for the principle of development”, it states, while automatic approvals would also be available for pre-established development types in other areas suitable for building. “There will therefore be no need to submit a further planning application to test whether the site can be approved,” the document says. The policy director of the Town and Country Planning Association called on the government to provide evidence of how the current planning system was “desperately broken”. Hugh Ellis told the Today programme: “Change is a good thing to planning, there’s no doubt about that, but the most important thing is that people’s voice is not going to be enhanced, this is not a democratisation of planning and that is really troubling to us.” The shadow housing minister Mike Amesbury said: “This is a developer’s charter that will see communities sidelined in decisions and denied vital funding for building schools, clinics and community infrastructure.” The Local Government Association’s chairman, James Jamieson, said nine in 10 applications were approved by councils, with more than a million homes given planning permission over the last decade yet to be built, and that the system should focus on that. “Any loss of local control over developments would be a concern,” said Jamieson, who is also the Tory council leader in central Bedfordshire."
2020-08-05T21:30:12Z,politics,Politics,How the planning system shake-up will affect housing in England,"How is the government proposing to change the planning system? In a very big way. Since the English planning system was introduced in 1947, it has always been discretionary, meaning planning applications are assessed against a local plan on a case-by-case basis, with permission decided by a democratically elected planning committee of local councillors. The new system proposes to do away with all that. Land will instead be classified into three zones, with planning permission awarded automatically if proposals meet certain criteria. What are the three planned new zones? For growth New homes, hospitals, schools, shops and offices will be allowed automatically. For renewal Proposals will be given “permission in principle”, subject to basic checks, largely on urban and brownfield sites. For protection Preserving protected areas like the green belt and areas of outstanding natural beauty.
How would this speed things up? The idea is that detailed local plans, which can take councils seven years to put together, will be abolished in favour of simplified housing plans and “design codes” to be prepared within 30 months. If a scheme meets the code, it would automatically get permission. The government is also proposing a “fast-track for beauty” system to encourage developers to bring forward higher quality proposals – a recommendation straight from a commission headed by the late and philosopher Roger Scruton. Is the planning system responsible for the shortage of homes? There is no evidence that the planning system is an obstacle to house building. Records compiled by the Local Government Association show that about 90% of planning applications are approved, while there are more than a million homes with planning permission that have not yet been built. How will the public have a say on new developments? With difficulty. The move to a zonal system reduces the possibility for public input and democratic accountability by half. England currently has a two-stage process, where local councillors and the public can comment on both the formation of the local plan, and on individual planning applications. The proposed reforms would give only one opportunity for democratic oversight, when the design code is first prepared. This could be many years in advance of particular schemes being given the green light. What are the implications of moving to a zonal planning system? In theory, a zonal system creates certainty: developers should be able to know what will and will not be allowed on a given site. Development in accordance with a code is automatically approved, as is any development not specifically prohibited by the code. Such a system sounds simple, but it creates fertile ground for lawyers to battle over anything that might be considered novel or innovative, which might not be covered by the restrictive code. How good a zonal system is comes down to the quality and scope of the code, and an effective one takes years to hone. Because there is no flexibility to respond to new circumstances at the final consent stage, every aspect has to be considered in minute detail in advance and written into the zonal plan. The zoning resolutions for New York City, for example, stretch to more than 4,300 pages.
What about affordable housing and community infrastructure? At present, developers contribute to affordable housing and things like parks and playgrounds through section 106 and the community infrastructure levy. Both of these would be scrapped and replaced with a new infrastructure levy that will be a fixed proportion of the value of the development, above a set threshold. This sounds straightforward in principle, but there is no guarantee that developers will not be able to negotiate down their obligations on grounds of financial viability, as they do at present. The government is also proposing to extend the exemption from section 106 for small sites, to help developers “bounce back from the economic impact of coronavirus” – meaning they won’t be obliged to provide affordable housing. What is the first homes scheme? The government is introducing a new “first homes” scheme to offer new-build homes at a 30% discount for local people, key workers and first-time buyers. The discount will be locked into the home in perpetuity, ensuring future buyers can continue to benefit from it. It remains to be seen how this will be funded. Could it translate to another subsidy for house builders, in the mould of the help to buy scheme?"
2020-08-05T21:30:12Z,politics,Politics,Jack Airey: the Tory aide at centre of England's planning overhaul,"While the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, is the public face of the move to launch a Conservative revolution of the planning process, one of its central architects is a softly spoken, bespectacled young thinktank operative who only joined the government in February. Jack Airey was hired as a special adviser against the backdrop of Dominic Cummings’ shake-up of the Downing Street apparatus. Yet a report co-authored by him and published in January by the thinktank Policy Exchange is regarded as a precursor of the overhaul announced on Thursday. In Rethinking the Planning System for the 21st Century, Airey sketched out plans for a bonfire of red tape and a future in which “development rules should be clear and non-negotiable”. Throwing out the notion that specific uses should be attached to individual private land plots, he wrote, “Market conditions should instead determine how urban space is used in the development zone.” Before that report, he had also been regarded as one of the drivers of a “building beautiful” agenda, co-authoring in 2018 a Policy Exchange paper with the late Conservative philosopher Roger Scruton. Thursday’s white paper owes much to the recommendations of a Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission subsequently chaired by Scruton, which called for measures to “end ugliness” and a planning “fast track for beauty”. Though coming from a thinktank known for its rightwing tilt, and as a platform for strongly pro-Brexit positions, Airey himself does not fit with the caricature some on the left might be tempted to paint. He has, for example, pushed back at the notion that immigration has been at the centre of the housing crisis and called for the building of new homes rather than “pulling up the drawbridge”. Nevertheless, he has spoken of his surprise at feeling what he described as the “full throttle of some parts of the architectural community”, following his work with Scruton. “I knew it existed but I was taken aback by some of the things some people have said,” he recalled in one interview with an architect’s podcast, in which he spoke of his proposals being labelled “fascistic”. Judging by the initial reaction to the government’s white paper, his latest ideas might yet become the focus of even greater heat."
2020-08-05T21:30:12Z,politics,Politics,England's planning changes will create 'generation of slums',"The biggest shake-up of planning for decades has caused fury that moves to fast-track the construction of “beautiful” homes across England will “dilute” democratic oversight, choke off affordable housing and lead to the creation of “slum” dwellings. Under the proposals, unveiled on Thursday, planning applications based on pre-approved “design codes” would get an automatic green light – eliminating a whole stage of local oversight within designated zones. Land across England would be divided into three categories – for growth, renewal or protection – under what Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, described as “once in a generation” changes to sweep away an outdated planning system and boost building. New homes, hospitals, schools, shops and offices would be allowed automatically in “growth” areas. In “renewal” zones, largely urban and brownfield sites, proposals would be given “permission in principle” subject to basic checks. Green belt and areas of outstanding natural beauty would be protected. While the proposed changes are likely to appeal to developers, they prompted stinging criticism from housing charities, planning officers and architects who warned of a new generation of fast and substandard housing.
The Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA) condemned them as disruptive and rushed, saying 90% of planning applications are currently approved but there are up to 1m unbuilt permissions. Labour called it “a developers’ charter” that will “set fire to important safeguards”. The long-awaited government white paper touts a new streamlined process designed to reduce red tape and harness technology to deliver homes more rapidly, ministers said. Government sources insisted there would be no dilution in building standards. Changes out for consultation under the white paper also include: Requiring local housing plans to be developed and agreed in 30 months, down from the current seven years. Extending the current exemption of small sites from having to make “section 106” payments – the means by which developers are forced to provide affordable housing. Ensuring that all new homes are carbon-neutral by 2050. At the weekend, Jenrick said the new regime drew inspiration from “design codes and pattern books” used in the construction of Bath, Belgravia and Bournville. But the prospect of a modern-day application and use of such codes to give developers “permission in principle” in zones categorised as being for growth was greeted with alarm in some quarters. The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) described the proposals as “shameful” and said they would do “almost nothing to guarantee the delivery of affordable, well-designed and sustainable homes”. “While they might help to ‘get Britain building’ – paired with the extension of permitted development rights last week – there’s every chance they could also lead to the development of the next generation of slum housing,” said RIBA president Alan Jones. Proposals to extend the current exemption of small sites from having to make section 106 payments were slated as a way of helping smaller developers bounce back from the economic impact of the pandemic. But Shelter said social housing “could face extinction” if the requirement for developers to build their fair share was removed. “Section 106 agreements between developers and councils are tragically one of the only ways we get social homes built these days, due to a lack of direct government investment,” said its chief executive, Polly Neate. “So, it makes no sense to remove this route to genuinely affordable homes without a guaranteed alternative.” The proposals contain scant detail on any alternative way to boost the number of affordable homes, promising only that they will not decrease. The white paper proposes a consultation on developers making in-kind payments of affordable homes toward the levy or allowing local authorities to buy a proportion of affordable housing at a discounted rate. Hugh Ellis, director of policy at TCPA, criticised the changes overall, saying: “This kind of disruptive reform doesn’t suit anybody, neither landowners nor developers. They’re turning the system on its head at a time when it’s working very well for the volume house builders – 90% of planning applications are approved and there are about a million unbuilt permissions.” He added: “It’s about local democracy. When local people are walking down the street and come across a new development they didn’t know about, the answer will now be: ‘You should have been involved in the consultation eight years ago when the code was agreed.’ “It’s diluting the democratic process. At the moment, people get two chances to be involved: once when the plan is made, and once when a planning application is submitted. Now they’ll only have a chance when the code is being prepared.” Zack Simons, a planning barrister at Landmark chambers, said there was a lot to welcome in a move towards digitising the planning system but added that “literally nothing” trailed in Jenrick’s public statements could not already be achieved under the current planning system. “Promises of “radical reform” can grab headlines. But remember that of more than 400,000 planning applications which are determined every year, over 80% are granted permission and under 0.5% are appealed to the Planning Inspectorate.”
A government source said it was misleading to suggest planning rules were not an obstacle to building. “The [90%] approval statistic masks the numbers of people who are put off applying altogether because of how bureaucratic and difficult this is,” the source said. However, little has been announced on what measures, if any, will be taken against developers who do not use the permission they have been granted. The white paper takes aim at the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act, which has acted as the basis for planning since it was passed by the Labour government of Clement Attlee. A “complex” planning system has acted as a barrier to building the homes people need, said Jenrick. “We will cut red tape, but not standards, placing a higher regard on quality, design and the environment than ever before,” he said. “Planning decisions will be simple and transparent, with local democracy at the heart of the process. As we face the economic effects of the pandemic, now is the time for decisive action and a clear plan for jobs and growth.” The Conservatives will hope the overhaul will be favoured not only by investors and developers, but also by the younger voters currently outside its reach. The Tory manifesto commits the government to 300,000 new homes built every year and, before coronavirus hit, senior Tories saw housing as the key mission of the government as a way of targeting a primary concern of many under-40s and city-dwelling voters shut out of the housing market – those most likely to vote Labour. “We are seeing a huge generation divide on housing,” one Tory source said. “The under-40s may have half as much chance of owning a home. That is being directly addressed by the first homes programme but the broader point is this planning system has held back homes being built on land that is ready to be built on. “And we know the main concerns which local people may have are about good design, environmentally friendly, buildings that fit into the architectural landscape, ones people are proud to own. We are not cutting any building standards.”"
2020-08-05T18:00:34Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus live: local lockdown imposed in Aberdeen; official UK death toll rises by 65 – as it happened,"Hereâ€™s a summary of the dayâ€™s main news: Aberdeen was placed under renewed lockdown conditions after a cluster emerged. The Scottish first minister said pubs, cafes and other indoor and outdoor hospitality venues must close down by 5pm on Wednesday, while people have been told not to travel into the city. Its residents must not enter each otherâ€™s houses. The lockdown will be backed by a greater police presence on Aberdeenâ€™s streets. Police Scotland said most people had complied with restrictions so far and that its officers preferred to explain the rules in the first instance. But it warned they would not hesitate to â€œtake enforcement actionâ€� if necessary. Another 65 people in the UK died after testing positive on Tuesday, according to official figures. The UK governmentâ€™s latest data release took the cumulative total of those who have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community to 46,364. Separate figures published by the UKâ€™s statistics agencies show there have been 56,600 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Contact tracers in England say they are making only a handful of calls every month. Some of those who spoke to the Guardian said they were occupying their time with barbecues and quizzes. The UK government cannot â€œdecreeâ€� that keeping schools open must be prioritised over pubs during local lockdowns, the schools minister has said. Nick Gibb insisted all children would return to school in England in September, but said decisions to enforce closures to prevent new outbreaks would be made locally. Two-thirds of clinically extremely vulnerable people are comfortable returning to work, an official analysis suggested. The Office for National Statistics found that proportion of people would be happy to go back, provided there were protective measures in place. But that still left a significant minority unwilling to say they would be happy to return. Lutonâ€™s mayor stepped down after breaking coronavirus guidelines at a large garden gathering. Tahir Malik said he regretted his actions and that resignation was the best thing he could do for the town. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. If youâ€™d like to read yet more, my colleague Severin Carrell has put together a detailed story on Aberdeenâ€™s lockdown:

2020-08-05T17:24:48Z,politics,Politics,Just another quiet day in the home-office of dedicated contact tracers | John Crace,"After people working for England’s test-and-trace system told the Guardian they were making a handful of calls a month, John Crace imagines the secret diary of a contact tracer 29th May: An email arrives. “Dear Sir, I am delighted to offer you a job as one of the UK’s ‘world-beating’ test and tracers. It will be tough, skilled work, involving dozens of phone calls each day, and your training will begin tomorrow. Thank you again for your dedication. Together we can beat the coronavirus and bring the country back to normal by Christmas. Yours, Boris Johnson and Baroness Dido Harding.” 7th June: Another email arrives. “Congratulations on completing your training.” I reply that I have yet to receive any training. Hear nothing back. 9th June: I email the head of training at Serco to remind her of my existence and to say that I am still awaiting instructions. This time she replies promptly to say that the training was targeted to help workers get used to long periods of doing nothing and that I need to be focused a great deal more on being patient. The less we do, the more effective we are being. 23rd June: I have yet to make a single test-and-trace call, despite having sat at home with my phone at the ready and the TV switched off for the past 14 days. I ring my local Serco HQ to check that they actually have the right number for me. They do so, and confirm that I am in the weekly draw for the most productive member of staff over the course of the last week. 1st July: Sod’s law. Have just invited some friends over for a barbecue, when I get an alert from the test-and-trace centre to call someone. Go indoors to prepare to give the bad news they will have to self-isolate for 14 days only to find it is a non-existent number. 4th July: I’m now on a roll. I get a second alert and call the number, which goes straight to voicemail. I don’t let this go as I don’t want to be responsible for a super-spreader slipping through the net. Eventually a man picks up and starts yelling at me. I am the 12th person to have contacted him over the past few days and would I please stop interrupting his quarantine? 10th July: The call centre emails to ask me what my favourite flower is. I give this a few minutes’ thought and reply. “On balance, I think I like bluebells the best. Why do you want to know?” An hour or so later I get an out-of-office reply saying “To be honest, we don’t give a shit one way or another what your favourite flower is. It was just a way of finding out how many of you were still monitoring your phones.” 18th July: I have seldom felt so desperate. I submit my own number to the test-and-trace database just so that someone will ring me to tell me to self-isolate. Even then no one calls. I ring the Serco human resources department. After half an hour the line goes to voicemail. “If you are a test and tracer who feels their life might be entirely futile, please try calling the self-help group Test and Trace Anonymous.” 19th July: “My name’s Simon and I’m a test and tracer,” I say. “Join the club,” says a woman. “Try not to worry too much. There are thousands of us who feel the same. Some people have been doing this for months without talking to anyone. Why don’t you sign up for one of our daily quizzes?” Finally I feel like I am getting somewhere. 21st July: Totally psyched for the quiz. “Question 1: Name the woman on the Jockey Club board who was responsible for giving this year’s Cheltenham festival the go-ahead, thereby risking the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.” Easy. Dido Harding. “Question 2: Name the former chief executive of TalkTalk whose utter ignorance of the company was famously described as a lesson to all.” That would be Dido again. I’m beginning to think there may be a theme here.
24th July: Am given a number to ring by one of the other test and tracers. Big mistake. I get through to a Liam Fox who thinks I am from the World Trade Organization. “I’m sorry about all my hacked emails on the US-UK trade talks,” he says. “But am I still in line to be director of the WTO?” I suggest that’s unlikely. But on the upside I tell him he doesn’t have to self-isolate for 14 days. He starts blubbing and I put the phone down gently. 26th July: I finally get to make a call that isn’t a fake number, doesn’t go to voicemail and hasn’t been rung countless times before. As a result, I am given a €50 voucher to spend anywhere in Spain over the course of the next month. 27th July: All non-essential travel to Spain is stopped and a 14-day quarantine imposed on travellers returning from the country. Try to flog my voucher to friends stuck in Spain for €20. Get told to bugger off. 1st August: Receive a message from Boris Johnson saying all those working from home should now be working in the office. Worried, I ring the No 10 switchboard to let them know I don’t have an office. A bored receptionist says not to worry as Boris is working from his country house for the rest of the summer."
2020-08-05T13:52:24Z,politics,Politics,John Hume's funeral in Derry unites mourners in sombre farewell,"John Hume spent a lifetime drawing the island of Ireland together and his funeral proved no different, uniting mourners in a sombre farewell to a political titan. Unionist and nationalist leaders joined family and friends at St Eugene’s Cathedral in Derry on Wednesday to celebrate the life and grieve the loss of a man many consider the greatest person in Irish history. Social distancing rules capped the numbers inside at 120 and Hume’s family had urged people to follow the ceremony on TV rather than congregate outside the gates, lending a subdued air to a city speckled with drizzle. But there was no mistaking the pride in the local son who engineered peace in Northern Ireland, prompting tributes across the island and messages from the pope, the Dalai Lama, Downing Street, the White House and Bill Clinton. The Nobel laureate – a prize he shared with the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble – died on Monday aged 83 after a long struggle with dementia. “Today we truly give thanks to God for the gift of John Hume,” Fr Paul Farren told the congregation. “Because make no mistake about it, there are people alive today who would not be alive had it not been for John’s vision and his work.” The late leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) has become a secular saint but the priest reminded mourners and viewers that Hume waged an often lonely struggle to coax the IRA and Sinn Féin into negotiations, to bring unionists and British and Irish governments onboard and to orchestrate the 1998 Good Friday agreement.
“We should never underestimate how difficult it was for John to cross the road and do what was intensely unpopular for the greater good … even in the darkest moments, when people would have been forgiven for having no hope, John made peace visible for others,” Farren said. He also lauded Hume’s widow, Pat, for her behind-the-scenes contribution. Mourners included Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland’s first minister and Democratic Unionist party leader, and Michelle O’Neill, the deputy first minister and deputy leader of Sinn Féin, who run the Stormont executive, a legacy of Hume’s work. From Dublin came President Michael D Higgins, the taoiseach, Micheál Martin, and other dignitaries. The Dalai Lama’s message praised Hume’s persistence. “His message about peace and nonviolence in the resolution of conflict, no matter how protracted or difficult it may seem to be, will long survive him.” Bono, U2’s lead singer, also paid tribute. “We were looking for a great leader and found a great servant.” As a young schoolteacher, Hume led civil rights protests in Derry in the late 1960s demanding an end to discrimination against Catholics. After the Troubles erupted he co-founded the SDLP, became an MP and MEP, and spent three decades arguing for an “agreed Ireland” shared peacefully by unionists and nationalists. He enlisted support from successive administrations in Dublin, London, Brussels and Washington. Viewers in a 2010 RTÉ poll voted Hume the greatest person in Irish history. On Tuesday night candles in windows and doors lit a path for the funeral cortege as it wound to the cathedral. Boris Johnson tweeted that a candle was lit in Downing Street. Suspected republican dissidents in Derry hijacked and burned several vehicles – a reminder that fringe groups still espouse violence. In a eulogy at the funeral, John Hume Jr paid tribute to his father’s quest for peace and made light of his driven, round-the-clock lifestyle, saying he kept the Irish chocolate industry in healthy profits for many years. “Yorkies, Crunchies, Creme Eggs, Double Deckers, Wispas – you name it, he loved them all,” he said. “We often found it odd how a man with the intelligence to win a Nobel prize could seriously believe that Crunchies were less fattening because they are full of air.” At the end of the ceremony the singer Phil Coulter performed The Town I Loved So Well. By the time the wicker coffin emerged from the cathedral to be taken to the cemetery, drizzle had given way to sunshine. Several hundred people lined the streets. “It’s sad to lose him,” said Anna Peake, 79. “He was an amazing man for peace and love on the island of Ireland. The people of Derry loved him.”"
2020-08-05T13:18:21Z,politics,Politics,Douglas Ross appointed leader of Scottish Conservatives,"The Scottish Conservatives have appointed Douglas Ross as their new leader without a contest after the sudden resignation last week of Jackson Carlaw. Ross, the MP for Moray, emerged as leader-in-waiting within hours of Carlaw’s resignation last Thursday, which came in a bloodless coup orchestrated by party leaders after several opinion polls showed a surge in support for Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish independence. Ross said becoming leader was the “honour and privilege of a lifetime”. He said: “Now our focus must turn to earning the trust of people looking for a positive and credible alternative for Scotland, and who want a fresh start for our country. I hope you’ll join us.” One of the few Scottish Tory MPs to hold his seat in the Scottish National party revival in last December’s general election, Ross will work in tandem with Ruth Davidson, the former leader, who will act as his de facto deputy at Holyrood. In an unorthodox move, Davidson will return from the backbenches to face Sturgeon at first minister’s questions until the Scottish parliament is dissolved next March before the Holyrood elections in May. Davidson is stepping down as MSP for Edinburgh Central in March before joining the Lords as a life peer. In a sign of the Tories’ anxieties about Sturgeon’s soaring popularity during the coronavirus pandemic, Davidson has deferred her appointment to the Lords until then. Ross and Davidson are expected to try to reassert the centrist, one-nation Tory policies Davidson championed before she resigned suddenly in August last year, partly in protest at Boris Johnson’s election as UK leader. In a joint article for the Scottish Daily Mail on Tuesday, which made no mention of Brexit or the prime minister, the pair said their goals were defending the UK, attacking Sturgeon’s domestic record and promoting economic recovery. “For us, unionism is not an end but a means – to a fairer and more prosperous Scotland,” they said. Recent polls by Panelbase put the SNP on 55% in a Holyrood election – a figure that suggests Sturgeon could win an overall majority in May – and showed support for independence had hit 54%, the highest yet. The Tories were on 20%, compared with their 28.6% result in the 2017 general election. Ross and Davidson said their alliance was based “on a genuine belief, born out of experience, that SNP rule isn’t as inevitable as some people feel. We abhor the sense of defeatism that has crept into some quarters and we want to show the fight is there for the winning.” A senior party source said the Tories believed they were able to claw back support before May’s election by focusing on the issues expected to be most pressing next year, once the pandemic has receded. These included combating unemployment, the economic recovery, and domestic subjects such as education. “We’re going to push back [against the SNP], and push back hard,” the source said. The SNP and other opposition parties are likely to attack Ross and Davidson over their unusual parliamentary roles, and Ross’s continuing part-time job as an assistant football referee. Although he expects to win a Holyrood seat in May, Ross is currently an MP, with no direct say over devolved policymaking, and Davidson has announced she is quitting Holyrood. The SNP signalled its intention to attack Ross’s politics on Tuesday by posting a tweet accusing him of having “a long history of racist views” because he called for tougher enforcement action against Travellers in his constituency in an online interview in 2017. Accused of defamation by senior Tories, the SNP later deleted the tweet; Ross had apologised for that remark and withdrawn it in a BBC interview on Monday, saying his stance then was “wrong”. Party sources believe Ross will keep the party’s Holyrood frontbench in their current posts, including his official deputy, Annie Wells, a Glasgow MSP."
2020-08-04T23:01:15Z,politics,Politics,Lack of special border measures before UK coronavirus lockdown was 'serious mistake',"The government’s failure to impose special border measures such as mandatory self-isolation in the run-up to the coronavirus lockdown was “a serious mistake” that significantly increased the pace and scale of the epidemic, MPs have concluded in a damning report. Between January and mid-March, non-mandatory guidance to self-isolate for 14 days was issued to travellers from designated high-risk countries including China, Iran and Italy, but not Spain. The guidance was withdrawn on 13 March. Evidence suggests thousands of new infections were brought in from continental Europe in the 10 days between the withdrawal of guidance and the introduction of lockdown on 23 March, the home affairs select committee says in the report. “It is highly likely that this contributed to the rapid increase in the spread of the virus in mid-March and to the overall scale of the outbreak in the UK,” the MPs say. The committee recommends that the Home Office, the Department of Health and Social Care and the Department for Transport should investigate the viability of introducing widespread or targeted tests at the border, alongside continued use of quarantine requirements and “travel corridor” arrangements.
The committee chair, Labour’s Yvette Cooper, said: “The government’s failure to have proper quarantine measures in place in March as the infection was spreading fast was a grave error and meant Covid spread faster and reached more people. The UK was almost unique in having no border checks or quarantine arrangements at that time.” The report says the Home Office and other government departments failed to provide the committee with the scientific advice behind the decisions despite repeated requests. “It is not clear, therefore, who was making the decisions about borders in March, nor on what basis such decisions were made,” the report reads. “We find that this lack of clarity is very serious and may well have contributed to mistakes being made.” The MPs say it is understandable that the government did not want to restrict flights but add that the failure to consider imposing stricter requirements on those arriving – such as mandatory self-isolation, increased screening, targeted testing or enforceable quarantine – was “a serious error”. The committee backs the government’s introduction in early June of mandatory self-isolation, the subsequent use of travel corridors and the reintroduction of self-isolation requirements for travellers arriving from Spain. However, the MPs say communication around the reintroduction of the quarantine requirements for travel with Spain was poorly handled. On 5 May, Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, told the health and social care committee that before lockdown on 23 March “we saw a big influx of cases, probably from Italy and Spain, looking at the genomics of the virus, in early March, seeded right across the country.”
According to recent research by the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium – which is comprised of NHS organisations, public health agencies and academic partners, including the universities of Oxford and Cambridge – Spain, France, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands were the top five sources of imported cases of infections. The consortium found that introduction of the virus into the UK peaked in mid-March at a time when infection rates were surging in European countries, but before the government clamped down on non-essential travel. A government spokesperson said: “The home affairs committee is incorrect in its assertions. All of our decisions throughout the pandemic have been guided by the science, with appropriate measures introduced at the right time to keep us all safe. And with passengers numbers significantly reduced, the scientific advice was clear that quarantine measures for those entering the country from abroad would be most effective when the UK has a lower level of infection. “Therefore, as the virus was brought under control here, border measures were introduced on 8 June to protect public health and help avoid a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS.”"
2020-08-04T18:25:33Z,politics,Politics,Liam Fox faces growing scrutiny over Russian hack of personal email,"Liam Fox is facing questions from opposition politicians, former civil servants and campaigners about how Russian hackers were apparently able to obtain government documents marked “official sensitive [UK eyes only]” from his personal email last year. The former minister’s account is believed to have been accessed repeatedly between July and October, and 451 pages of emails and policy documents were subsequently posted on Reddit, prompting questions as to whether the dossier had come directly from Fox’s personal email. Labour has accused ministers of misjudging the threat posed by Russia and called on the government to provide a full and public explanation of the extraordinary affair, and the extent to which Fox himself was at fault over the hack. Rachel Reeves, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “The government now needs to explain how a minister’s account was hacked by a foreign state and specifically confirm whether classified documents were accessed through a personal email account.” Downing Street would only repeat that it was unable to comment because there was an ongoing criminal investigation, but it has not disputed that Russia had hacked Fox’s personal account, details of which have emerged via Whitehall briefings. Ministers have previously publicly accused “Russian actors” of disseminating the hacked trade documents online. Bob Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, said Fox “absolutely shouldn’t have used his private email address” for official documents, and that there were clear rules “for the very good reason they aren’t secure”. Ministers are told they must comply with the Official Secrets Act, but the use of private emails within government is not itself illegal. Had Fox been a civil servant, however, he would almost certainly have been reprimanded if it was found that official documents had been sent or held on a personal email account. Alex Thomas, a former civil servant under the former cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood, said: “For a civil servant it would be a disciplinary offence if they had shared information via an inappropriate means.” Trade policy documents are “taken seriously and the security of that information does matter”, he added. The hack led to the emergence of a 451-page dossier online last autumn, which Labour ultimately picked up during the election campaign. Jeremy Corbyn, then party leader, said the documents, whose authenticity has never been questioned, showed that the NHS was “on the table” in trade talks with the US. Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ justice spokesperson, said: “Liam Fox’s actions were totally irresponsible and by sending classified government documents to his private email, it seems he might have breached national security in a very serious way.” Ministers have periodically been embroiled in rows about the use of private emails, most notably when Michael Gove, then education secretary, was discovered in 2011 to have used a email account with the name of “Mrs Blurt” to discuss government business with his aide Dominic Cummings and others. At least some of the emails were deleted, but the information commissioner ruled subsequently that such correspondence was nevertheless covered by freedom of information laws and should be retained. Maurice Frankel, the founder of the Campaign for the Freedom of Information, said Fox “ought to have been using government servers for his business” and added: “There’s no obvious reason why material like this should have been on a personal email account.” A spokesperson for Fox, who was trade secretary until the end of July last year, declined to comment. The 58-year-old is currently the UK’s nominee for director general of the World Trade Organization."
2020-08-04T17:00:07Z,politics,Politics,Starmer says PM has one month to fix coronavirus test-and-trace system,"Ministers have one month to fix the broken test-and-trace system and halt a devastating second wave of coronavirus or Britain will face a “long and bleak winter”, Keir Starmer says today. The Labour leader warned there is “precious little evidence” of serious preparation for a resurgence in Covid-19 cases. Writing for the Guardian, Starmer calls for mass testing of asymptomatic people and a clear plan setting out what “hard decisions” Boris Johnson is prepared to take in order to keep schools open if cases rise over coming weeks. Starmer says the prime minister must admit his “world-beating” £10bn system is flawed. “His repeated refusal to accept that test and trace isn’t functioning properly is a roadblock to fixing the issues and restoring public confidence,” he writes. The intervention comes as councils launched new localised systems for contact tracing to plug holes in the national scheme. Blackburn with Darwen council in Lancashire announced it had set up its own team on Tuesday after the national system failed to reach hundreds of its most vulnerable residents. In other areas, including Leicester and Liverpool, council workers have been carrying out door-to-door tracing – but local health officials says incomplete data from the national system is hampering their efforts. On Tuesday, researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who modelled scenarios for the reopening of schools, warned that the test and trace system currently reaches around half of contacts and needs to improve dramatically in order to avoid a second wave, which could be bigger than the first. Starmer calls for renewed focus on testing in today’s article. “Alongside rapid improvements to the test-and-trace system, we need a focus on ensuring testing reaches more of the estimated 70-80% of people who don’t have [coronavirus] symptoms,” he writes. Labour sources highlighted current spare capacity in the testing system, saying the party would support any reasonable new moves to use that capacity to build a better national picture of the number of asymptomatic cases. A number of countries have adopted routine asymptomatic testing, including Germany, Portugal and most successfully, South Korea, which opened public testing to everyone, regardless of symptoms, from February. Starmer is to step up specific criticism of the government’s systems this month, both on communication and test and trace, warning the government has less than five weeks, rather than months, to get preparations in place to tackle a resurgence of the virus once children across the UK are all back in school. A functioning test-and-trace system is the key not only to preventing a second wave, but also to unlocking the economy and building public confidence to get children back to school, Labour will warn. “It’s great if the government are committed to getting the schools open, but polling on this hasn’t shifted: parents are still concerned about sending their kids to school, that won’t change without public confidence in the test-and-trace system,” one Labour source said. In his Guardian piece, Starmer says schools must be the absolute priority in September, even if that comes at economic and social cost. “Young people cannot afford another damaging U-turn like the one made by the education secretary in June,” he writes. “The government must set out a clear plan this time, not just hope for the best. If that means making hard decisions elsewhere, so be it: to govern is to choose.” The Labour leader attacked the government’s communications strategy, saying haphazard announcements of new local lockdowns and quarantines, as well as mixed messages on workers returning to offices, had left the public confused and anxious. “Getting a grip on communications is essential. Reintroducing regular press conferences would help,” he says. “Working closely with authorities, not governing by diktat, is crucial. There should be an end to anonymous, contradictory briefings to the media.” Starmer’s last comment is a veiled reference to ideas floated and then dismissed such as shielding advice for over-50s and reform of the quarantine system. Labour’s strategy over the coming month will be to present Starmer as a leader who can work constructively but also set the government specific targets. He warns a new plan must be drawn up to protect care homes during any resurgence of the virus and calls for a redrawing of the furlough scheme to target specific industries. “The current one-size-fits-all removal of furlough risks a squeeze on jobs that could hand a P45 to people across the country,” he says, while also criticising the government for spending “untargeted billions on bonuses for companies who have already brought workers back from furlough, and a stamp duty cut for landlords”. Starmer, who will visit the lost Labour heartland of Stoke-on-Trent on Wednesday to hammer home his message on the need to protect jobs, said he would support any moves the government took in the coming months to improve the failures he had highlighted. “This crisis is bigger than politics. But the reality is that if the government doesn’t use this summer wisely, focusing on driving down the rate of infection, Britain faces a long and bleak winter.” A government spokesperson said it backed local action to tackle outbreaks, such as the steps taken in Blackburn, but stopped short of promising any imminent further expansion of testing to find asymptomatic cases. The Department of Health and Social Care said the most recent scientific advice did not support routine testing to find a symptomatic cases and found regular testing of those without symptoms was only worthwhile among groups most likely to have been exposed to the virus, such as in care settings. “NHS test and trace is already working – last week over 80% of those testing positive were reached, with over 75% of their contacts reached as well,” the spokesperson said. “We have rapidly built, from scratch, the largest diagnostic testing industry in British history. Over 2.6 million people have been tested in just eight weeks and we have the capacity to carry out more than 330,000 tests per day, growing to 500,000 per day by the end of October.”"
2020-08-04T16:00:46Z,politics,Politics,"Lindsay Hoyle spends £7,500 on bedding and mattresses for Speaker's residence","He might have been more frugal in the refurbishment of his grace-and-favour home than his predecessor, but the new Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has still managed to rack up a considerable bill – including spending in excess of £7,500 on mattresses and bedding. The sum accounts for more than half of the £12,636 of public money that went on works to get the Speaker’s residence in Palace of Westminster ready for his occupancy at the end of last year, according to details obtained by the Guardian using Freedom of Information laws. The total figure is, however, dwarfed by the more than £20,000 billed by the former Speaker, John Bercow, for work to the apartment in 2009. Although Hoyle’s bill is lower, it includes £7,523 on new mattresses and bedding. A lengthy note accompanying the spending states: “The replacement of mattresses and bedding was required as these had become damaged and/or worn and no longer deemed suitable for new occupants. This cost included like-for-like replacement for four mattresses and associated bedding as well as bedding for other overnight accommodation provision on the parliamentary estate.” Hoyle became the 158th speaker in November last year, with the Lancastrian promising to bring calm to the chamber, which has seen bad-tempered debates in recent years, particularly over Brexit. The MP for Chorley, who has represented the constituency since 1997, was deputy speaker for nearly a decade before taking up the post. A spreadsheet of spending on “works to prepare the residence for the new Speaker’s occupancy” shows that £2,292 went on “works to flooring” and £1,300 on “heritage furniture polishing work”, as well as a further £1,300 on cleaning of non-heritage furniture. Supplying and installing “light pulls” cost £111 and removing redundant small wall fittings cost £110. The work took place in November and December 2019. Separately, £89,506 was spent in May and June 2020 on asbestos removal to support fire safety works. In June, July and August, fire safety works took place, costing another £9,243. A further £400 was billed for “heritage watching brief in support of the fire safety works” in May, as well as £3,715 for “heritage furniture disassembly in support of the works”. Maintenance to the heating system in April cost £2,120 and repairing a door lock in June cost £80. It means that in total, since Hoyle became speaker, £117,700 has been spent on the apartment. Bercow prompted controversy after being elected to the post in 2009 when figures emerged showing he spent £20,659.36 refurbishing the Speaker’s house in parliament. The spending was defended as necessary to make the apartment child-friendly for Bercow’s young family. A spokeswoman for the Speaker said: “After 10 years of use by the previous post holder and his family – who used it as their primary home – the Speaker’s residence needs renovating, updating and fire safety improvement work to take place. Unlike any other property, the Speaker’s residence is located within the Palace of Westminster, which is a Grade 1 listed building and a Unesco world heritage site, so alterations, repairs and replacement of soft furnishings need to be in keeping with the historic nature of the building.”"
2020-08-04T05:00:01Z,politics,Politics,Number of UK citizens emigrating to EU has risen by 30% since Brexit vote,"The number of British nationals emigrating to other EU countries has risen by 30% since the Brexit referendum, with half making their decision to leave in the first three months after the vote, research has found. Analysis of data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Eurostat shows that migration from Britain to EU states averaged 56,832 people a year in 2008-15, growing to 73,642 a year in 2016-18. The study also shows a 500% increase in those who made the move and then took up citizenship in an EU state. Germany saw a 2,000% rise, with 31,600 Britons naturalising there since the referendum. “These increases in numbers are of a magnitude that you would expect when a country is hit by a major economic or political crisis,” said Daniel Auer, co-author of the study by Oxford University in Berlin and the Berlin Social Science Center. According to interviews, half chose to leave the UK quickly. “Another important finding from the empirical evidence associated with Brexit is reduced levels of consideration and level-headedness in decision-making, with increases in levels of impulsiveness, spontaneity and corresponding risk-taking,” the researchers said. While the withdrawal agreement signed in January enshrines the residency, work and social rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons in the rest of the bloc, it failed to guarantee the free movement rights of British migrants, restricting future employment and residency prospects in other member states. Co-author Daniel Tetlow said that “Brexit was by far the most dominant driver of migration decisions since 2016”. The jump in citizenship was “further evidence that an increasing number are making migration decisions to protect themselves from some of the most negative effects of Brexit on their lives”, the report said. The key loss for British nationals is the freedom to move country within the EU or to work or offer services across a border. This does not apply to EU nationals in the UK who retain free movement rights beyond Brexit courtesy of their EU member state citizenship. It means that unless British nationals take out citizenship in their host country, they can no longer work in or offer a service to another EU member state, impacting professions including accounting, law, architecture, translation and health. The biggest jump in migration was to Spain, where an estimated 380,000 British nationals live. Registration has not been essential in the country so many have lived there without being included in official Spanish immigration data, with an average of just 2,300 a year registering as migrating to the country between 2008 and 2015. After the referendum, this jumped fivefold, with 21,250 registrations in the two years between 2016 and 2018.
The second most popular country for British nationals was France, which does not require registration of EU migrants. Between 2008 and 2015 the number of registrations was just over 500 a year. After the referendum this rose tenfold with 5,000 registrations over the following two years. In Germany, 14,600 Britons had dual nationality in 2019 compared to 622 in 2015. A total of 31,600 applied and received German citizenship in the three years after the referendum (2016 to 2019) with another 15,000 German passports expected for 2020. Overall half the estimated 120,000 Britons in Germany are expected to have dual citizenship by the end of this year. Interviews with migrants in Germany for the study found those who had made the move to the EU since 2015 considered it a “big risk” but were prepared to make the trade-off to secure future residency and employment routes across 27 countries. Tetlow said the rise in naturalisation numbers was a striking commitment “to integrate or socially embed”, with an increase in language learning and community involvement. “We’re observing a new social integration phenomenon and a redefining of what it means to be British European. In 2019, Brits came in just behind Turks in numbers receiving German citizenship – way ahead of Poles, Romanians, Iraqis or Syrians,” he added. Case study Andreas Mitchell’s family moved from Scotland to Germany in 2018 after the 20-year-old was diagnosed with a form of leukaemia and they feared Brexit could delay medicines or treatment. Andreas said: “About six months after the referendum I was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. I was getting treatment but these kind of things can start deteriorating over the years, and eventually we decided we should probably leave in case things started to get difficult. “We had a fear that if a hard Brexit came there could be delays at the border with medicines coming through and my treatment would have to be prioritised and it would get interrupted by two or three weeks. With leukaemia you can’t wait a few weeks.” He added: “It became a question of should we stay, things deteriorating financially for the family – petrol into Aberdeen every day mounts up cost-wise and there was a risk if my treatment got postponed.” Mitchell’s German-born mother, Uschi, says they loved their life and home in Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and they miss their family and friends there – but the town and area have already changed significantly because of Brexit. “Even without Covid-19 the economy had started to contract. People and investors alike became increasingly cautious when it came to spending money,” she said. They also considered Ireland and Italy, but Uschi got a job in Germany. Fear over Brexit was “the main factor”, she added. “Where we were wasn’t brilliant for work so we thought we would not be able to sustain ourselves and Andreas’s diagnosis was a big scare, so Brexit was the big push in the end.”"
2020-08-04T05:00:01Z,politics,Politics,Labour's Dawn Butler: 'People threatened to kill me. I’ve been attacked on the tube',"At the start of April, Dawn Butler was a well-liked figure in parliament and looked like a strong candidate for deputy leader of the Labour party. An experienced parliamentarian, 50 years old and a party member for more than 30 of them, she had been a minister in Gordon Brown’s government and served in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet. In December 2009, she had been the first black woman to speak from the dispatch box. She also had strong union links, having worked for the GMB and, before that, the Public and Commercial Services Union. She had a life before – and halfway through – Westminster, working as a computer programmer and then an employment-service trainer. In February 2005, she stood to be a parliamentary candidate in West Ham, in the east London borough of Newham, where she was raised by her mother, who worked for the NHS, and her father, who worked on the railways. She lost that race by four votes. A month later, she went for Brent South, in north-west London, and got it, even though “it had already been earmarked for Tony Blair’s political adviser. That was like a red rag to a bull, wasn’t it? It had already been stitched up for a bloke, so obviously I was going to go for it.” That May, she won the seat in the general election. After boundary changes, she lost the newly minted seat of Brent Central to Sarah Teather in the 2010 Lib Dem bounce, only to be elected again – in the same constituency – in 2015, since when she has held the seat. She spent the intervening years designing learning programmes for companies and nursing her father in the last year of his life. On 3 April 2020, she lost the deputy leadership race to Angela Rayner – about which she has views, which we will come to. Since then, she has been a backbencher, working in the same crisis conditions as everyone else. In June, she wrote an opinion piece in the Metro newspaper defending the Black Lives Matter protests. “We had 6,000 bits of communication and about 2,000 of them were hate communication,” she says of the response. “There are people calling me every word you can think of – the C-word, the N-word, the B-world. People threatening to kill me. I’ve been attacked on the tube. People have tried to attack me in my constituency office. A member of staff bought themselves a stab vest to come to my surgery.”
She had to close her constituency office because she could not guarantee her staff’s safety. “My team had to wade through all this and basically grade [the messages], in terms of what Twitter might take down, or Facebook might take down, or the police might take seriously, or parliament might take seriously. And they were broken by all this. They’re protecting me from the hate and I feel so guilty about it.” We meet in her constituency, at the Arch, a deserted but intensely festive Indian restaurant in Wembley, where she is sitting in a cabana in the broadest sunshine, looking like a portrait of optimism. It is astonishing to hear, first-hand, about the racist abuse she has endured and to see the contrast between the grind of this nastiness and how undimmed she seems by it. She quickly and resolutely diverts from her own experience on to someone whom she thinks has it worse: Diane Abbott, the recipient of almost as much online abuse as all other female MPs combined, according to research by Amnesty International in 2017. “You have people who’ve made a career out of attacking Diane. What did she have to put up with when she entered parliament [in 1987]? What scars has she got, what did she have to do to keep the peace, how many times did she have to smile through it?”
There are clear parallels in the way Abbott and Butler are treated, not just by political opponents and trolls on social media, but also by putatively respectable platforms. “They often try to dismiss what I’m saying, then two or three weeks later everyone else is saying it and I’m exonerated. A presenter said to me: did I read the government’s report [on coronavirus], which was 50 pages. It was only 50 pages anyway because it had such a large font; if they’d printed it at normal size, it would have been a pamphlet. And I was ridiculed for saying I hadn’t. But I didn’t need to read it – I’d already read the science behind it. I’m on the science and technology select committee.” She says this portrayal – the idiot who is not on top of her brief – “is a form of trolling. It’s a trope. And it’s racism. It’s something that black women face all the time. We are simultaneously invisible and visible.” This has persisted throughout her life in the public eye, even the most triumphant and historic moments of which have been marked by this kneejerk ridicule. When she stood up to speak on behalf of Brown’s government, “the first black woman to stand at the dispatch box, the Tories tried to belittle me at that moment in history. I can’t remember his name, but one took great delight in telling me that ‘upskilling’ was not in the English dictionary. He knew it was a momentous time, but they’d all been instructed to put me down.” But the person she remembers vividly from that day is Sadiq Khan, who was a transport minister at the time. “He ran from the other side of parliament to make sure he sat beside me. He was all out of breath. He said: ‘I’m not letting you do this by yourself.’”
Perhaps because of her five-year hiatus outside parliament, Butler made an easy transition from Brown’s government to Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, from minister for youth affairs to shadow minister for women and equalities. The obvious assumption is that she made a strategic shift in her own politics to fit in with the new order, but the only sign of that in her voting record is that, early on, she voted consistently against an inquiry into the Iraq war, which would have aligned her with the right of the party. She rejects that and gives a straightforward, personal reason for those votes: “I never believed in holding an inquiry while we still had troops in Iraq. My brother was in the army and I spoke to him about it. If you held an inquiry while the troops were still out there doing their best to fight for the country, it would have been soul-destroying for them.” Her analysis is that Labour moved rightwards after 2010: “When I came back in 2015, I was a little bit surprised at the sorts of things that the Labour party was comfortable with, like the welfare reform bill [in which Harriet Harman, as interim leader, instructed MPs not to vote against Conservative cuts]. I didn’t understand what had happened in my time away; I was only gone for five years. That’s when I knew that Jeremy Corbyn was going to do well, because he knew who he was and what our values were as a party.”
But Corbyn did not woo her into the shadow cabinet – she had to break down his door. “He had a lot of inexperienced people around him and that wasn’t helping us. I knew that I could help him at PMQs; I knew that I had skills to contribute.” Butler’s critique of Corbyn’s time is deeply felt, but quite careful. “The Labour leaked report [into the party’s handling of antisemitism, which described a closed inner circle around the leader, outside of which was a party so riven that staffers were actively hoping for electoral defeat] cut very deep. I was very bruised by that. The lesson is: you need people around you when you’re in power who will question what you’re doing, because you’ll make better decisions.” I ask, of course, whether she is glad of Keir Starmer’s victory. “I would have been glad whoever won.” She dissolves into laughter and immediately concedes: “That’s really a cop-out. Am I glad? Do you know what I think? I think the Labour party’s leadership election system needs to change. I don’t think you should be having an internal election that means you have to spend a lot of money.” She then rattles off how much everything costs – £5,000 to get access to the membership lists, £13,000 to pay for the system to contact members by text, half a million for a mailout. “I thought working 24 hours a day would be enough to win. But, actually, I needed money to access some of the systems that were needed. And I had 30 grand. Before the phone calls and mailouts started, I was in second place.” In the event, Butler came last, on 11%.
Another interpretation is that her campaign did not get across who she is. She often used to come across as dry and cautious, with more than a trace of the disciplined minister of government, serious and liable to equivocate. That Butler has vanished: no longer bound by the responsibilities of the frontbench, she relishes the freedom to choose her own causes: “There are things that I need to speak out on that may make Keir feel uncomfortable.” She also seems to have liberated her personality: funny, zealous, mischievous, pioneering. Her chosen causes are varied: she has a fairly geeky, careful eye on government procurement, from the contact-tracing app to Chris Grayling’s shipping contract with a company that had no ships. She is viscerally worried about a bad or no-deal Brexit and what it will do to her constituents. “I think a lot of what this government is doing is that they’re using it [the virus] as a smokescreen for what’s going to happen post-transition. And we really have to work hard at informing the public as to what’s actually going on.” And the Black Lives Matter movement – “It is a movement, not a moment,” she says, referring to Starmer calling it the latter, for which he later apologised – “has got me thinking about all kinds of things. Whenever, in general, African-Caribbean people, people of colour, see an injustice taking place, a wrongful arrest or a killing, it brings back trauma, it makes you think of the stuff you’ve been through, or your family has been through. My parents taught me resilience, but it was their resilience. My brothers taught me resistance, how to survive. So they would say to me: ‘When you’re driving, if a police car drives past you, look in the mirror, see if it turns around to follow you. If it does, stop somewhere where there are people.’”
It is stark to hear, in such concrete terms, the coping strategies that people of colour have developed to counter institutional racism. Butler continues: “There are loads of people who are, for the first time, understanding the injustice that African-Caribbean people go through. They’re seeing things they never saw before. There are people who are understanding that they have privilege whether they’ve asked for it or not.” It is the fight of a generation, she says, but the vastness of it does not put her off identifying the practical solutions she wants now: the resignation of the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, for one. “I work with the police and they want the racist police officers out of the force the same way I do. But if you’ve got the head of the force refusing to acknowledge anything’s wrong, that’s never going to happen. She doesn’t accept the terminology ‘institutional racism’. If she doesn’t accept it, how can she be committed to eradicate it from her police force?” Butler is also calling for an end to stop and search. “It does not work – or rather, it works the way it’s designed to work – it is designed to be discriminatory. The fact is, where a police officer can stop a person of colour driving a car, saying: ‘We smelled drugs coming from your car; that’s why we stopped you,’ and then, when they search the car, there are no drugs, you have to ask yourself: what were they smelling?” Butler is adamant that she wants a life after Westminster – “I don’t want to be wheeled out” – but she has unfinished business: “the eradication of racism. We live in a topsy-turvy world where it’s a sin to call someone racist, but not a sin to be racist.” Plus, “I made a commitment to myself, when I was elected to parliament, that I would ensure there would be other African-Caribbean women coming behind me. There’s no point in being the only one. It’s too much of a burden for one person to carry and we won’t see change.”"
2020-08-03T19:42:38Z,politics,Politics,Russians hacked Liam Fox's personal email to get US-UK trade dossier,"A personal email account belonging to Liam Fox, the former trade minister, was repeatedly hacked into by Russians who stole classified documents relating to US-UK trade talks, the Guardian understands. The security breaches last year, which are subject to an ongoing police investigation, pose serious questions for the Conservative MP who is currently the UK’s nominee to become director general of the World Trade Organization. Whitehall sources indicated the documents were hacked from a personal account rather than a parliamentary or ministerial one, prompting Labour to ask why Fox was using unsecured personal emails for government business.
A spokesman for the former minister declined to comment and later stressed the Cabinet Office had not publicly confirmed which account was hacked. Downing Street and the Cabinet Office said it was inappropriate to comment further given that criminal inquiries were continuing. The stolen documents – a 451-page dossier of emails – ultimately ended up in the hands of Jeremy Corbyn during last winter’s election campaign after Russian actors tried to disseminate the material online. They had been posted on the social media platform Reddit and brought to the attention of the then Labour leader’s team. Corbyn said the documents revealed the NHS “was on the table” in trade talks with the US. Details of Russia’s targeting of Fox’s emails were first revealed on Monday by Reuters, which said his account was accessed several times between 12 July and 21 October last year. It was unclear if the documents were obtained when the staunch leave supporter was still trade secretary; he was dropped by Boris Johnson on 24 July. The attack is understood to have deployed a “spear-phishing” technique frequently used by Russian actors, in which superficially plausible emails are sent inviting the recipient to click on an attached file. The file contains malicious code designed to give access to or take control of the target’s computer. Chris Bryant, a Labour MP and former Foreign Office minister, said he was not surprised that the Kremlin might want to hack the trade secretary’s email, given Russia’s long history of targeting western politicians. “What shocks me is using insecure personal email accounts for sensitive, classified government business. This a very serious breach of national security and should be a criminal offence,” Bryant added. Using personal emails for UK government business is not illegal but ministers are reminded that government information “must be handled in accordance with the requirements of the law, including the Official Secrets Act”, in guidance published by the government in 2013. That came two years after Michael Gove, then education secretary, and his aide Dominic Cummings were discovered to have used personal emails for government business. The information commissioner ruled subsequently that such emails were nevertheless covered by freedom of information laws. It had previously been thought that the US-UK trade documents were hacked via a special adviser’s personal email. Last December, Cummings – by now the prime minister’s chief adviser – warned all political aides to be vigilant as it had emerged “foreign powers” were targeting British politicians. Accurately attributing the origin of hacker attacks is notoriously difficult and often requires extensive investigation. But there are also political reasons to be cautious about publicly blaming the Kremlin for the attack. Any accusation that an MP and former minister was targeted by Russia would prompt an escalation in tensions between London and Moscow, already heightened after British ministers made a string of accusations about Russian hacking. Last month Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, accused Russian actors of trying to disseminate the trade documents online but did not divulge how they were thought to have been obtained. All the government would say was that the classified material appeared to have been stolen. Raab said the dossier had been illicitly acquired before the 2019 general election and that there was an ongoing criminal investigation. He also accused Russian hackers from the group known as Cozy Bear of targeting UK, US and Canadian research organisations involved in developing a coronavirus vaccine. Raab said it was “completely unacceptable” for Russian intelligence services to target research on the Covid-19 pandemic. It has been previously been alleged that Cozy Bear is controlled by the Russian FSB spy agency or its SVR foreign intelligence agency, although the Kremlin denied it was behind the alleged attacks. Days later, a long-delayed MPs’ report concluded the British government and intelligence agencies failed to conduct any proper assessment of Kremlin attempts to interfere with the 2016 Brexit referendum, with ministers in effect turning a blind eye to allegations of Russian disruption. In July the UK nominated Fox for the post of director general of the WTO, which falls vacant at the end of this month. Fox is one of eight candidates for the position, which is chosen by the 164 member countries in a process expected to last into the autumn. Fox, 58, has been an MP since 1992 and twice stood for the Conservative party leadership. He was made trade secretary under Theresa May in 2016. The MP for North Somerset had been forced to resign as defence secretary in 2011 after it emerged that a lobbyist friend, Adam Werritty, was acting as an adviser to him despite not being employed by the government. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “There is an ongoing criminal investigation into how the documents were acquired, and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this point. But as you would expect, the government has very robust systems in place to protect the IT systems of officials and staff.” In 2017 up to 90 email accounts belonging to peers and MPs – 1% of parliament’s 9,000 email addresses – were hacked in an orchestrated cyber-attack. Later that year it was reported that passwords belonging to 1,000 British MPs and 1,000 Foreign Office staff had been traded by Russian hackers, with the majority of passwords said to have been compromised in a 2012 hacking raid on the business social network LinkedIn, in which millions of users’ details were stolen."
2020-08-03T18:44:52Z,politics,Politics,"To Corbyn's dismay, the story of the US-UK dossier has mostly been its origin","As Jeremy Corbyn took to the stage on a Wednesday in November brandishing secret documents 15 days out from the 2019 election campaign, it was potentially the Hail Mary moment to salvage the Labour leader’s campaign. Labour had discovered the explosives that would blow up Johnson’s seemingly bomb-proof three-word election campaign: “Get Brexit Done.” The documents Corbyn held up to the cameras brought together two of Labour’s most deadly attack lines: Brexit meant desperate free trade deals with the avaricious Americans, and the UK trade negotiators were secretly preparing to expose the NHS to the chill wind of the US private pharmaceutical industry. The beloved NHS was about to be sold to Donald Trump’s friends. Surrounded by smiling junior doctors, Corbyn said the 451 pages of unredacted documents “leave Boris Johnson’s denials in tatters and showed our NHS is already on the table for a toxic deal”. The documents covered six rounds of talks from July 2017 to “just a few months ago”. A flustered Conservative party tried to kill the sense of drama by saying the documents had already been available online for two months, and were simply a read out of working group meetings between officials. It later emerged the Telegraph may have seen the documents as the basis for a story back in July. The consensus was that papers had indeed been lying fallow on the social news site Reddit, unexploited by any reporter or politician. But within days of his dramatic press conference, the media – prompted by the Tories – were questioning the origins of the documents, and suggested they might have been put on to Reddit by Russian hackers. Labour’s Laura Piddock, one of Corbyn’s closest allies, thrown on the defensive, said it was a massive distraction to claim the authors were Russian. The document was an authentic British government paper. But by then Labour’s explosives had been made safe. The story was the origin of the document, and not its content. With days to polling day, the Sunday Times reported British spies had found the documents had been circulated on Reddit, three German-language websites and a Twitter account. They had a similar dissemination pattern – including grammatical errors – used by Secondary Infektion, a Russian operation exposed by Facebook. Reddit itself said it had banned 61 accounts linked to the release of the documents because it believed the leak was “part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia”. There was no suggestion that Labour had acquired the documents illegally, although it could be argued the party did not advertise the fact that the documents had not been handed directly by a whistleblower. Last month on the eve of the publication of the much delayed intelligence and security committee report into Russian meddling into British democracy, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, formally confirmed the Reddit papers were part of a Russian hackers dump, and said there had been Russian effort to amplify the information’s existence, presumably through twitter. Now the near-final piece of the jigsaw has fallen into place. The documents were hacked from the office of the former trade secretary Liam Fox. Doubtless Corbyn will be criticised for being Russia’s useful but ineffective idiot, but it’s unlikely any politician in the moral maze of an election campaign will be so scrupulous as to spurn a chance to publicise an authentic and damaging document simply due to its murky origins."
2020-08-03T17:10:22Z,politics,Politics,Harassment claims: did Westminster's culture of impunity ever go away?,"The culture of silence and delay around MPs accused of harassment and bullying has not changed even with strict new systems in place, according to one of the high-profile complainants in parliament’s “Pestminster” scandal. Concerns have been raised over the handling of a complaint made by the alleged victim of a Conservative former minister arrested on suspicion of rape. She is alleged to have raised concern about the MP with the chief whip, Mark Spencer, in April but has said no action was taken and the MP still has the Conservative whip. Spencer is understood to have told the woman to make a formal complaint but said no issue of sexual abuse was raised. Ava Etemadzadeh, who is still waiting on the outcome of a sexual harassment complaint against the former Labour shadow cabinet minister Kelvin Hopkins almost three years after she made it, said the delays most complainants had to suffer was unacceptable. Hopkins denies all allegations against him. “We have seen the processes put in place, but it seems like the culture has not changed,” she said. “Any victim needs to have confidence that parties will not try to protect their own MPs when complaints are made. “These cases have to be dealt with in a timely way, the delay is unacceptable. Since 2017, a lot has changed since the MeToo movement, but parties have still been extremely slow to act.” Almost three years since the “Pestminster” scandal, where multiple MPs were accused of assault and lewd behaviour was seemingly tolerated by house authorities and party bosses, tough new measures have come into effect. An MP can be sacked and a byelection called if claims of bullying or inappropriate behaviour are proved. Complaints must now be handled by the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), which runs a helpline.
This year MPs voted in favour of supporting the formation of an independent panel of experts to deal with bullying and harassment allegations against them. Previously it had been MPs themselves who would decide on any actions. Multiple inquiries have found a general culture of impunity in Westminster, including one by Dame Laura Cox which found cases had “long been tolerated and concealed” in a culture of “deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence.” Yet the apparent delay in Spencer acting on a complaint of abusive behaviour has left many victims of that culture questioning whether it ever went away, despite the vaunted reforms to Westminster’s processes. The alleged victim told the Times she had been devastated by the failure to take action, saying it was “insulting and shows they never cared”. Spencer has since said he believes it is up to the whips to investigate the alleged crime, rather than the party. Spencer is understood to claim to have spoken only once to the complainant, advising her to complain via the independent process. The Metropolitan police have said they received allegations on Friday of sexual offences and assault relating to four incidents at addresses in London, including in Westminster.
Labour has promised it will introduce its own independent process for bullying and harassment complaints, which are currently heard by a panel of party members who are elected and can stand for election along factional lines. Etemadzadeh said she had been pleased to see the police take the most recent complaint against the unnamed former minister seriously, as well as with the conviction against the ex-Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke for sexual harassment. However, she said the Elphicke case had also shown up how MPs had closed ranks around a colleague. “The Charlie Elphicke case exposed how willing backbenchers were to believe anything their colleagues said – MPs at the 1922 Committee [of Conservative backbenchers] repeatedly campaigned for his reinstatement to the whip and believed his lies about MeToo being a witch-hunt,” she said.
Elphicke was convicted of sexually assaulting two women. He had had the whip removed in November 2017 when the allegations first surfaced, but it was controversially restored before a confidence vote in Theresa May’s leadership the following year. He was suspended again after being formally charged. Kate Maltby, the writer and critic who became another high-profile campaigner against harassment in Westminster, having accused the former cabinet minister Damian Green of propositioning her with a promise to help with her career, said there would always be a risk in bringing cases to the chief whip. “Frankly, going to the chief whip is rarely the answer,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We know that the office of the chief whip is the most partisan place in any political party. I would never encourage anyone to go to the chief whip. But I would encourage people to go to the new ICGS system, where I know a lot of people have put a lot of effort into establishing – because it has that political independence.” Green has denied allegations against him. He added at the time: “If she felt uncomfortable … then obviously I’m sorry about that. But I should emphasise again as I have done throughout that I didn’t believe I did anything inappropriate.” Maltby said politics was a place where personal patronage would always play a part. “I know still of female candidates in both parties who talk about men who have mentored them and championed them to become MPs who turn around and say there is a sexual cost expected to that.”"
2020-08-03T16:24:10Z,politics,Politics,"Who else would be more useless as a peer? They're in, said Boris | John Crace","The timing couldn’t have been more perfect. The second full day of recess and an emergency Downing Street press conference to announce that coronavirus wasn’t going to be all over by Christmas after all had ensured that little attention had been paid to Boris Johnson’s “summer holiday” peerages list. For Boris it had been the most fun he’d had since becoming prime minister a year ago. The chance to make good on his promise to level up the country by rewarding friends and family with jobs for life. It had, though, taken him a while to get into the swing of things. “I thought we had promised to reduce the numbers in the Lords, not increase them,” Boris had said to Dominic Cummings. “That’s what every prime minister says when he or she comes into office, so obviously we will say we remain committed to reducing the numbers while increasing them,” Classic Dom had replied. “Nobody can resist a bit of patronage once they get the chance. So just get stuck in and enjoy yourself.” Unusually for Boris, he started off somewhat cautiously, with peerages for Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond. Just to prove he had no lingering resentments towards two former MPs he couldn’t stand and had effectively thrown out of the Commons by withdrawing the party whip. Still, it wasn’t as if they would be in a position to do much harm in the Lords. Just a bit of box-ticking here and there. Then there had been something for Nigel Dodds. The least he could do after first stitching up the DUP over Northern Ireland in the Brexit withdrawal agreement and then calling a general election in which the DUP leader had lost his seat. “Don’t forget the money men,” Dom reminded him. “We wouldn’t want people to get the idea that donating large amounts of cash to the Tory party was no longer a safe way in to the House of Lords.” Michael Spencer’s name was hastily added to the list. As was Edward Lister’s. Steady Eddie had stood by him for years and was now his chief of staff. And hopefully most people would have forgotten his possible conflict of interest when he pocketed £487,000 from a Malaysian property developer when he was the £68k-per-year chairman of Homes England, a government body set up to fund affordable housing. There again, who really cared if they hadn’t. Boris hastily rattled his way through a few more names. He was tempted to leave out Charles Moore simply because the former editor of the Spectator had had his heart set on a peerage since he was 15 and it would have been great to disappoint him, but then largesse had won the day. Besides, Moore would be bound to be even more slavishly supportive in ermine. There also had to be something for Gisela Stuart. The former Labour MP had done her bit by keeping quiet as Boris and Michael Gove had told lie after lie on the Vote Leave campaign bus in 2016 and she could probably use the £300 per day. He’d heard she was down on her luck. Talking of which, Kate Hoey ought to make it on the list. Not because he particularly admired her – no one did – but because it would upset almost every Labour voter. “This just isn’t really doing it for me,” said Dom. “I mean, it’s OK. We have a decent haul of objectionable people. But we need to do better, with some really big names. Names that will really prove to everyone that we are taking the piss big time. That we really don’t give a shit what anyone thinks. So let me give you some suggestions. Evgeny Lebedev, for example.” “You’re kidding me,” Boris replied. “He’s really only famous for giving lavish parties to posh people – just remember the state I was in when I got back from Perugia – and he’s the son of a former KGB agent. We’ll never get away with this just a week after the ISC report highlighting excessive levels of infiltration into British political life by Russian oligarchs.” “Just watch us. And then you could also go for Claire Fox.” “Wasn’t she a member of the Revolutionary Communist party who said the Bosnian genocide was fake news, has refused to apologise for defending the IRA bombing in Warrington and is dedicated to overthrowing the House of Lords?” “Sure, but they all say that until they’re asked to join the club. Now she’s a rightwing rent-a-gob who will do anything for a bit of attention.” “OK, you’re on,” said Boris, warming to his task. “Then let’s also include Ian Botham. Not for his cricketing achievements, obviously, but just because he’s a Brexiteer who became so boring he was even dropped from the Sky commentary team.” “Loving it,” said Classic Dom. “Talking of boring, how about we also appoint a former Tory MP who was so spectacularly forgettable he never achieved anything of any importance throughout his entire career?” “Not Henry Bellingham?” “The very same. Can you imagine anyone who will be more useless as a peer? Present company excluded of course.” Eventually Boris had decided on 35 names, along with a knighthood for Philip May. But he could still do with one more name. Then it came to him. The People’s Government had done corruption, incompetence and cronyism, but somehow nepotism had been overlooked. Within seconds he was on the phone to his brother. “I’m making you a peer, Jo,” he said. “But what for? I haven’t done anything.” “That’s the whole point, old boy. Besides, you haven’t done any less than some of the others on my list.” “Dad will go bonkers. He’s desperate for a peerage.” “I know. But it will be great to make him sweat for another year or two.” • This article was amended on 4 August 2020 to remove a reference to Denis Thatcher, who received a hereditary baronetcy, rather than peerage."
2020-08-03T15:17:14Z,politics,Politics,Cabinet minister 'lobbied Boris Johnson to help Charlie Elphicke',"A cabinet minister lobbied the prime minister to help Charlie Elphicke after the Conservative MP was charged with sexual assault, the Guardian has been told. Questions resurfaced about the Tory party’s handling of the case last week after Elphicke was convicted of three counts of sexual assault against two women in 2007 and 2016. He is due to be sentenced later this year and could face a jail term. Elphicke, who represented Dover from 2010 until last year, is understood to have asked cabinet ministers to help him after the allegations were referred to the police in 2017. In November 2019, having been charged in July that year following 20 months of police investigation, he succeeded in getting a member of Boris Johnson’s cabinet to raise his case with the prime minister, according to a source.
“Charlie went around saying that he had no idea why he was being investigated, so in a way there was a legitimate case for why people felt that he was being unfairly treated,” said the source, who has knowledge of discussions among ministers at the time. “From that point of view there was a certain amount of confusion and good people thought he was being unfairly treated. He was saying he had no idea, which can’t have been the case.” The source added: “He successfully lobbied one of Boris [Johnson’s] … cabinet ministers, who raised it and said: ‘We should do something, prime minister, to help Charlie.’” While Johnson was said to have been “initially sympathetic”, another member of the cabinet strongly warned him against intervening and he did not do so, it is understood. The Cabinet Office and No 10 have been contacted to ask for their response and whether they can confirm that Elphicke’s case was raised with Johnson by one of his ministers. The revelation raises further questions about the manner in which senior Conservatives handled Elphicke’s case when he was under criminal investigation, and the extent to which MPs continued to support him. Elphicke lost the Tory whip in 2017 when the sexual assault allegations were referred to the police, but was reinstated in December 2018 before a vote of confidence in the then prime minister, Theresa May. The Guardian has also been told of deep unease among some Conservative MPs, particularly women, at the reaction from male Tory MPs when Elphicke and Andrew Griffiths, a colleague who had the party whip removed after being accused of sexually inappropriate conduct, were welcomed back into the fold. “There was a lot of thumping of tables with fists and I remember just looking across at another woman with a frozen look,” said one Conservative who was in attendance at a meeting of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory MPs in December 2018. Griffiths, who sent lewd text messages to two young women, was cleared of wrongdoing by the parliamentary standards watchdog in September last year. Ed Davey, the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: “People will be deeply disturbed to hear that a cabinet minister thought it acceptable to appeal directly to the prime minister to pull strings for a Tory MP facing serious criminal charges.” There was also reaction from the Women’s Equality party (WEP), which said the minister who lobbied on Elphicke’s behalf should be sacked for breaches of the ministerial code. “Just as with Epstein, this shows how powerful men protect one another rather than protecting the victims of these terrible crimes,” said a spokesperson. Jolyon Maugham, the barrister and director of the Good Law Project campaign group, said: “These interventions in the criminal justice system – highly inappropriate interventions to protect their own from criminal sanction – are happening more and more.” The Crown Prosecution Service said after the verdict in Elphicke’s case at Southwark crown court on Thursday that Elphicke “had abused his power and influence over these women to make unwanted and forceful sexual advances towards them”. The father of two was released on bail but was warned by the judge, Mrs Justice Whipple, that he faced the “very real possibility” of prison. Elphicke’s wife, Natalie, who became the MP for Dover after her husband did not stand for the seat in last year’s general election, announced shortly after the verdict that their marriage of 25 years was over. Giving evidence at his trial last Monday, her husband admitted not telling police the truth when they asked him about one of the women he was accused of sexually assaulting, saying he feared it would destroy his marriage. Both of the women who accused Elphicke gave evidence during the trial. One of them, speaking via video link, said she feared for her safety and locked herself in a room when Elphicke ran after her and tried to smack her bottom following the assault. She said he chased her down the stairs at his London home chanting “I’m a naughty Tory”."
2020-08-03T15:14:06Z,politics,Politics,"Sir Philip Barton to head Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","Sir Philip Barton, the British high commissioner to India for a matter of weeks, has been appointed by Downing Street to head the newly merged Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. As permanent undersecretary of the department from next month, he will play a critical role in preparing the post-Brexit “global Britain” policy. The lightning promotion to run the newly merged department indicates the degree of haste with which decisions are being taken in Whitehall. Barton had only just started to make public appearances in India after promising to be a bridge between India and the UK. He was previously director general responsible for the UK government’s long-term strategic response to the coronavirus outbreak. He is in effect taking over from the current Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) permanent undersecretary, Sir Simon McDonald, who is standing down as part of a widespread changing of the guard at the top of Whitehall. The cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, is also retiring, as is the head of MI6, Alex Younger, who is being replaced by the political director at the Foreign Office, Richard Moore. Barton faces the task of pressing ahead with the merger of the FCO and Department for International Development (DfID), which is due to be completed by the end of September. The process will involve reforming departmental salary structures and deciding new lines of accountability between the old DfID staff in the field and the local diplomatic network. Many DfID staff fear their poverty reduction work will be undermined by a diplomatic staff determined to put UK commercial interests first.
Barton will face the continuing consequences of leaving the EU, requiring the Foreign Office to move resources towards bilateral relations in individual European capitals, and away from Brussels. He will also need to manage the consequences of a November presidential election in the US, which may not have a direct impact on future relations with China but could require a UK review of its relations with Russia and in the Middle East. Barton was acting chairman of the joint intelligence committee from 2016 to 2017. He has also worked in the Cabinet Office as director general on the 2016 anti-corruption summit hosted by the then prime minister, David Cameron, and director of foreign policy and Afghanistan/Pakistan coordinator supporting the National Security Council. He was private secretary to the prime ministers John Major and Tony Blair. His appointment as high commissioner to India was announced on 6 February. He arrived in Delhi on 12 June before completing his quarantine on 26 June and presenting his credentials to the Indian president on 8 July. As director general consular and security, he had last summer been acting permanent secretary at the FCO during McDonald’s summer break."
2020-08-03T14:30:34Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson 'still committed to Lords reduction' despite 36 peerages,"Downing Street has insisted the government remains committed to reducing the size of the House of Lords despite the creation of 36 new life peers last week, the second-highest number added to the upper house for more than two decades. The new peerages – which include figures closely associated with Boris Johnson’s political career and the Brexit campaign – came as research showed the Lords was becoming even more unrepresentative of the general population. Not a single peer comes primarily from a manual or skilled trade background, according to data from the Electoral Reform Society. As the UK faces its greatest public health crisis in more than 100 years, just 2.2% work in healthcare, compared with one in 10 of the general public. Boris Johnson’s spokesman has meanwhile declined to comment on any of the individual peerages, such as for the Russian-born newspaper owner Evgeny Lebedev and the Brexit-supporting former cricketer Ian Botham, saying only that people were “nominated in recognition of their contribution to society”.
The spokesman also declined to say whether Johnson agreed with the views of Colin Parry, the peace campaigner whose son Tim died in the 1993 IRA bombing in Warrington. Parry has condemned the elevation of the former Brexit party MEP Claire Fox, who has refused to apologise for having defended the IRA’s planting of the bomb, when she was a member of the Revolutionary Communist party. Responding to the list of appointments, Darren Hughes, the chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said the House of Lords was looking “more and more like a retirement home for the PM’s allies”. Johnson loyalists and allies who were also handed peerages included his chief strategic adviser, Edward Lister; Veronica Wadley, the former Evening Standard editor who supported Johnson during his London mayoralty, and Charles Moore, who was his editor at the Daily Telegraph. Others included James Wharton, a former Tory MP who ran Johnson’s 2019 campaign to replace Theresa May as party leader, and Daniel Moylan, a combative Eurosceptic who advised him as London mayor and, later, on Brexit. The elevation of Moylan, formerly a deputy leader at Kensington and Chelsea council – where he played a key role in planning – also came under attack on Monday from Grenfell Tower survivors and firefighters. Moylan was described by the Grenfell United group as being “at the heart of a culture that held residents in contempt”. There was also a peerage for Lorraine Fullbrook, a former Tory MP whose husband, Mark, is the business partner of Johnson’s long-term strategy guru Lynton Crosby, and who himself was involved in the prime minister’s 2019 Tory leadership bid. Also nominated was the financier Helena Morrissey, a campaigner for greater female representation on company boards, but also someone who played a key role as a cheerleader for Brexit in the City of London. The government insisted it would still adhere to a plan agreed when Theresa May was in No 10, which committed to gradually reducing the 800-plus size of the Lords down to about 600. Norman Fowler, the Lord Speaker, called the creation of the 36 peers “a massive policy U-turn”. But Johnson’s spokesman denied the policy had been abandoned: “No. It remains the case that the size of the House of Lords needs addressing, but given retirements and other departures, some new members are needed to ensure the Lords has appropriate expertise and it continues to fulfil its role in scrutinising and revising legislation.” The spokesman said Johnson’s honours roll was “less than other, comparative lists”. However, while several recent lists contained more honours overall, the number of peerages is greater than all but one recent list. It was exceeded by the 45 peers created by David Cameron ahead of the 2015 general election. Cameron’s resignation list created 16, and Theresa May’s 19. Neither Tony Blair or Gordon Brown had resignation honours lists. Ahead of the 2001, 2005 and 2010 elections, they created 24, 27 and 24 new peers respectively. After the 1997 election, 57 new peers were created for John Major’s resignation list, but 31 of these were new Labour “working peers”, intended to help reduce the then-Conservative majority in the upper house. When asked about the relatively large numbers, the spokesman said: “The point I was making is it’s a longstanding convention that individuals can be nominated for an honour or a peerage in recognition of their public and political service, and that prime ministers can draw up dissolution or resignation lists.” Asked about other comments from Fowler that the size of the Lords, which will rise to 830 members, meant some of the new peers risked being “passengers”, the spokesman said: “All of the individuals were nominated in recognition of their contribution to society and their public and political service. Peers are appointed to further contribute to public service in parliament.”"
2020-08-03T13:00:41Z,politics,Politics,Tory-linked PR firm granted Â£3m Covid-19 contract without tender,"The political communications company behind the Conservative party’s controversial 2019 digital campaign strategy received a £3m government contract to work on Covid-19 messaging without a competitive tender and is negotiating with the Cabinet Office for more work, the Guardian and openDemocracy can reveal. Topham Guerin, founded in 2016 by two young New Zealanders, Sean Topham and Ben Guerin, specialises in producing images and videos for social media and has worked for a number of rightwing political parties. It was behind two Tory election campaign stunts that attracted widespread criticism: renaming the official Conservative party Twitter account “factcheckUK” during the leaders’ debate, and setting up a website presented as Labour’s manifesto. An investigation by the Guardian and openDemocracy found that on 17 March, shortly before the UK went into lockdown, Topham Guerin was contracted by the Cabinet Office to work on the government’s public communications.
Under emergency Covid-19 regulations that allow the government to ditch usual competitive tendering practices, no tender was conducted to allow other companies to bid for that work. A six-month contract was subsequently formalised on 7 May, with a retrospective 17 March start date, for a total of £3m. The details were not made public until mid-July. Topham Guerin is the latest Conservative party-linked company known to have received contracts from the government under the emergency procurement rules. Others include Faculty – an AI company that worked for the prime minister’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, on the Vote Leave campaign in 2016 – and Public First, a policy and research firm owned by two long-term associates of both Cummings and the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove.
The Topham Guerin contract sets out the high-level responsibilities of the firm, including that its staff will attend daily meetings at Downing Street or the Cabinet Office, lead the branding strategy and produce social media content. The contract also said the role would include weekly meetings with the British army’s information unit, the 77th Brigade, “to review fake news mitigation efforts and provide recommendations on further actions to take”. A Cabinet Office spokesman told the Guardian that Topham Guerin had principally been producing social media messages, and that the meetings with the 77th Brigade never took place. The Guardian has previously reported that Topham and Guerin, who are in their 20s, worked on huge propaganda campaigns for CTF Partners, run by the Tories’ long-term strategist Sir Lynton Crosby, on behalf of clients including major polluters, the Saudi Arabian government and anti-cycling groups.
After its work on the Tory election campaign last year, Topham Guerin took on more staff at its Mayfair office in January and February. Among these appointments was Deborah Feldman, a former Conservative staffer who previously worked for CTF as managing director. While the £3m contract with Topham Guerin runs until 16 September, the Guardian has learned that the Cabinet Office is negotiating a new contract with the firm. It is not clear what the proposed contract is for, or if it will be tendered competitively. The company did not respond to a question about the new contract, and a Cabinet Office spokesman said it did not comment on ongoing negotiations. The spokesman said the firm, which started in New Zealand politics and worked on Scott Morrison’s Liberal party election victory in Australia last year, was selected for the Covid-19 contract due to its “wealth of experience in communications”. “Topham Guerin were awarded a contract to help advise and generate social media content to support coronavirus communications,” the spokesman added. “This has been published on gov.uk in the normal way, in line with transparency rules. This work has helped to ensure that vitally important public health messages are effectively communicated to the public.” A spokesman for Topham Guerin said the company had provided direction for the Enjoy Summer Safely campaign by the advertising agency Mullenlowe. “Topham Guerin are proud to have worked with both the New Zealand and UK governments to provide creative and digital support for their all-of-government responses to the Covid-19 crisis,” he said.
The shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, criticised the awarding of the contract without a tender to the former campaigners on behalf of the Tories. “Given the huge importance of communications during a deadly pandemic, work of this magnitude must surely be undertaken by longstanding, proven expertise in public health communications,” Reeves said."
2020-08-02T20:00:21Z,politics,Politics,"Nazir Afzal: CPS, Met and Durham police 'closed ranks' over Cummings case","Nazir Afzal, a former regional chief prosecutor, has questioned the impartiality of Durham police, the Met and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) after they all rejected his requests for a thorough investigation into alleged lockdown breaches by Dominic Cummings. Afzal, former north-west chief crown prosecutor, said the police and his successors had “closed ranks” on the issue and ignored the “deep public concern” over Cummings’ trip to Durham and Barnard Castle after they were exposed by the Guardian and the Daily Mirror. The inaction of police and prosecutors has prompted Afzal and his lawyers to begin preparing a dossier of evidence on Cummings’ lockdown movements at the height of the pandemic. They have also issued an appeal to the public for help in compiling it. Last month lawyers for Afzal urged CPS and the Met to thoroughly investigate why the prime minister’s chief aide left his home in London for Durham on the day his wife showed coronavirus symptoms and when he admitted there was a “distinct probability” he had already caught the virus too. They also asked Durham police to reopen its investigation into Cummings movements in the county, claiming its initial three-day probe was “short, narrow and limited”. Both police forces and the CPS have now rejected the request. Explaining its decision, in letter to Afzal, the Met said: “It would not be prudent for resources to be spent on the same or similar allegations.”
Durham police refused to add to its press statement about its investigation which found Cummings had probably breached health protection regulations when he took a 52-mile round trip to Barnard Castle with his wife and son on her birthday. But it made no finding over Cummings’ initial decision to leave London, because it was confined to his movements in County Durham. The CPS told Afzal it would take no action unless invited to do so by the police. Afzal, whose older brother Umar died of coronavirus when he was self-isolating at home on 8 April – when Cummings was in Durham – said: “Contrary to my experience while in post, neither the police nor the CPS appear to have an interest in this important issue of deep public concern.” He also questioned their impartiality, adding: “You have to ask, what do they have to hide and whose side are they on?” Last week the former chief constable of Durham, Mike Barton, said Cummings’ behaviour had made it more difficult for officers to enforce the rules and his name had been cited by some as as an excuse for law-breaking. Barton added: “If the public don’t think the police are operating in a fair and impartial way, you won’t get their trust and you won’t get their support.” The warning came as research showed that Cummings’ behaviour was a key factor in breaking down a sense of national unity over the lockdown. Afzal said: “It doesn’t fill me with much confidence that they chose to close ranks when the recent survey shows that public compliance with the lockdown regulations was significantly impacted by the actions of Cummings and the inadequacy of the government and police response.” Afzal’s solicitor, Mike Schwarz, a partner at the firm Hodge Jones & Allen, said: “We appeal to any witness who can shed light on Mr Cummings’ activities, especially in March and April, to come forward. We are driven by what others should be doing – compiling a dossier of evidence and making our own assessment as to whether a prosecution should follow and presenting it to the director of public prosecutions.” Anyone with information is urged to email Schwarz, at mschwarz@hja.net."
2020-08-02T18:55:41Z,politics,Politics,Len McCluskey praised by Labour MPs for ordering Unite funding review,"The leader of Unite, Len McCluskey, has been praised by left-leaning Labour MPs for ordering a review of the union’s political donations after Keir Starmer’s decision to pay damages to former staff turned antisemitism whistleblowers. Ian Lavery, the party chair under Jeremy Corbyn, is one of three former shadow ministers who have told the Guardian they support the union’s general secretary for re-examining whether to donate to Labour in the wake of the six-figure settlements. Their interventions will increase tensions between the Socialist Campaign Group of MPs and Labour’s leader following the latter’s decision to apologise and pay damages to seven staff who claimed they had been defamed by senior party figures after taking part in a BBC Panorama documentary on antisemitism. It comes amid growing speculation about the future leadership of the UK’s three biggest unions – Unite, Unison and the GMB – which are responsible for a majority of Labour’s funds. McCluskey, whose union has given Labour around £7m since January 2019, said on Saturday that paying the damages was an “abuse of members’ money”. He told the Observer: “A lot of it is Unite’s money and I’m already being asked all kinds of questions by my executive. It’s as though a huge sign has been put up outside the Labour party with ‘queue here with your writ and get your payment over there’.” Lavery, who was also shadow minister for trade unions under Corbyn, said: “What Len says is extremely important. I have had people asking me from Unite if it is right that members’ money is used to finance Keir’s legal challenges and pay compensation when the advice that the party allegedly had was that the party was in a very strong position to defend the claims. “People have got to be accountable and responsible. You cannot expect unions to pump millions of pounds into the party if the party isn’t accountable.” Another former shadow cabinet minister agreed: “Starmer is on warning that he must work with everyone across the movement and cash has to be accounted for. The lurch to the right will not be paid for with union subs.” Another said: “Len said what a lot of us have been thinking.” The party settled with the ex-staffers as part of an attempt to draw a line under the antisemitism row. However, Labour officials warned the shadow cabinet last month that mounting legal action related to antisemitism could cost the party hundreds of thousands of pounds over the next year. One Starmer loyalist dismissed McCluskey and Lavery’s criticisms. “They are fighting a battle over antisemitism they could not win when they were in charge and now they want Keir to make the same mistakes. It is a silly position to take and deeply insulting for many Jewish members,” they said. McCluskey, 69, also said he intends to stay in charge at Unite until his tenure ends in 2022, amid growing speculation he could stand down early as well as electioneering from some of his close union allies. Meanwhile the Unison leader, Dave Prentis, has announced that he will be stepping down at the end of the year, while Tim Roache stood down as general secretary of the GMB in April amid allegations of misconduct. The “Big Three” unions, which represent more than 3 million workers, not only contribute most of Labour’s funds, but also sponsor MPs and influence votes on policy and party rules. Although the top of the union movement is still dominated by middle-aged white men, there are female or BAME candidates standing for each position. Speculation McCluskey may step down had increased after United Left, the faction which has dominated Unite, held a ballot last month and decided to back the union’s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, to become the next leader. Sharon Graham, Unite’s organising director said to be separate from McCluskey’s inner circle, is also planning to stand. After the GMB announced it had received an anonymous letter containing claims about Roache’s conduct, the union asked a QC to launch an independent investigation into allegations of wrongdoing. Roache vehemently denies the allegations. Nominations for his successor will close next month. Rehana Azam, the union’s national secretary who has co-ordinated its response to the Covid 19 crisis, is expected to be a popular frontrunner. Gary Smith, the union’s secretary in Scotland, is also expected to stand. The inquiry, conducted by Karon Monaghan QC, is expected to hang heavy over the election, following claims that other executives and staff were involved in inappropriate spending. The union said: “The need for a full, transparent and independent investigation following a number of very serious allegations made by way of anonymous correspondence received by the union has been agreed.” In a statement released in April, Roache said: “I have spent 40 years defending people based on evidence and the right to natural justice. This anonymous letter affords me neither.” Candidates standing for the top job in Unison, where two-thirds of members are women, include Margaret Greer, who would become both the first female and the first black general secretary of the UK’s biggest union if she wins. Glasgow-born Christina McAnea, who is currently assistant general secretary, is also standing. Two other BAME candidates are also standing. Roger McKenzie, an assistant general secretary who is on the left of the union, and Hugo Pierre, a Socialist party member. Nominations open on 10 August."
2020-08-02T12:35:09Z,politics,Politics,No 10 criticised over drive to recruit White House-style spokesperson,"Downing Street is being accused by Labour of flouting Whitehall rules to hire a new White House-style spokesperson to host daily government press conferences on live TV. A new special adviser is being recruited to reply to questions from journalists including rebuffing criticisms from opposition politicians. But the special advisers’ code of conduct stipulates that politically appointed staff cannot speak publicly or engage in political controversy. The Cabinet Office is aware that the rules will be interpreted at the discretion of Boris Johnson. Labour has criticised the move, amid concern that Dominic Cummings is dropping the previous practice of asking ministers to answer for government policy. The shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, told the Guardian: “Once again, this government is showing its willingness to play fast and loose with the rules when it comes to Boris Johnson’s closest advisers. And once again, they are showing contempt for the most basic requirements for accountability. “Elected politicians answerable to parliament should be delivering the government’s messages; not well-paid appointees accountable to no one but the prime minister.”
The job advert placed on the Conservative party’s website has led to speculation that the government is hoping to employ a broadcaster who may already be well known to the public. Placed on the Conservative LinkedIn page, the advert describes the job as a chance to “communicate with the nation on behalf of the prime minister”. “Essential skills” include “excellent risk management and crisis communication skills”. US presidential spokesmen such as Sean Spicer and Anthony Scaramucci became household names, and found themselves at the centre of controversy. But in the UK, twice daily media briefings have been held behind closed doors, with a civil servant taking questions from a group of accredited journalists, known as the lobby. Questions regarding party matters are referred to the political party’s spokespeople. Under the new plan, a special adviser – a politically appointed civil servant who answers directly to a minister – will answer questions in front of television cameras. According to point 14 in the special advisers’ code of conduct, “special advisers must not take public part in political controversy, through any form of statement whether in speeches or letters to the press, or in books, social media, articles or leaflets … briefing on purely party political matters must be handled by the party machine.” A senior government source suggested it was a normal “special adviser” job and the code was at the discretion of the prime minister. As EU negotiator, David Frost is among those classed as special advisers but who have also given high-profile speeches, notably in February when he set out the UK’s vision for Brexit. In a further development, the union for senior civil servants has claimed that the Cabinet Office has confirmed suspicions that cabinet ministers are no longer expected to choose their special advisers. A senior official from the propriety and ethics team wrote to the FDA union on 14 July to say that an appointing minister as well as the prime minister are expected to agree before a “spad” is taken on. “I can confirm that it is still a requirement for the appointing minister, as well as the prime minister, to agree to the appointment of a special adviser,” the official wrote. The ministerial code says it is cabinet ministers who choose their advisers, who must then be approved by the prime minister. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA, said the letter showed a power shift that had left special advisers with few employment rights. “It is now clear that ministers are expected to approve their allocated special adviser from No 10, a complete reversal of the arrangements envisaged under the ministerial code. “As we witnessed with the resignation of former chancellor Sajid Javid, even the most powerful ministers in cabinet are expected to accept the advisers picked for them by No 10. “Special advisers are now left without security of employment, can be dismissed almost at will by the PM and are under the direct management of Dominic Cummings. These changes are not about effective government, but more effective control for No 10,” he said. A Whitehall source insisted that there had been no fundamental change."
2020-08-02T06:17:04Z,politics,Politics,Jeremy Corbyn makes fresh complaint over rejected House of Lords nominees,"Jeremy Corbyn has raised renewed concerns over the decision to reject his nominees for seats in the House of Lords, amid anger on the left over a raft of peerages announced last week. It is understood the former Labour leader has again complained to the cabinet office about the rejection of a peerage for Karie Murphy, a former Labour official and a close ally.
A peerage for Murphy, as well as for other Corbyn nominations, the former speaker John Bercow and former deputy leader Tom Watson, were turned down by the independent House of Lords appointment commission, which vets nominees. The former Labour leader had wanted to install Murphy in the Lords to work on trade union rights. Corbyn did not respond to a request for comment. Anger over the rejection has re-emerged on the left after a series of prominent Corbyn critics were cleared to join the second chamber. Peerages were given to Frank Field, John Woodcock, Ian Austen, Gisela Stuart and Kate Hoey – all former Labour MPs who had opposed their former leader. Insiders believe that Murphy’s nomination was blocked in light of the investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission into Labour’s handling of alleged antisemitism. Murphy was one of the most powerful figures inside Labour under Corbyn’s leadership. She denies any wrongdoing. Previously asked about the rejection of Corbyn’s nominees, a Downing Street spokesman made clear that vetting was a matter for an independent commission. He added: “There is no automatic entitlement to a peerage for any holder of high office.”
The complaints from the left came as Boris Johnson was also criticised for continuing to expand the Lords to “ridiculous” proportions. His list prompted accusations of cronyism. It included his brother Jo Johnson, his chief strategic adviser Sir Edward Lister, and the Russian-born billionaire newspaper proprietor Evgeny Lebedev. A major Tory donor and prominent Brexiters, including former England cricketer Sir Ian Botham, were also included. Lord Fowler, the former Tory cabinet minister and now Lord Speaker, warned that the prime minister was encouraging “passenger” peers by frustrating plans to reduce the size of the Lords. The second chamber will now have almost 200 more members than the Commons. The House of Lords had previously backed plans to reduce the number of peers to 600. “I do think the prime minister has got to stop these kinds of mass appointments because I think the public are unimpressed with it,” Lord Fowler told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I think most of us in the House of Lords are unimpressed with it and it is not necessary – we don’t need a House of Lords of 830. “It is ridiculous because it is far too many for the duties... What you are doing is encouraging some in the House of Lords who are quite frankly passengers and don’t make much effort in any event.” A government spokeswoman said: “As has been the case under successive administrations, distinguished individuals are periodically appointed as peers to enable the House of Lords to fulfil its role as a revising and scrutinising chamber while respecting the primacy of the Commons.”"
2020-08-01T19:00:51Z,politics,Politics,Len McCluskey: ‘Labour should not be taking Unite’s money for granted’,"Len McCluskey, the uncompromising general secretary of the Unite union, chuckles at the suggestion that his tenure in charge of Labour’s most generous financial backer will come to a premature end. “There’s lots of people who would be delighted to see the back of me, but they’re gonna have to put up with me a little longer,” he says. “I’m going nowhere.” As one of the most powerful supporters of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, rumours that he would depart before his mandate ends in April 2022 were seen as evidence that Labour’s left, so dominant under Corbyn, was melting away. In a wide-ranging interview with the Observer, however, McCluskey not only insists he will be in charge until his mandate expires, he also says the left is regrouping, that it will continue to demand a major say over Labour’s direction – and puts Keir Starmer on notice against any shift to the right.
McCluskey waves a leaflet, Starmer’s 10 campaign pledges, which included higher tax on the wealthy, the abolition of tuition fees, the “common ownership” of rail, mail, energy and water, and ending NHS outsourcing. “The fact is that Keir Starmer ran on a radical programme, some might say a Corbyn programme, and of course I keep this to hand,” he says. “I intend to keep that front and centre for the coming months and years. “He has our support. That means that initially, in the first 100 days which he’s gone through, he has to make his mark. He has to do things – it’s almost like a honeymoon period. You get away with certain things. And my view with the left was, ‘look, just calm down until we get to the stage of whether there’s a shift in and a move in policies, because that would constitute a problem ... Keir has got to steer that way through’. For me, he has to recognise that the ship he is sailing, if it lists too much to the right, then it will go under.”
Unite and other unions are watching Starmer carefully, he says. “There will be some interesting debates and discussions in the coming months with Keir, not only for myself but all the unions on the left who are equally in a situation at the moment where they’re wondering where we are, what direction are we going in. Are we in the 10 pledge direction? If so, then good.” There is one early decision, though, that has infuriated McCluskey – the party’s decision to pay “substantial damages” to seven former party workers who turned whistleblowers over antisemitism in a BBC Panorama documentary. They sued after the party suggested they had acted in bad faith. There is “no doubt” Unite’s executive committee will now want to review the huge sums it gives to Labour – more than £7m since the start of 2019, according to Electoral Commission records – McCluskey says, calling the settlement a “huge miscalculation”. He says that Labour’s own legal advice stated it would successfully fight the claims in court – a statement disputed by party sources. “It’s quite extraordinary, especially from a barrister,” he says. “All of us want to try to draw a line under the issue [of antisemitism]. The quicker the last antisemite in the Labour party is expelled and kicked out, the better for all of us. So I understood him wanting to do that, but you have to balance things. “There were lots of claims and criticisms that the Labour party was institutionally antisemitic. I absolutely reject that.” He also points to a leaked report, drawn up at the end of Corbyn’s leadership, that alleges some staff, opposed to the leader during the 2017 election, took money away from his team’s control. Would Unite really ever stop paying Labour’s bills? “It would be a mistake if anybody took Unite for granted. I think that would be a mistake.”
While he is reserving judgment on Labour policy, he has some early concerns about tactics. “At the moment there seems to be almost an attitude that says, ‘well, let’s say nothing, let’s keep quiet’. I think that’s dangerous,” he says. “There’s nothing wrong with caution, so long as that doesn’t slip into fear or timidity. I think that’s exactly what happened to Ed Miliband. “I worry about what I hear coming out of the Treasury team. It’s got individuals in there that I have a huge question mark over.” Who? “Pat McFadden, Wes Streeting, [prominent Corbyn critics] who are not only cautious, but effectively believe that the last five years of [former shadow chancellor John] McDonnell’s alternative economic strategy was a disaster.” The left is bruised, but not defeated, he says. “I was trying to persuade Jeremy and John that this perceived move towards a second referendum and Remain was going to be disastrous [at the last election],” he says. “The scale of the defeat was difficult to contemplate and therefore, of course, the left and the so-called Corbyn project, socialism, took a major hit. The election of Keir against the perceived left candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey was a further disappointment. So people have to brush themselves down, but the reports of the left’s death are greatly exaggerated.” In fact, he says there are plans for a rejuvenation of the left – a “major gathering” that is likely to feature Corbyn himself. Won’t it be seen as a rival to Labour’s official conference, reinforcing splits? “I’ve no doubt that people may see it as an alternative. It’s not supposed to be an alternative. It’s supposed to be a declaration that we are here. We are going nowhere. And we stand for those principles of radicalism and socialism that we’ve fought for all our lives.”"
2020-08-01T19:00:50Z,politics,Politics,Unite sounds warning over Labour antisemitism payouts,"Labour’s biggest union backer will review its political donations in light of Keir Starmer’s decision to pay damages to ex-staffers who claimed the party had not dealt with antisemitism, its general secretary has warned. In an interview with the Observer, Unite leader Len McCluskey said there was “no doubt” the union’s ruling executive would be demanding a review of the millions it donates to the Labour party in the wake of the six-figure settlements. “It’s an abuse of members’ money,” he said. “A lot of it is Unite’s money and I’m already being asked all kinds of questions by my executive. It’s as though a huge sign has been put up outside the Labour party with ‘queue here with your writ and get your payment over there’.
McCluskey’s robust intervention will intensify the infighting prompted by the party’s decision to apologise and pay damages to seven staff who turned whistleblower for a BBC Panorama documentary on antisemitism. The party accused them of acting in bad faith, but settled as part of an attempt to draw a line under the antisemitism row. Former leader Jeremy Corbyn condemned the payouts. Any loss of financial support from Unite would pose a major problem for Labour. While its large membership provides some income, the union remains its biggest donor by far. It has given the central party more than £7m since the start of 2019, according to Electoral Commission records. In a wide-ranging interview, McCluskey put Starmer on notice that he would fight any shift to the right. He said it would “constitute a problem” if Starmer edged away from his 10 leadership campaign pledges, which included Corbyn-era policies such as higher taxes on the wealthy, abolishing tuition fees and “common ownership” of rail, mail, energy and water. “He has to recognise that the ship he is sailing, if it lists too much to the right, will go under,” he said. “We’ll have to wait to see how the situation unfolds. Unite is financially a very powerful and strong union. We have a political fund that is the largest in the whole of Europe. So of course, my members would expect that we are influential in that respect. There will be some interesting debates and discussions in the coming months with Keir, not only for myself but all the unions on the left who are equally in a situation at the moment where they’re wondering where we are, what direction are we going.”He also warned Starmer against the timidity that he says sank Ed Miliband’s leadership. “There’s nothing wrong with caution, so long as that doesn’t slip into fear or timidity,” he said.
Following suggestions that the left has lost power and influence since Corbyn’s departure as leader, McCluskey revealed that figures across the left would gather for a major event this autumn. “I don’t see the creation of an alternative party to Labour. But I do think it is the duty and the legitimacy of the left to continue to argue for our views and our thoughts and our policies.” He said Starmer had to ensure he was including the left. “He seems to me to be really genuine about wanting to unite the party. But my message to him would be, you need to start making certain that you reach out the hand to the left – that they are an integral part of his thinking.” McCluskey denied reports that he would step down from his role earlier than expected. “My period in office finishes in April 2022 and I’ll be in charge until then,” he said. “This next six- to 12-month period is going to be very, very crucial in industry. That’s my main priority – and of course that spills over into politics, because what the government does, what Labour is campaigning for, matters.”"
2020-07-31T17:43:22Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus live: England at limit of lockdown easing, says Whitty; official UK death toll passes 46,000 – as it happened","A further easing of lockdown measures in England planned for 1 August was delayed for at least two weeks. In the surprise move for businesses that were planning to reopen tomorrow, Boris Johnson said he was pausing the reopening of higher risk indoor settings including casinos and bowling alleys, and preventing beauty salons resuming close-up treatments, for at least a fortnight. Pilot sports events would be cancelled from 1 August and the move to allow wedding receptions to have up to 30 guests from this weekend was also reversed. However, shielding advice for up to 2.2 million people who were advised to avoid leaving their homes from March would be lifted as planned on Saturday. Sage said it did not have confidence that the reproduction rate was currently below 1 in England. The government postponed the further lockdown easing after new Office for National Statistics data showed infection levels in England were at about 4,200 new cases per day as of 23 July, the highest number since mid-May and, at 31%, the highest week-on-week percentage increase in the same period. Englandâ€™s chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said the country appears to be â€œat the outer edgeâ€� of how far society can reopen safely amid the continued prevalence of the virus. It comes as large areas in the north of England faced new curbs and restrictions which were hastily announced last night. Rules on the wearing of face coverings will be extended to more indoor settings from 8 August. The prime minister announced that masks should be worn in indoor venues including museums, galleries and cinemas, and that this would be enforceable by law. The Scottish government strongly advised against all but essential travel to parts of northern England which are facing new lockdown restrictions. Following a rise in coronavirus cases in Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire, Nicola Sturgeon urged anyone intending to travel to those areas to cancel their plans. Boris Johnson was accused of â€œthe worst kind of cronyismâ€� after he granted peerages to his brother Jo Johnson, as well as Tory grandees and Brexit allies. Among the list of 36 figures heading to the House of Lords were the ex-England cricket player and Brexit supporter Sir Ian Botham, newspaper owner Evgeny Lebedev and numerous former Labour MPs who rebelled against the partyâ€™s position to support Brexit, including Kate Hoey, Ian Austin and Gisela Stuart. Philip May, the husband of the former PM Theresa May, will receive a knighthood. The Tory MP Craig Whittaker, was condemned after claiming that the â€œvast majorityâ€� of people breaching coronavirus lockdown rules were from BAME communities, particularly Muslim backgrounds. Labour called the comments â€œovert racismâ€� and the Muslim Council of Britain said it was a case of â€œshameless scapegoating of minoritiesâ€�. But the PM didnâ€™t distance himself from them, saying at his press conference that it was â€œup to the whole country to get this rightâ€�. The UKâ€™s death toll exceeded 46,000 as another 120 Covid-19-related deaths were recorded, bringing the governmentâ€™s tally to 46,119. Thatâ€™s it from me on the UK side.

2020-07-31T14:50:17Z,politics,Politics,Why has easing of the Covid-19 lockdown in England been delayed?,"Just a fortnight ago, Boris Johnson unveiled a plan that he hoped would put the country back on a path to normality by Christmas. But at the same Downing Street podium on Friday, he said that the government was postponing plans to ease Covid-19 lockdown restrictions further on Saturday. The prime minister said the delay in easing measures across England for at least a fortnight was to combat new cases of the virus. He also announced face coverings would be made mandatory in a host of new indoor settings. So, what does it all mean?
What lockdown restrictions in England are not now going ahead? The reopening of leisure businesses including casinos, bowling alleys and skating rinks due to take place on 1 August has now been postponed until 15 August at the earliest. Close-contact services, such as certain beauty treatments, will also not yet be allowed and indoor performances will not resume. Meanwhile, pilots of larger crowds in sporting venues and conference centres will not take place and wedding receptions of up to 30 people will not be permitted, although ceremonies can still go ahead as before. What about face coverings? Rules on face coverings were being extended, meaning from 8 August people would be required to wear them in indoor venues such as museums, galleries, cinemas, and places of worship, Johnson said. Is the guidance on going back to the workplace still changing? Yes. Johnson said government guidance giving employers more discretion over how staff could return to work safely, including potentially going back to offices, remained effective from Saturday.
Will the pausing of shielding still happen? Yes. The prime minister confirmed that the plan to pause shielding nationally from Saturday will still go ahead. Why is the government putting the brakes on easing lockdown restrictions? In explaining the move, Johnson said Covid-19 was “gathering pace” in parts of Asia and Latin America, and that some European countries were “struggling to keep the virus under control”. He said Covid-19 rates were on the up in England, with new Office for National Statistics weekly survey figures showing that the prevalence of the virus in the community was probably rising for the first time since May. About one in 1,500 people now had coronavirus, compared with one in 1,800 on 15 July and only one in 2,000 on 2 July, he said. Meanwhile, the ONS estimates that there are now 4,900 new infections a day, up from about 3,000 on 14 July and 2,000 at the end of June. “We just can’t afford to ignore this evidence,” Johnson said. Do people understand the nationwide lockdown rules in England? Fewer than half of the public fully understand England’s lockdown rules, a study released before Johnson’s latest announcement found. In an ongoing survey of more than 70,000 adults, researchers from University College London found that about 45% of respondents said they had a “broad understanding” of the current rules in England, with only 14% saying they understood the rules completely now lockdown had eased."
2020-07-31T11:22:17Z,politics,Politics,Douglas Ross poised to become leader of Scottish Conservatives,"Douglas Ross, the MP for Moray, is expected to be appointed as leader of the Scottish Conservatives as the party scrambles to reverse a steep fall in popularity before the Scottish election in May. The party plans the quickest possible coronation for Ross, who confirmed on Friday he would stand after Jackson Carlaw’s shock resignation on Thursday night. Party officials are trying to dissuade other people from standing to avoid a delay in Ross’s appointment as leader, after a series of opinion polls showed a majority of voters are backing Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish National party. Ross confirmed the previous Scottish leader, Ruth Davidson, had agreed to take first minister’s questions for the Conservatives until the next Holyrood elections, but will not assume the role of interim leader or act as Ross’s deputy. On Friday afternoon, Davidson was named as a new Tory peer, despite her long-running antipathy to Boris Johnson. She said she would postpone taking her seat in the Lords until March, when she will quit her Holyrood seat of Edinburgh Central before the Scottish parliament election in May. Carlaw quit after a series of polls showed the SNP was on course to win an overall majority in the election, putting a second independence referendum back on the agenda, with support for the Tories slumping to 20%. Panelbase polls put the SNP at 55% in a Scottish election. The same polls showed support for independence had reached a record 54%, excluding “don’t knows”. A senior party source said the Conservatives believed Panelbase’s results were accurate and that put the future of the UK in peril. The Scottish party believes a large part of their challenge is countering deep antipathy towards Boris Johnson among potential Tory voters in Scotland. His backers believe Ross can counter attacks that he will be controlled by No 10 by pointing out he was the first UK government minister to resign in protest over the decision by Dominic Cummings and his wife to travel to Durham during lockdown while they were ill with Covid-19 symptoms. In his statement on Friday confirming he planned to stand, Ross said: “This is a crucial time in Scottish politics. We are months away from an important election, and need strong, decisive leadership of our party to take on and defeat the SNP in seats right across the country. “[I] want us to show clearly to everyone in Scotland, no matter where they live or who they are, that if they want to move on from the divisions of the past and focus on the issues that really matter; a strong economy, good schools, safe streets and a world-leading NHS then the Scottish Conservatives will be their voice. “Scotland is an integral part of the United Kingdom and that’s a relationship I want to maintain and improve. Under my leadership, this will be an absolute priority.” In a move likely to provoke opposition attacks about being a part-timer, Ross will seek a seat at Holyrood in the 2021 Scottish parliamentary election but is expected to stay on as MP for Moray. The Tories will cite Alex Salmond’s decision to remain an MP after winning a Holyrood seat in 2007, when he became first minister. Davidson said several other Holyrood party leaders, including her predecessor as Scottish Tory leader, Annabel Goldie, and former Labour first minister Jack McConnell, had taken peerages. She tried to forestall attacks on her decision to move to the Lords by insisting it had a significant political and constitutional role. “As a chamber dedicated to scrutinising and revising legislation, the upper house is stronger when it includes a range of voices with experience from different jobs, backgrounds, specialities and parliaments across the UK, and I believe I can make a contribution to its work,” she said."
2020-07-30T14:53:11Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock's speech on NHS's future leaves audience comatose | John Crace,"We’ve seen several iterations of Matt Hancock since he became health secretary. There’s been the energetic Tigger enthusiast determined that everyone must have the best experience possible as they are kept on hold for 30 minutes on the NHS 111 helpline. There’s been the tetchy, defensive Hancock, who has just realised he’s been set up by Boris Johnson to take most of the blame for the government’s failings over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic and can’t understand why Labour aren’t more supportive of what he’s done. The clue might be in the word opposition. Today we saw a third Matt as he delivered his speech to an audience of a few dozen doctors at the Royal College of Physicians on the future of the health service. This was newly-qualified-management-consultant Hancock, who couldn’t wait to share his MBA thesis on why management consultants shouldn’t have anything to do with the NHS with the rest of the world. Irony has never been his strong point. But then it turns out that talking management bollocks is actually Matt’s happy place. Ask him – as several news reporters did that morning – how he knows if people are properly self-isolating on their return from Spain or whether the R rate is above 1 in some parts of the UK – and he becomes almost monosyllabic. His answers to the above questions were “I know because I know” and “I’m not going to tell you” respectively. Yet allowed 50 minutes to bore on uninterrupted about how “the important thing about a system is that it should work as a system”, Hancock is like a pig in shit. It doesn’t take much to imagine him driving down to Cornwall for his summer break and insisting that his kids use the time to write down their goals for their holiday, along with a 10-point strategy document outlining how they are going to achieve them. Hancock raised a few eyebrows by opening his speech with a section on the positives to be taken from the Great Fire of London in 1666. Given that the fire had been partially responsible for ending the plague of the year before, it initially sounded as though Matt’s solution to the coronavirus might be to burn the entire country and start again from scratch. Only it turned out that what he really meant was that the Great Fire had been the catalyst for great change, like the rebuilding of St Paul’s Cathedral and the establishment of the fire brigade. So the coronavirus hadn’t been all bad news. Apart for those who had died from it. Here Matt started to get animated. The coronavirus had revealed the possibility of a new type of health service: one where people could be stacked up in hastily constructed Nightingale field hospitals. One where patients could be shifted out of hospitals into care homes without being tested. One where dermatologists could get to try their hand at ICU procedures as outpatient demand for their services had rather dried up. One where innovation could be brought in at speed. “There are seven major cultural lessons to be learned,” Matt said earnestly. At this point, you could feel the energy being sucked out of the room. His new mantra of innovation at speed clearly didn’t apply to him. “The first is that we must value our people.” Something every health secretary over the past 10 years has said, before imposing a whole range of cost-cutting measures to systematically undermine the entire profession. On and on it went. There must be mission-based standards of bureaucracy with clear tramlines. Yeah, me neither. We needed better tech and better apps with more patients having phone or video consultations with their GPs. Oddly, he chose not to mention his “world-beating” test and trace coronavirus app that was supposed to make the entire country safe and which has been long binned as useless. Then he didn’t talk about the telephone track and trace system, which has also been a lot less effective than anyone imagined.
“Seventhly,” Matt said eventually, to a few sighs of relief from those still awake. Health needed to be more holistic, which is why the government had introduced its new obesity strategy. Had he quickly changed into his retro 70s Adidas tracksuit and squeezed out some one-handed press ups, he could have rescued the whole morning, but sadly he passed up the opportunity and let his speech drift remorselessly to its close. No one really had any serious questions for Hancock. Partly because the audience was too comatose, but mostly because there was nothing to say. The doctors would believe it when they saw it. It had been an OK speech as these things go, but had been delivered at the wrong time. Most people in the NHS aren’t worrying about long-term reform so much as getting through the next 12 months. Only that morning, the Office for National Statistics had reported that England had the most excess deaths in Europe and the self-isolation guidance had been extended from seven days to 10, while Boris Johnson had a couple of weeks ago suggested the UK would be back to normal by Christmas. It wasn’t the NHS that needed a reality health check. It was the government."
2020-07-30T14:09:00Z,politics,Politics,"Dominic Cummings undermined lockdown enforcement, says ex-Durham police chief","Durham’s former chief constable has warned that Dominic Cummings’ lockdown behaviour has made it more difficult for officers to enforce the rules and has been used by some as an excuse for law-breaking. Mike Barton said the decision by the prime minister’s chief aide to drive to Durham at the height of the coronavirus pandemic had “damaged trust in the government and in the rules”. After the trip was exposed by the Guardian and the Daily Mirror, Barton said: “People were actually using the word ‘Cummings’ in encounters with the police to justify antisocial behaviour.” Speaking to Times Radio, he said: “If the public don’t think the police are operating in a fair and impartial way, you won’t get their trust and you won’t get their support. People who make the rules shouldn’t break them. Otherwise, you can’t expect the little people to do it.”
Barton, who retired last year after a seven-year stint running the force, also criticised Cummings’s failure to apologise for his actions and the excuses he gave for them during a Downing Street press conference. “His bare-faced effrontery in the rose garden was staggering,” he said. Barton said Cummings’s explanation for his trip to Barnard Castle was worse than childish. He said: “To say that he drove 60 miles with his child in the back of the car, on his wife’s birthday, to go to a beauty spot to test his eyesight, just beggars belief. I wouldn’t have expected a seven-year-old boy who was caught red-handed to have come out with such a ridiculous excuse.” He added: “So do I think that damaged trust in the government and in the rules? Of course it did. And that’s what the studies are now saying.”
Research published on Thursday suggested that the Cummings lockdown scandal was a key factor in a breakdown of a sense of national unity over the pandemic. Barton also criticised the government for trying to defend him. He said: “It ill behoved the government that you had ministers trotting out a defence of Cummings when there wasn’t one.” A three-day investigation by Durham police found that Cummings probably broke health protection rules by driving to Barnard Castle. But as the investigation was confined to his movements in County Durham, it made no finding on his decision to leave London. Durham police said it would not act retrospectively against Cummings. Asked if Durham police had done a good enough job of investigating Cummings, Barton said: “I don’t know anything about the investigation.” But he added: “If you lose the trust of the public, you cannot police.”"
2020-07-30T12:10:31Z,politics,Politics,Ex-Tory MP's guilty verdict casts spotlight on decision to restore whip,"Christmas was less than two weeks away when Theresa May faced what was expected to be a knife-edge vote engineered by hard Brexit Tories to have her sacked amid the political paralysis of 2018. In what was ultimately just a stay of execution, the embattled prime minister survived by a 83 votes but a shadow remains even today over the decision to reinstate the Tory whip to Charlie Elphicke and Andrew Griffiths, two MPs accused of sexually inappropriate conduct, so they could vote. Griffiths was subsequently cleared by a parliamentary inquiry. More than two years on – as Elphicke was convicted on Thursday of sexual assault charges – the move to bring him back into the fold during May’s tenure as prime minister has been described as “appalling” by Anna Soubry, who was a Tory MP at the time.
“If she did know about it it’s quite remarkable that she let it happen, and having found out about it she could have done something about it,” said Soubry. Before his political career was abruptly halted by his suspension from the parliamentary party in November 2017, Elphicke had been an ambitious backbencher whose role as MP for a Brexit “frontline” constituency, Dover and Deal, allowed for an intermittent national profile. Despite being a key figure at one point in the so-called 301 group of MPs pressing for the party to follow a more radical direction, his only more senior role beyond the backbenches had been as a junior whip during a brief spell until 2016. Having backed the wrong horse during the 2016 referendum he also subsequently sought to pivot towards the new pole of power in his party by talking up the merits of a no-deal Brexit. Then came the allegations by a young parliamentary worker who said that Elphicke had sexually assaulted her twice. There was sympathy from colleagues at the period of limbo followed without charges while an even more bitter rift opened up between party HQ and Elphicke, who was backed by his local association. Even Soubry, who said she believed there was no smoke without fire when it came to the sort of accusations faced by Elphicke, said: “I felt he was treated very badly in the sense that he had all these allegations hanging over his head for some time.” But that sympathy went only so far. Some speak of a colleague who was described as “bombastic” and was inclined to swim at the top of the current. One other woman who had been an MP recently told the Guardian of Elphicke: “Smarmy bugger, suspect where there is smoke, there is fire. Tried it on with me a bit.” She praised the role of two female Conservative MPs in dealing with the allegations, Margot James and Anne Milton, who she said would “never have dreamed” of putting party before doing the right thing. Soubry says that too often the opposite has happened. James put the young parliamentary worker in touch with Milton, then deputy chief whip, who advised the woman that she should consider speaking to the police. But it was another woman, Elphicke’s wife, Natalie, who was his staunchest and most vocal defender throughout, accusing the party HQ of tipping off the media before he was informed of his suspension. In the 2019 election she won her husband’s former seat for the Conservatives. A credible candidate in her own right with a background in law and Conservative policymaking, some sceptics nevertheless suggested she had been keeping the seat “warm” for her husband. Now that he is facing a prison sentence, Natalie Elphicke has now also detached herself from him, tweeting less than an hour after the verdict that it “ends her 25 year marriage to the only man I have ever loved.” • This article was amended on 4 October 2020. Anne Milton was deputy chief whip, not chief whip as an earlier version said."
2020-07-30T06:36:53Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Boris Johnson faces Eurotunnel test,"Boris Johnson is facing a major Brexit test with the future of Eurotunnel operations at stake, it has emerged. The EU wants the UK to drop its opposition to a role for the European court of justice in British affairs to ensure trains keep running between France and the UK after Brexit is implemented on 1 January. The European commission has this week asked the European parliament and the European council to officially mandate France to urgently negotiate a new bilateral deal with the UK giving the ECJ the powers to resolve future disputes between the two countries as “union law would not longer be applicable to the part of the channel fixed link under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom” after Brexit. Unless there is an overarching deal with one body responsible for legal disputes regarding the entire 30-mile (50km) tunnel there will be chaos, insiders say. “It would mean train drivers would have to have two sets of qualifications to drive on the British and French side of the tunnel. It would affect how you operate the tunnel with potential for divergence in the future on everything from signalling, voltage, the radio systems, the signalling system, ventilation, hydraulics. It would be like driving on the left- and right-hand side of the road at the same time,” said a source. The EU’s plan to keep the ECJ as an arbiter in disputes will be anathema to Downing Street. A senior official involved in the Brexit negotiations says there can be “no halfway house” on the ECJ and that Michel Barnier’s team have recently accepted it is a “non-starter”. The commission’s move follows a request on 16 July by France informing it that “it would like to negotiate an agreement supplementing the Treaty of Canterbury” signed by Margaret Thatcher and François Mitterrand in 1986 to facilitate the undersea tunnel. One option is to make the international court of arbitration in The Hague the apparatus for dispute resolution. It was used in 2007 when the then Channel Tunnel Group won its £35m compensation claim against the two governments over losses suffered because of damage and security expenses arising from “multiple incursions” of migrants who were living in the Sangatte refugee camp near Calais. Experts say that finding a way of adjudicating over future disputes between the bloc and the UK without some role for the ECJ is almost impossible and point out that it will be involved in disputes over the Northern Ireland protocol and citizens’ rights. “From the EU’s point of view it would be very odd to have a railway in its territory that was not governed by EU law, from the UK’s point of view it would also be odd to have a railway in its territory not governed by UK courts but the Treaty of Canterbury provides for one legal regime,” said Steve Peers, law professor at the University of Essex. On the wider issue of the ECJ, Catherine Barnard, professor of EU law at Cambridge, thinks “it is going to be very difficult to exclude the ECJ unless we have such a thin trade deal that it’s not worth the paper it’s written on with no principles of EU law engaged at all”. It is understood that one option discussed at the negotiating table is a political mechanism for dispute resolution, say insiders. But this comes with huge and expensive risks of “whack-a-mole” trade wars. If it was up to governments to settle disputes, the UK could decide to impose tariffs on German cars, for example and the EU could retaliate by slapping tariffs on Scottish whisky, just as Donald Trump threatened earlier this year. “If you have a problem in one area you shouldn’t be able to retaliate in another completely unrelated area,” said a senior UK official involved in the talks who hinted at an overarching agreement but with specificity on “which bits of the treaty can be suspended in response to the difficulties”. “This could be an area for wriggle-room. It means we could say to the EU we will keep the EU happy by having one big treaty but then say the dispute resolution mechanism only applies to areas 1, 2 and 3 to stop the retaliation [or prospect of trade wars],” says Barnard. A department for transport spokesperson said it supported measures to secure the continuation of critical services through the Channel Tunnel regardless of the outcome of Brexit talks adding: “We are absolutely clear that we will protect our national interests in any bilateral arrangements and they will fully respect the UK’s status as an independent, sovereign nation.”"
2020-07-30T06:00:10Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson urged to address House of Lords gender imbalance,"Boris Johnson is being urged to rebalance female representation in the Lords by elevating more women in a peerages list expected within a week. Concerns have been raised after the names of just two women were leaked to the media out of an expected list of 30 peers. Sam Smethers, the Fawcett Society’s chief executive, said the prime minister had an opportunity to show he takes the issue of the gender imbalance within the upper chamber seriously. “Women’s representation in the House of Lords is even worse than the Commons. Instead of driving women’s representation down the government should be taking every opportunity to improve the gender balance. Allocating the majority of new peerages to women would be a good start,” she said. Ruth Davidson, the former leader of the Scottish Conservatives, and Gisela Stuart, a former Labour MP who campaigned for Leave in the Brexit referendum, are expected to be elevated to the Lords. Men who are expected to be approved by the House of Lords’ appointments commission include the former England cricketer Ian Botham, the former Tory chancellors Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond and the former Labour MPs Frank Field, John Woodcock and Ian Austin. Charles Moore, the journalist and biographer of Margaret Thatcher, and Daniel Hannan, the former Leave-supporting MEP, are also expected to be ennobled, as well as Sir Eddie Lister, chief strategic adviser to No 10. There are currently 773 peers, 212 of whom are women. Just over a quarter of Conservative peers are female, compared with 39% of Labour peers and 36% of Liberal Democrats. The prime minister has faced accusations that he has failed to bring women into the cabinet, with only six female ministers serving as full cabinet members. John Bercow, the former Speaker, Tom Watson, the former deputy leader of the Labour Party, and Karie Murphy, the former chief of staff to Jeremy Corbyn, were put forward for peerages by Jeremy Corbyn, but their names have been reportedly rejected. Three Tory donors – the City financiers Peter Cruddas and Michael Spencer and the head of the Midlands Industrial Council, Johnny Leavesley – were on the list of candidates submitted to the appointments commission, sources confirmed to the Guardian. But reports have claimed they may not be included on the final list of peers because of objections by members of the commission. There is no implication of any wrongdoing by the donors. In an email to peers at the weekend, Lord Fowler, the Lord Speaker, said that the prime minister was breaking a cross-party consensus on reducing the size of the chamber. The Burns report called for a reduction to no more than 600 peers following an escalation in costs. One Conservative peer insisted that the number of peers should continue to rise. Lord Maude, the former cabinet minister, told the Guardian: “We must refresh the House of Lords and many of those who attend are part time and bring in their expertise. I have no problem with the extra numbers being brought in.”"
2020-07-30T05:00:10Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson repeatedly used inaccurate child poverty figures,"Boris Johnson repeatedly used inaccurate and misleading figures that exaggerated the government’s record on poverty, the UK statistics watchdog has confirmed. The Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) was responding to a complaint by the End Child Poverty Coalition that the prime minister had three times used official poverty data “selectively, inaccurately and, ultimately, misleadingly”. Speaking at prime ministers’ questions and in an interview with the BBC, Johnson said the number of families or children in poverty had fallen by 400,000 since 2010. The coalition of poverty charities, campaign groups and unions said this number, along with other poverty statistics used by the PM, had no basis in fact. In a concise reply to the coalition, the OSR said its investigation team agreed that Johnson’s statements were incorrect. Their letter states: “Thank you for raising your concerns regarding the use of child poverty statistics with us. Our team has investigated the statements which you highlight (and has reached the same conclusion that these statements are incorrect).” While it does not admonish Johnson, the letter says the OSR has published a blogpost explaining the four official measurements of poverty in the UK to “bring to the attention of the team that prepares briefing for prime minister’s questions”. The blogpost says: “There is no wrong measure, but there is a wrong way of using the available measures – and that is to pick and choose which statistics to use based on what best suits the argument you happen to be making.” Anna Feuchtwang, the chair of End Child Poverty, said: ‘It is deeply insulting to the children and families swept into poverty, when data about them is used selectively and misleadingly at the whim of politicians. The simple fact is that by any measures child poverty is rising, but instead of tackling the problem, the government risks obscuring the issue and misinforming the public.” Labour’s shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said: “It is shameful the prime minister is unable to tell the truth about the hardship faced by so many families struggling to make ends meet … The prime minister must now correct the record both publicly and in parliament, and ensure that when he next raises his government’s damning record on child poverty, he comes clean about what the stats are saying.” The statistics watchdog has previously warned against politicians using official poverty measures selectively. In recent years the government has preferred to cite absolute measures of poverty, which show its record in a more favourable light, than relative measures, which are more commonly used by poverty campaigners. The End Child Poverty Coalition complaint accuses Johnson of citing inaccurate poverty statistics in a way that is “liable to mislead the public and undermine the integrity of official statistics”. It has now written an open letter to the OSR questioning the brevity of its letter and its failure to publish the correspondence on its website. Although the ORS has a duty to intervene in statistics issues of national importance – it said in previous correspondence with the coalition that poverty statistics were of “significant public interest” – it also has a policy of refusing to “become a player or a referee in political debate”. The complaint, from Feuchtwang, highlighted three occasions when Johnson made inaccurate claims on the government’s record on poverty. At PMQs on 17 June, Johnson told the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, he was “completely wrong” to say child poverty had risen by 600,000. Poverty had declined since 2010, the PM claimed, and there were now 400,000 fewer families in poverty. Feuchtwang wrote that the 600,000 figure was correct. When asked by Starmer at PMQs the following week to “do the decent thing” and correct the record on child poverty, Johnson declined and said there were “100,000 fewer children in absolute poverty and 500,000 children falling below thresholds of low income and material deprivation”. Feuchtwang said that while the 100,000 figure was correct, the second figure was not: she pointed out that “there are actually 1.5 million children classed as low income and materially deprived”. The third instance was when Johnson was interviewed by Andrew Marr on the BBC on 1 December during the general election campaign, when the PM claimed child poverty had fallen by 400,000 since 2010. Feuchtwang said that official statistics at the time showed the poverty rate had risen on two of the official measures, stayed the same on a third, and fallen by 100,000 on a fourth, suggesting it was unclear where Johnson had found the figure he cited. “While it is expected – and right – that child poverty should be the subject of robust political debate, it cannot be right that official figures on something as fundamental as how many children are in poverty continue to be used selectively, inaccurately and, ultimately, misleadingly,” Feuchtwang wrote. There are four official measures of poverty: relative poverty, which records households which have less than 60% of contemporary median income, before and after housing costs; and absolute poverty, which tracks numbers in poverty against a 2010/11 baseline, also before and after housing costs. Asked for a response to the regulator’s decision, a No 10 spokesperson instead pointed to a parliamentary written answer from the PM on 30 June. This says the number of children in workless families had fallen by 740,000 since 2010, but gives no precise source for the claim that there are 400,000 fewer children in poverty. Questionable figures This is not the first time the Conservative government has been accused by watchdogs of misusing statistics: Coronavirus testing In June, Matt Hancock was criticised for his use of Covid-19 testing figures. The chair of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir David Norgrove, accused him of painting a picture that was “far from complete and comprehensible”. The health secretary had promised 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. To reach that target, test kits put in the post were included – even if they were never returned. Hancock’s aim, Norgrove said, seemed to have been to “show the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding”. Taking back control of £350m Boris Johnson, while serving as foreign secretary, was reprimanded for a “clear misuse of official statistics” over a Daily Telegraph article in which he repeated the debunked Brexit campaign claim that the UK would “take back control of roughly £350m per week” after Brexit. Norgrove said he was “surprised and disappointed”, while Johnson accused the statistics chief of a “wilful distortion” of the article. Rough sleeping In April 2019, the UK Statistics Authority said government claims on rough sleeping were not to be trusted until ministers explained how some figures may have become skewed. The government boasted of cutting rough sleeping in England by 2% in 2018. But Norgrove said official figures from that year should be discounted until concerns over claims of deliberate underreporting were addressed. School funding The Department for Education was involved in a running battle in 2018 with the UK Statistics Authority, which criticised the DfE for its “potentially misleading” claims over school funding and repeated failures to correct problems identified by the authority."
2020-07-30T04:00:08Z,politics,Politics,"DfID merger and overseas aid cuts will weaken UK influence, Labour warns","Labour has urged the government to rethink its plan to merge the Department of International Development (DfID) with the Foreign Office, a move described by DfID’s first permanent secretary as “an act of wanton institutional vandalism”. Preet Kaur Gill, the new shadow international development secretary, also warned that massive UK overseas aid cuts were being forced through in secrecy that went far beyond those justified by the fall in UK growth. John Vereker, the permanent secretary at the time of the creation of DfID as an independent department in 1997, described the proposed merger as vandalism. “It is hard to see how destroying one of the few remaining internationally admired instruments of British soft power, alongside the Commonwealth itself, is going to help bring coherence to the three Ds of the much vaunted Global Britain: Defence, Development and Diplomacy,” he said.
“The government appears to have sacrificed what the OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] once described as the best development agency in the world in fruitless pursuit of short-term political and commercial self-interest. Accountability will be weakened, specialist skills and systems will be lost, poor people in developing countries will suffer, and a DfID-shaped hole will be exposed to Chinese influence peddlers and Russian mischief-makers. “Mixing aid and short-term self-interest is always a recipe for disaster.” Gill claimed few decisions had been greeted so critically, pointing out that three former prime ministers had condemned the merger. In the final day before parliament rose, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, in a letter to the international development select committee, announced £2.9bn in cuts to the 2020 overseas aid programme of £15.9bn, citing the collapse in growth caused by coronavirus. He said the UK would still meet its statutory commitment to spend 0.7% of Gross National Income on overseas aid. But Gill pointed out that the Office for Budget Responsibility was predicting only a 9% fall in GDP, and the £3bn planned cuts are a much bigger reduction to the official development assistance budget. “The question is, why are they cutting the budget by 20% or so? Either they are hiding the fact that the economic situation is going to be substantially worse than they are making out, or this is just another excuse to meet the 0.7% target, but still prop up spending by other departments.” Nearly 30% of the overseas aid budget is no longer spent by DfID, but by other government departments.
Gill said the reforms were being pushed through with no consultation, and accused the outgoing international development secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, of being in hiding as her department was dismantled around her by the Foreign Office and Downing Street. “This is a takeover, not a merger, that will weaken our influence,” she said. She accused the government of spending £50m “in the midst of a pandemic that has not yet peaked to fix something that is not broken. It shows where this government’s priorities lie, and it is not with the world’s poorest. “There are two very different departments with very different skills and responsibilities. Ambassadors meet governments and look at business and the British national interest. Development is about assisting the poorest and making a difference because it is our moral duty to do so. What will be the hierarchy of decision-making in-country, and what is the report-back mechanism to London? “There has been no opportunity to feed into what the new department would look like. We need to know what kind of mechanism for accountability and scrutiny will exist. They very fact that Raab sneaked out £3bn of cuts the day before parliament went into recess shows they are going to evade scrutiny. It’s a massive concern that there is going to be no independent voice for development in the cabinet. “There is no clarity on the role of the independent spending body ICAEI, on a select committee, or a separate accounting officer.” Dismissing suggestions that the so-called “red wall” seats want to see the back of the aid budget, she said: “I am convinced the British public do want to show global solidarity. A third of the Yemeni population do not have access to healthcare. In South Sudan, a population of 11m only has 24 ICU beds. Nearly 3m people do not have access to wash facilities, and in the absence of a vaccine, that is so important.” Gill, the first female Sikh MP, insisted she wanted to stay in her post for the long haul. She accepted that some cuts were necessary. “We are in the middle of an economic crisis, so there will be cuts, but they cannot be from life-saving programs that DfID is providing,” she said."
2020-07-29T23:01:02Z,politics,Politics,"Cummings trips damaged UK lockdown unity, study suggests","The scandal over Dominic Cummings’ trips to and around Durham during lockdown damaged trust and was a key factor in the breakdown of a sense of national unity amid the coronavirus pandemic, research suggests. Revelations that Cummings and his family travelled to his parents’ farm despite ministers repeatedly imploring the public to stay at home – as exposed by the Guardian and the Daily Mirror in May - also crystallised distrust in politicians over the crisis, according to a report from the thinktank British Future. The findings emerged in a series of surveys, diaries and interviews carried out over the first months of the pandemic as the public got to grips with profound changes to their habits, relationships and lifestyles. It found that while the start of lockdown forged a new community spirit and softened divisions caused by Brexit, this dissipated as the Cummings scandal emerged, lockdown rules were eased and social tensions resurfaced, especially over how far people observed social distancing rules. While the pandemic has made the UK overall less divided – and revealed an appetite to hang on to perceived gains in community spirit created under lockdown – it warns that tensions could re-emerge in the coming recession over issues such as growing perceptions of a gap between rich and poor. Jill Rutter, the author of the report, said: “There’s a risk that past divides are re-emerging as society starts to reopen. The shared experience of lockdown made many people feel more connected to their neighbours and local community. Now that sense of togetherness is starting to fray. The good news is that people would rather we kept hold of it.” The study notes: “The perception that the prime minister’s adviser, Dominic Cummings, had broken lockdown rules was a highly salient issue that appeared to damage trust in politicians.” Participants in the research grew “noticeably angrier” about politicians after the revelations, although it also served to create fresh consensus. “It was not, however, as divisive an incident as might be thought. Most people, irrespective of their political views, appeared to disapprove of Cummings’ action.” The study was carried out for the /Together coalition, a campaign set up in the wake of Brexit to bridge social divides and build a kinder society. It comprises two surveys of more than 2,000 people carried out in early March and late May and June, and material from online discussion groups and 36 WhatsApp diarists. The start of lockdown heralded a new community spirit, characterised by neighbourly generosity, volunteering, enhanced social connectedness, and “acts of kindness from strangers” – all promoting strong feelings of national unity, the study found. This sense of togetherness and generosity, typified by the weekly clap for carers in support of the NHS and other frontline workers, made people feel “part of something that was positive and larger than just their street” and helped heal deep social divisions over Brexit. But by mid-May, this unity had started to dissipate, researchers found, with the perception that “some groups of people were not observing social distancing rules” becoming a major source of division, especially as lockdown rules were eased. In addition to the Cummings revelations, the sense of unity broke down further as differences in lockdown policy emerged between the Westminster and devolved administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. There were also differences in attitudes to, and experiences of, the pandemic between young and old, and home workers and key workers. A major public concern was the division between rich and poor. “It was felt that those in power needed to address wealth divides, but also recognise that more work was needed to bring people together in urban areas with a more transient population.” There was widespread support for the Black Lives Matter campaign – including broad support from people of all ethic groups and ages for action to tackle inequality and racial prejudice in the UK – although there was concern about violence on some of the protests. The study urges the government to invest in the positive bonds created under lockdown, such as in volunteering programmes. “Our leaders, whatever their political views, need to make healing social divides a priority, and to commit a practical agenda to make it happen,” it said. Quotes on Cummings in answer to a question posed in early June: Are we more divided or more united as a country? “More divided, two reasons. The first is the Dominic Cummings saga. The vast majority of people see it as one rule for those in charge and one rule for everyone else and this is now causing issues as many people are flaunting lockdown rules, whilst others are at the opposite end of the scale and worried about government advice and whether to trust them.” - Male, 45, Yorkshire, remain supporter “We are a little less together than we were. During the height of … lockdown I felt there was a real community/‘in this together spirit’, which probably peaked at VE Day. Then as lockdown eased, different people were at different levels and saw the easing differently. But then the Cummings situation kind of brought everyone back together again. Today I would say we are at very early days of how things were before lockdown, albeit a little bit more community spirit than before.” – Female, east of England, leave supporter “In short: undoubtedly more divided. More detail: it was relatively easy to persuade the country to go into lockdown. Easing the restrictions has produced a whole spectrum of differing opinions never mind the uproar the Dominic Cummings saga has added to the debate.” – Male, West Midlands"
2020-07-29T18:58:08Z,politics,Politics,Rachel Riley and Tracy-Ann Oberman drop libel claim over retweet,"The Countdown presenter Rachel Riley and actor Tracy-Ann Oberman have dropped their joint libel claim against a barrister for retweeting a critical blog post about the pair. Jane Heybroek, an immigration lawyer, said the duo had withdrawn their case after 18 months of legal action that cost her over £80,000 in legal bills. In 2019 Heybroek had retweeted a link to a lengthy blog post by a man called Shaun Lawson entitled “Beneath Contempt: How Tracy-Ann Oberman and Rachel Riley harassed, dogpiled and slandered a 16-year-old child and her father”. The article made allegations about the actions of Oberman and Riley towards a young Labour activist who had made comments about antisemitism in the party. Heybroek did not publish the original blog post, and said there was no evidence that anyone read it as a result of her retweet. Heybroek said she had spent tens of thousands of pounds on the case, while Riley and Oberman, who have been actively involved in highlighting allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party, were represented on a no-win, no-fee basis: “This meant that there was almost no risk to them in bringing the claim. Many people would have felt forced to settle for reasons of pragmatism.” At a hearing earlier this year, a judge described Heybroek as “broadly supportive of Jeremy Corbyn”, but said there was no other clear evidence of her political position. Heybroek said that despite Riley and Oberman’s “vocal stance against antisemitism” in other legal cases, this claim “did not actually involve any allegations of antisemitism”. “Unfortunately, as a result of the litigation, I was the subject of a number of nasty comments from a small minority of people who simply presumed to know what the case was about and what the outcome would be. They were wrong on both counts.” Riley and Oberman’s solicitor, Mark Lewis, of Patron Law, said in a statement that his clients “chose not to proceed further after the judge had determined that the opinion expressed was capable of being defamatory, in circumstances where Jane Heybroek claimed that she had promptly deleted her tweet”. They have both now made a contribution towards Heybroek’s costs. Lewis said: “Their libel insurers each did not see any advantage in pursuing a case over the liability of a retweet that was deleted so quickly. There are bigger fish to fry in the pursuit of those who choose to maintain a serious libel.” • The standfirst and text of this article were amended on 31 July 2020 to clarify the amount Heybroek said she had spent on legal bills."
2020-07-29T17:30:01Z,politics,Politics,No 10's hunt for press conference frontman hits Â£100k hurdle | John Crace,"“What are you doing here, Caino?” said Boris Johnson, as he brushed past his director of communications. “I thought you were off on hols.” “I was,” Lee Cain replied, trying to conceal his resentment. “But then you went and shut down non-essential travel to Spain, so that was my fortnight in Magaluf buggered.” “Sorry about that. Maybe you could try France or Italy instead ...” “How do I know you aren’t going to cancel all travel there too?” “Good point. Why don’t you just go to Gatwick and see which flights are still open and book a seat to anywhere? It’s not far off what Oliver Dowden was suggesting on the radio this morning and it seems to be as good a plan as any. And if it turns out you get stuck there, I promise to try and repatriate you.” “If it’s all the same, I think I’ll stay put.” “Well, I’m glad I have bumped into you because I’ve had a great idea,” Boris continued. Since the daily coronavirus briefings went down such a storm, why don’t we start a daily televised Downing Street press conference in the autumn? It will be a great way to get our message across to the public.” “What is our message?” Caino snapped. He was having a bad enough day as it was, without another of the prime minister’s new ideas. “Whatever it happens to be at the time. I’m not saying we should be consistent. Also be a great opportunity to rubbish whatever Labour happens to be doing at the time.” “You do realise that the coronavirus pressers weren’t a total success. Even without the damage limitation on the Dom Cummings Durham safari, we frequently had to silence the scientists and give information that was only partly accurate. And your approval ratings have dropped significantly over the past four months.” “But not by as much as if I hadn’t done the press briefings.” “Are you sure now is the right time? Things are going to get even messier with high unemployment, further lockdowns and a bodged Brexit deal. Mightn’t it be better to keep your head down?” “Oh, I didn’t intend to front them myself. I’m far too busy trying to lose weight at the moment. Besides, neither me nor anyone in the cabinet is trusted by the public. So what I imagined is that we could make it like the White House pressers and just get someone in on a £100K contract and get him to do it instead.” “Don’t you think we should maybe also consider hiring a woman?” “Are you sure? Everyone else who works here is a bloke. But if you say so. Best man for the job and all that.” “So how are we going to go about the recruitment process?” “We’ll just bung an advert on the Conservative party website with all the usual blah about ‘must be able to work to immovable deadlines, strong under pressure and good interpersonal skills’.” “Christ,” said Caino. “We don’t want someone with interpersonal skills. The whole point of Number 10 is that it’s a place where everyone gets to shout at each other. We can’t start going soft and have people talking about their feelings.” “I know. But we’ve got to look as if we’re being diverse and accessible. So just knock something up and let’s see what kind of takers we get.” “I think the £100K salary is going to prove to be a dealbreaker for some. I mean there’s no chance of getting Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby in on that kind of money. They would have been a perfect double-act as they don’t ask difficult questions and the public trust them. Still, let’s see who we get.” Within minutes of the advert going live, the applications started pinging their way into Caino’s inbox. The first was from David Starkey. He had unexpectedly found himself with time on his hands having lost a couple of jobs after an ill-advised interview with Darren Grimes. “I have had a long career in television,” he wrote, “am sympathetic to the Brexit agenda and would be an ideal communicator of the government’s immigration policy”. He was filed under maybe. Moments later an email arrived from Carol Vorderman saying she was excellent with numbers. She was a definite no. They didn’t want someone who could pick holes in the government’s budget. George Osborne was also put on the reject pile. Not because he couldn’t do the job, but because Caino was aware that the former chancellor was constitutionally incapable of not applying for a high-profile post regardless of whether he wanted it or not. Besides, he might find it hard to fit in with his six other jobs. There were also two applications from serving Tory MPs. One from Helen Whately, who felt her career had shown there was nothing she wouldn’t say in defence of the party line and that she could easily combine the post with her job as the care minister who didn’t care about anything but herself. The other came from Chris Grayling. He was rather more blunt about his prospects. He was now struggling to get by on his MP’s salary of £80K and felt that he had a proven track record in crisis mismanagement. The most left-field email came from Keith Vaz. Things hadn’t particularly worked out for him in the industrial washing machine sector and he was keen to re-enter politics. And even though he had also once been a Labour MP he didn’t see why that should stop him being a Conservative spokesperson. Another maybe. Now to sit back and wait for the people he really wanted to apply The hacks and radio shock-jocks who had made a living out of giving Boris an easy ride."
2020-07-29T17:29:23Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus live: concern about second wave 'very high' in NHS; death toll rises by 83 - as it happened,"MPs have been told that concern amongst NHS managers about there being a second coronavirus wave in the UK is â€œvery highâ€�. (See 2.42pm.) The warning was delivered as the UK recorded a further 83 coronavirus deaths, with the figures confirming that the UK death toll has stopped falling and is now rising again - although only very marginally. (See 5.43pm.) Sir Keir Starmer has urged the government to use testing to reduce the need for people arriving in the UK from certain countries to quarantine for a full 14 days. (See 4.34pm.) But Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, has said that testing passengers for Covid-19 on arrival in the UK is â€œnot a silver bulletâ€�. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has confirmed that further countries could be included in the UKâ€™s quarantine measures. Speaking to reporters on his return home from Spain (he only started his holiday there at the weekend, but decided to come back early after the quarantine announcement on Saturday night), Shapps said We absolutely have to act the moment we get the information and thatâ€™s exactly what happened with Spain, as we saw and as weâ€™ve seen over the weekend, where there were over 6,100 cases - the highest since the peak in March over there. It was the right thing to do and itâ€™s why the whole of the UK did [it] at the same time. I canâ€™t therefore rule out other countries having to go into the quarantine as well. At a meeting this afternoon the UK government was discussing quarantine with the devolved administrations, amid speculation that Belgium, Luxembourg and Croatia will be added to the list. Shapps also said that, although the government considered exempting the Canary and Balearic islands from the quarantine applied to Spain, the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, was strongly against. Shapps said: We did have a look at whether certain islands could be included [on the list] and not others. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, was very clear with us that he was concerned about the data, weâ€™d seen how the data had come very fast forward in Spain in 20, 48 hours, it had gone up by 75%. It had doubled in just a few days. He was concerned to see what was happening in the islands and thatâ€™s why we make it a whole-country approach in these things.

2020-07-29T17:00:03Z,politics,Politics,"UK negotiators have only engaged with issues 'in last week or two', says EU","British negotiators in the trade and security talks with the EU have only started to engage with the most contentious issues “in the last week or two” after pressure from business groups, the European commissioner for trade has said. In an interview with the Guardian, Phil Hogan, who oversees the EU’s negotiations, said there had been “a change of attitude” by Downing Street in July as they realised time was running out but that the talks were “not as advanced as we would like”. The two sides have been engaged in intensive negotiations this month, and informal discussions have continued this week. But despite the most contentious issues of access to British waters for European fishing fleets and new rules to prevent regulatory undercutting being under discussion, common ground between the sides is yet to be found with about 12 weeks left before parliamentary ratification will need to be sought.
Hogan, a former Irish government minister, pointed to “five or six” major issues standing in the way of a deal, with the one of the most pressing being what self-limiting rules the UK government would establish on its financial assistance to companies, known as state aid. No 10 had so far refused to to fulfil its “promise” to publish details of the subsidy control regime it would implement when the UK left the single market in December, Hogan said, leaving officials in Brussels nervous that too much was being left to the last moment. British negotiators have recently claimed that it is not necessary for the EU to have sight of the new regime as domestic legislation is no longer relevant to Brussels. Hogan warned, in response, that the EU could give “strategic” exemptions from its own state aid regime to allow capitals to subsidise European companies competing with British businesses unless an agreement on maintaining a so-called level playing field was found. “We had been waiting for the last three months for the UK to come to the table in terms of meaningful negotiations,” Hogan said. “And I actually say it’s only in the last week or two that we have noticed that people are starting to engage on the UK side. We welcome that very much. I think there is now a realisation by people in the negotiating side of UK that time is running out. The British business has started to be more vocal, privately and publicly, in relation to the importance of reaching a deal.” He added: “It’s in the interest of both sides to have a framework for state aid because I think the UK will be concerned that some of the state aid exemptions that we might introduce strategically as well might not be always in the interest of the UK. “We are still waiting for the state aid rules that the UK promised some time ago. In order to settle this, we need to hear what they will propose.” The transition period, during which the UK stays in the customs union and single market, ends at the end of the year along with the associated terms of trade with the rest of the world enjoyed by EU member states. Whitehall has been busy seeking new trade deals for the UK. An agreement with Japan is reportedly set to be announced within weeks but officials have conceded it will be less ambitious than had been hoped. Negotiations with Donald Trump’s White House have faltered over US demands for lower regulatory standards for its exports into the British market with both sides conceding a deal will not be possible this year. Hogan, speaking to five European newspapers, said there was never any advantage to be gained by negotiating from a position of weakness outside the EU. He said: “The UK is beginning to realise that as part of the European Union they were able to negotiate an agreement with various countries on the basis of 500 million people. It is different when you have 60-70 million people and therefore what will be asked of a single albeit large economy like the UK. “The US will be pushing as hard as they possibly can … I think the big issue of standards came into focus rather quickly [in the] discussions. And I think the British public opinion quite rightly asserted themselves in the form of petitions and political outreach to the ministers in the government to suggest that maybe this wasn’t a great idea.” Hogan said the British public had been warned during the 2016 referendum of the difficulties the UK would face in securing preferential trade terms. “But various people in the House of Commons like [the former Conservative cabinet minister] Owen Paterson were articulating the view that ‘we could get at the drop of a hat all sorts of very good and very beneficial international agreements for the United Kingdom if only we were away from the Trojan horse of the European Union’,” he said. A UK government spokesman said: “The UK has engaged constructively on all issues throughout the negotiations. Unfortunately the EU’s unusual approach has meant we have only been able to progress at the speed of the most difficult issues. Both sides will need to work energetically if we are going to get an agreement in September.”"
2020-07-29T15:03:02Z,politics,Politics,UK close to securing post-Brexit 'continuity' trade deal with Japan,"The UK is close to sealing a “continuity” trade deal with Japan that will mirror that of the EU pact that Britain will no longer be part of next January. But in order to strike an agreement in time for it to be ratified by the Japanese parliament, the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, has had to drop her ambitions for preferential treatment for British food exports. And while she has not got the concessions she wanted on agriculture, often the most contentious subject in trade talks, it is understood the deal will go further than that of the EU’s in relation to data and digital services. The deal is also expected to involve zero tariffs on Japanese cars imported to the UK in line with the EU deal, which removed the 10% levy on automobiles and parts applying to third countries. A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: “Both sides are committed to an ambitious timeline to secure a deal that will enter into force by the end of 2020 if at all possible. Our priority is to maintain and enhance the trading relationship between our two countries.” Japan’s foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, and Truss agreed last month to strike a swift deal on an economic partnership to secure continuous trade once Brexit is implemented on 1 January. Hiroshi Matsuura, Tokyo’s chief negotiator, warned in June that “to avoid a gap in January … we must complete negotiations by the end of July” in order for the ratification process in Japan’s parliament. It is understood that both sides expect to sign the deal by September. While Britain and Japan agreed to use the EU deal as the basis of the agreement, the UK also wanted to get a “reduction of elimination” of tariffs on goods and agriculture, particularly British beef exports, and market access for UK services. But it was made clear in the last few weeks that there was insufficient time to go into line-by-line tariff negotiations on agriculture, which was one of the most most difficult areas in the EU-Japan talks that led to a deal last year. “It is our highest priority to achieve an agreement within the timeframe … We need to adjust ambitions to a realistic level,” Matsuura told Reuters earlier this month. He added that digital trade would be an area where both countries could agree goals that went beyond the EU deal."
2020-07-28T18:00:09Z,politics,Politics,MPs may have been misled over BAME voter ID claims,"The government may have misled MPs over mandatory voter ID, after it was revealed the data cited by a minister to prove the system does not discriminate against BAME voters does not exist. Labour has said the disconnect between the Cabinet Office’s statement and the Electoral Commission’s evidence will raise questions over whether the government has examined any evidence on the impact on ethnic minority voters of requiring voters to bring ID in order to vote. The Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith said in June that “the evidence shows there is no impact on any particular demographic group … the evidence of our pilots shows that there is no impact on any particular demographic group from this policy.” Asked for the evidence in a written question last month, Smith said: “Based on the independent Electoral Commission’s evaluations of the 2018 and 2019 voter ID pilots, there is no indication that any consistent demographic was adversely affected by the use of voter ID.” However, in both of its most recent reports, the Electoral Commission said it had no way of measuring the effect of voter ID on minority ethnic communities’ votes. “Polling station staff were not asked to collect demographic data about the people who did not come back, owing to the practical challenges involved in carrying out that data collection exercise,” the body’s 2019 report said. “That means we have no direct evidence to tell us whether people from particular backgrounds were more likely than others to find it hard to show ID.” The 2019 report found in Derby, one of the pilot areas, that there was a strong correlation between the proportion of each ward’s population from an Asian background and the number of people not issued with a ballot paper – similar to a 2018 finding in Watford. However, the body cautioned against drawing any conclusions from that data and said there was not yet sufficient evidence in either direction. Cat Smith, the shadow minister for voter engagement, said the Windrush scandal had shown how some communities had face severe consequences when they had no official documentation. “The government continue to plough on with voter ID plans, turning a blind eye how this could disenfranchise ethnic minorities,” she said. “The government have stated repeatedly on record that evidence concludes voter ID has no impact on any particular demographic group. This is simply not true, the evidence does not exist. “If these US-style voter suppression plans go ahead, we could see BAME communities locked out of democracy. The government must correct the record and recognise the damaging impact that mandatory voter ID will have upon minority ethnic groups.” In a series of Freedom of Information requests by the Labour party, the government has also said it does not hold data on the possession of ID by ethnicity. Voting rights groups expressed serious concern at the findings. Darren Hughes, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said ministers had “apparently failed to gather any evidence” and said it was “baffling and looks deeply misleading”. He said the ERS research suggested the policy will disproportionately hit people of colour, older voters and those on low-incomes. Sam Grant, policy and campaigns manager at Liberty, said: “The fact the government doesn’t have the evidence to understand what impact this will have shows it is disregarding these risks and trying to plough ahead with plans that threaten the basic foundations of our democratic system.” In a statement, ChloeSmith said voter ID was “a reasonable way to combat the inexcusable potential for voter fraud in our current system and strengthen its integrity”. She added that there was a “wealth of evidence to show that voter ID does not impact voter turnout” including its operation in Northern Ireland for several decades and said the studies had shown the overwhelming majority of people cast their vote successfully in the pilot schemes. The 2019 Conservative manifesto pledged to introduce voter ID in primary legislation over the course of the parliament. The Cabinet Office said the Electoral Commission’s report had found 99.6% of electors coming to polling stations were able to cast their vote without a problem. • This article was amended on 3 August 2020 to clarify that a statement originally attributed only to “Smith” was from Chloe Smith, not Cat Smith."
2020-07-28T17:53:33Z,politics,Politics,UK: 119 new Covid-related deaths as PM says 'signs of second wave' in parts of Europe – as it happened,"Boris Johnson has said signs of a second wave of coronavirus in mainland Europe meant it was his duty to impose quarantine rules on people arriving in the UK from Spain. He has also suggested that more countries could follow Spain in having quarantine re-imposed for arrivals to the UK, although he also implied that the government is actively considering reducing the period of quarantine from 14 days to 10 days. (See 12.18pm.) Nicola Sturgeon has urged holidaymakers to avoid all non-essential foreign travel and instead stay in Scotland because of the heightened risk of a sudden change in coronavirus quarantine rules. As Severin Carrell reports, the first minister said the sudden decision last Saturday to require travellers from Spain to quarantine for 14 days underlined how volatile the situation had become, after a series of Covid-19 flare-ups in other countries. Speaking during her regular coronavirus press conference, she added: If it was me, I wouldnâ€™t be booking a foreign holiday right now. I would choose, if I had the time to go on holiday, I would be choosing to spend it here in Scotland. With Scotland reporting the 12th day in a row with no deaths of confirmed Covid-19 patients in hospital, Sturgeon said it was essential no unnecessary risks were taken. The Welsh government is also urging people to avoid foreign holidays. (See 1.51pm.) Sturgeon has said she is trying to get the UK government to follow Scotland in committing to the goal of eliminating coronavirus. (See 1.04pm and 4.27pm.) The UK has recorded a further 119 coronavirus deaths, taking the official headline total to 45,878. (See 4.33pm.) The government closing its furlough scheme this autumn is a â€œmistakeâ€� that will drive up unemployment by 1.2 million by Christmas, one of the UKâ€™s leading economics thinktanks has warned. People in Oldham have been told to stop visiting friends and family to avoid a full local lockdown after the number of coronavirus cases more than quadrupled in a week.

2020-07-28T17:17:01Z,politics,Politics,"Times were tense on the Shapps' family holiday, then the Spanish PM rang... | John Crace","A fitful night’s sleep hadn’t eased the tension in the Shapps’ family compound in the south of Spain. Conversation was limited to a few terse exchanges as Grant started packing his bags for his return home. “But you told the Today programme back in April that you wouldn’t be taking a family holiday abroad this summer,” his wife reminded him. “So how come we’ve ended up in this villa and will have to quarantine for 14 days on our return?” “Um …” Shapps mumbled. “Well, everything seemed to be getting a bit better, we had introduced some air corridors and the flights were dirt cheap …” “So it’s sod’s law that you, the transport secretary, chose to fly on the one air corridor that you knew was going to be closed before we had even taken off.” “Look, I’ve said I’m sorry countless times. I just couldn’t be seen to be acting on inside knowledge. Not that I had any.” “So instead you look like a complete twat by cutting short a holiday you said you weren’t going to take, in order to get your 14 days of quarantine over and done with as soon as possible, while leaving me and the kids behind.” “That’s one way of looking at it …” “Chill out, Mum,” said the kids. “We’ll probably have a better time without him. At least we won’t have the embarrassment of being photographed on the beach again.” Moments later there was an insistent knock on the door. Shapps got up to open it, to be greeted by two Spanish secret service officers. “We’ve got prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, on the phone. He’s very keen to have a word with you about your government’s changes to its coronavirus guidelines for Spain. And yes, he has got a translator with him.” Grant reluctantly took the receiver, sensing that a bad day was about to get a whole lot worse. “So what the fuck is going on?” Sánchez demanded. “We have a spike in infections in Catalunya and Aragon and even then our daily death figures are lower than the UK. And what do you do? You effectively close down the whole country to English tourists.” “Try to look on the bright side,” Shapps replied. “At least you won’t have to deal with a whole load of drunks in Magaluf and bookings for self-catering holidays in the UK have gone through the roof.” “But it’s just mad. Why did you have to impose the same restrictions on the Canaries and the Balearics? Both of them have extremely low rates of infection and the islands aren’t full of people like Toby Young who think wearing a mask is an affront to their national identity. Except for the Brits.” “That’s just it. The quarantine is to protect ourselves against our own tourists who go on holiday, get pissed, forget to take any precautions and come back to the UK having given one another the coronavirus. And what we were also worried about was that tourists might fly in to Lanzarote and then try to sneak their way back to the Spanish mainland by boat …” “You do realise that Tenerife is about the same distance from Barcelona as London is? And nobody has ever booked a holiday to Ibiza and wound up in Granada by mistake. Not even Michael Gove when he was out of his head on coke. It makes about as much sense as imposing a total lockdown in the Falkland Islands when you have an outbreak in Leicester.” “Actually that’s an oversight on our part. We should have done that long ago.” “And if you’re really concerned about infection, how come Gibraltar got an exemption? Thousands of mainland Spaniards go to work there every day. And you do know there’s nothing stopping people flying in to the south of France and then driving over the Spanish border?” “Crikey. I hadn’t thought about that.” “Well, if you don’t get things sorted soon then we are going to retaliate by imposing a 28-day quarantine on anyone travelling to Spain from the Isle of Wight.” “Be my guest. You don’t want people like Richard Tice and Bob Seely coming into your country for a barbecue.” “The thing is, you’re giving the impression that you don’t have a clue what you’re doing. First you unilaterally impose a 14-day quarantine. Then you extend it to include Mallorca and the Canaries. And now I’m hearing from Boris Johnson that you might reduce the quarantine to just 10 days.” “Finally, we’re on the same page, Pedro,” said Shapps. “Looking as if we are panicking is exactly the impression we want to give. We got hammered for being slow to react back in March and we don’t want to make the same mistake again when the second spike inevitably comes. So we’re now determined to look tough by being the first to lock things back down regardless of whether they’re actually necessary. With any luck by this time next week I will have also shut down the air corridors to Italy, France and Greece. Just imagine the travel chaos. I’ll be headline news for weeks.” Sánchez shook his head and ended the conversation. There was no arguing with that kind of logic."
2020-07-28T09:19:31Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit will deliver double shock to UK economy, study finds","A Brexit hit is looming for sectors that have emerged relatively unscathed from the Covid-19 pandemic, analysis by the London School of Economics suggests. The LSE report says Brexit will deliver a double shock to the economy – with business conditions worsening for those sectors that have survived the impact of coronavirus and lockdown measures – whether Boris Johnson secures a deal with the EU or not. The analysis, seen by the Guardian before its publication on Wednesday, includes information from a monthly survey of Confederation of British Industry members. “Our analysis shows that the sectors that will be affected by Brexit and those that are suffering from the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown are generally different from each other,” said Swati Dhingra, an economics professor who co-authored the report. A “simultaneous impact” from Brexit and coronavirus will be felt across the business spectrum from the autumn when the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s pandemic policies aimed at supporting the unemployed end and the new trading environment for the UK outside the EU begins to bite, the research finds.
The report, Covid-19 and Brexit: Real-Time Updates on Business Performance in the United Kingdom by the LSE’s Centre for Economic Performance, shows sectors that entail more human contact – including hospitality, air travel, restaurants, hotels, and arts and entertainment – have been the hardest hit by the pandemic. The affect on other sectors such as the scientific industries, professional services, including accountancy and legal services, and publishing has been less severe because they can continue to operate with staff working from home. Among those reportedly continuing to operate with remote working are firms such as Vodafone, Google, the accountancy firm KPMG, GlaxoSmithKline, Rolls-Royce and the consumer goods group Unilever.
But Brexit will impose barriers on those trading goods or services with the EU, whether it is pharmaceutical companies seeking regulatory approval, banks or services needing to transfer data from servers in the bloc or car manufacturers or clothes importers being required to fill in customs declarations for the first time in decades. The report points out that as far back as 2017 the government announced that Brexit would be guided by impact assessments across sectors; it has provided detailed analysis in only 10 sectors to date. “The government must move beyond its broad assessment of Brexit impacts to much more finely tuned plans” in preparation for the “biggest slowdown of our lifetime” said Josh de Lyon, a research assistant at the LSE centre who co-authored the report. Dhingra said the coronavirus pandemic had “reduced the capacity of the UK economy to take further shocks”, and “rushing Brexit through” would “broaden the set of sectors” that experienced worsening business conditions. Using monthly data collected by the CBI on business experiences and expectations of growth or declines, along with what it describes as “state of the art” modelling, the centre has been able to assess the outlook for the next three months. LSE, like other big institutions, is loath to put a figure on the projected combined shock to the economy although various sectors have warned of hardship coming down the tracks. The manufacturing body Make UK warned that more than half of the manufacturing sector was planning redundancies when the business support schemes ended. The LSE report urges the government to put in place an industrial strategy that “must reflect” the cold reality of “being in a post-Brexit UK which is placed in a post-Covid world economy” in which global trade shrinks."
2020-07-27T21:30:04Z,politics,Politics,Cycling ambitions for England move up a gear with No 10 plans,"If England does, as Boris Johnson has promised, enjoy a new era of mass walking and cycling, then two of the primary reasons could be lurking within the more technical and unglamorous elements of his £2bn policy announcement: updated regulations and a new watchdog. For countless years, while central government and local authorities talked up the benefits of safer streets and more cycling, too many of the actual bike lanes built ended up being little more than precipitously slim strips of paint, often ending abruptly. But under the new No 10 plans, bike lane design standards are not only being updated, but will be enforced by a body called Active Travel England. Billed as a travel equivalent of Ofsted, it can insist on certain designs, inspect what is built and withdraw funding from councils that are too tardy or unambitious. Veterans of the cycling world will detect in this tough approach the hand of Andrew Gilligan, who as Johnson’s cycling tsar when the PM was mayor of London pushed through a rapid second-term programme of bike lanes, metaphorically twisting the arms of certain councils to speed things up. Gilligan, like Johnson a journalist by trade, is now a No 10 adviser and is heavily involved in the walking and cycling programme. It has been welcomed by campaign groups – albeit with some warnings about the need for more funding – who detect in Johnson a politician who might, finally, instigate some sort of real change in active travel. For all the talk over several years of cycling booms, riding a bike for transport remains distinctly niche, with only 1-2% of all trips across the UK made via cycling, a figure unchanged for years. Johnson is, famously, a keen city cyclist himself, even if high office means he now has to be ferried about by car. But he will be particularly keen on getting more Britons active as a parallel to his new anti-obesity strategy, boosting public health in a new world of pandemics.
While the focus on risk factors for Covid-19 has been mainly on weight, many of the comorbidities linked to poorer outcomes, such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, are just as closely connected to inactive living, which is estimated to causeabout 100,000 non-Covid deaths across the UK every year. Will the new announcement turn us into a Dutch-style nation of utility cyclists? No, not least because such transformations take decades, not years, and much will depend on consistent political will, and funding, over the very long term. But campaigners will be encouraged by the ambition, not least the effective ban on new paint-only bike lanes. They will also welcome moves to create more low-traffic neighbourhoods, which block rat-running motor vehicles. For all the focus on separated bike routes, on smaller roads the way to encourage both cyclists and pedestrians is fewer cars, with those remaining travelling at lower speeds, something that sounds simple but has proved politically very difficult. Johnson has made it something of a trademark to promise a “golden era” for walking and cycling. This is a start. Whether it amounts to more than that will necessarily take time. • The main image of this article was changed on 28 July 2020 to one more appropriate to the facts of the story."
2020-07-27T17:50:10Z,politics,Politics,UK transport secretary Grant Shapps to return from Spain amid quarantine row – as it happened,"The UK government has this afternoon tightened up its travel advice for Spain, saying it is advising against all non-essential travel to the country, including the Balearic and Canary Islands. At the weekend the islands were not included when the government advised against all non-essential travel to mainland Spain, and reimposed quarantine for arrivals from all parts of Spain, including the islands. Spain has said it is in talks with the UK about getting an exemption for the Canaries and Balearics. But government sources have indicated that no exemption will be granted soon and instead the latest moves shows the rules for the islands being tightened, not relaxed. The government has recorded just seven new UK coronavirus deaths on its daily dashboard - the lowest daily headline total since early March. See 5.06pm. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has said he is cutting short his holiday in Spain and coming home early following the decision to reimpose quarantine on arrivals from the country. He said this would allow him to get his period in quarantine over as soon as possible.
The British government â€œpanickedâ€� when it decided to impose a 14-day quarantine on visitors returning from Spain, according to the Ryanair chief executive, Michael Oâ€™Leary, who called the move a â€œbadly managed overreactionâ€�. Imposing an earlier lockdown in England would have saved lives, according to a report into the high death rate of London bus drivers in the pandemic by a leading expert on health and social inequalities. A pet cat has been diagnosed with Covid-19, the first case of animal infection with coronavirus in the UK, the government has confirmed. Police were twice as likely to fine young black and Asian men under the lockdown rules than their white counterparts, according to new figures that underline concerns about racial bias in policing. Sir Mark Sedwill, the outgoing cabinet secretary, has said in a speech at Oxford University that â€œdemoralisingâ€� anonymous criticism of government officials has â€œrisen in the last few yearsâ€�. He said: Any kind of anonymous briefings and sniping is demoralising for people ... Itâ€™s not completely unique but it has definitely risen in the last few years. Ministers were also victims of this sort of briefing, he said. Thereâ€™s nothing more destabilising for a senior cabinet minister to read a whole load of stuff in one of the newspapers about whether or not the skids are under them because of something thatâ€™s happened. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. Our coronavirus coverage continues on our coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-07-27T17:25:51Z,politics,Politics,One Nation group of centrist Conservatives to relaunch,"The centrist Tory caucus, which led opposition to a hardline no-deal Brexit under Theresa May, is to relaunch this summer with 100 MPs and a blitz of new policies aimed at pulling Boris Johnson away from the hard right of the party. Policies expected to be backed by the One Nation group over the coming months include a drive to protect aid spending and raising taxes on unearned income. The group, which was originally spearheaded by the former cabinet minister Amber Rudd, was organised to counter the influence of the European Research Group, which backs hard Brexit and which had flourished in opposition to May’s Brexit deal. Most of the group’s key figures, including the former cabinet members David Gauke, David Mundell, Claire O’Neill and Rory Stewart, have left parliament and many have been ousted or resigned from the party.
“Many of us were asking ourselves: is this still our party?” one senior backbencher said. “Have we ceased to be a Cameronite, liberal, one nation party? The battle is still going on – though it’s a bit more polite. “There is a tussle going to define Boris. We are reconciled to Brexit because of the democratic mandate from the election. But there is still a fight to be had about what sort of party we are – over agriculture and trade, over the economy and coronavirus support. Is this an attempt to bring out the liberal, one nation Boris? Yes, it is.” The former Cabinet Office minister Damian Green, who chairs the group, said he was keen to move the focus of the group away from Brexit and added that there was a need for an “intellectual regeneration” of the party. “In a first-past-the-post political system, a successful party has to be a coalition,” Green said. “And the moderate voice has got to be very loud inside the Conservative choir or it becomes narrow and sectarian. “If you want to see what can happen to parties who only appeal to a narrow part of their base, then look at 2019 and Labour. The Tory party must never end up like that. We have had bad times, when some of my best friends in politics were being thrown out of the Tory party. But I maintained what I want to continue fighting for.” The group’s new website, launched on Monday, counts more than 100 members, making up more than a third of the parliamentary party. Green said a significant number of the MPs contributing to the group were from the new intake of 2019 and were keen to contribute ideas on “levelling up” the divide between north and south. “This is exactly what their voters, first-time Conservatives, want to see.” Another policy he said was “non-negotiable” for Conservatives like him was continuing the commitment to 0.7% of GDP on aid spending. Stephen Hammond, the former health minister who lost the Tory whip over his opposition to a no-deal Brexit but then regained it to fight the 2019 election, has written one of the group’s paper’s on the post-Covid economic recovery. “Much of this is where Boris has been, evidenced in the second half of his mayoralty in London. We want to present practical solutions to problems presenting us in the post-Covid world.” George Freeman, a former transport minister and the author of the group’s statement of principles, said: “Last year Boris won a massive majority by promising to end the Brexit civil war and deliver Brexit and an inspiring one nation programme of investment in ‘levelling up’ to spread opportunity across the whole country. We need to honour both parts of that promise.”"
2020-07-27T15:44:31Z,politics,Politics,Shapps feels the pain in Spain on holiday from hell,"Imagine the scene: Grant Shapps and his family had flown in to Spain on Saturday lunchtime, picked up the hire car and had just settled into the self-catering villa when he chose to break the bad news. As of midnight UK time, anyone returning from Spain would have to quarantine themselves for 14 days on their return home. “Now you tell us,” his wife and three children had chorused angrily. “We thought you were meant to be the ‘air corridor’ transport secretary. Did you actually know this was going to happen?” “Well I did get a text this morning from Matt Hancock saying he was much enjoying his hols canoeing in England and how sorry he was to screw up our time in Spain. Though he didn’t give me any exact details. But in any case if we had cancelled our hols then it would have looked like we’d been acting on inside information.” “So let’s get this straight. You let us all come out here knowing that we would have to be cooped up at home for a fortnight on our return. Didn’t you think that some of us might have stuff arranged for when we got back? Worse still why have you knowingly flown us into a place where we’re more likely to get sick?” “You needn’t worry too much about that. Most of Spain has a far lower rate of coronavirus infection than the UK. So we’re probably safer out here than back home.” “In which case why have you put blanket quarantine restrictions on the entire country? Wouldn’t it have been better just to target those regions where the infection rate had gone up?” “Oh,” said Shapps. “I hadn’t thought of that. Michael Gove just said we had to include the whole of Spain because he’s got a holiday in Ibiza booked and he rather fancied an extra two weeks lounging around at home when he gets back.” The rest of the evening had passed in an uneasy silence. His wife was giving him the cold shoulder and the kids were on their phones texting their friends about what a moron they had for a Dad. Things were still tense the following morning, but eventually everyone agreed to go down to the beach for lunch. On reflection a mistake, because it was just his luck there was one Brit who happened to recognise him and within minutes he was being harangued by dozens of holidaymakers who were pissed off to find out their summer had been completely ruined. Shapps’s first instinct had been to try and lie his way out of it. “I’m not Grant Shapps,” he had insisted. “I’m Michael Green. I mean, me llamo Miguel Verde.” But after 20 minutes or so, he had been ground down and forced to give an informal briefing to a bunch of angry strangers. No, he couldn’t give them any advice on claiming statutory sick pay or universal credit for the quarantine period. And no, he had no idea how long the self-isolation restrictions would remain in place. In fact he was just as clueless as they were about the current situation. It had all been a bit last minute and the government was still making policy up on the hoof. After a miserable lunch, Shapps and his family returned to the villa. “There’s only one way this holiday is going to work,” said his wife. “And that’s if you remain inside the compound where no one can see you for the next two weeks, while me and the kids go off in the car and try to enjoy ourselves as best we can without you.” Grant nodded meekly. So on Monday morning, Shapps found himself at a bit of a loose end. Out of boredom as much as curiosity, he phoned his government department. “Look on the bright side,” said his special adviser. “You’re not the only minister who has been caught out. Paul Scully is stuck in Lanzarote.” “Who is Paul Scully?” “No idea. But I’ve been told he’s been tweeting photos of a couple of beers on the Playa Dorada along with some bollocks about people behaving confidently and sensibly.” “So can you give me any more information about what’s going on? Can’t we at least open up the Canaries and the Balearics?” “Fraid not. The Foreign Office has got it in for them, too. God knows why. Nobody in Whitehall has a clue what’s going on. Things are so bad they even sent Helen Whately out to do the morning media round. Besides, nobody ever listens to a word we say.” “Well can we try and find out where Dominic Raab is going for his holidays and impose quarantine restrictions there? Even if it’s in England and it means closing down the whole of the West Country.” Having wasted two minutes watching the video of Boris Johnson talking up the benefits of exercise, Shapps dozed off. Only to be woken a few hours later by the return of his family. “It’s no good. I’ve decided I’m going home on Wednesday,” he told them. “I’m bored out of my mind on my own here.” “Are you serious?” his wife replied. “You mean you dragged us all out here knowing we were going to be in quarantine and now you’re going back early because of the quarantine. You can’t make this stuff up. No wonder most people think everyone in government is a complete twat.” “I’m sorry. But I think it’s for the best,” Grant mumbled sheepishly. “And I guess I might get some time off quarantine with a visit to Barnard Castle. In any case I won’t have to do any food shopping as I can take advantage of the government’s obesity strategy that will give me £10 off every Burger King Deliveroo meal.”"
2020-07-26T21:00:34Z,politics,Politics,"Commons may never return to packed chamber debates, says Speaker","The House of Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has said parliament may never return to the packed and noisy chamber debates while coronavirus remains a threat – but said he would be keen to cease virtual contributions as soon as it is safe for MPs to return to Westminster. Hoyle, who took the Speaker’s chair late last year after John Bercow, warned he would oppose moves to take parliament to York during the restoration of the Palace of Westminster, saying he felt it was important MPs remained in the capital. “It would be nice to be able to turn the clock back and know that you could have a full chamber without risk,” he told the BBC’s Westminster Hour. “But while there’s risk, I cannot see it. Safety does come first – it’s about protecting people. “There is no greater day than seeing a packed chamber with everybody jostling to be in there. That’s what brings this House alive, that’s what makes this House. But that won’t happen until we know it’s safe.” Hoyle said he was keen to return to a system where MPs must make all contributions in person, rather than virtually, but said he “can’t see that happening tomorrow … I think we’re a little bit further away from normality as we knew it.” Hoyle, the MP for Chorley, said as a Lancastrian it would be “hard to stomach being the Speaker in York” but said he was also serious in his concern about moving parliament out of London – something which has been proposed by Boris Johnson. MPs are set to decant from Westminster for lengthy restoration works on the crumbling palace. “Joking apart, I think it is important that you’re in the capital city. I think this is the home of parliament,” he said, adding that MPs and peers would ultimately decide the location. “The one thing all of us can agree on is that we need to get on with doing some repairs. We need to make this place safe, we’ve got to make it fit for purpose. So something will have to happen. But it’s not for me to decide – it’s for the House to decide.” Hoyle said he was not prepared to relax the 2-metre distancing in parliament for the time being. “I have a duty of care to staff of this House, staff of MPs and MPs themselves … I wanted to hold the rules – people wanted to take the 2-metre rule down – I think it’s been the right thing to do.” Hoyle said he had been disturbed over recent months about decisions by Downing Street to announce major new policies at press briefings rather than in the Commons. “If there’s something new to come out and you want to tell the world, tell parliament and let the world watch it from parliament’s eyes,” he said. “We’re elected to scrutinise. Members are elected to hold the government to account and we’ve got to allow them to do so. And if you’re briefing the press first, that’s not the way forward. It’s not good for Downing Street, it’s not good for relations and it doesn’t endear your own backbenchers. They want to know that they count and that they matter. And I think that’s the way forward for all of us.”"
2020-07-26T07:07:17Z,politics,Politics,Lib Dem leadership hopeful Layla Moran hints at closer links with Labour,"Scrapping Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system would be a precondition for the Liberal Democrats considering a future coalition with Labour, a contender to lead the party has warned. Layla Moran, who is vying for the job alongside acting party leader Ed Davey, said that she was interested in building significant levels of cooperation with Labour before the next election. She even suggested the parties could build a joint campaigning force where it benefited them. In an interview with the Observer, the Oxford West and Abingdon MP said she was best placed to overhaul her party’s relationship with Labour. Successive Lib Dem leaders have ruled out coalitions with Labour or the Tories since the party’s electoral collapse following its coalition with the Conservatives under Nick Clegg, but Moran said she would not rule out such a deal with Keir Starmer. However, she suggested ending first past the post would be a prerequisite. “I’ve absolutely ruled out a coalition with the Tories,” she said. “I would never say never [to a coalition with Labour], especially with a more centrist progressive Labour leader, as we’ve seen under Keir. We’ve still got a long way to go and I think Labour still has to revamp their own policy platform. I think top of the list of something I’d be looking for is electoral reform. Without it, actually, it would end up hurting the party potentially to do anything. So without seeing the small print, it’s hard to say one way or the other, but it’s not ruled out.” She called on activists within the two parties to consider forming a “huge campaigning force” to help each other at the next election. She said she wanted a “Paddy plus” arrangement with Labour, in reference to the close relationship between former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown and Tony Blair before the 1997 election.
“We need to be really smart about it,” she said. “I would like to get to the point where at the very least, in those seats where we stand a chance of defeating the Tories, [activists] aren’t fighting each other, because that just defeats the purpose. But even better, if we can inspire a progressive movement of activists to take those seats off Boris Johnson’s Tories, that’s where I’d like to get to. ‘Paddy plus’ is kind of what we’re aiming for, but it’s not a pact and it’s not anything formal.” Voting to decide who will replace Jo Swinson, who lost her seat in the 2019 election, begins this week. Moran’s manifesto, launched this week, includes support for a universal basic income. However, she rejected the idea that the Lib Dems would be to the left of Labour under her leadership. She said that unlike her rival Davey, who was a minister in the coalition government, she was best placed to build a constructive relationship with Starmer and Labour.
“That coalition hangover means that the vitriol between the parties is really palpable. I would love to get to the point where that heat was taken out of the relationship between Labour and the Lib Dems, because that would also help actually achieve something that’s greater than all of this stuff, which is frankly tactical – which is a kinder, gentler politics in our country that is less divisive and generally more respectful.” She said the past decade for the party had “clearly been disastrous”, attacking the party’s support for revoking Brexit. She ruled out backing rejoining the EU for at least five years. “We have to accept that public opinion just isn’t there yet. There’s a battle to be won in the hearts of people first. “Let’s show people why, had we stayed, it would have been in our interests … by making the positive case for why we should have an ever closer trading relationship, why we want to maintain our British-EU standards that we helped to create.”"
2020-07-26T07:03:17Z,politics,Politics,Risk of ‘unrest’ if civil servants are forced into hasty return to office,"Boris Johnson’s hopes of getting people to return to work from 1 August are in serious doubt as the UK’s biggest civil service union warns of “serious industrial unrest” if public servants across the country are pushed to return to their offices too early. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), which has 200,000 members, has reacted furiously after being told at a private meeting in Downing Street on Thursday that the Cabinet Office’s permanent secretary, Alex Chisholm, has written to all Whitehall departments, asking them to report back on how they could get more people to return as early as next month. While the letter made clear it would be left to the discretion of individual departments to decide what was safe, the unions were given the impression that civil servants were being asked to “take the lead” and “set an example” after Johnson announced earlier this month that the “stay at home” guidance would end from 1 August. A source close to negotiations with government said: “It was clear that this is the big push from the centre to say you should now be accelerating work to bring people back in. On the face of it, this looks like departments are just being asked what their plans are. In reality this is the big push.” In a letter to the Cabinet Office after the meeting that has been obtained by the Observer the PCS’s general secretary, Mark Serwotka, raises concerns about safety and asks for urgent reassurances about the government’s plans. He also points to “contradictions” between what he sees as the Cabinet Office’s apparent instruction that a return was now required, and an accompanying message that it would be left to individual departments to react as they saw fit. In the letter, Serwotka warns of dire consequences unless the union’s concerns are met. “This unnecessary and hasty push for an upscaling at workplaces has the potential to create serious industrial unrest,” he says, adding that no consideration had been given to using the Covid-19 crisis to rethink how civil servants could work in future. “It is clear that this is a political decision to use public sector workers to prop up and maintain an already decaying economic model, regardless of the risks to their safety.” A union source said that balloting members on strike action was not being planned, but neither was it being ruled out. “There are no immediate plans for a ballot, but nothing is off the table.”
Johnson announced 10 days ago that he wanted to begin a return to normality from the start of August, despite misgivings among his senior scientific advisers. Instead of all workers being told to work remotely where possible, the prime minister said people could return at the “discretion” of their employers. They would no longer be advised to stay away from public transport, he added. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is known to be deeply frustrated at the cost to the country of running almost empty trains and underground trains, because so many workers in the capital are not coming in to work. Dave Penman, general secretary of the First Division Association, which represents civil servants of all grades, including many on the highest grades said: “Many civil servants are performing as well, if not more effectively, remotely.” He added: “Many are coming back to offices for roles that cannot work remotely or they don’t have a suitable home-working environment. Offices and transport cannot cope with a full return and so this next phase needs to be handled carefully. Planning for a partial return can be as, if not more, complicated than the original transition to home working. There will always be work that cannot be done remotely but the future of work was already changing and the last six months has accelerated that.”Most workers in private sector firms are not represented by unions and must rely on company executives to make workplaces safe. Business lobby groups said that after consulting their members they were concerned that many employers would be unable to bring workers back to town and city centre offices without clearer guidance about how schools would reopen in September and the health risks of travelling on public transport. Josh Hardie, deputy-director general of the CBI, said recent government guidelines on how to manage workplace environments helped employers reassure staff about their safety at work. But he said that while “businesses can take the lead in the workplace, changes in messaging on transport and further testing are also vital for building confidence and minimising the risk of a disastrous second wave”. Claire Walker, a director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “For many employees, returning to the workplace is contingent on schools reopening, the availability of wraparound care and the capacity of public transport.” She said many businesses faced huge costs adapting their workplaces to conform with the latest guidelines, and they should be allowed to offset this expense against their tax bill, “which would help many to return to workplaces over the coming months”. A spokesman for the Health and Safety Executive said: “We have been working across government to ensure all employers have the right guidance to enable a safe return to workplaces. “The Cabinet Office, and each department, will need to carry out their own risk assessment for civil servants, just like other employers.It is now up to employers to decide if their workers will need to remain working at home or return to the workplace.” A government spokesperson said: “Civil servants have worked throughout the pandemic, and have made significant, valuable contributions towards the national effort. “We are ensuring workplaces are Covid-secure so civil servants can return safely, and are developing plans to make sure departments are productive whilst fully respecting public health rules.”"
2020-07-25T23:01:07Z,politics,Politics,Doctors to prescribe bike rides to tackle UK obesity crisis,"GPs will be encouraged to prescribe cycling as a way for patients to lose weight, as part of a new government strategy to tackle the nation’s obesity crisis to be announced on Monday. In what Downing Street says is its biggest initiative to encourage more people to take exercise, the plans to be revealed by prime minister Boris Johnson could also mean GP surgeries participating in bicycle schemes, to make cycling easier and cheaper to take up. Government officials say that a key challenge will be to make people feel safer on bikes in busy urban areas. This, they accept, will mean spending huge sums on segregated cycle lanes and secure cycle parking as well as developing low-traffic neighbourhoods. Initially the plans will be trialled in areas with poor health and physical activity rates, with a view to expanding them across the country if successful.
A government spokesperson said: “Covid-19 has given us all a wake-up call [on] the immediate and long-term risks of being overweight, and the prime minister is clear we must use this moment to get healthier, more active and eat better. We will be urging the public to use this moment to take stock of how they live their lives, and to take simple steps to lose weight, live healthier lives, and reduce pressure on the NHS.” Johnson, who cycled to work when mayor of London and as a backbench MP, has taken a personal interest in the new strategy, particularly since he was admitted to hospital and then intensive care with coronavirus. It comes amid growing evidence that excess weight is associated with a higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. Recent studies have also shown that cycling to work is linked to a 46% lower risk of heart disease compared with a non-active commute. Two-thirds (63%) of UK adults are above a healthy weight, with 36% overweight and 28% obese. Alarmingly, one in three children aged 10 to 11 are overweight or obese. Friends of Johnson say he has changed his previously “non-interventionist” views on the role the state should play in encouraging people to avoid fattening food and drink. As a result he is also expected to announce a ban on TV “junk food” advertisements before 9pm and possibly a ban on online promotions for unhealthy foods, and limits on in-store promotions.
Speaking during a recent visit to a GP surgery in east London, Johnson said that he did not normally support “nannying or bossying”, but added: “Obesity is one of the real co-morbidity factors. Losing weight, frankly, is one of the ways you can reduce your own risk from coronavirus.” In a further move to tackle expanding waistlines, people in England who are at risk of diabetes or already have the disease will from Monday be able to seek help without seeing their GP. They will be able to refer themselves to NHS England’s acclaimed Healthier You diabetes prevention programme, which helps patients lose weight and adopt healthier lifestyles. Until now people have had to visit their GP or nurse and have a blood test before being referred. NHS England’s decision to let people self-refer comes after the sharp fall in the number of patients visiting a GP surgery during the pandemic.
In future people will be able to use an online tool, hosted by Diabetes UK, to calculate their risk of developing diabetes. Anyone recording a moderate or high score can then refer themselves to their local branch of Healthier You, which provides weight and lifestyles coaches, online support groups and in some places wearable technology to monitor their health. More than 500,000 people have already been referred to the programme, which lasts for nine to 12 months. People who have completed it have lost an average of 3.6kg, NHS England says. Around 4.8 million Britons have been diagnosed with, or are thought to have, diabetes, which costs the NHS an estimated £10bn a year. Nine in ten of them have type 2 diabetes, which is closely associated with being overweight. “The evidence is now in: obesity can double your chance of dying from coronavirus. So this pandemic is a call to arms to adopt medically proven changes in what we eat and how we exercise”, said Sir Simon Stevens, NHS England’s chief executive."
2020-07-25T20:00:04Z,politics,Politics,Antisemitism: Labour warns of cash crisis as cases grow,"Labour will this week be formally notified of a batch of potentially costly new legal actions over antisemitism – days after a warning was issued to the shadow cabinet about the devastating toll the crisis is taking on the party’s finances. The Observer can reveal that lawyers from the Manchester-based firm 3D Solicitors, representing nine current and former Labour members, will notify the party’s high command early this week of the detailed basis of claims they are making for breaches of data protection and privacy rules. The nine individuals are all understood to have lodged confidential complaints to the party while Jeremy Corbyn was leader about what they saw as cases of antisemitism. But their email messages were contained in a report by party officials loyal to Corbyn that was leaked and reported in the media in April. A source close to the latest cases said: “This is about privacy and data protection. These were people who are or were normal party members and councillors who raised issues about antisemitism in good faith and confidentially with the party. They then found that they had been named in a report leaked deliberately, leading them to be abused on social media. No attempts, it seems, were made to protect their privacy.” Another informed source said: “If the party agrees to settle this, which it will if it has any sense, it will cost Labour a few hundred thousand pounds. If it reaches court and Labour loses, it will cost the party many millions.” The leaked report, which ran to 800 pages and was written when Corbyn was still leader, denied that under his leadership the party had failed to tackle antisemitism. On the contrary, it suggested that people who had not wanted him to be leader had deliberately stirred up the controversy in order to undermine him. It said: “At its extreme, some employees seem to have taken a view that the worse things got for Labour, the happier they would be, since this might expedite Jeremy Corbyn’s departure from office.”
The news of the latest cases follows the party’s decision last week to apologise and pay “substantial damages” to seven former party workers who turned whistleblowers over antisemitism in a Panorama documentary. They were accused at the time by the party of acting in bad faith and of being critics of Corbyn’s leadership. The decision to apologise and pay damages – which will cost the party more than £500,000 – underlines the determination of the new leader Keir Starmer to move on and end the crisis, whatever it takes. Last Tuesday, in a sign of growing anxiety about the potential for the crisis to cripple Labour, the shadow cabinet was briefed about the effect that legal actions are having on party funds and its ability to plan ahead. Members of Starmer’s office told the shadow cabinet gathered in a committee room in the House of Commons that while it was important that they began preparing for a huge year of local elections in 2021 – which will include elections to the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly, police commissioner elections, the London mayoral elections and council elections – there would be financial constraints. The officials said the next three big financial drains on the party all related to litigation involving the whistleblowers, fallout from the forthcoming report into antisemitism by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), and other civil cases being mounted by individuals against the party. Many believe the total costs could run into millions.
One shadow minister said: “The people responsible for all of this have created a toxic financial timebomb inside our party.” Another senior Labour figure said: “The message was that this is a big year, but don’t think there is much money to fight these elections.” It is understood that the nine individuals whose case will be submitted to the party next week are among a total of over 30 people, including the party’s former general secretary Iain McNicol, who are planning or considering legal action in the ongoing controversy. McNicol was named in the leaked report and after it was made public stepped down as a party whip in the Lords. Sources in the party say he believes it was a “hatchet job” by Corbyn supporters who fear they will be heavily criticised in the EHRC report and wanted to get their side of the story out before it is published in the next few months. One of those who may take legal action after being named in the leaked report said it was now clear that even the party’s most senior lawyer under Corbyn warned at the time that it was deliberately misleading and relied upon improperly obtained private correspondence. The individual said: “I’m appalled to see in black and white that Labour’s own legal advice was that these messages were being selectively used without context to create a misleading and damaging account.” But Corbyn said the legal settlement “risks giving credibility to misleading and inaccurate allegations about action taken to tackle antisemitism in the Labour party in recent years”. In a statement on social media on Wednesday, Corbyn criticised the agreement by the party to pay damages to the whistleblowers. He said: “The party’s decision to apologise today and make substantial payments to former staff who sued the party in relation to last year’s Panorama programme is a political decision, not a legal one.” This article was amended on 26 July 2020 to clarify that email messages, not WhatsApp messages, of the nine complainants were contained in the leaked antisemitism report."
2020-07-24T19:00:34Z,politics,Politics,Germany calls on UK to show more realism in Brexit negotiations,"Angela Merkel’s government has called for more realism from the UK in the ongoing trade and security talks, after the EU capitals were given a “sobering” update by Michel Barnier following the recent round of Brexit negotiations. After a presentation by the EU’s chief negotiator to ambassadors from the 27 member states on Friday, a spokesman for the German government, which holds the rolling EU presidency, said the bloc was ready to move negotiations quickly forward but “expressed the need for more realism in London”. The comments will be a blow to Downing Street, where it had been hoped the resolution of the EU’s internal budget and recovery fund debate would allow Merkel and the other leaders to intervene and unblock the negotiation following a month of little progress. “With the [budget] now wrapped up we hope member states will become more engaged in this process in Brussels and get them moving forward politically in a helpful way,” a UK source close to the negotiations said. The two sides completed their latest round of negotiations in London on Thursday without being able to agree on the basic outlines of a deal to reassure businesses about the future, which Boris Johnson had said in June should be possible. But despite publicly warning on Thursday that a deal by the end of the year appeared “unlikely” given the British position on fisheries and Brussels’ demands for a “level playing field”, sources said Barnier had not been overly pessimistic in his presentation on Friday. He warned the ambassadors that he believed negotiations needed to be wrapped up by the beginning of October due to the lengthy ratification process. Echoing the language recently used by the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, Barnier said that even if the deal on offer was “low quality”, as recently claimed by the British official, a “zero tariff, zero quota” agreement was a prize worth having. He added the EU would be open to revisiting some issues next year to strike separate agreements if the current negotiation was successful. The two main obstacles to a deal remain the access of European fishing fleets to British waters and arrangements to ensure neither side can undercut the other by lowering regulatory standards or unfairly subsidising industry. It is understood a number of the eight member states with the greatest interest in fishing access reiterated to the room of ambassadors that they would not agree to a deal without agreement on fisheries. Last week’s talks on fishing access focused on quota-sharing arrangements and the list of stocks for which shares need to be agreed. Barnier claimed the UK was effectively excluding European fleets from key stocks of fish in a move that risked destroying the bloc’s fishing industry.
On level playing field clauses, both sides have agreed there should be a “non-regression” on labour, the environment and climate standards as they stand at the end of the transition period. The EU is demanding a “forward-looking” mechanism to ensure there is no regulatory undercutting in the future should the EU further develop its rulebook. There is a deadlock on state aid rules, with Brussels calling for the UK to publish its plans for controlling subsidies once the UK is outside the single market and customs union. Downing Street has so far appeared reluctant to respond to Barnier’s pressure, insisting its rulebook is wholly independent from the EU now the country has left the bloc. EU sources said there was concern in Brussels that interest in striking a deal was waning in London but that an agreement in September remained the most likely outcome given the economic damage of failure."
2020-07-24T18:09:41Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson admits government could have handled crisis differently in early months – as it happened,"Boris Johnson admitted the government could have handled the UK’s coronavirus outbreak differently and there were lessons to be learned, including on the timing of the lockdown. One year on from taking office, the prime minister told BBC News the government had underestimated the extent of asymptomatic transmission and didn’t fully understand the coronavirus in the “first few weeks and months” of the pandemic. It marked a significant departure from his previous insistence that the government took “the right decisions at the right time” based on scientific advice.
A lack of PPE, inadequate testing, and discharging people from hospitals into care homes were the key mistakes made by the UK government in its approach to England, MPs were told. The responses, seen exclusively by the Guardian, were given as part of a major coronavirus inquiry. Older people were “catastrophically let down” and many died before their time, according to the Age UK charity, and the BMA said the government’s testing and tracing capabilities at the start of the crisis fell “far short” of what was needed and left the infection to “spread unchecked”. The Unite union doctors group said the government had been slow and had “squandered” weeks of valuable time. The Office for National Statistics estimates that 27,700 people had coronavirus in England last week, suggesting cases have either remained stable over recent weeks or have potentially started to rise. In the latest report, published on Friday, the number of new infections in the week of 13 to 19 July were estimated at 2,800 per day, compared with 1,700 per day the week before. Separately, the government published its latest estimates of the R number, which reflects the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to. In England, R stands at 0.8 to 1, meaning the pandemic is stable and potentially in decline. Growth rates published alongside the latest R values suggest infections are falling by 1% to 4% per day. The UK government’s tally of Covid-associated deaths rose by 123 to 45,677. That’s it from me from the UK side. Thank you for reading along and to everybody who got in touch throughout the day. If you would like to continue following the Guardian’s coronavirus coverage, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture."
2020-07-24T13:48:07Z,politics,Politics,"Labour was warned antisemitism report was deliberately misleading, leak reveals","Labour’s most senior lawyer under Jeremy Corbyn formally warned the party that an internal report on antisemitism was deliberately misleading and relied upon improperly obtained private correspondence, leaked documents show. Thomas Gardiner, Labour’s director of governance and legal until last month, wrote that the report should not be circulated because party employees’ emails and WhatsApp messages had been “presented selectively and without their true context in order to give a misleading picture”. The report, which was leaked to the media, was compiled to be submitted to an inquiry by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into Labour’s handling of antisemitism complaints. Gardiner’s comments, sent in an email to the party’s then general secretary, Jennie Formby, will be a key piece of evidence for 32 former Labour officials, including the former general secretary Iain McNicol, who are suing the party for data breaches and libel within the leaked report. The 851-page report – which is subject to an independent inquiry led by QC Martin Forde – blames former Labour officials opposed to Corbyn for hampering his efforts to tackle abuse and sabotaging the party’s 2017 general election campaign. The report included WhatsApp messages, emails and texts from staff. Formby told the Guardian she authorised the search of the party’s internal systems, including WhatsApp groups, after the EHRC asked her to do so for its inquiry. Supporters of the current Labour leader, Keir Starmer, have accused Corbyn and his allies of unleashing a wave of claims against Labour that threaten to leave the party having to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in legal bills. Allies of Corbyn have hit back, saying Gardiner had previously supported publication of the report and the use of private correspondence but had changed his mind after becoming aware it had been leaked to the media. According to documents seen by the Guardian, Gardiner wrote the email to Formby to register his concerns on 11 April. He objected that the authors were trying to “lay false blame” on him for failings in the complaints process. He continued: “I also object further on the grounds that large sections of the report have been compiled using email searches which were not authorised for the authors to undertake including improper searches of my email account. “The report also includes confidential private WhatsApp and other messages – a clear and unacceptable breach of confidence. Further, these messages are presented selectively and without their true context in order to give a misleading picture,” he wrote. “I realise it will not be helpful not to further use the report, given that it has apparently been leaked in a previous version, but I must register this formal objection.” Formby told the Guardian she had authorised the searches of emails and WhatApp messages, which were legitimately carried out at the request of the EHRC. “As general secretary, I authorised the searches which were legitimately carried out. The information used in the internal report into the handling of antisemitism complaints came to light when searches were undertaken in response to EHRC requests,” she said. “The EHRC asked the Labour party to search all its internal systems, including WhatsApp groups where possible, and the party’s staff handbook makes clear that staff communications on internal party systems can be searched in this way.” One of the 32 claimants told the Guardian the evidence in Gardiner’s email was “hugely damaging” for Labour. “Those looking to take legal action against [the] party for the leaked report have long argued that the messages have been edited to create a misleading and damaging impression. What this email suggests is that this is exactly what Labour knew it was doing,” the claimant said. The email was revealed amid renewed Labour infighting after the party agreed to pay out a six-figure sum to seven former employees and a BBC journalist, admitting it defamed them in the aftermath of a Panorama investigation into its handling of antisemitism. The leaked report was intended to be submitted as an annexe to the EHRC inquiry into Labour’s approach to dealing with antisemitism. Commissioned before Starmer became leader, it contained leaked WhatsApp messages referring to Corbyn-supporting party staff as “trots” and conversations referring to the former director of communications Seumas Milne as “dracula”. There were also mentions of Corbyn’s former chief of staff, Karie Murphy, as “medusa”, a “crazy woman” and a “bitch face cow” that would “make a good dartboard”. Formby, who stood down as general secretary in May, declined to comment on Gardiner’s email. “In view of the ongoing independent inquiry it would not be appropriate,” she said. A Labour party spokesperson said: “It would not be appropriate to comment further while investigations are being carried out.” The EHRC said: “This is still an ongoing investigation and we cannot comment on the details.” Gardiner, who stood down as head of the governance and legal unit in June, was also approached for a comment."
2020-07-23T19:10:39Z,politics,Politics,Sturgeon accuses Johnson of using Covid-19 as 'political weapon',"Boris Johnson was accused of using the coronavirus pandemic “as some kind of political weapon” by Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, against a backdrop of rising tension over the future of the union. Sturgeon accused the prime minster of “celebrating” the pandemic after Johnson used his first visit to Scotland since last December’s election to hammer home his message that the UK’s response to the virus exemplified the “sheer might” of the union. He claimed it would have spelled economic disaster for Scotland had it not been able to rely on the UK Treasury for assistance. Describing the furlough scheme as a “fantastic demonstration of the way we work together as one country”, Johnson denied using the crisis to shore up diminishing support for the union, as polling shows a sustained majority in favour of Scottish independence for the first time. Johnson did not respond to questions about reported cabinet panic at growing support for independence, after it emerged on Wednesday that he had ordered senior ministers to visit Scotland more regularly and make their government more visible in the Scottish media. Resurrecting instead the lead slogan from the 2014 referendum’s pro-union campaign, he said: “I think the country is far better together and that’s what I believe in.”
The relationship between the Westminster government and devolved administrations has become increasingly strained over the pandemic, as an initially unprecedented “four-nations” approach fell away, with groups charged with coordinating the inter-governmental response simply ceasing to meet by early May. A report published on Thursday by the Scottish affairs committee described a “vacuum” in ministerial-level communication between the UK and Scottish governments, and detailed how collaboration between the nations deteriorated as lockdown measures started to be eased. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has complained that, despite giving himself the title “minister for the union”, Johnson has failed to speak to its component parts. Insisting he was not politicising the crisis, Johnson added: “It’s not a remotely political point, I just happen to think that’s the best way to do things and I think it’s a great thing for our country. “When you strip away some of the rhetoric, beneath it the UK is dealing with the crisis in a way that is very uniform across the whole of the country and we’re going to get through it together.” Despite sustained criticism from the Scottish Conservatives of Sturgeon’s more cautious approach to opening up the economy, most recently with the Scottish government advising office workers to continue to work from home while Johnson has encouraged them to return to workplaces, the prime minister said: “The unity and shared approach is much more significant than the differences.” Speaking to the media at a military base at Lossiemouth, on the north-east coast of Scotland, where a handful of pro-independence supporters were gathered at the gates, Johnson also denied avoiding Scottish voters, saying he met “loads of people” during his morning trip to Orkney and at the nearby Baxters Highland Village, who “seemed in a very good mood”. His brief appearances on Thursday are unlikely to diminish his chronic unpopularity in Scotland – recent polling for the Sunday Times put Sturgeon’s approval rating at three times that of the prime minister. Asked why he thought that Scots believed that her handling of the crisis has been so much better, Johnson again deflected the question, replying: “Whatever the superficial political differences and the differences in presentation, the reality is that this country is tackling the coronavirus crisis with much more that unites us than divides us.” At her lunchtime media briefing, Sturgeon was far more direct, telling reporters: “None of us should be crowing about this pandemic in a political sense.” She also rejected Johnson’s claim that an independent Scotland would not have had the financial muscle to stop coronavirus causing an economic disaster, adding that his claims about the might of the UK Treasury were really “just a feature of where power lies”. She went on: “If Scotland was an independent country then just like Ireland or many of the other small countries, we’d be doing these things ourselves. “I just don’t think any of us should be championing and celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some, you know, example of the pre-existing political case we want to make.” Asked on his visit whether two Conservative MPs on the intelligence and security committee, Theresa Villiers and Mark Pritchard, and others who had received donations from individuals or companies with Russian links should return the donations, Johnson said: “We have a rule that we don’t take foreign donations. But what I don’t like to see is people automatically assuming that everybody who is associated with some country or other is in some way untouchable. We are not a racist country.”"
2020-07-23T19:09:55Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Sturgeon accuses PM of using Covid crisis as 'political weapon' by 'crowing' about union — as it happened,"Boris Johnson has been accused of tastelessly exploiting the coronavirus crisis to boost support for the union on his first visit to Scotland since the general election. At a news conference Nicola Sturgeon, Scotlandâ€™s first minister, said: â€œI donâ€™t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make.â€� (See 2.19pm.) She was responding to Johnsonâ€™s claim that an independent Scotland would not have had the financial muscle to stop coronavirus causing an economic â€œdisasterâ€�. (See 10.40am.) Sturgeon said the UK government was only able to help in the way that it did because it could borrow billions and that, under independence, Scotland would also have borrowing powers. Johnsonâ€™s visit coincides with opinion polls in Scotland showing support for independence consistently ahead of opposition to it for the first time since devolution. (See 11.28am.) But Johnson said, even if the SNP secured a majority in next yearâ€™s Scottish parliamentary elections, that would not justify a second referendum. (See 12.02pm.) Michel Barnier has said a trade and security deal with Boris Johnsonâ€™s government by the end of the year appeared â€œunlikelyâ€�, as he complained that Britain was demanding â€œnear total exclusionâ€� of European fishing boats from its waters. Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum, has apologised for joining Labourâ€™s attack on the whistleblowers who broke their silence about the partyâ€™s handling of antisemitism on Panorama last year. Face coverings will be compulsory in takeaways, banks and post offices as well as shops, supermarkets, indoor shopping centres and stations in England from Friday, the government has announced. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. Our coronavirus coverage continues on our coronavirus live blog. Itâ€™s here."
2020-07-23T17:30:48Z,politics,Politics,Sajid Javid urges PM and businesses to improve diversity immediately,"The government must not wait for the results of any further race reports to tackle discrimination in the UK, according to former chancellor Sajid Javid, as he disclosed he still encounters racism every day. Javid, the first politician from a Muslim background to hold one of the great offices of state, has urged the prime minister and businesses to make immediate changes to improve diversity. Following the killing of George Floyd in the US and the widespread Black Lives Matters protests in the UK, Boris Johnson announced he would set up an independent Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities in June – the sixth review into discrimination since 2014. It follows a series of reports or inquiries set up by Johnson and his predecessors, which have thus far seen little response in the way of policy. Critics have said there is still a backlog of recommendations from earlier reports that need to be introduced. “We shouldn’t be waiting for the commission to do its job and thinking ‘there’s nothing to do now, let’s wait for the commission, then we can follow what it says’. “Because we cannot afford to wait,” Javid said in a discussion on racial equality by thinktank British Future. The prime minister personally announcing the review was significant, he suggested, as was home secretary Priti Patel’s recent response to the Windrush Lessons Learned review by Wendy Williams, where she set out five reforms including training and recruitment at the department. However, asked whether this latest review would lead to any meaningful change, he said: “In terms of how profound this commission can be to change the culture … I’d love to think there will be lots of different really big important things. I’m going to wait and see and not judge it too early on.” Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch MP will oversee the review, which is being led by educational consultant and charity founder Tony Sewell. He was forced to make a public apology last week after the Guardian unearthed controversial comments he made in the Voice newspaper after footballer Justin Fashanu disclosed he was gay in 1990. There was also criticism when it emerged Downing Street’s director of policy Munira Mirza had been asked to set it up. She has previously been sceptical of discussions around institutional racism. Javid, who is the son of Pakistani Muslim immigrants, said: “Like many people of colour, I faced racism in my life. I still face racism every day. “If you look at my social media feed after this seminar you can see lots of people making racist comments about me. You get used to it, but we shouldn’t have to.” Changes the government could make immediately include putting greater pressure on businesses to make sure there is diversity right across their workforce, he added. “The more people you have that have come from different backgrounds … that will inevitably help the change that organisation and the culture.” He said Theresa May’s Race Disparity Audit had also provided invaluable information on diversity and levels of pay across different employment sectors and was part of the data available to government."
2020-07-23T17:05:31Z,politics,Politics,Boris went to Scotland to bolster support. Mission accomplished — for the SNP | John Crace,"During Wednesday’s PMQs, the SNP’s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, had implored Boris Johnson and any other cabinet minister to visit Scotland. The more the merrier. Just come, said Blackford. Because the more the Scots saw of the Tory government, the greater the support for Scottish independence. The following day, Boris took him up on his offer. Come the evening, he was rather wishing he hadn’t bothered. It had been an early start for Boris to catch the plane up to Orkney and he wasn’t feeling his sharpest. As usual he had rather lost interest halfway through the second paragraph of his briefing notes, so instead he asked one of his advisers to give him a few key bullet points of why he was going before they landed. “It’s quite simple,” said the adviser. “Dom’s got the whole thing mapped out. All you have to do is make a couple of whistle-stops, do a few clips to camera and then get the hell out of there back to London.” “Classic Dom. So I won’t actually have to meet any of the ghastly Scots Nats or anything like that,” Boris the Not-So-Brave replied. “I can’t face meeting that Nicola Sturgeon woman or hacks who might ask awkward questions.” “Nah. It’s all sorted. The only people you’re going to meet are those we’ve checked out thoroughly to make sure they don’t cause trouble. Your job is just to remind them that if they had left the union then they would all probably have died from the coronavirus as the Scottish government would have been even more useless than yours.” “How about I also recite a poem that I published when I was editor of the Spectator?” Boris suggested. “How does it go?” “The Scotch – What a verminous race! / Canny, pushy, chippy, they’re all over the place.” “Um...” “Wait, there’s more. Battening us off with false bonhomie / Polluting our stock, undermining our economy.” “Perhaps not, prime minister. Though it is a great poem, obviously. Save it for a Tory gala fundraising dinner. The Russian oligarchs will love it.” “If you say so. And why are we going to Orkney again?” “Because it’s remote enough for protests to be kept to a minimum.” On arrival in Stromness, Boris was met by his security detail and the cavalcade of Range Rovers headed towards the harbour. The only signs of life were a few dozen protesters by the roadside waving the Scottish and EU flags and holding up placards saying “Save the NHS” and “Twatt”. Which also happens to be a village in Orkney and the locals reckon one Twatt is more than enough. Just as they reached a bare stretch of road, the cars screeched to a halt. “What’s going on?” asked Boris. “This is the ideal place for a TV clip,” said his adviser. “But we’re in the middle of nowhere...” “Precisely. So there’s no chance of you being shouted down by any protesters. And if we get the camera angle right, you’ll be able to see a bit of the town in the background.” Boris lumbered out of the car and went through his prepared routine. No one loved the Scotch more than him. Which is why they were better off in the union because without Westminster to hold their hands they would all be dead. And all talk of another independence referendum was just nonsense because they had had one back in 2014. So who cared if there was a clear majority in favour of another one, that Scotland overwhelmingly wanted to stay in the EU and that its people had seldom held a prime minister in such open contempt. “Great clip,” said the adviser. “That should win over the Nats. Now get back in the car.” Meanwhile down in Edinburgh, Sturgeon was conducting her weekly coronavirus press briefing. No, she didn’t want to score any political points during an ongoing global pandemic but she did think it was inappropriate for the prime minister to have come up to Scotland while people were still dying to crow about how much he had done for the union when the UK as a whole had the highest mortality rate in Europe. And yes, she would have been happy to have met Johnson if he had been polite enough to request a meeting and she would also have reminded him that though the money from Westminster was very welcome, it was still only borrowed money. So if Scotland had been independent, it could have borrowed the money itself and probably spent it a whole lot better as its general handling of the coronavirus had been a damn sight better than England’s. But as this was a public health briefing, she wasn’t going to say any of this. Later that afternoon, Boris was astonished to find himself at RAF Lossiemouth on Scotland’s east coast. “What are we doing here?” he asked. “Is this a refuelling stop?” “No,” said his adviser. “It was the only other place in Scotland where we could guarantee to keep hundreds of protesters away. But since you’re here, you might as well take a look at some new planes we’ve bought.” “Do I have to? Can’t we just go home?” “It’s only an hour or so. Just do it.” Boris tried to doze on the way back, but his adviser insisted on updating him with everything else that had gone wrong that day. The EU Brexit talks stalled. The Track and Trace targets missed yet again. SNAFU. “How was it?” asked Carrie, when Boris eventually arrived home. “Shit.” “Look on the bright side. At least you’ll never have to go there again. Not that they would have you, mind.” Sturgeon checked the polls and disagreed. Support for the SNP was up another couple of points. Now she came to think of it, she rather missed Boris now he was gone."
2020-07-23T14:09:57Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit trade deal is 'unlikely' by end of the year, says Barnier","Michel Barnier has said a trade and security deal with Boris Johnson’s government by the end of the year appeared “unlikely”, as he complained that Britain was demanding “near total exclusion” of European fishing boats from its waters. After the latest round of negotiations in London, the EU’s chief negotiator told reporters in a virtual press conference that the two sides were “still far away” from agreement with just three full months to go before a 31 October deadline. Despite signs of compromise in some key issues, including on the need for a single deal rather than multiple sectoral agreements, the EU official said there had been “no progress” on the two most difficult areas: the rights of European fleets in British waters; and ensuring neither side drives down regulatory standards or is able to unfairly subsidise their businesses.
In a statement, the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, concurred that there were “considerable gaps” but insisted that an agreement could still be reached in September. UK sources said Barnier’s assessment that the talks were “back at an impasse” accurately described the situation, but added this was for technical reasons that could be surmounted over the summer. The two sides are to meet for two days of informal talks next week before a formal round of negotiations in mid-August. But Johnson’s optimistic hopes of agreeing an outline of the principles of a deal by the end of this month had been dashed, Frost conceded. “It is unfortunately clear that we will not reach in July the ‘early understanding on the principles underlying any agreement’ that was set as an aim,” the UK official said. In his remarks at the end of the week’s talks, Barnier had focused on fishing rights and the UK’s failure to offer reassurances on its state aid regime from the end of the 2020 as the major obstacles to a deal. “The UK is effectively asking for near total exclusion of EU fishing vessels from UK waters,” Barnier said. “That is simply unacceptable.” He said the EU was willing to accept that “there may be change to the benefit of UK fishermen” but that it would not be at the price of the “destruction of the EU fishing industry”. On state aid, Barnier said the UK had failed to offer any assurances on how it would regulate subsidies once the country was outside the single market and customs union at the end of 2020. “We need consistency or some sort of equivalence between our respective systems,” he said. “We need to see what is ahead of us. I understand what David said that the UK is still going through an ongoing debate, parliament and government are still working on this but the debate does still have to make some sort of progress.” Barnier said: “Over the past few weeks the UK has not shown the same level of engagement and readiness to find solutions respecting the EU fundamental principles and interests.” He added: “It means simply that by its current refusal to commit to the condition of open and fair competition, and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement at this point unlikely.” In notably more optimistic comments, Frost highlighted the EU’s “pragmatic” acceptance that the European court of justice would not have any jurisdiction in the UK and the British recognition, in turn, of the need for there to be one all-encompassing deal. “We have heard the EU’s concerns about a complex Switzerland-style set of agreements and we are ready to consider simpler structures, provided satisfactory terms can be found for dispute settlement and governance,” he said. Frost conceded, however, that given the difficulties that remained, there was still the risk of a deal not being secured. “Although we will continue energetically to seek an agreement with the EU, we must face the possibility that one will not be reached, and we must therefore continue preparing for all possible scenarios for the end of the transition period at the end of this year,” he said."
2020-07-23T13:34:39Z,politics,Politics,"Despite the dire Brexit warnings, a deal is still the likely outcome","It will all sound very familiar to those who have taken a cursory interest in the Brexit circus over the last four years. The clock is ticking, says the European Union; an Australia-style (no) deal is better than a bad deal, respond the British. For all the dire warnings and Michel Barnier’s claim that a deal is now “unlikely” following this week’s talks in London, the wise money would be on history repeating itself when it comes to the outcome too: a trade and security deal patched together in October in time for ratification and the start of a new relationship on a firm(ish) footing in 2021. The long-awaited withdrawal agreement was wrapped up, after all, when Boris Johnson and the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, stitched a deal together in a hotel in Wirral last October as the reality of a disorderly British exit loomed.
The rational outcome, then, would be for the two sides to avoid adding no-deal salt to Covid-19 injury. Johnson would surely welcome the political and economic win of avoiding huge tariffs on goods exports and imports in the context of criticism of his handling of the pandemic, the growing threat of Scottish independence and the rise of the new Labour leader, Keir Starmer. But there cannot be any certainty. Not a line of agreed legal text has been written down, and there will be hundreds of them to perfect by the end of October ahead of an unwieldy ratification process on the EU side. Political accidents do happen. Johnson’s year in office has not been without slip-ups and errors of judgment, of which the relatives of the more than 45,000 people who have died with coronavirus in the UK so far will be painfully aware. The pessimists in Brussels wonder whether Johnson’s publicly stated eagerness for a deal will overcome the apparent indifference they detect in some former Vote Leave officials around the negotiations. Sources on both sides agree that there isn’t much of a personal understanding between the two lead negotiators – David Frost in the UK camp and the EU’s Barnier. There have been some dinners but face-to-face time has been limited. Momentum could build for a British exit without a deal should the negotiations become rougher than expected in early autumn. “It isn’t the breakdown or breakthrough point,” said an EU source close to the negotiations. “But if things go sour in September and October, we will look at July as a massive missed opportunity.” At the start of this month, Barnier sought to draw a Venn diagram of sorts. He carefully elucidated both sides’ red lines, or his interpretation of them. The two most contentious areas in the talks now are access to British waters for European fishing boats and the maintenance of similar regulatory frameworks in the UK and the EU to avoid either side gaining an unfair advantage. As he sought to sketch out the negotiating space, Barnier accepted that there would be no role for the European court of justice in the UK; no obligation for the country to be bound by EU law; and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit “makes a real difference”. In return, he stipulated what Brussels would need: robust guarantees for a “level playing field”, including on rules on subsidies known as state aid, and a solution on fishing access that avoids European coastal communities being ruined. Barnier’s complaint has been that the UK is not playing ball. He has hinted at a willingness to accept “regulatory equivalence” between a British and EU system that would fit snugly inside his Venn diagram but there has been no sight in Brussels of Downing Street’s plans to limit state subsidies, for example. With fisheries, the two negotiators this week laid out their expectation of the catches they would expect for their respective fishing fleets. Yet hints from both sides that they are willing to compromise on their opening positions – the status quo on the EU side and the revolution proposed by the British – has not led to much discovery of common ground in the negotiating room. “The level of expectation on catches for each side were so far apart that you just can’t see how they can be resolved,” said an EU official. For all the fireworks on Thursday, a deal still remains the most likely option. Both negotiators need to win over domestic audiences to compromise and a substantive agreement in July would have suggested that one side was slacking. But as they head into the final run, there is no agreed choreography. With both sides still doubting the other’s intentions going into the summer break, neither Frost nor Barnier will be entirely relaxed as they take their place by the pool."
2020-07-23T10:22:43Z,politics,Politics,Momentum founder apologises for joining Labour attack on whistleblowers,"Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum, has apologised for joining Labour’s attack on the whistleblowers who broke their silence about the party’s handling of antisemitism on Panorama last year. It is understood the apology is part of the agreed high court settlement with the former Labour party staff. Lansman said he wanted to say sorry to “the former staffers” in a tweet on Thursday morning linking to the high court statement retracting the party’s accusations that the whistleblowers had made “false and malicious” statements and were motivated by their opposition to Jeremy Corbyn. “This is a link to the Labour party’s court statement apologising to former party staffers who appeared in the Panorama programme on antisemitism. I tweeted something similar based on the party’s advice & assurances & also apologise to the former staffers,” he said. The former staff, Kat Buckingham, Michael Creighton, Samuel Matthews, Dan Hogan, Louise Withers Green, Benjamin Westerman and Martha Robinson all broke non-disclosure agreements to tell the BBC programme that they felt fatally undermined by senior Labour bosses in their attempts to tackle antisemitism, alleging consistent interference in complaints. Along with the Panorama journalist John Ware, they were paid “substantial damages” by the Labour party amounting to between £170,000 and £180,000. Lansman’s apology came after a day of bitter infighting at the Labour party and will serve to underline the continuing rivalries between old and new management.
It is in stark contrast to Corbyn, who issued a statement after the high court hearing claiming the settlement was a “political decision” against legal advice. Corbyn’s statement caused astonishment among the litigants in the libel action, with Ware confirming to the Guardian that he was “consulting his lawyers” about a libel action against the former Labour leader, raising the prospect of another costly court battle over Labour and antisemitism. The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, also criticised the decision to settle and called it a misuse of party funds. “The leaked report on how antisemitism was handled tells a very different story about what happened,” he said. Their statements have plunged the party back into civil war, with Dame Margaret Hodge, one of the most vocal critics of Corbyn’s approach to antisemitism, branding his statement “bizarre” on Wednesday night. “I think it’s obsessional. I cannot understand that he wants to stand on a hill and be judged by his inability and failure to tackle antisemitism. That’s what he wants to go down fighting – it is extraordinary,” she told the BBC’s Newsnight. While the shadow attorney general, Lord Falconer, said the settlement represented a closing of the chapter in Labour’s history, there is little chance of it disappearing, with the Equality and Human Rights Commission expected to publish a highly critical report in September followed by a further report by Martin Forde QC into the consequences of an internal Labour report into antisemitism that was leaked in April. The media lawyer Mark Lewis said he had been instructed by 32 individuals including Lord McNicol, the former general secretary of Labour, to sue the party in the wake of the leak. He was pursuing “five or six courses of action” including potential breaches of the Data Protection Act, breaches of confidence, misuse of private information, libel and employment law in relation to the responsibility of an employer to protect its staff regarding work issues.
Some of his clients were the target of sustained social media attacks as a result of private messages. “They include people who were high up in the Labour party and individuals lower down the ranks in the staff and others who made reports who had a reasonable expectation of privacy. Many had their messages taken out of context in the report,” said Lewis, a partner at Patron Law. Lewis told Newsnight: “McNicol is named in the report and is blamed for things that simply didn’t happen. It’s a mischaracterisation of a report which is being taken on.”"
2020-07-23T06:00:36Z,politics,Politics,UK trade department to tackle 'fake news' with new rebuttal role,"Liz Truss’s Department of International Trade is to tackle what it views as “fake news” about the UK’s post Brexit trade policy with its own rapid rebuttal expert. The DIT has just advertised a new position of “chief media officer, trade policy and rebuttal” to handle the press and denounce stories it believes are false or contain false information. The term “fake news” was given international currency by Donald Trump to denounce mainstream media outlets who challenged the US president on his pronouncements.
The job advert confirms the phrase is now being adopted by government in the UK to combat the fast-moving and international commentary on Twitter, Facebook and other platforms. With less than six months to go before the UK leaves the EU’s single market and customs union, the department is also casting for a new director general for trade relations and implementation to lead 800 staff, act as “ambassador for UK trade policy at the highest levels” and build “a pipeline of candidates for future free trade agreements”. According to the advert, the DIT’s new chief media officer will be asked to “advise ministers on reactive media handling and rebuttal, as well as managing rapid rebuttal processes and combatting fake news on social media” as well as “brief and handle lobby journalists on high-profile reactive and proactive stories, and develop a programme of media briefings to shape stories”. Responsibilities will also include “promoting our four priority trade deals”, which sources say are the US, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Japan recently gave the UK until the end of July to complete a continuity deal which would kick in temporarily after the UK loses access to the EU deals in January. The vacancy comes as Boris Johnson’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings seeks to shake up media relations in Whitehall. Two weeks ago Downing Street advertised for a £135,000-a-year data expert to set up a “skunkworks” in No 10, a reference to a pseudo start-up in the vein of those pioneered by aircraft maker Lockheed Martin to fire up innovative projects unencumbered by bureaucracy. A DIT spokesperson said: “Seeking free trade agreements is a key priority for this country. “The government is drawing on the skills of the brightest and best talent to achieve departmental goals and support in securing future trade deals.”"
2020-07-23T05:00:34Z,politics,Politics,Seven key moments in Boris Johnson's first year as prime minister,"A year on from Boris Johnson’s victory in the Conservative party leadership race, which ushered him into Downing Street, we look at the key moments of his time in office so far. 24 July 2019 – Sweeps into No 10, promising to defy ‘the doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters’ The result of the leadership ballot of Tory members was announced to a packed Westminster conference centre on 23 July. Johnson beat Jeremy Hunt by a convincing 92,153 to 46,656. A parade of other rivals, including Matt Hancock and Andrea Leadsom, had been knocked out in earlier rounds of voting by MPs. The next day, after Theresa May had led her final prime minister’s questions, Johnson paid the customary visit to the palace, and swept into No 10. By contrast with the earnest tone of his predecessor, his first speech in Downing Street was a characteristic mashup of patriotic bombast and breezy optimism. “No one in the last few centuries has succeeded in betting against the pluck and nerve and ambition of this country. They will not succeed today,” he said, before disappearing behind the famous black door. 3 September 2019 – Johnson withdraws the whip from 21 Tory MPs, blowing up his own majority Throughout the summer and early autumn, Johnson’s new administration was engaged in parliamentary guerrilla warfare with the “Gaukeward squad” of Tory rebels, who wanted to avoid a no-deal Brexit. When Oliver Letwin secured a majority for an arcane parliamentary motion, paving the way for Hilary Benn’s bill that would ultimately force Johnson to delay Brexit, the prime minister expelled all the Conservative MPs who had voted for it. They included nine former cabinet ministers, including Philip Hammond and David Gauke – and Winston Churchill’s grandson, Nicholas Soames. The purge underlined Johnson’s ruthless determination to take Britain out of the EU on his terms, and obliterated his slim majority, making an election all but inevitable.
12 December – General election victory Johnson had won the support of a wary and demoralised Tory party by insisting he could win them a general election – and on 12 December he made good on that promise. After a tightly controlled campaign featuring relentless repetition of his “get Brexit done” slogan, and few sightings of most of his cabinet, Johnson was returned with a thumping majority of 80, tearing through Labour’s post-industrial heartlands. He hailed the result as evidence that leaving the EU was the “irrefutable, irresistible, unarguable decision of the British people” and promised those who had lent their vote to the Tories in traditional Labour areas: “I will not let you down.” Jeremy Corbyn swiftly announced he would stand down as Labour leader, after a “period of reflection”. 31 January – Got Brexit done (sort of) The prime minister had defied expectations and secured a Brexit deal with the EU27 in October, by signing up to a new Irish protocol – which effectively meant accepting a border down the Irish Sea, a compromise Theresa May was not willing to countenance. He was then forced to delay Brexit until January by Hilary Benn’s rebel legislation, which required MPs to approve a deal before the UK could leave. But with a comfortable majority after the general election he was able to push his “oven-ready” deal through parliament, allowing the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. The prime minister marked the occasion with a party for close allies in Downing Street, at which he sipped English sparkling wine and sounded a small gong. His deal left many questions about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU to be thrashed out in negotiations. But with Brexit “done”, Johnson moved on to a ruthless reshuffle that caused his chancellor to resign rather than accept No 10 tightening its grip on the Treasury. 23 March – Stay at home Stripped of his habitual bonhomie, a sombre Johnson delivered an unprecedented broadcast message, urging the British public to stay at home to protect themselves from coronavirus. The full lockdown followed an intense period of escalating public health measures, which took the prime minister in little more than a fortnight from a message of “wash your hands and business as usual”, to “stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives”. Just four days later, Johnson announced he had contracted the virus himself; and on 7 April his condition had deteriorated so much that he was taken into intensive care, where he would remain for three anxious days.
26 May – Dominic Cummings’ press conference Johnson leaped to the defence of his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, after the Guardian and Daily Mirror revealed he had driven 270 miles to his parents’ property in Durham at the height of the coronavirus lockdown. With questions about Cummings’ conduct refusing to die down, and a number of Conservative MPs expressing concern, the insouciant former Vote Leave director gave an extraordinary press conference at a table in the No 10 rose garden. Cummings claimed he had taken the cross-country journey to secure childcare for his four-year-old son – which he did not eventually use – and that a side-trip to Barnard Castle was to check if his eyesight was good enough to drive back to London. The explanation was met with incredulity across a nation wearied by lockdown, and protests from many MPs – but Johnson stood by his right-hand man, underlining how indispensable Cummings had become.
17 July – Prepare for the worst, hope for the best With a return of some of his trademark optimism, after weeks in which some colleagues had feared he had not fully recuperated from the virus, Johnson held out the prospect of a “significant return to normality” by Christmas. He encouraged the public to return to their workplaces from 1 August if employers believe it is safe to do so, and added ice rinks and bowling alleys to the long list of businesses – including pubs and restaurants – that have been allowed to reopen. However, at the same time Johnson announced he would be setting aside an extra £3bn to help the NHS manage through a potential second wave this winter. “Even as we plan for the worst, I strongly believe we should also hope for the best,” he said."
2020-07-23T05:00:34Z,politics,Politics,'A hell of a year': Tories reflect on 12 months led by Boris Johnson,"When Boris Johnson sailed into a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers on the wave of a seismic election victory, he joked that he was looking forward to seeing how long it would take for letters of no confidence to start pouring in from his parliamentary colleagues. A year after he became leader, the Conservative backbenches are already restless. One former cabinet minister said they thought the “clouds had gathered” – and not just because of the pandemic, but owing to a feeling that a “good-time” prime minister was not what was needed for the massive economic challenges ahead. Even Johnson’s critics concede he has had, as one put it, “a hell of a year”. One pointed out that Johnson had “been on the backbenches, where he was almost a figure of fun, then won the leadership, divorced his wife, secured a fiancee, fathered a child and nearly died of Covid. It’s a lifetime in one year.” But they added: “The hard facts are that Boris is a good-time prime minister; his grip on detail is shocking. He’s the chairman of the board rather than the chief executive. And he’s got a highly contentious, divisive and controversial chief executive in Dominic Cummings.”
Though Johnson has a reputation as a genial parliamentary colleague, MPs say he has few trusted friends in the party. “He is not clubbable: he doesn’t come into the tearoom, you don’t see him around very much,” an ex-cabinet minister said. Another MP said: “In this No 10, the Conservative party is just something they need to govern. And the party is becoming gradually unwhippable as a result.” If the economic downturn and the fallout from an inquiry into the pandemic put the party into freefall, some have even begun to think Johnson may need to be replaced before the next election. “The party has no emotional attachment to Boris because he does not give us something to believe in, apart from as a vehicle for power,” one MP said. “So a year out, if the polls look bad, it could happen.” If the time comes when the Tories are behind in the polls and a rival begins to gather supporters, “it’s not that people will move against him, they just won’t lift a hand to help him,” another backbench MP said. In anticipation of the possibility that the Tories will be led by someone other than Johnson by the time of the next election, Labour is pinning responsibility for the failings of the Covid-19 response on the government as a whole. “They’re government decisions, they’re Conservative decisions,” said one Labour strategist, who added that Keir Starmer was deliberately avoiding personal attacks on Johnson. “People have been trying that for years and it doesn’t work. It’s a question of competence. It’s a question of delivering what you promised.” One former adviser to Theresa May expressed surprise about the discontent of Tory backbenchers. “Given that Boris Johnson has the biggest majority since Blair, that restiveness in the party is a striking thing that I didn’t expect,” they said. Tory backbenchers say they need to see a more definitive programme from No 10, and some blame a Downing Street team and cabinet that they say was constructed to deal with Brexit and little else. One long-serving Tory MP said he and a colleague had discussed how many members of Johnson’s cabinet would have met the threshold to be included in Margaret Thatcher’s top team, and decided the answer was none. “It’s tall poppies: he can’t stand tall poppies,” he said. “I think Boris has shown in the first year that the government and the team in No 10 is obsessed – and obsessed isn’t too strong a word – with Brexit,” said one MP, a backer of Johnson’s leadership campaign. “And they were caught completely unprepared for Covid because they didn’t put together a government that had anything other than Brexit in mind.”
One former cabinet minister said the economic challenges ahead went far deeper than dealing with the fallout from coronavirus and were likely to affect the Tories’ target voters. “We’re leaving the largest trading free-trade bloc in the world. And we are in the deep freeze with the biggest economy in the world,” the former cabinet minister said. “And this is on top of coping with a pandemic. We are a small ship riding into a massive storm – a massive threat to the living standards, financial wellbeing and economic future of people who do vote.” Though Labour may have pinned its hopes on Johnson taking the brunt of the blame for any mishandling of coronavirus, including delayed decisions on lockdown, it is one area where MPs are prepared to cut the prime minister some slack – and where they believe voters will too. “If you take my classic marginal seat, we have had enough doctors, beds, ventilators, PPE,” one veteran MP said. “We’ve been able to furlough thousands. Very few people are complaining – yet. “I think there’s a lot of sympathy for the prime minister as someone who was a sort of casualty of war. Of course, the whole Dominic Cummings thing was a nightmare. But it’s not quite the same thing as passing a judgment on Boris himself.” Johnson’s brush with his own mortality sent shockwaves through the party, many MPs said, but several said they felt he was now trying too hard to prove his fitness. “I think people were really worried about him for a while,” one former minister said. “Everybody has to be Putin on a horse in this game; nobody can admit weakness. Hence the press-ups”. Many MPs said Johnson would be the right figurehead for the coming years when the country desperately needs to renew its self-confidence. Steve Brine, the Winchester MP who ran Jeremy Hunt’s leadership campaign, said last Friday’s Downing Street press conference in which Johnson held out the hope of a “significant return to normality” by Christmas was a welcome return to the optimism of old. “That’s what the country needs right now,” he said. “We need his optimism now more than ever, and we have to get behind him.” Johnson’s general election victory in December was defined by the dismantling of the so-called “red wall” of traditional Labour seats across the north of England, where the call of “get Brexit done” persuaded voters to turn to the Conservatives in droves. Those new MPs are now keen to see the prime minister deliver on what they promised their voters: “levelling up” and closing the stark economic disparity between north and south. Some more experienced MPs expressed concern that the narrative may not produce tangible results for their election leaflets. “Levelling up isn’t really defined properly. It can’t be defined properly, because that’s the nature of it. It’s something that’s generational, not from one election cycle. So you can’t declare victory on levelling up,” one MP said.
Ben Bradley, the former Tory vice-chair who was one of the first MPs to seize a “red wall” seat, in Mansfield in 2017, said Johnson’s success or failure would be down to that agenda. “I think the narrative is good. But the proof in the pudding, isn’t it?” he said. “We said that these were lent voters, so we have to deliver and prove that they did the right thing. So that’s the challenge for him, almost more so than dealing with the pandemic, which is process-driven. It’s understanding the needs of those voters and getting that tangible stuff in place that makes them feel better, within three or four years.” One former cabinet minister cautioned that Johnson should not set too much store by his reputation in ex-Labour seats. “I went to 17 red wall seats. The name Boris Johnson barely came up. The name Jeremy Corbyn came up all the time,” the MP said. Few are daring to predict whether Johnson can keep hold of power beyond the next election. “He is definitely intending to fight the next election. Politicians like Boris are about winning and not about anything else,” one frontbencher said."
2020-07-22T22:27:35Z,politics,Politics,Antisemitism settlement plunges Labour party into civil war,"Labour’s decision to pay a six-figure libel settlement to ex-staffers who claimed the party was failing to deal with antisemitism has plunged the party back into civil war, with Jeremy Corbyn publicly condemning his successor’s decision to settle the case. Corbyn’s statement caused astonishment among the litigants in the libel action, with the Panorama journalist John Ware confirming to the Guardian that he was “consulting his lawyers” and raising the prospect of another costly court battle over Labour and antisemitism. Corbyn said he was disappointed by the settlement brokered under Keir Starmer, calling it a “political decision” against legal advice, and said the decision “risks giving credibility to misleading and inaccurate allegations about action taken to tackle antisemitism in the Labour party in recent years.” The former leader, who is believed to have considered a court challenge to the settlement along with senior allies, said the party had received legal advice that it would win the libel case brought by the seven ex-staffers and the journalist who made the BBC Panorama programme on which they appeared. The ex-staff members alleged senior figures in the party minimised and interfered with attempts to deal with antisemitism complaints about party members. They sued the party for defamation after Labour spokespeople described them as having “political axes to grind,” suggesting they had acted in bad faith, and said Ware had conducted “deliberate and malicious misrepresentations designed to mislead the public”.
In court on Monday Labour apologised “unreservedly” to the seven former employees and to Ware, admitting it had defamed them. The case is understood to have cost Labour around £600,000, with around £180,000 in damages agreed for the eight individuals. The decision to settle and apologise incensed key figures on the left of the party who have claimed that a separate leaked report on “hyperfactionalism” among those dealing with antisemitism complaints – which named some of the Panorama whistleblowers – vindicates the comments made in the wake of the programme. The leaking of that report and its contents, including emails, messages and private WhatsApps, is now the subject of an independent inquiry by the QC Martin Forde, and legal action is also being taken against the party by people named within it. Mark Lewis, the solicitor who acted for Ware and the whistleblowers, revealed to the Guardian that he had been approached by 32 individuals who want to take action against the party for a range of allegations, mainly centring on the fallout from the leaked report. Lewis told BBC’s Newsnight that one of the new litigants was Lord Iain McNichol, a Labour life peer. He said he had been “named in the report” for “things that simply didn’t happen”.
He said the claims centred on “five or six courses of action” including potential breaches of the Data Protection Act, breaches of confidence, misuse of private information, libel, and employment law in relation to the responsibility of an employer to protect its staff regarding work issues. Defending the Labour party’s decision to issue the statements against the whistleblowers before the documentary screened, Corbyn said the leaked report had proved there was concern “about the role played by some of those who took part in the programme”. He said: “Labour party members have a right to accountability and transparency of decisions taken in their name, and an effective commitment from the party to combat antisemitism and racism in all their forms. “The party’s decision to apologise today and make substantial payments to former staff who sued the party in relation to last year’s Panorama programme is a political decision, not a legal one. “To give our members the answers and justice they deserve, the inquiry led by Martin Forde must now fully address the evidence the internal report uncovered of racism, sexism, factionalism and obstruction of Labour’s 2017 general election campaign.” The Forde inquiry is not expected to report until the end of the year. Labour is also awaiting the full publication of an inquiry into institutional antisemitism by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, likely to come next month. On Wednesday Starmer’s spokesman defended the decision to settle and said he regretted that members’ funds had to be used in that way. “All three candidates for the leadership – Keir, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey – said at the Jewish Labour Movement hustings that they would seek to settle this issue and also they believed that the party had not taken the right approach at the time,” the spokesman said. “It’s a sign we will take a zero-tolerance approach and we are utterly determined to restore trust in Jewish community. “Of course we regret [the use of members’ funds], we never wanted to get to this position, but the decision was taken to settle and unreservedly apologise.” The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, also criticised the decision to settle and called it a misuse of party funds. “The leaked report on how antisemitism was handled tells a very different story about what happened,” he said. Leftwing members of the party’s governing national executive committee, who are a minority on the body, are set to demand that Starmer account for the size of the settlement and that the party publish the legal advice it was given about the case. Louise Withers-Green, one of the seven whistleblowers who had all previously worked in the party’s complaints unit, said she hoped it was the end of the saga for them. “We all had given so much to the party, as a staff and as volunteers for so many years,” she told the Guardian. “The backlash has been quite difficult to deal with.” She said she had been thanked and praised by Jewish party members. “When it’s been difficult, I’ve held on to the fact that people out of nowhere will come up and say that they are left-wing and Jewish and that what we did really, really meant a lot to them,” she said."
2020-07-22T20:34:26Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit negotiations have not broken down, say No 10 sources","Downing Street sources have denied Brexit negotiations between the UK and European Union have broken down, but admit they are at an impasse. After two full days of talks in London, No 10 officials described the current state of play as neither a “breakthrough nor a breakdown”. The latest round is expected to end on Thursday without advancing on a deal. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, and his UK counterpart, David Frost, are in the midst of intensified discussions. A fifth round of talks will go ahead as planned next week, with another round scheduled for August unless agreed otherwise.
Differences are said to remain on the issues of a level playing field for businesses, governance, state aid rules and fishing rights. The EU’s preference for a role for the European court of justice is also a sticking point. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said the UK was continuing to engage with the EU constructively. “Round five negotiations are ongoing and we remain committed to working hard to find the outlines of a balanced agreement … but significant differences still remain on a number of important issues,” he said. “Our preference is to leave with an FTA [free trade agreement] as long as it guarantees our political and economic independence. But we will make sure that we’re prepared for all possible scenarios.” He added: “The discussions do continue to be constructive and I think that’s been the case throughout this intensified state of the discussions, but equally I think we acknowledge that there are still significant differences on a number of important issues.” Some backbench Conservative MPs are said to be getting nervous that a deal will not be ready in time for the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020. Reports that Frost had said the UK would accept tariffs on certain goods are believed to have added to confusion among the Tory ranks about the government’s position. Labour is also said to be looking closely at recent polling that has shown voters in their former “red wall” strongholds overwhelmingly want Johnson to strike a deal on Brexit rather than walk away from talks. The north and Midlands could bear the brunt of the economic downturn because of the coronavirus pandemic and potential consequences of a no-deal scenario. The UK has piled on pressure to get a quick Brexit deal sealed this month, with Boris Johnson saying in June there was no reason an outline agreement could not be struck in July, urging the EU to put “the tiger in the tank”, a reference to a 1960s Esso slogan. However, his flamboyant approach was immediately punctured by the EU, which said it expected talks to go into September. Charles Michel, the European council president, batted back that the bloc was “ready to put a tiger in the tank but not to buy a pig in a poke”. One senior EU source predicted before the latest round of talks that the UK would try and “inject some drama and theatre” into the talks, with rows seen as a by-product of the tension to create the space for a deal."
2020-07-22T17:19:20Z,politics,Politics,UK politics: Corbyn criticises Labour's decision to settle antisemitism libel case – as it happened,"Jeremy Corbyn has criticised Labour after the party apologised “unreservedly” and paid out a six-figure sum to seven former employees and a veteran BBC journalist, admitting it defamed them in the aftermath of a Panorama investigation into its handling of antisemitism. The decision marks one of the clearest breaks made by Sir Keir Starmer from the line taken by his predecessor since he replaced Corbyn in April. It is a point Starmer reinforced at PMQS when he told Boris Johnson that Labour was now “under new management”. Johnson has been asked by Starmer why he “sat on” the intelligence and security committee report on Russian interference in UK politics, during a fiery and acrimonious final PMQs session before parliament breaks for summer recess. The government’s flagship test and trace system is failing to contact thousands of people in areas with the highest infection rates in England, raising further questions about the £10bn programme described by Boris Johnson as “world-beating”, the Guardian has established. Britain is to cut its global aid budget by £2.9bn this year due to the economic hit of the coronavirus crisis, PA Media reports. However, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, insists the UK will still meet its commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on international development. Government sources said that a “line by line” review of aid projects had taken place and what were considered the “40 most vulnerable countries” were prioritised for assistance. The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, has admitted he regrets sitting next to the Tory donor Richard Desmond at a fundraising dinner before overruling a local authority and the government planning inspectorate to give permission for the billionaire’s £1bn Westferry property development. The Department for Work and Pensions is to overhaul its safeguarding systems following a series of high-profile failures in which mentally ill claimants took their own lives after having their benefits cut off by welfare officials.

2020-07-22T17:14:38Z,politics,Politics,Julian Lewis warns Dominic Cummings not to politicise ISC inquiries,"Julian Lewis, the new chair of parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC), has demanded that ministers prevent Dominic Cummings and other special advisers from politicising its future inquiries. The independent MP told a Commons debate on the Russia report on Wednesday that he had been warned by a journalist that “some people within government” had tried to sack the committee’s civil service secretariat and “make political appointments” instead. Lewis then called on James Brokenshire, the security minister, to give “a categorical commitment that no party political special advisers will be allowed anywhere near the intelligence and security committee”. Brokenshire responded by giving a non-committal answer – “he can certainly have my assurances to the weight and the support that I give to his committee” – prompting a string of concerned MPs to repeat Lewis’s question. That culminated in Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs select committee, asking Brokenshire to “rule out any attempt at government interference in the work of the ISC, any political appointments to its secretariat.” Brokenshire said he was “very clear on the need for independence by the ISC” and added: “Certainly I do not want to see the sense of that question of its independence being drawn into any doubt.”
Concerns about the politicisation of the committee – traditionally a cross-party body that oversees the spy agencies – have been in the air for months after Downing Street refused to release the Russia report before last December’s election. It was eventually published on Tuesday and revealed that the British government and intelligence agencies had failed to conduct any proper assessment of Kremlin attempts to interfere with the 2016 Brexit referendum. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, accused the government of “a dereliction of duty” by sitting on the report for months and “blocking its publication before a general election”. Labour had secured the emergency debate after the government refused to organise one. The 50-page document, the product of 18 months’ research in the last parliament, revealed how deeply Russia has penetrated British life through a mixture of cyber-threats and the presence of oligarchs who hire London-based advisers and make political donations to reinforce their position. “We categorically reject any suggestion that the UK actively avoided investigating Russia,” Brokenshire said. “We are unafraid to act wherever necessary to protect the UK and our allies from any state threat.” Lewis had the Conservative party whip removed last week after he stood against Downing Street’s preferred choice of chairman, Chris Grayling, and defeated him by five votes to four with the support of Labour and SNP members. Consideration was briefly given to trying to remove the veteran MP from his post, but No 10 relented, leaving him to chair the committee, which traditionally works in a non-party political fashion. Downing Street said it was surprised by Lewis’s comments and it was not immediately aware of what exactly he was referring to. The Labour backbencher Chris Bryant said he believed that the UK had become too easy on wealthy Russians, and he accused the government of being complicit in helping them hide their wealth offshore. “What mystifies me is that government ministers are still giving out golden visas to dodgy Russian oligarchs, that government ministers are still granting exemptions to dodgy Russian oligarchs so that they can hide their ownership of businesses in this country, and I am mystified that government ministers are still taking millions of pounds from dodgy Russian oligarchs,” the MP said. Keir Starmer called on Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, to publicly condemn her SNP predecessor, Alex Salmond, for hosting a show on the Kremlin-backed TV channel RT. Speaking after prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, a spokesman for the Labour leader said: “We completely condemn it and we advise the first minister Nicola Sturgeon to do the same.” The SNP said Sturgeon had already criticised Salmond’s decision when his show was announced in 2017. At the time, she said: “His choice of channel would not have been my choice.” The ISC said in its report that RT broadcast “serious distortions” along with its fellow state-owned broadcaster Sputnik. Salmond is no longer a member of the SNP, having resigned when charged with sexual offences in 2018."
2020-07-22T17:00:19Z,politics,Politics,Test and trace failing to contact thousands in England's worst-hit areas,"The government’s flagship test-and-trace system is failing to contact thousands of people in areas with the highest infection rates in England, raising further questions about the £10bn programme described by Boris Johnson as “world-beating”. Local leaders and directors of public health are demanding more control over the tracing operation amid concerns that their ability to contain the virus is being put at risk. Data obtained by the Guardian shows that in areas with the highest infection rates in England, the proportion of close contacts of infected people being reached is far below 80%, the level the government’s scientific advisers say is required for test and trace to be effective. In Luton, which has the sixth highest infection rate in England, only 47% of at-risk people were contacted by test and trace. In Leicester, which remains under a partial lockdown, the rate was 65%, meaning more than 3,300 people were not reached by the programme. Directors of public health have expressed frustration that local expertise has been sidelined under the centralised test-and-trace system, which has been handed to private firms such as Serco and Sitel. More than 5,500 people in four areas with the highest infection rates in England were not contacted when they should have been told to self-isolate, the Guardian has learned. These included 3,340 people in Leicester, 984 in Kirklees, 759 in Rochdale and 448 in Blackburn with Darwen. The government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has said that 80% of an infected person’s close contacts must be contacted and told to self-isolate within 48 to 72 hours for the national programme to be effective. In Blackburn with Darwen the figure was 54%; in Leicester 65%, in Rochdale 66% and in Kirklees 77%. Bradford council, which has the fourth-highest infection rate in England, declined to provide a figure but said “a high number of contacts” in the city were not traced by the national system. A council spokeswoman said it was asking the government “to allow us to set up a local extension to the national test-and-trace system which would enable us to follow up uncontacted data with door-to-door visits, something which no national system can really do.” Gerry Taylor, Luton borough council’s director of public health, said she was “very concerned” at the low rate in the Bedfordshire town. She said the centralised system was “too remote” to be able to reach all of its communities. “Clearly 47% is too low. The bulk of the contact tracing feels somewhat distant from us and working more closely together with the national system I think would be a huge advantage,” she said. Local leaders say they have the community links and relationships to hunt down the virus at street level, thereby plugging holes in the centralised system. Factors including language barriers, distrust of unknown callers and missed emails could explain the low contact completion rate in the worst-affected towns, where in some cases the virus is disproportionately affecting people of south Asian heritage. Under the current system, contact tracers attempt to reach close contacts of an infected person by text, email or up to 10 times by phone call. Kate Hollern, the Labour MP for Blackburn, said the national test-and-trace system had failed. “People are out there spreading the virus unknowingly due to this government failure. The responsibility and resources for this should have been with local government, who have the local knowledge. It’s a complete shambles and we really need to get control of it.” Lisa McNally, the director of public health at Sandwell Council in the West Midlands, which has the ninth highest infection rate in the country, said that last week only 40% of positive coronavirus cases in her area had been contacted by the national system. She said she asked the government for more data so those people could be traced locally but was told it was not possible. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “NHS test and trace has already helped test and isolate more than 180,000 cases – helping us control the spread of the virus, prevent a second wave and save lives. This represents 81% of close contacts identified by those who test positive. “The service is working closely with local authorities across England to help manage local outbreaks. High quality data is critical to providing good public services and we’ve been providing increasingly detailed data to local directors of public health, helping them tackle local outbreaks and control this virus.”"
2020-07-22T16:42:26Z,politics,Politics,Boris is the emperor with no clothes and itâ€™s not a pretty sight | John Crace,"A more fruitful strategy for Boris Johnson at prime minister’s questions might be damage limitation. To accept that Keir Starmer is far brighter, better prepared and more obviously sincere and try to dead-bat his way through the half-hour with short, anodyne responses. It might not be the rallying cry for the Tory troops that he would like to give, but it would sure as hell be better than being comprehensively owned by the Labour leader week after week. But Boris is temperamentally incapable of such an act of self-preservation. His natural instinct is for destruction, both of himself and everything around him. So while Starmer is The Daddy, Johnson is visibly regressing in front of our eyes. When he first became PM, he would act the adolescent: Kevin the teenager. Then he slipped back to the grumpy 10-year-old. Now he is like a toddler barely out of nappies. At the current rate of progress, his baby son will soon be reading him bedtime stories. What’s more, it appears Boris either is unaware of his decline or believes it to be of little consequence. Or possibly both. He may even be right for the time being. After all, most people aren’t paying much attention to his weekly half-hour of humiliation, he has an 80-seat majority, and an election is four years off. Yet his lies and tantrums still have the power to corrode. And few prime ministers have done more to undermine democracy than he has. For the last PMQs before the summer recess, Starmer focused on the intelligence and security committee’s report on Russian interference in UK politics. How come Johnson had managed to sit on something that had highlighted Russia as an urgent and immediate threat for 10 months? The honest answer would have been that Johnson had actually intended to sit on the report for much longer than 10 months but had been caught on the hop when Chris Grayling, his nominated stooge for the committee chair, managed to lose a vote that had been rigged in his favour. He should have paid more attention to those who had warned him there was no bad situation that Failing Grayling could not make worse. There should be statues to Grayling in every city, symbols of hope for losers everywhere. Instead Boris did what he always does. He ignored the question and went on the attack. No one cared more about national security than him, and the reason successive Tory governments had failed to even wonder whether the Russians might have influenced the Brexit referendum was because Vladimir Putin had assured them that such an idea was totally unthinkable. The Russian president had been far too busy in 2016 with acts of espionage elsewhere in the world, so there was clearly no need for the UK to go looking for evidence of interference that everyone knew didn’t exist. There couldn’t be a smoking gun if no gun existed in the first place. To make the point more forcefully, Boris concluded by saying that Starmer had failed to condemn the Salisbury novichok poisonings. Now it was Keir’s turn to look confused, as Johnson had clearly failed to notice that Jeremy Corbyn had been replaced as leader of the Labour party back in March. Starmer pointed out that he had strongly supported government actions against the Russians on that occasion. What’s more, as director of public prosecutions he had also introduced proceedings against Russia on behalf of Alexander Litvinenko’s widow. Yeah but no but yeah but no but you’re still basically pro-Russian, said Boris, by now stuck on autopilot. And in any case, all this stuff about the ISC report was just sour grapes from “Islingtonian remoaners” who still hadn’t got over the result of the 2016 referendum. This was Boris’s great Freudian slip. Because Labour under Starmer has never once tried to refight the Brexit vote. The only reason Johnson could have had for bringing the subject up was that it had been his fear that Russia might have tried to influence the referendum that had led him to suppress the report. After all, if he had really believed in Russia’s innocence he would have published it before the last election. Visibly rattled, Boris now just lapsed into meaningless, disconnected phrases and a lame gag about “more flip-flops than a Bournemouth beach”. He really does need to get himself a new scriptwriter. Starmer merely sighed that this was a bit rich coming from a man who as a journalist had two contradictory columns for every occasion. “We are delivering as the people’s government,” Johnson insisted. Only I don’t remember him promising us the highest death rate in a global pandemic, a disastrous no deal with the EU and the likelihood of the biggest recession in decades. The only person unable to see quite how damaged Boris is, is Boris himself. He is the emperor with no clothes and it’s not a pretty sight. Even when he’s losing badly, he imagines himself to be a winner. The Tory MP Nusrat Ghani suggested he might care to spend his staycation recess reading Winnie the Pooh. Boris’s eyes lit up. There were too many Eeyores on the Labour benches. What the country needed was a Tigger like him. Except it doesn’t. What the UK really needs is a grown-up in charge. And what we’ve got is an infantile narcissist."
2020-07-22T13:02:48Z,politics,Politics,Harry Dunn death: UK closes loophole that let accused claim immunity,"The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has announced the closing of secret legal loophole that allowed Harry Dunn’s alleged killer Anne Sacoolas to claim diplomatic immunity. A lawyer for Dunn’s family welcomed the move as a “huge step” in securing the extradition to the UK of Sacoolas to stand trial. Sacoolas, the wife of a CIA agent who was working at the US intelligence base RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire, was allowed to return to the US days after allegedly driving her car on the wrong side of the road on 27 August and crashing into Dunn on his motorcycle. In a written statement to parliament, Raab said he and US and UK officials had agreed new arrangements to prevent family members of staff stationed at the base from claiming immunity from prosecution in future. His statement said: “We have secured the agreement of the US so that the Croughton arrangements could not in future be used in the same away as in the tragic case of Harry Dunn. These changes took effect by way of an exchange of notes on 20 July.” He said the US base had agreed to provide mandatory driving training to staff and to improve road signage to remind them to drive on the left. Raab said: “No family should have to experience what they have gone through and I recognise that these changes will not bring Harry back. However, I hope that the knowledge that the Croughton arrangements have been revised and that a family in their position would now see justice done bring some small measure of comfort.” On TuesdayRaab had prompted anger from Dunn’s family by greeting the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in Downing Street. Speaking at the gates of Downing Street on Tuesday, Harry’s mother, Charlotte Charles, said: “Words are not enough any more.” The family has mounted a judicial review of the Foreign Office’s decision-making in the case. Charles and her lawyer Radd Seiger met Raab on Wednesday to discuss diplomatic immunity at the base. Speaking to the Guardian afterwards, Seiger welcomed Raab’s statement as a “very significant development”. He said: “Huge credit to Harry’s parents for standing up, bringing this campaign and a judicial review, because without those none of these secret agreements at Croughton would have been brought to light. And it is absolutely unprecedented from an international relations perspective to get these pre waivers, but as I understand it anybody who commits any serious crime coming off Crouton now will be arrested, and we have the parents to thank for that.” He added: “Now that they’ve reached this agreement, how can the Americans with any credibility refuse now to send Anne Sacoolas back to the UK? The arrangements that apply in July 2020 are equally as good those in August 2019 when Harry Dunn died. This is a huge step forward towards bringing Anne Sacoolas back.” In the meeting, Raab told Seiger and and the Dunn family that the US was still resisting extraditing Sacoolas to the UK. Seiger said: “I am now going to work with him [Raab] to make sure that he brings further pressure to bear in terms of suspending the extradition treaty with the United States or there have to be consequences.” Raab’s statement confirmed that legal “arrangements” at the Croughton base “contained a waiver of immunity from criminal jurisdiction for US staff outside the course of their duties, but no such waiver for their family members.” He added: “The US waiver of immunity from criminal jurisdiction is now expressly extended to the family members of US staff at the Croughton annex, thus ending the anomaly in the previous arrangements and permitting the criminal prosecution of the family members of those staff, should these tragic circumstances ever arise again.” Raab also said the Department of Transport had launched a safety review of roads around the 10 US air force bases in England."
2020-07-22T12:48:30Z,politics,Politics,Labour pays out six-figure sum and apologises in antisemitism row,"The Labour party has apologised “unreservedly” and paid out a six-figure sum to seven former employees and a veteran BBC journalist, admitting it defamed them in the aftermath of a Panorama investigation into its handling of antisemitism. The settlement and formal apologies to both the reporter, John Ware, and the ex-employees, which have been read in open court, is believed to have cost the Labour party around £600,000, with about £180,000 in damages agreed for the eight individuals. The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was disappointed by the settlement, calling it a “political decision” and said it “risks giving credibility to misleading and inaccurate allegations about action taken to tackle antisemitism in the Labour Party in recent years.” The settlement is believed to be an unprecedented case of a political party libelling a journalist and former employees. Labour conceded it had made defamatory and false allegations against the litigants in the light of their interview with the Panorama programme Is Labour Antisemitic?, broadcast last July. It agreed to retract and withdraw accusations that the whistleblowers were motivated by their opposition to the party’s former leader Jeremy Corbyn and had “political axes to grind” and its accusation that Ware had conducted “deliberate and malicious misrepresentations designed to mislead the public”. In a four-page agreement statement made in relation to the former staff’s libel action read out in court 37 of the high court, it said: “The Labour party is here today to publicly set the record straight, and to apologise to the claimants for the distress and embarrassment that it has caused them.” To Ware, it said in a three-page statement: “The defendant is here today to set the record straight and to apologise unreservedly to Mr Ware.” Both statements disclosed that “substantial damages” were being paid out while at the same time pointedly referring to the Labour party being led by Corbyn at the time the libel occurred. The apology was handed down after Corbyn and his former head of communications, Seumas Milne, sought legal advice over its wording. Allies of Corbyn believe the case could have been successfully contested. Louise Withers-Green, one of the whistleblowers who worked in the party’s complaints department, said the former employees had endured a torrent of abuse since the programme had aired. “It feels like it is closing a chapter where the libel against us has been retracted, but this is only a first step for the party in beginning to tackle antisemitism,” she told the Guardian. “I had never expected the party to welcome the Panorama programme with open arms. But I had been expecting them to take responsibility in the long-term for what was happening and truly want to take action. I never expected we would be called bad faith actors.” She added: “I didn’t see, I still don’t see, that there was another option or another route to clear my name,” she said. Most important was the apology, she said. “I think politically the apology means a significant amount. And I think, personally, it’s certainly a turning point.”
The comprehensive apology and retraction will be read in some quarters as an attempt by the current Labour leader, Keir Starmer, to draw a line under the episode in the party’s recent history. A Labour spokesman said the party acknowledged the “many years of dedicated and committed service to the party” that the ex-staffers had given. “Under the leadership of Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner, we are committed to tackling antisemitism within the Labour party. Antisemitism has been a stain on the Labour party in recent years,” the spokesman said. “It has caused unacceptable and unimaginable levels of grief and distress for many in the Jewish community, as well as members of staff. “If we are to restore the trust of the Jewish community, we must demonstrate a change of leadership. That means being open, transparent and respecting the right of whistleblowers. We are determined to deliver that change.” In a statement condemning Keir Starmer for the decision to settle, Corbyn said: “Labour party members have a right to accountability and transparency of decisions taken in their name, and an effective commitment from the party to combat antisemitism and racism in all their forms. “The party’s decision to apologise today and make substantial payments to former staff who sued the party in relation to last year’s Panorama programme is a political decision, not a legal one.” In the programme, eight whistleblowers, seven of whom then sued the party, broke non-disclosure agreements to tell the BBC that they felt fatally undermined by senior Labour bosses in their attempts to tackle antisemitism, alleging consistent interference in complaints. The ex-staffers, Withers-Green, Sam Matthews, Kat Buckingham, Dan Hogan, Ben Westerman, Martha Robinson, and Michael Creighton, worked in the Labour party’s governance and legal unit and were responsible for investigation of allegations of misconduct by party members. The party said it accepted that a statement put out ahead of the broadcast “contained defamatory and false allegations about the whistleblowers”, which was sent to national newspapers and broadcasters, as well as “Jeremy Corbyn-supporting blogs and websites including the Canary, Skwawkbox and Novara Media and many individuals on social media platforms”. Labour admitted it had wrongly accused one of the whistleblowers of “making a false and malicious statement” and accusing them of acting in “bad faith” and working to harm the Labour party. “The Labour party acknowledges that these claims about the claimants are untrue, and we retract and withdraw them and undertake not to repeat them,” the statement said. Lawyer Mark Lewis, of Patron Law, who represented Ware and the whistleblowers, said the case was “unprecedented”. Individual politicians had faced legal challenge by journalists they had libelled in the past, but “I cannot think of a case in which a political party was sued for libel”, he said. “Labour chose to double down and attack the programme’s presenter, John Ware, and the whistleblowers rather than addressing the truth of the problem. It is ironic that the workers’ party chose to act as disgruntled bosses who had been caught out.” Ware, 72, launched proceedings after being subjected to what he said was an avalanche of abuse and criticism by Corbyn supporters.
One year later, Labour admitted it had wrongly accused him of having “invented quotes, flouted journalistic ethics and that, in pursuit of a predetermined outcome to the question asked by the Panorama programme … [and] knowingly promoted falsehoods, including by misrepresentations of fact and, by fabricating facts”. The party said it “unreservedly withdraws these allegations and is profoundly sorry for the distress caused by their publication and republication”. Counsel for Labour, Mark Henderson of Doughty St, said the party also acknowledged the claims were untrue. “We retract and withdraw them, and undertake not to repeat them,” he said. A BBC spokesperson said its journalism had been “subject to an extraordinary and vitriolic attack by the Labour party” and said the apology was long overdue. “We applaud their strength to take this case forward and are pleased it has been recognised in court that these extremely serious and damaging allegations against them were false and have been unreservedly withdrawn. John Ware is a reporter with an extraordinary record of excellence at Panorama for investigative journalism in the public interest.” Labour is awaiting the final publication findings of the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s (EHRC) investigation into allegations of institutional antisemitism. The party revealed this week it had received a draft of the report. Many of the key individuals involved during the period under investigation, including the former general secretary Jennie Formby, Corbyn’s chief of staff, Karie Murphy, the head of complaints, Thomas Gardiner, and the director of communications, Milne, have now left their roles at the party. The party is also set for further potentially damaging recriminations over a leaked internal report that detailed a “hyper-factional” environment that hampered complaints procedures because of hostility to Corbyn’s leadership. Several of the whistleblowers involved in Panorama were named in the report, which is the subject of an independent review chaired by the QC Martin Forde. In his statement, Corbyn said the report showed there was concern “about the role played by some of those who took part in the programme.” “To give our members the answers and justice they deserve, the inquiry led by Martin Forde must now fully address the evidence the internal report uncovered of racism, sexism, factionalism and obstruction of Labour’s 2017 general election campaign.” The Unite general secretary Len McCluskey also criticised the settlement. “Today’s settlement is a misuse of Labour party funds to settle a case it was advised we would win in court,” he said. “The leaked report on how anti-semitism was handled tells a very different story about what happened.” In the statements read in court on Wednesday, the party said its apology in both cases was not intended to have any influence on the EHRC or Forde’s investigation."
2020-07-22T12:45:02Z,politics,Politics,PMQs: Keir Starmer criticises Boris Johnson over Russia report delay,"Boris Johnson has been asked why he “sat on” the intelligence and security committee report on Russian interference in UK politics, during a fiery and acrimonious final PMQs session before parliament breaks for summer recess. Labour’s Keir Starmer said the report, completed last October, found Russia posed an immediate and urgent threat to national security, and he claimed Johnson deliberately suppressed the findings. “The prime minister received that report 10 months ago. Given that the threat is described as immediate and urgent, why did the prime minister sit on that report for so long?” he asked. Johnson said that as foreign secretary and now prime minister he had taken strong action against Russia, including expelling 153 Russian diplomats. He accused Starmer of “sitting on his hands” by supporting his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour leadership, which he said had “parroted the line of the Kremlin” in the aftermath of the 2018 Salisbury poisonings. Starmer said he had personally condemned what happened in Salisbury and had supported the then prime minister, Theresa May. He said his commitment to national security could not be in doubt as in his pre-political career as director of public prosecutions he had worked on live operations with the security and intelligence services. “The report was very clear that until recently the government has badly underestimated the Russian threat,” he said. “The government’s taken its eye off the ball – arguably it wasn’t even on the pitch. After this government’s been in power for 10 years, how does the prime minister explain that?” Johnson claimed no country was more vigilant in protecting against Russian influence than the UK, and said new legislation was being introduced to protect critical national infrastructure and protect intellectual property. He said Starmer’s argument was that of an “Islingtonian remainer” who still did not accept the EU referendum result and tried to give the appearance that Russian interference was responsible for Brexit. Starmer said the delay had left a serious gap in the UK’s defences, and the threat from Russia deserved a far better response.
Johnson said: “Everybody understands these criticisms are motivated by a desire to undermine the referendum on the European Union that took place in 2016, the result of which he simply cannot bring himself to accept.” Johnson has been severely criticised by opposition parties and the report’s author, Dominic Grieve, the former Conservative MP and former intelligence and security committee chair, for not allowing its release before the 2019 general election. It was finally published on Tuesday after the committee reconvened following a gap of more than six months following Tory party wrangling over who should chair it. Julian Lewis had the whip removed by the Tories after he was selected by committee members instead of Johnson’s choice, the former minister Chris Grayling."
2020-07-22T11:55:14Z,politics,Politics,Robert Jenrick says he regrets dining with donor before planning decision,"The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, has admitted he regrets sitting next to the Tory donor Richard Desmond at a fundraising dinner before overruling a local authority and the government planning inspectorate to give permission for the billionaire’s £1bn Westferry property development. Jenrick also conceded it “would have been better not to” exchange messages with Desmond after the dinner, but claimed there was “no bias whatsoever” in his initial approval of the east London development, which was later quashed with the minister conceding his decision was “unlawful”. Jenrick has faced mounting pressure over the issue, after emails between civil servants released last month suggested he was “insistent” that the decision be rushed through in January in time for Desmond to avoid a £45m community levy to the borough. Desmond donated £12,000 to the party a fortnight after permission was granted. Appearing before the housing, communities and local government select committee on Wednesday, Jenrick said: “In terms of the process of the decision-making, I’ve said in my letter to you that I think this could have been handled differently. I regret that I was sat next to the applicant at a dinner in November. “I’ve also made clear that I had absolutely no idea that I was going to be sat next to him or his associates until I took my seat at the table. That is to some extent an occupational hazard of being a planning minister, because people do approach you to discuss applications – not just developers but local councils, members of the public and indeed MPs.” He added: “I was very clear to the applicant when it became clear that to me that he was discussing an application that would come before me for a ministerial decision that it was not appropriate for me to discuss it or to pass comment on it. That’s exactly in line with the rules as they were explained to me and are set out by the department. And on that occasion conversation moved on to other things, as you would expect. “I’ve also said in my letter that, with hindsight, it would have been better not to have exchanged text messages with the applicant.” Text message exchanges released by the government revealed how Desmond lobbied Jenrick after the dinner to expedite the development to avoid the need to pay the levy to Labour-run Tower Hamlets council, the poorest borough in London, saying: “We don’t want to give Marxists loads of doe [sic] for nothing!” Jenrick said the text messages also showed that he told Desmond it was not appropriate to discuss the application. He told the committee: “So I entirely believe that the decision was the right one, there was no bias whatsoever, and any suggestion of that is extremely unfair and in most cases a wilful misleading of events.” He added: “But would it have been better not to have been sat next to the applicant? Yes. That wasn’t my decision. Would it have been better not to have had text messages with him? Yes, and both myself and the department will learn lessons from the experience.” Jenrick sat next to Desmond, the former owner of the Express, at a Conservative party fundraising event on 18 November last year, where Desmond lobbied him and showed him a video about the 44-storey, 1,500-apartment development. In one document released by the government last month, a civil servant in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government wrote: “On timing, my understanding is that SoS [secretary of state – Jenrick] is/was insistent that decision issued this week ie tomorrow – as next week the viability of the scheme is impacted by a change in the London CIL regime.” The ministerial code states: “If a minister meets an external organisation or individual and finds themselves discussing official business without an official present – for example at a social occasion or holiday – any significant content should be passed back to the department as soon as possible after the event.” Jenrick told the committee it was not of interest to him who benefited from avoiding the community infrastructure levy (CIL). “I think it was a perfectly fair decision to try and get this done, one way or another, before the CIL charge came in,” he said. “Who that benefits is of no interest to me. I’m not interested in the personal finances of the applicant.” He said officials in his department “were aware of events” surrounding the Westferry application and “at no point did anybody advise me to recuse myself”.
He added: “There was no meeting with the applicant, I encountered him at a dinner. He mentioned the application, I told him that it was not appropriate to discuss it and I didn’t pass any comment. “The department were aware that I was going to the dinner, the department were aware that there was a suggestion of going on a site visit … I discussed it with my officials, as to whether it was wise to go on a site visit in light of the nature of the application, in light of the fact that I had sat next to the applicant at a dinner, and my officials advised me that on balance they thought it wasn’t and so we declined it.” He said it was “not unusual” for ministers to go against the advice of officials. He said he did not know whether Westferry was the first time he had made a decision contrary to civil servant advice. Jenrick, who has consistently denied wrongdoing, removed his approval for the scheme last month, admitting it was “unlawful by reason of apparent bias” after a challenge from Tower Hamlets. Boris Johnson has said he considers the matter “closed”. Following Jenrick’s appearance before the committee, the shadow housing and planning minister , Mike Amesbury, said: “The stench of this grubby affair won’t go away until Mr Jenrick comes clean: he needs to give a statement to the House answering all the committee’s questions in full if the public is to have any faith in the integrity of the planning system.”"
2020-07-22T05:00:04Z,politics,Politics,Home Office urged to correct false slavery information in citizenship test,"More than 175 historians have called on the Home Office to remove the history element of the UK citizenship test because of its “misleading and false” representation of slavery and empire. The signatories say the official handbook, which the Life in the UK test is based on, creates a distorted version of history, which directly counters the values of tolerance and fairness it purports to promote. In an open letter, the signatories, including 13 fellows of the British Academy, two past presidents of the Royal Historical Society and the director of the Stephen Lawrence Research Centre, write: “The official handbook published by the Home Office is fundamentally misleading and in places demonstrably false … People in the colonies and people of colour in the UK are nowhere actors in this official history. The handbook promotes the misleading view that the empire came to an end simply because the British decided it was the right thing to do. Similarly, the abolition of slavery is treated as a British achievement, in which enslaved people themselves played no part. The book is equally silent about colonial protests, uprisings and independence movements.” Among the examples of “falsehood and misrepresentation” they highlight are the claim in the handbook that: “While slavery was illegal within Britain itself, by the 18th century it was a fully established overseas industry.” However, slavery’s legality within Britain was still a matter of debate at that time, as illustrated by the famous Somerset case in 1772. Adverts placed in newspapers show that many black people were held as slaves in Britain. The handbook also states that “by the second part of the 20th century, there was, for the most part, an orderly transition from empire to Commonwealth, with countries being granted their independence”. The historians say that decolonisation was an often violent process, citing India and the Mau-Mau uprising in Kenya as just two examples. The letter, signed by historians from major universities across the country, demands that the history element of the test be withdrawn until the guidebook can be corrected and rewritten. Historian and broadcaster David Olusoga said: “This is another manifestation and a version of our history that whitewashes the difficult parts and if this is the history we’re telling to new fellow citizens then I somewhat despair. “With the Black Lives Matter movement what we’ve seen is organisations and institutions all over the world listen in ways that they haven’t been able to do previously. So I’m hopeful that the Home Office will reappraise this handbook and its version of British history and offer new British citizens a fuller and more frank understanding of our past.”
Anindita Ghosh, professor of modern Indian history at the University of Manchester, is one of several signatories who have sat the test, in her case last year after some 25 years in the UK. “One of the reasons I kept putting it off was the book, because I personally found it very insulting knowing what I know of British and Indian history to read what was there in the book. “Britain would not have been Britain today, if it had not been fed these resources from two centuries of rule in India. It’s a joke to just have that one paragraph [referring to India].” Simukai Chigudu, associate professor of African politics and fellow of St Antony’s College, University of Oxford, sat the test about 15 years after arriving from Zimbabwe. He said: “Having worked across a number of different institutions and lived in different parts of the country and so on, I felt like I had a really good grasp of what life in the UK is like. And then you read the handbook you have to take for the test and it’s just nonsense. “It’s an array of some random facts and very simplistic history that the academic in me looked at and could see was a kind of form of national myth-making about the UK, that glosses over ugly sides of history that valorises a very mainstream populist view of the country, a sanitised version of colonialism and slavery.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Given the breadth of British history, the Life in the UK handbook provides a starting point to explore our past and help those seeking to live permanently in the UK gain a basic understanding of our society, culture and historical references which occur in everyday conversations. “We have published several editions of the handbook since it was launched and will continue to keep its contents under review and consider any feedback we receive.” • Read the letter in full"
2020-07-21T23:38:43Z,politics,Politics,Corbyn-era Labour figures may challenge antisemitism settlement,"Key figures in Labour when Jeremy Corbyn was leader are mulling a challenge to the party’s settlement with a BBC journalist and seven of its former staff over a libel case relating to a Panorama programme last year about its handling of antisemitism. It is understood the former Labour leader himself as well as his former director of communications Seumas Milne have taken legal advice about the settlement and apology set to be read at the high court on Wednesday. The Guardian understands a full-scale legal challenge to the statement of apology is now unlikely ahead of the hearing listed for 10am at the high court but senior figures are now considering routes for a future challenge to the settlement. According to several sources, an out of court settlement was reached in the last week between the journalist and the former staff, all of whom worked in the Labour party’s governance and legal unit and were responsible for investigation of allegations of misconduct by party members. It is understood a formal apology was requested by the litigants and this is due to be read out in court on Wednesday. John Ware, who led the Panorama investigation, sued over a statement by Labour that the BBC had engaged in “deliberate and malicious representations designed to mislead the public” in its broadcast. Labour submitted a formal complaint about the programme to the BBC, but the corporation’s Executive Complaints Unit rejected it as did Ofcom. The watchdog rejected 28 complaints against the programme for alleged bias, concluding it was “duly impartial” and included the Labour party’s response prominently throughout. The Panorama programme Is Labour Anti-Semitic?, which was screened in July last year, made a number of serious claims about the party’s internal culture for dealing with complaints of antisemitism. In the programme, eight whistleblowers, seven of whom involved in the legal action against the party, broke non-disclosure agreements to tell the BBC that they felt fatally undermined by senior Labour bosses in their attempts to tackle antisemitism, alleging consistent interference in complaints."
2020-07-21T17:34:17Z,politics,Politics,Focus on pay restraint distorts Rishi Sunak's spending review,"The government has embarked on a spending review across Whitehall that the chancellor says must include pay restraint. Rishi Sunak, in a letter to his cabinet colleagues, spells out his priorities for Whitehall departments and in among the calls for Britain to become a “scientific superpower”, improve public services and tackle crime, is the demand for a clampdown on pay. According to Sunak, the government will be in a position to justify bearing down on public sector pay from next year after three years of extraordinary generosity. Public sector earnings growth reached 3.6% in the 2018-19 financial year and 3.7% in 2019-20, according to Treasury figures. That’s two years of inflation-busting increases that will be matched by a third year now that the chancellor has agreed to increases ranging from 2% to 3.1% for 2020-21, backdated to April. Around a quarter of public sector spending is devoted to staff salaries, so when the chancellor turns his attention to the government’s spiralling debts, it is understandable that pay is an element of any newly drawn budgetary equation. At least it would be fair for him to focus on pay restraint if he had presented a more comprehensive picture of recent years. A seven-year freeze on public sector pay in England might have officially come to an end in 2017, but the pay awards since then have come from existing budgets and were paid for by savings elsewhere. This meant that teachers, soldiers and police officers have generally found themselves working with fewer resources and fewer colleagues each day, making it more difficult to do their job. The Treasury also focuses on increases in the overall pay bill rather than on pay awards to all staff. This allows officials to include the extra cash devoted to bonuses and promotions and other extras in the pay figures. With a widening pay gap in the public sector as elsewhere in the jobs market, this focus on total earnings distorts the amount earned by many of those on the lowest pay scales and workers who fall outside the scope of the pay awards.
As Sunak concedes, only 900,000 of the 5 million-plus public sector workforce is included in the latest pay figures. No wonder Dr David Wrigley, the vice-chairman of the British Medical Association, told the BBC that doctors would feel let down by a pay increase of 2.8% this year and the prospect of next to nothing in subsequent years. “These are the sort of rises we’d expect to see in normal times, not in a time when many of us have not had a day off in six months and have been putting our lives on the line,” he said. Sunak, like his predecessors, will demand quick fixes as he seeks more from less, most likely pressuring departments into making false economies that must be rectified in later years. Which is not to say that the pandemic has nothing to say about the future of public sector services and where savings can be made. For instance, there are many services tentatively entering the digital age that will see the process accelerate over the coming years, freeing up staff to perform other tasks. However, most of the services on Sunak’s hit list were on George Osborne’s and Philip Hammond’s and have little left in terms of savings to offer the Treasury. The justice department will need more not less money over the next few years to get through a backlog of court cases. Universities will need extra subsidies to cope with the loss of foreign students and the care system is only going to get bigger as the population ages. Charting a route out of the pandemic will not be an easy task, and would not be for any chancellor. But Sunak has the extra burden of wanting a smaller government when for the next decade the UK will need the state to be the driving force."
2020-07-21T17:20:51Z,politics,Politics,UK targets up to 12 Covid-19 vaccines from around the world,"The UK government aims to secure stocks of not one vaccine or even two but up to 12 that are being developed around the world, hedging its bets to ensure it has something that works as early as possible to try to end the health, social and economic havoc being wreaked by Covid-19. As Oxford University published early results of its trials, showing its vaccine is safe and provokes a good immune response, Kate Bingham, the chair of the government’s vaccines taskforce, said the strategy was to have an entire portfolio rather than one star player. On Monday the government announced it was investing in BioNTech/Pfizer’s vaccine and a second being developed by Valneva, a French company that has a manufacturing site in Scotland. That is a total of 90m doses – almost as many as the 100m secured from Oxford. “The strategy has been very clear,” Bingham said. “We have no template to show us how to make a vaccine against coronavirus because it has never been done.” So the intention is to “explore the landscape” and select a few out of each of the four “buckets”, as she described them – the different modalities or technologies being used around the world in vaccine development. “There are the two hairy, scary, sexy ones which are the most advanced,” she said. Those are the vaccines such as Oxford’s delivered by an inactivated adenovirus like the common cold, and the mRNA vaccines that employ a genetic code rather than parts of the virus, being developed by BioNTech, Imperial and Moderna. “An mRNA vaccine has never been approved by any regulator ever,” Bingham said. Johnson & Johnson has had regulatory approval for an Ebola vaccine that uses an adenovirus vector approach, but only in the last couple of weeks. “Those are the most advanced clinically, but about which we know least. Then you’ve got the rather boring, much more established vaccine formats, which we know much more about but they are further behind in clinical development. The one company we announced, Valneva, with the Scottish manufacturing site, which grows up live Covid virus and then inactivates it – that is a very proven form of vaccination. “Polio, the new flu vaccines – basically you just take whole virus and then inactivate. They are good at eliciting an immune response because you get the full virus, as it were.” The “other boring approach which is well-understood”, she said, was the use of an adjuvant – a protein to boost the immune system – which was what the big pharmaceutical companies GSK and Sanofi were doing, for example. Bingham said vaccines based on those latter two technologies would not get approval before the middle of next year. “But they are better understood and more proven and, as formats, more likely to work – but slower. So what we’ve done is pick what we think are the best in class of the different vaccine types and secure rights to those.” The people most at risk of dying from Covid-19 are older people, those with underlying health problems and ethnic minorities. A vaccine for older people could prevent 90% of deaths. But there have already been many questions as to whether the vaccines in development will work well for them. In flu it is possible to get efficacy of only 50%, which nonetheless is very worthwhile. Bingham said the adjuvant vaccines held most promise for older people who have weakened immune systems. They provoke the immune system into a better response, she said. She cited GSK’s Shingrix vaccine against shingles: “They showed over 90% responses in the elderly. That’s why I say it’s more likely to work in those patient cohorts. It doesn’t mean they can get a vaccine for Covid, but it’s some evidence the adjuvant may work in this format and the whole inactivated virus also uses an adjuvant. “So both those two are the ones that – if I had to bookend high risk to low risk – those would be the lower risk and more likely to work in the elderly cohort than these new ones. These new ones may well work – we just don’t have the data.”
Bingham said nobody wanted to wait until the middle of next year for a vaccine. The strategy had been to build a broad portfolio “and to recognise that we will lose money by doing that”. She added: “If we’re in the fortunate position that they all work, we will be the vaccine supplier to the world, but the likelihood is most of these will fail. We would kick ourselves if we only had supported the more traditional approaches if the new approaches do work.” She said there had to be commercial companies involved. “The reality is, if you are actually trying to develop a vaccine that can be deployed internationally, you really do need a big pharmaceutical company at your side. A little company is not going to do that well.” The UK is not alone in bidding to secure a supply of vaccine. The US has attracted particular criticism for its America-first policy and the multibillion-dollar deals it is willing to sign with vaccine companies. Bingham said the UK is a supporter of Covax, the World Health Organization and Gates Foundation bid to raise money from donor countries to fund essential supplies of a vaccine for low-income countries that stand little chance of obtaining anything by themselves. What is certain is that when there is the evidence everyone is waiting for that any of the vaccines work, there will be an undignified scramble to buy."
2020-07-21T17:16:34Z,politics,Politics,UK government rejects ISC call for inquiry into Russian interference in Brexit referendum â€“ as it happened,"The British government and intelligence agencies failed to prepare or conduct any proper assessment of Kremlin attempts to interfere with the 2016 Brexit referendum, according to the long-delayed Russia report. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has said the UK should join the US and countries around the world in being more assertive towards China. Speaking at a news conference, he praised Boris Johnson for his decision to exclude the Chinese firm Huawei from the UKâ€™s 5G network, saying that the PM was making a decision in the national interest, and not just responding to pressure from Washington. Pompeo went on: We think that the entire world needs to work together to ensure that every country - including China - behaves in the international system in ways that are appropriate and consistent with the international order. You canâ€™t go make claims for maritime regions that you have no lawful claim to. You canâ€™t threaten countries and bully them in the Himalayas. You canâ€™t engage in cover-ups and co-opt international institutions like the World Health Organization ... We want every nation to work together to push back against the Chinese Communist partyâ€™s efforts in every dimension that I have described. That certainly includes the United Kingdom, it includes every country. We hope we can build out a coalition that understands the threat and weâ€™ll work collectively to convince the Chinese Communist party itâ€™s not in their best interests to engage in this kind of behaviour.
Prof Chris Whitty, the UK governmentâ€™s chief medical adviser, has dismissed suggestions that ministers ignored scientific advice when they put off ordering a full lockdown until relatively late. In evidence to the Commons health select committee, Whitty said: Ministers at the time, who were put in an incredibly difficult position, in my view, followed the advice given by Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies], which are clearly signposted through the minutes of Sage, with a delay that was no more than you would reasonably expect for what are really very difficult things to operationalise and decide. I do not think - Iâ€™m not saying now and Iâ€™m not going to say at any point, to be clear - that in my view there was huge delay between the advice that ministers received, given the enormity of the difficulties that we were asking of people, and the practical implications of what was being done. At a committee last week Sir Patrick Vallance, the governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser, suggested that ministers did delay following scientific advice to order a lockdown - although it has been reported that Vallance may have misremembered when Sage moved to recommending a full lockdown. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has told MPs that Public Health England was not suited to setting up a national testing programme. Giving evidence to the Commons science committee, he said: We need a standing capability, right, we need a public health agency that isnâ€™t only brilliant at science, but also is ready to mass scale very, very quickly. PHE was designed as a scientific organisation, and it is really good as a scientific organisation, and remains so, and has some of the best public health scientists in the world in PHE. The challenge that it found was it was not set up to be an organisation ready to go to mass national scale and we didnâ€™t go into this crisis with that mass of testing capability. In that we were like almost every other country in the world. Germany was the exception in this space rather than the norm, and some of the far eastern countries. Hancock also described his decision to set 100,000 tests a day as a target was a â€œbig, hairy, audacious goalâ€�. He explained: Iâ€™ve been accused of over-promising and sometimes delivering. And the point is that when youâ€™re handling a pandemic response and the response you need is to scale-up at a speed that is almost unprecedented within government at a national scale, the tools that I found worked were to set demanding goals. In fact the chancellor told me afterwards that I set a â€˜big, hairy, audacious goalâ€™, apparently this is a classic business school doctrine that I didnâ€™t know that I was following. NHS chiefs have told the Welsh government the country is likely to need 5,000 extra beds on top of its normal capacity to deal with coronavirus this autumn and winter. As Steven Morris reports, at the governmentâ€™s weekly press conference health minister Vaughan Gething said some field hospitals would be needed to meet the demand of what he believed would be â€œa truly extraordinary autumn and winter.â€� Priti Patel has promised to revolutionise the culture of the Home Office in the wake of the Windrush scandal, pledging a more compassionate, â€œpeople firstâ€� approach to immigration to meet the recommendations of an independent review into UK government failures. A Conservative MPâ€™s behaviour has been branded â€œcompletely unacceptableâ€� by his own party, following allegations over WhatsApp texts sent to a young female intern and a male parliament worker. As PA Media reports, Rob Roberts, MP for Delyn, North Wales, is under investigation by the office of the parliamentary commissioner for standards. CCHQ confirmed an investigation is under way, that Roberts has apologised and he is undergoing training in social media. Thatâ€™s all from me for today.

2020-07-21T17:02:47Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak warns public sector workers of new pay squeeze,"Rishi Sunak has warned public sector workers to expect a renewed squeeze on pay and ordered government departments to find cost savings in response to the economic shock unleashed by Covid-19. Against the backdrop of rapidly rising public borrowing after the government pumped billions of pounds into its initial emergency response, the chancellor announced the launch of a comprehensive spending review to set out his longer-term priorities. Suank promised to raise overall spending in real terms to meet the Tories’ manifesto promise to “level up” Britain, but also served notice that cost savings would still need to be found across Whitehall given the scale of the economic shock. On Monday night the Treasury announced an above-inflation pay rise for 900,000 public sector workers this year. But in a letter sent to government departments, the chancellor said that over the next three years “we must exercise restraint in future public sector pay awards”. One union leader described the pay awards as “a smokescreen” to hide bad news. Sunak told ministers the move was necessary for “reasons of fairness” because while average public sector wages had risen over the year to May, private sector pay had fallen due to Covid-19. “It will be vital that public sector pay awards made during the review take into account the wider economic context,” he said. Prompting anger from trades unions and warnings to steer way from austerity, critics said the move echoed the Tory response to the 2008 financial crisis – which included public sector pay freezes in an effort to bring down government borrowing levels. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: “It’s hard to see how public sector workers can trust ministers after this cynical ploy to disguise plans for more pay restraint. “In the last decade, we learned the hard way that austerity and pay restraint slow down recovery. People have less to spend. Businesses have fewer customers. And it holds back growth.” Sunak’s letter to ministers came just hours after the Treasury had announced that doctors, police, teachers and some other public sector workers in England were to receive above-inflation pay rises this year. However, the pay rises will cover fewer than one in five public sector workers, and exclude nurses and carers. They will also only apply this year, while the spending review will set out the government’s pay policy and wider budgeting plans until 2023-24. The review will also allocate infrastructure spending budgets until 2024-25, and grants for devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said: “The fanfare announcement of more pay for some public service workers was clearly just a smokescreen for something altogether more sinister. “Talking of holding down pay for all the NHS workers – including nurses, paramedics, cleaners, porters and healthcare assistants – and the care, school and council staff who’ve all given so much in the past few months will go down like a lead balloon with the public.” The spending review, due to be completed by the autumn, comes as the first major test for the Tories’ promise to end austerity and level-up economic prosperity as the country emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic. However, it also comes amid growing concern in the Treasury over borrowing levels after official figures showed public sector borrowing hit almost £130bn between April and June as the coronavirus struck – more than double the government’s budget deficit for the whole of last year. Launching the review, the chancellor said “tough choices” would need to be made despite his promise to increase overall government spending above inflation. The Treasury said departments had been asked to “identify opportunities to reprioritise and deliver savings” in response to the economic shock caused by Covid-19. Experts said the move paved the way for real-terms cuts to spending for some departments. Ben Zaranko, a research economist at the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, said the chancellor had set the stage for a less generous settlement than planned in March. “We’re not in a period of austerity any more. [However,] some areas might be facing cuts – and that’s not going to be easy for those areas, and it will have real consequences for public services. But it’s the government’s job to prioritise,” he said. Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, said the announcement covering pay increases for some public sector workers had come as “light at the end of the tunnel” for some frontline workers after a decade of austerity.
“But the language in the chancellor’s announcement on the comprehensive spending review suggests he might be giving with one hand only to take away with the other. This is not the time to fall back on policies that delivered the slowest economic recovery in eight generations,” she said. Asked if austerity was over given the plans to restrain public sector wage growth and find cost savings in some departments, the prime minister’s spokesman said Boris Johnson had been “clear that we will not be responding to this crisis with what has been called austerity”. Earlier on Tuesday figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that public borrowing in the first three months of the 2020-21 financial year jumped to £127.9bn, the highest quarterly sum since comparable records began in 1993. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s tax and spending watchdog, has forecast a deficit of £322bn this year – the highest shortfall in the public finances in peacetime for 300 years."
2020-07-21T16:25:59Z,politics,Politics,"Johnson was asleep on the job, and since when was idleness a crime? | John Crace","Somewhere in Epsom, Chris Grayling was sobbing loudly having managed to lock himself in a cupboard. Wondering how he hadn’t managed to acquire vital intelligence about the intelligence and security committee. Wondering how he had managed to come second in a rigged election. Wondering how he had failed to suppress a report on interference in UK elections for a little while longer. The irony of all this rather passed him by. Meanwhile up in London, Julian Lewis, who had stolen the chair of the ISC from under Failing Grayling’s nose simply by promising the four opposition MPs on the committee that he would publish the Russia report as soon as possible, was happily taking centre stage in a book-lined room, having first made sure the curtains were firmly drawn. Satisfied there were no foreign spooks peering in, Lewis began the press conference by insisting he was only the facilitator. The compere, if you like. He hadn’t been on the committee when it had written the report, so he wanted to leave the interpretation of its findings to two men who had. Labour’s Kevan Jones kicked things off by referring to the nine-month delay in publication. This had been entirely down to the prime minister, whose four different excuses for postponing and discrediting the report had all been outright lies. Jones didn’t mince his words. He’d been waiting a long time to let Boris Johnson know what he thought of him and he wasn’t going to waste the opportunity now. Thereafter the press conference turned into a double act for Jones and the SNP’s Stewart Hosie, with each man taking it in three-minute turns to expose the ease with which the British political process could have been corrupted. Neither MI6 or GCHQ had been tasked with investigating Russian interference and MI5 had never got round to tasking itself with doing the job. After all, it was well known that Russia was actively trying to destabilise the west, having already attempted to influence the Scottish independence referendum and the 2016 US presidential election. What’s more, UK politicians had become far too chummy with Russian oligarchs and not too bothered about the source of the money flowing into the “Londongrad laundromat”, just so long as it continued to arrive by the sackful. But the killer line was that it was impossible to say whether the Russians had tried to influence the Brexit referendum because the government had made no attempt to find out one way or another. The result had gone the way that Vote Leave had wanted, so there was no point in rocking the boat. Why take the gloss off a result that had given so many people so much pleasure? Not to mention put Boris into Downing Street three years later. Besides, it was unthinkable that the Russians would bother to interfere in something as inconsequential as the UK’s membership of the EU. The government had been given the warnings, been given the chance to investigate, and yet had chosen to do precisely nothing. Such laissez-faire attitudes opened up some fascinating possibilities. At a stroke, the police could get rid of all their unsolved crimes simply by saying those crimes had never been committed. That boy who had been stabbed had merely accidentally tripped on a knife. That car hadn’t been stolen, someone had merely driven it by mistake. But why stop here? Why not see just where a total lack of curiosity might get you? If no one had gone to the trouble of identifying the coronavirus, it was self-evident that no one could have died from it. That way we could have avoided all the hassles and economic hardships caused by lockdown. Far better for hundreds of thousands of people to have died from unexplained causes than to have inconvenienced those who either didn’t get the virus or managed to recover. Both men were too canny to allow themselves to be drawn on why the government had tried to cover up the report or might be so uninterested in even sounding out the possibility of Russian attempts to interfere with the UK democratic process. Instead, they merely contented themselves with raising the odd eyebrow from time to time. It was the political equivalent of the dog that didn’t bark in the night. AKA, never open an inquiry unless you know what you might learn first. And the Tories under both Theresa May and Johnson had had a pretty good idea of what they might find. Having insisted it had made no efforts to discredit the report before its publication, the government went out of its way to discredit it immediately afterwards. If there had been anything to investigate then it would have been hot on the case. So the absence of any investigation was a sure sign that nothing untoward had happened and that the Russians had dozed off during the Brexit referendum. Besides, why bother to drag up something that had taken place four years in the past and would cause more trouble? Any attempt to portray the government as colluding with the Russians was just a smear. If Boris was guilty of anything it was being asleep on the job. And since when was idleness a crime? If only the Americans hadn’t had such a hissy-fit over Huawei, we could have happily ignored the Chinese too. Let bygones be bygones."
2020-07-21T16:01:56Z,politics,Politics,What does the Russia report mean for British people and politics?,"What does the report tell us? The Russia report accuses the government of failing to investigate Russian interference in British politics, in particular during the 2016 EU referendum. The Commons intelligence and security committee’s language is scathing. It says Downing Street showed a “lack of curiosity” over Kremlin meddling. The report doesn’t say whether this complacency was deliberate or an omission. Either way, it amounts to a stunning rebuke of Boris Johnson and his predecessor as prime minister, Theresa May. We now know why Johnson sought to bury the report before last December’s general election. It is embarrassing. He burned political capital to keep it secret. The report broadly reflects the expert view of Christopher Steele, a former MI6 spy who gave evidence to the ISC in 2018. He said Johnson, as foreign secretary, and May “threw a blanket” over indications that the Russians had pushed for Brexit and may have covertly funded the campaign. They put Tory party politics above national security, Steele alleged. The ISC says: “The written evidence provided to us appeared to suggest that HMG [Her Majesty’s government] had not seen or sought evidence of successful interference in UK democratic processes or any activity that has had a material impact on an election, for example influencing results.” There is abundant evidence that the Russians were actively seeking to undermine British democracy, the report says. The intelligence agencies – including MI6, MI5 and GCHQ – were acutely aware of Kremlin activity around the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. They had early warning in spring 2016 of Moscow’s email hacking and dumping operation against the Democrats in the US, done to damage the party’s then presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, and to help the Republicans’ Donald Trump. Yet no Russian “threat assessment” was carried out before the 2016 EU vote, the ISC says. The referendum was therefore left “unprotected”, it says.
The report is equally critical of the spy agencies. They appear to have been reluctant to take responsibility for defending the UK from hostile state meddling, it suggests. None of the agencies carried out an assessment of what Moscow did during the EU vote. When asked, MI5 sent the committee a cursory six-line note. GCHQ failed to provide information about the numerous pro-leave troll accounts run from inside Russia. And the report suggests MI6 didn’t ask its secret agents “to provide information on the extent or nature of Russian influence campaigns”. The big picture is damning: of a government that didn’t want to know, and of spooks who were too timid to ask. Where does this leave the Brexit vote? Four years on we still don’t know the extent of Russian meddling in the referendum. Nor did we discover whether it affected the outcome. Leave.EU, funded by the Bristol businessman Arron Banks, claims the report exonerates the campaign, which included multiple meetings with the Russian ambassador in London. It doesn’t accuse or clear Banks; he makes a brief appearance in a footnote. The question of how deeply Moscow meddled cannot be answered because it was never asked, the ISC says. As the Scottish National party MP and ISC member Stewart Hosie said on Tuesday, nobody in government wished to go near the Russian meddling issue “with a 10ft barge pole”. The committee has called on Johnson to carry out a “post-referendum assessment” of the degree to which the Kremlin interfered in the vote. It argues this would be a useful exercise even if it establishes that there was minimal interference. Any reckoning would reassure voters worried about the integrity of elections. And it would help pre-empt future attacks by Russia on British democracy. The report notes that the US special prosecutor Robert Mueller carried out an analogous exercise which concluded last year, after a two-year investigation, that Vladimir Putin had run a “sweeping and systematic” operation to make Trump president.
Downing Street has said it will not do what the ISC wants. There would be no cross-Whitehall investigation of the EU referendum, it said after the report was released. This position is short-sighted: Putin is happy to support any political party if it suits his strategic purpose. In the absence of a Mueller-style inquiry, the debate over the legitimacy of the UK’s historic vote to leave the EU will rumble on. Neither side won a knockout blow on Tuesday. But the report fuels suspicion that the victorious Brexiters have something to hide, and will leave remainers feeling a little cheerier. What do we learn about the Putin state? Twenty-first-century Russia is a malign entity. In the list of Kremlin enemies, Britain is near the top, just below the US and Nato. The ISC took evidence from a range of intelligence chiefs. All say the Kremlin is notoriously opaque and that Putin surrounds himself with a “small group of trusted and secretive admirers”. Moscow is therefore a formidable counter-intelligence challenge. The Russian president is able to take decisions far more quickly than his democratic counterparts, as seen for example in his lightning move in 2014 to annex Crimea. Nonetheless, the ISC is critical of the UK’s spy agencies. It accuses them of not allocating sufficient resources to a metastising problem. It suggests that in the 2000s they “took their eye off the ball” – the ball being a resurgent and aggressive Moscow. At the time, the west was busy with the danger from Islamist terrorism. Successive governments “badly underestimated” the threat posed by Putin and the multi-level response needed. In their submissions, the agencies pushed back against this critique. MI5 says it was preoccupied with dealing with “appalling terrorism”. The report starkly sets out the multi-faceted nature of Russian activity. It mentions the 2006 polonium murder of Alexander Litvinenko and the 2018 nerve agent attack against Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury. Putin’s attempts to subvert the UK come in many guises, the ISC says. They include hacking; the use of Russian state media, such as RT and Sputnik; social media bots and trolls; and the financing of far-right political parties in Europe, such as National Rally (former the Front National) in France. There is recognition that the Kremlin is engaged in ongoing disinformation warfare, characterised by lies, “pro-Russian narratives” and deliberate confusion. What about donations from Moscow-linked donors to the Conservatives and other parties? The report does not name names but offers a few clues. The key paragraph says: “Several members of the Russian elite who are closely linked to Putin are identified as being involved with charitable and/or political organisations in the UK, having donated to political parties”. Their “public profile” allows them to “assist Russian influence operations”, the ISC says. It adds that Russian business and intelligence are “completely intertwined” – in other words, oligarchs who live and invest in London may well be following the Kremlin’s geo-political agenda, as well their own private interests. The report acknowledges the UK has long had a welcoming attitude to Russian money. Few questions are asked. It notes that this approach has turned London into a “laundromat” for dirty money. Beneficiaries include PR firms, charities, universities and members of the House of Lords. It is too late to “untangle” Russian cash from the UK, the report says, but the government needs to do more to tackle hostile activity at source. The National Crime Agency is limited in what it can do. It lacks the resources to take on billionaire oligarchs, who can comfortably afford top lawyers, the ISC notes. What has been redacted? Sections of the report have been deleted and replaced with asterisks. It’s unclear whether it was Downing Street or the security services that did this. Or both. Additionally, the report contains a confidential annex. This will only be read inside Whitehall, unless a public-spirited civil servant leaks it. The suspicion is that many of these deletions have been made for political rather than security reasons. One example: “The extent to which Russian businesses are using access to UK businesses and politicians to exert influence is ****.” Another: “The government must ****, take the necessary measures to counter the threat and challenge the impunity of Putin-linked elites.” What recommendations does the ISC make? A key ISC complaint is that the government’s response to the Russian threat is badly coordinated, with little clear idea of who is supposed to be in charge. It compares the current Whitehall arrangement to an “unnecessarily complicated wiring diagram”. The ISC wants new legislation to counter Russian espionage and the flow of murky money from Moscow, and to deal with “enablers” in the UK who allow influencing to take place. It advocates greater international cooperation, of the kind seen in spring 2018 when the UK and its allies expelled 153 Russian spies after the Salisbury attacks. The report recommends a US-style “foreign agents” law. This would mean anyone working for a foreign power would have to register as a foreign agent. It also calls for an overhaul of the Official Secrets Act and for “greater cohesion” among the spy agencies in dealing with the cyber-threat from Moscow. The report says the approach should be to publicise the activities of hostile Kremlin agencies such as the GRU, which carried out the Skripal hit. The UK also needs to push back more against covert digital influence. Social media companies that fail to identify and remove Russian troll operations should be named and shamed, it says. • On Wednesday 22 July, Luke Harding will join Carole Cadwalladr for a Guardian Live online event about Russian interference in western democracies.

2020-07-21T15:11:12Z,politics,Politics,"Covid-19: test all health and care workers weekly, says UK scientist","All health and care staff should be routinely tested for Covid-19 once or twice a week, according to one of the UK’s most eminent scientists, Sir Paul Nurse, whose team’s research suggests 45% of staff were infected with coronavirus at the peak of the pandemic in England, most of whom showed no symptoms. Giving evidence to the Commons health and social care select committee, Nurse, who turned the Crick Institute he heads into a testing laboratory, said his team had told ministers that frequent, routine testing was essential to ensure the safety of health and care staff and give the public the confidence to go into hospitals. “My colleagues in the Crick contacted Downing Street in March, wrote to minister [Matt] Hancock in April, emphasising two main things: the importance of regular systematic testing of all healthcare workers, including not only frontline doctors and nurses but support staff, ambulance drivers and other healthcare providers, such as the care homes, GP surgeries, community nurses and the like. These all need to be tested. “At the height of the pandemic, our own research – and of course that only backs up what’s been done elsewhere – is that up to 45% of healthcare workers were infected. And they were infecting their colleagues … reinfecting patients, yet they weren’t being tested systematically.”
The second point they made to Hancock, he said, was that high numbers of people were testing positive without symptoms. “Again, our own research has shown that nearly 40% of healthcare workers at that time were infected but had no symptoms. So this was a real, major failure. In the healthcare environment, we weren’t providing proper protection. And it’s important.” He said healthcare workers “deserve to work in a safe environment. I mean, some of them are dying because of what they do.” Routine testing would be important before a possible second wave in the autumn and winter, he said. He rejected the argument that some tests showed people were infected when they were not. His lab had seen no more than one false positive out of 5,000 tests, he said. Nurse said it was not always clear who was in charge in the crisis. “It’s not always been clear at least to me and my colleagues as to who is in charge exactly and who has been making decisions.” Sir Jeremy Farrar, the head of Wellcome, said the UK had not been prepared for the pandemic. Like much of the rest of the world, it had neglected public health since the first Sars outbreak in 2003, he said. “We’ve underestimated the warning calls from Sars 1 through Ebola, through Zika, through the [flu] pandemic of 2009. Maybe the world became a little bit cynical. Emerging infections were not going to cause the devastation that some people had said they would. And we let down our guard, and we didn’t realise the power of infectious diseases,” he said. “So I think critically we need to look at that period prior to December 2019 coming into January and February, which is what I regard as the absolute critical two months.” It was very clear by 20 January that the virus was not like Sars 1, he said. There was asymptomatic transmission, it was highly infectious and it caused a range of illness, from mild to very severe. “It was an animal infection that humans have no immunity to, and we had no diagnostics no treatments and no vaccines,” Farrar said. “I think the lessons that Korea, Singapore, Vietnam had learned from previous epidemics were well implemented. And they acted quicker. I think the UK was slow to put in place testing, to put in place extra clinical capacity, and to make sure that healthcare workers were protected with PPE. And as a result, subsequent events led to the epidemic taking off in a way in the UK which was not the same as in Korea, Germany, or even Singapore and Vietnam.” Farrar said the UK should have significantly increased testing in January and February. Instead, it took the decision that there was too much transmission of the virus in the community and went for lockdown instead. “In retrospect, I think that was a mistake,” he said.
That had been the advice of the WHO and it was what Germany, South Korea, Singapore and Vietnam had done – countries that have suffered fewer deaths. “That would have been a better option, to ramp up the testing in February,” he said. “It goes back to my comment about the eight weeks in January and February, when I think there was not enough urgency. And if I again now look back on my time on the Sage committee, I regret that Sage wasn’t more blunt in its advice and wasn’t more robust.” But it was not in Sage’s remit to hold anybody to account, he said."
2020-07-21T15:00:47Z,politics,Politics,UK civil servants fear press office centralisation could 'undermine democracy',"Civil servants have questioned whether sweeping plans to centralise government communications could serve to “undermine democracy”, an internal document shared with the Guardian has revealed. In a dramatic overhaul of civil service press offices, social media teams, designers and campaigners, the UK government’s 4,500 communications staff will be reduced to about 30 per department – and have each of them working for a central employer instead of the department they work with. Many of the civil servants affected by the proposals, which the leaked document states have been signed off by Boris Johnson himself, first learned of them from media reports earlier this month. In the wake of discontent following that, the Government Communication Service (GCS) prepared a 14-page report of frequently asked questions responding to concerns. One of these asked: “Does the new structure centralise power, and does this undermine democracy?” The response gave some general assurances before dismissing the central concern with the implication that the proposals could not be undemocratic because they originated from the prime minister. “The single employer model aims to ensure better coordination, greater efficiency and effectiveness and unified, excellent professional standards and practice,” it stated. “This approach has been mandated by the PM who of course was democratically elected.”
Increasing central control of communications is seen as further evidence of No 10’s increasingly controversial attempts to extend its political control over the civil service, as most dramatically manifested in the recent departure of Mark Sedwill as cabinet secretary and the departure of other permanent secretaries in major government departments. Though proposals for centralising government communications have been in circulation since 2014, the briefing to civil servants notes that “the PM’s personal backing now means this is the time to bring this into being”. Beyond this assurance, the document offers little in the way of detail for communications staff, who have been told to expect to operate under the new centralised model by April 2021. The civil servants were told the GCS was “unable to confirm” whether existing teams would be kept together, whether they would get any say over which campaigns or policy areas they work on, or details on how the process would work. Instead, the closing section of the staff briefing tackles the communications fiasco of staff learning about seismic changes to the nature of their roles through the media, rather than through official channels. “The timing of the announcement on 6 July wasn’t of GCS’s making, and we apologise that you did not hear about it first through GCS,” it notes apologetically. “The timing isn’t what we would have wanted and certainly is not how we advise into our organisations. “We know this has caused a lot of hurt and anger among many. From here on, we’re now trying to repair that and actually practise what of course we know about good comms.” Another questioner in the document asked: “Did you know No 10 was talking to the Times prior to publication, and if you did, what steps did you take to inform directors of communication?” The response notes: “This announcement was not as we would have wished. This announcement was made the night before publication. Directors of communication were rung as soon as we knew this.” The document also tried to reassure staff on the high quality of government communications work during recent crises, with one answer noting that “we have done, and continue to do, incredible work on Covid”, and another in response to asking why efforts have not been recognised and valued stating: “The prime minister and government have been pleased, impressed and proud by what we’ve achieved. There is plenty of evidence of the success of GCS and our communicators. Examples like our work through Covid-19, EU transition and other major programmes are, genuinely, applauded and appreciated.” A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “Moving to a single employer model is a longstanding plan to make government communication more efficient and effective. There will now be a formal civil service process, overseen by a dedicated programme board. There will be full consultation with staff throughout this process.”"
2020-07-21T14:55:11Z,politics,Politics,UK report on Russian interference: key points explained,"After a nine-month delay, much speculation about its contents and attempts by Downing Street to downplay its significance, the Russia report by parliament’s intelligence and security committee has finally been published, investigating the Kremlin’s reach in UK politics. So what does it say? Here are some of the key points: UK government failed to investigate evidence of successful interference in democratic processes The inquiry did not seek to assess the impact of Russia’s alleged attempts to influence the 2016 EU referendum, and the report explains that it would be “difficult – if not impossible” to do so. It says: “However, it is important to establish whether a hostile state took deliberate action with the aim of influencing a UK democratic process, irrespective of whether it was successful or not.” The committee was not able to do so, the report states, because there was no attempt by the government or intelligence services to investigate. In a section about the referendum, the report says: “The written evidence provided to us appeared to suggest that HMG [Her Majesty’s government] had not seen or sought evidence of successful interference in UK democratic processes or any activity that has had a material impact on an election, for example influencing results.” It further indicates that open-source material, including studies of attempts to influence the referendum using the Russian media outlets RT and Sputnik or social media campaigns, “was not fully taken into account”. In contrast with America’s handling of allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, where there was an intelligence community assessment, the report states: “We have not been provided with any post-referendum assessment of Russian attempts at interference.” It adds: “Even if the conclusion of any such assessment were that there was minimal interference, this would nonetheless represent a helpful reassurance to the public that the UK’s democratic processes had remained relatively safe.” ‘Credible open-source commentary’ suggesting Russia sought to influence Scottish independence referendum There has been “credible open source commentary” indicating Russia tried to influence the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, according to the report. In a partially redacted sentence, it says: “However, at the time ***. It appears that *** what some commentators have described as potentially the first post-Soviet Russian interference in a western democratic process. We note that – almost five years on – ***.”
Russian influence in the UK is ‘the new normal’ In a section on Russian expatriates, the report refers to Britain “welcoming oligarchs with open arms”. However, it says the UK government’s building of links with major Russian companies has been counter-productive, “in that it offered ideal mechanisms by which illicit finance could be recycled through what has been referred to as the London ‘laundromat’”. The report damningly concludes: “The money was also invested in extending patronage and building influence across a wide sphere of the British establishment – PR firms, charities, political interests, academia and cultural institutions were all willing beneficiaries of Russian money, contributing to a ‘reputation laundering’ process. In brief, Russian influence in the UK is ‘the new normal’, and there are a lot of Russians with very close links to Putin who are well integrated into the UK business and social scene, and accepted because of their wealth. This level of integration – in ‘Londongrad’ in particular – means that any measures now being taken by the government are not preventive but rather constitute damage limitation.” The report states that Russian links to the UK’s elite provide access to companies and political figures, meaning they have a means for influence. “To a certain extent, this cannot be untangled and the priority now must be to mitigate the risk and ensure that, where hostile activity is uncovered, the tools exist to tackle it at source,” the report states. Links between Russian elite and UK politics Members of the Russian elite closely linked to Vladimir Putin are involved in charitable and political organisations in the UK, putting them in a position to help the Kremlin influence operations, the report says. “Several members of the Russian elite who are closely linked to Putin are identified as being involved with charitable and/or political organisations in the UK, having donated to political parties, with a public profile which positions them to assist Russian influence operations. It is notable that a number of members of the House of Lords have business interests linked to Russia, or work directly for major Russian companies linked to the Russian state – these relationships should be carefully scrutinised, given the potential for the Russian state to exploit them.” Intelligence community ‘took its eye off the ball’ on Russia In a section covering the “allocation of effort”, the report questions whether the intelligence community took its eye off the ball in its response to Russia. It states: “If we consider the Russian threat to have been clearly indicated in 2006 with the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, and then take events such as the annexation of Crimea in 2014 as firmly underlining Russian intent on the global stage, the question is whether the intelligence community should – and could – have reacted more quickly and increased operational effort on Russia. “On figures alone, it could be said that they took their eye off the ball; nevertheless, the heads of MI5, SIS, GCHQ and defence intelligence all sought to defend against this suggestion.” UK’s paper-and-pencil voting system makes direct interference harder The UK’s voting system is “largely sound”, with the paper-based approach making it more difficult to influence, according to the report. It says: “In terms of the direct threat to elections, we have been informed that the mechanics of the UK’s voting system are deemed largely sound: the use of a highly dispersed, paper-based voting and counting system makes any significant interference difficult, and we understand that GCHQ has undertaken a great deal of work to help ensure that the online voter registration system is safe.” Work is being undertaken “nonetheless” by GCHQ to mitigate any risks to the voting system. Defending UK’s democratic processes is a ‘hot potato’ No one organisation in the UK recognises itself as having an overall lead on defending the UK’s democratic processes, and the report says “discourse has appeared to be something of a ‘hot potato’”. It says: “Whilst we understand the nervousness around any suggestion that the intelligence and security agencies might be involved in democratic processes – certainly a fear that is writ large in other countries – that cannot apply when it comes to the protection of those processes. And without seeking in any way to imply that DCMS [Department for Culture, Media and Sport] is not capable, or that the Electoral Commission is not a staunch defender of democracy, it is a question of scale and access. “DCMS is a small Whitehall policy department and the Electoral Commission is an arm’s length body; neither is in the central position required to tackle a major hostile state threat to our democracy. Protecting our democratic discourse and processes from hostile foreign interference is a central responsibility of government, and should be a ministerial priority.” The operation role should sit primarily with MI5, the report says. Social media companies, “which hold the key”, are “failing to play their part”, the report says. “The government must now seek to establish a protocol with the social media companies to ensure that they take covert hostile-state use of their platforms seriously, and have clear timescales within which they commit to removing such material.” The report calls on the government to “name and shame” those who fail to act. Errors in Salisbury poisoning and weapons watchdog hack do not diminish Moscow threat Mistakes by Russian operatives in the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, and the attempted hacking of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in 2018, may demonstrate that the country’s intelligence services are “not infallible”, the report notes. But it adds: “It would be foolhardy to think that they are any less dangerous because of these mistakes.” The report says it is likely Russian intelligence will “learn from their errors”, becoming “more difficult to detect and protect against as a result”. New legislation needed to replace outdated spy laws The report calls for new legislation to replace the outdated Official Secrets Act, which it says is not fit for purpose. Current legislation enabling action against foreign spies is “acknowledged to be weak”, the report says, adding: “In particular, the Official Secrets Acts are out of date – crucially, it is not illegal to be a foreign agent in this country.” The report states: “We recognise the need to get legislation right. Nevertheless, it is very clear that the Official Secrets Act regime is not fit for purpose and the longer this goes unrectified, the longer the intelligence community’s hands are tied. It is essential that there is a clear commitment to bring forward new legislation to replace it (and a timetable within which it will be introduced) that can be used by MI5 to defend the UK against agents of a hostile foreign power such as Russia.” The report highlights that unexplained wealth orders, introduced recently to tackle criminal activities, may not be that useful in relation to the Russian elite, citing practical issues around their use. It also “strongly” supports the National Crime Agency’s suggested amendments to the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018, such as including serious and organised crime as grounds for introducing sanctions. The report also calls for the Computer Misuse Act to be updated to reflect modern use of personal electronic devices."
2020-07-21T10:54:35Z,politics,Politics,Russia report reveals UK government failed to investigate Kremlin interference,"The British government and intelligence agencies failed to conduct any proper assessment of Kremlin attempts to interfere with the 2016 Brexit referendum, according to the long-delayed Russia report. The damning conclusion is contained within the 50-page document from parliament’s intelligence and security committee, which said ministers in effect turned a blind eye to allegations of Russian disruption. It said the government “had not seen or sought evidence of successful interference in UK democratic processes” at the time, and it made clear that no serious effort was made to do so. “The report reveals that no one in government knew if Russia interfered in or sought to influence the referendum because they did not want to know,” said Stewart Hosie, a Scottish National party MP who sits on the cross-party committee. “The UK Government have actively avoided looking for evidence that Russia interfered. We were told that they hadn’t seen any evidence, but that is meaningless if they hadn’t looked for it.” The committee, which scrutinises the work of Britain’s spy agencies, said: “We have not been provided with any post-referendum assessment of Russian attempts at interference”. It contrasted the response with that of the US.
“This situation is in stark contrast to the US handling of allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, where an intelligence community assessment was produced within two months of the vote, with an unclassified summary being made public.” Committee members said they could not definitively conclude whether the Kremlin had or had not successfully interfered in the referendum that led to the UK quitting the European Union because no effort had been made to find out. “Even if the conclusion of any such assessment were that there was minimal interference, this would nonetheless represent a helpful reassurance to the public that the UK’s democratic processes had remained relatively safe,” said the report. After the government immediately rebuffed calls for a full investigation, Labour last night accused it of failing in its response to the security threat posed to UK democracy by Russia. Speaking ahead of an urgent question in parliament on Wednesday, the shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said that “on every level, the government’s response does not appear to be equal to the threat”. “This report outlines the scale of the shortcomings of the government’s response to maintaining our national security in the face of what is clearly a growing and significant threat from Russia,” he said. Drawn up by a cross-party committee of MPs and peers, the report is the product of 18 months’ work involving evidence taken from the UK’s spy agencies and independent experts. Although its long-delayed version is heavily redacted, the thrust of its conclusions – that insufficient attention has been paid to Russian infiltration in British politics and public life – was clear. Committee members noted that publicly available studies have pointed to “the preponderance of pro-Brexit or anti-EU stories” on the Russia Today and Sputnik TV channels at the time of the vote, and “the use of ‘bots’ and ‘trolls’” on Twitter, as evidence of Russian attempts to influence the process. There was “credible open source commentary” that Russia undertook “influence campaigns” relating to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, but despite this, no effort was made to look at the Kremlin threat to British democracy until after the Brexit vote. It was only after Russia hacked US Democratic party emails in July 2016 that any assessment appeared to have been made – and the document suggests that some sort of exercise was conducted after the 2017 general election. “Had the relevant parts of the intelligence community conducted a similar threat assessment prior to the referendum, it is inconceivable that they would not have reached the same conclusion as to Russian intent, which might then have led them to take action to protect the process,” the report added.
An official UK government response said: “We have seen no evidence of successful interference in the EU referendum,” and added that there was no need to launch an inquiry because Britain’s spy agencies made “regular assessments” of the Russian threat. “Given this long-standing approach, a retrospective assessment of the EU referendum is not necessary,” it said. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab rejected claims the government had “actively” sought not to delve deeper into the perceived threat of Russian interference. “We’ve got a long period recognising the enduring, significant threat posed by Russia to the UK, including in cyber. Russia is a top national security priority,” he said. But Hosie was scathing about the refusal by both Boris Johnson and Theresa May to look at Kremlin interference in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. “No one wanted to test this issue with a 10ft bargepole,” he said, adding that it was an “outrage” the report was not published before last December’s election. Downing Street “took its eye off the ball” over the Russian threat, the MP said, it underestimated the response required and was still trying to play “catch-up”. Britain has also become “a favourable destination for Russian oligarchs and their money”, observed the committee, concluding they had become a corrupting force in British public life through their connections. Citing no names, it also warned that it was “notable that a number of members of the House of Lords have business interests linked to Russia, or work directly for major Russian companies linked to the Russian state”. Marina Litvinenko, whose husband, Alexander, was murdered in 2006 in London by Kremlin assassins, said she was “very pleased” by the report, and its mention of Russian oligarchs making political donations. She said the report demonstrated there was ample evidence of the threat posed by the Kremlin to the UK. “The government has no excuse for being naive. After what happened to my husband in 2006 and to Sergei Skripal in 2018 there are no excuses. There are too many suspicious deaths.” Ministers had long claimed there were “no successful examples” of Kremlin interference in British politics but abandoned that position last week when Raab, the blamed “Russian actors” for spreading an illegally obtained dossier relating to US-UK trade talks that eventually ended up in the hands of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn during the election campaign. Committee members complained that when they asked for written evidence from MI5 at the start of their inquiry about possible interference in the Brexit vote, the domestic spy agency “initially provided just six lines of text”. The report was completed last October, but was sat on by Johnson before the general election and only declassified and cleared for release by the prime minister in December. It could not be released until No 10 had nominated Conservative members to the committee, although its nominee for the chair, Chris Grayling, was ambushed by opposition members who voted instead for Julian Lewis. Lewis then had the Conservative whip removed, but the newly independent MP was unrepentant as the report was published, accusing Downing Street of politicising the oversight of the intelligence agencies. “This committee has been subject to unprecedented delay and dislocation. this must never happen again. the sooner normal relations are established between this government and the committee, the better for all concerned,” the committee chair said. Russian officials angrily protested the conclusions of the report, accusing the UK of taking a “leading role in Russophobia” and claimed it cleared Moscow of attempts to influence the 2016 Brexit referendum. “The charges are once again unfounded, unsubstantiated and unconvincing,” said Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the foreign affairs committee of Russia’s federation council, a lawmaking body, in written remarks on Tuesday."
2020-07-21T10:30:00Z,politics,Politics,Calls for inquiry into Tory MP Rob Roberts accused of asking intern to 'fool around',"Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for the Conservatives to suspend Delyn MP Rob Roberts, while an investigation is carried out into allegations he propositioned an intern. BBC Wales reported that Roberts, who was elected in the north Wales constituency of Delyn last year, sent text messages to the 21-year-old woman asking her to “fool around” with him. In the messages, as published by the BBC, Roberts told the intern: “Don’t ignore me when I’m making you feel better,” before suggesting she might want to “fool around with no strings, you might come and visit me in London.” He told her he “might be gay but I enjoy … fun times”. The woman had told the MP she was struggling with her mental health and was in an “awful state”, according to the messages. Roberts responded: “I was just thinking about fun times … Maybe if you thought of them too it might help you.” The woman told BBC Wales the messages made her feel “incredibly sick”. “I had had one of the worst days ever, and then I messaged him saying: ‘I’m crying, I’m not OK’, and his solution to that was to proposition me,” she said. A Conservative party spokesperson said there was an “ongoing” investigation into Roberts’ conduct. “While Mr Roberts has apologised for his behaviour and has been undertaking safeguarding and social media protection training, we are clear such conduct is completely unacceptable,” the spokesperson said. It is understood Roberts had already been rebuked by the Tory party chair, after a previous incident. However, acting Lib Dem leader Ed Davey, said Roberts should have the whip removed, while the investigation is carried out. “These are incredibly serious allegations that cannot just be brushed under the carpet. Women must be able to work in politics and know that it is a safe place for them. “The Conservative party must immediately remove the party whip while they urgently investigate, or they risk sending the message that they view this behaviour as acceptable conduct for a sitting Conservative MP.” The Labour MP for Gower, Tonia Antoniazzi, said: “The allegations about Rob Roberts are very concerning and should be investigated. Worryingly, these are not the first serious accusations of this nature that have been made against him in his seven months as a Tory MP.” Roberts has previously admitted propositioning a different member of staff, who subsequently changed job, and admitted the request had been “inappropriate”. He was also the subject of controversy when police broke up a party at his family home during lockdown, although he insisted he was in London at the time. Antoniazzi said: “Last week the Tory party showed they could remove the whip from an MP within hours when motivated to do so. Given the nature of the evidence against Mr Roberts, it is unclear why he still holds the Tory whip.” A Conservative party spokesperson said: “Our party takes all allegations extremely seriously and has safeguarding and complaints processes in place to investigate complaints made to it under the party’s code of conduct.” Roberts has been approached for comment."
2020-07-21T05:00:34Z,politics,Politics,Asylum seeker to sue Home Office after falling ill with Covid-19,"An asylum seeker who became infected with Covid-19 after an outbreak in his accommodation – despite assurances from the Home Office that he would not be at risk from the virus there – is taking legal action against the government. Public health officials have confirmed an outbreak of Covid-19 at Urban House in Wakefield, where more than 20 people are known to have contracted the virus. The man, from Eritrea, whose claim for asylum is based on his account that he fled persecution in his home country and survived torture and trafficking on his journey through Sudan and Libya trying to reach the UK, is bringing the legal action against the Home Office for failing to protect him from the coronavirus. His lawyers wrote to the Home Office on 15 April expressing fears that he and others were at risk of contracting Covid-19 in Urban House due to overcrowded conditions including room sharing, a lack of social distancing and meals being eaten in a communal dining room. A Home Office official responded: “While I can understand your client may feel concerned about his health, it is not accepted that the current practices in Urban House, guided as they are by up-to-date expert medical advice, are placing him or any other resident at risk of contracting Covid.” The asylum seeker spoke to the Guardian from a hotel he had been moved to by the Home Office to isolate him after he began to experience symptoms. “I was so scared in Urban House and believed I was at risk of catching Covid-19 because of the bad and overcrowded conditions there. I have been very ill with Covid but now I’m starting to feel better,” he said. He added that although asylum seekers are supposed to be placed in Urban House for only a few weeks, he had been there for approximately four months. “Many of us in Urban House have been asking for transfers. It is too crowded there. Covid has really weakened us and we fear we could pick up another infection if we are sent back there,” he said. The legal action against the Home Office argues that officials’ failure to house him in suitable accommodation was unlawful and resulted in him contracting Covid-19. The Home Office contractor for Urban House is Mears. New asylum seeker accommodation contracts came into force in September last year. A National Audit Office report revealed that in the first four months of the contract, Mears was fined £3.1m by the government for various failures. An academy of Medical Sciences report published last week warned that further Covid-19 outbreaks were likely in places such as asylum seeker accommodation. Isabella Kirwan, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, representing the man bringing the action, said: “Residents of Urban House are at grave risk of contracting Covid-19. It is clear that they are unable to properly protect themselves in conditions that are manifestly unsafe. The Home Office has yet again failed an extremely vulnerable group of individuals.” Graham O’Neill, of the Scottish Refugee Council, who is monitoring asylum seeker accommodation across the UK, expressed concern that safeguarding vulnerable people was not one of the key performance indicators for Home Office contractors in asylum accommodation. “Any public service is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable,” he said. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The safety and wellbeing of asylum seekers and the local communities in which they live is of utmost importance. We have put in place a range of measures to specifically support asylum seekers affected by the pandemic.” A Mears spokesperson said steps had been taken to reduce the number of asylum seekers in Urban House, which was now operating at half capacity to end room sharing and allow social distancing. The spokesperson added that cleaning was maintained for all areas and the company could not comment on fines incurred as its contract was commercially confidential."
2020-07-20T21:00:24Z,politics,Politics,"Care services must now be nationalised, says John McDonnell","John McDonnell has called for the urgent nationalisation of care services in response to the coronavirus pandemic, warning that years of underfunding have put older and disabled people at heightened risk from a second surge in infections this winter. In his first significant intervention since stepping down as shadow chancellor earlier this year, McDonnell said fixing Britain’s long-running crisis in social care should be a top priority of government as Covid-19 exposes severe frailties in the system. Throwing his weight behind growing cross-party calls to establish a national social care service, he will use a speech on Wednesday to say: “With another spike in the virus highly possible, it’s time to act decisively and create the caring services we need. “We need the urgent nationalisation of care to establish the National Care and Support Service alongside the NHS.” His intervention comes amid growing concern over Covid-19 infections and deaths in care homes and after the Tory peer Ros Altmann said nationalising the social care sector could be required in response to the crisis. The head of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens, has warned that plans to reform the social care sector need to be in place within a year amid intense pressure on the sector. Boris Johnson has said the government is finalising plans to fix social care funding, after promising a solution in the 2019 Tory manifesto, although he is coming under mounting pressure to act after almost a year in charge as prime minister. McDonnell is expected to say that nationalising the care sector would finish the task of the postwar Labour government, which created the NHS in 1948, in a speech to mark the 75th anniversary on Sunday of the Attlee government taking office. The influential backbench Labour MP and former leading figure on Jeremy Corbyn’s opposition front bench will say the Attlee government took the health service into public ownership despite a national debt pile following the second world war more than twice the size of the UK’s current debt mountain. “In the ruins of the second world war, with debt far higher than today, they didn’t offer a meal deal. They founded the NHS, created the welfare state, built council homes and nationalised one third of industry,” he will say.
The veteran Labour MP will make the speech to mark the launch of a new campaign vehicle to set out a socialist vision for a post-Covid-19 economy, as part of his work from the backbenches as a senior figure on the Labour left. The “Claim the Future” project will bring together policy experts and campaigners, with McDonnell launching the group alongside the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, the leading economist Jayati Ghosh, Asad Rehman, the executive director of the War on Want charity, and Tina Ngata, environment and human rights campaigner."
2020-07-20T19:11:02Z,politics,Politics,Psycho Raab confused at being the biggest dove in the Commons on China | John Crace,"Sometimes you just can’t win. Just a week after announcing he was barring Huawei from the UK’s 5G network by 2027 – the Chinese had apparently promised they wouldn’t do any spying in the next seven years – Dominic Raab was back in the Commons to make yet another ministerial statement. This time to indefinitely suspend the extradition treaty with Hong Kong and to impose an arms embargo on the territory. Try to think of it as “tough love”, the foreign secretary insisted. If we didn’t adore the Chinese so much and admire their progress this century then we wouldn’t be making such a fuss. But now we had such high expectations of them, it was only right that we submit China to the same level of scrutiny as we would any other country. Apart from the ones with appalling records of human rights abuses from which we made a small fortune flogging arms. Those could all be safely overlooked. “The UK is watching,” Raab said grandly, the vein in his neck throbbing with intent. Somehow he manages to look even more terrifying when he’s trying to sound reasonable than when he’s going full-on psycho. He had liaised on these sanctions with the UK’s Five Eyes partners and was hoping to achieve the same level of coordination with European allies. If only there was an organisation uniting 27 European countries that the UK could join, then it would have been a whole lot easier. Typical Europe. Never there when you really need it. Yet despite Raab’s best efforts to take a tough line with China, it still wasn’t enough to satisfy MPs from both sides of the house. Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, damned him with faint praise. Dom had taken some decent first baby steps, the Labour MP said, but there was so much more he could have done. If the UK was so worried about Chinese involvement in sensitive areas affecting national security, then how come we were letting them build a couple of nuclear power stations for us? Raab stuck his fingers in his ears and pretended he hadn’t heard. Nandy was also surprised the government wasn’t more bothered about China’s treatment of the Uighur Muslims and wanted to know why Magnitsky sanctions had not been taken out against some known individual offenders. Raab ummed and ahhed. It was all very difficult. No one cared more about the persecution – genocide was a terribly ugly word – of an ethnic minority than him. However, you also had to remember that China was the world’s second most powerful economy and so for the time being he would prefer to give it the benefit of the doubt. But he was definitely keeping an eye on the situation. This rather set the tone for the rest of the session. Conservative Tom Tugendhat chalked up the sanctions as a win for the foreign affairs select committee, which he coincidentally chairs, and wondered if Raab might care to consider some of its other, more hawkish, recommendations in relation to China. Others weren’t quite so keen to credit Tugendhat as they rather fancied taking some of the plaudits for the hardening of the line themselves. But a consistent theme emerged. It wasn’t sinophobic to take action against China’s human rights abuses and to be concerned about the Uighurs: it was what any decent country would do. By the end, Raab appeared somewhat bemused. It’s not every day he is the biggest dove in the chamber and you could sense him longing to go berserk and impose any number of sanctions on the Chinese. Just as a matter of macho pride. But he just about held it together till the close, though you wouldn’t bet against a pile of corpses being found in the Thames tomorrow morning as Raab tries to exorcise his pent-up frustration. Recess can’t come too soon for Dom. The same could also be said for Matt Hancock, who was also forced into making a Commons statement following Boris Johnson’s rather optimistic Santa Claus press conference last week saying the UK would basically be back to normal in time for Christmas. Presumably the prime minister still hasn’t got round to reading the report from the Academy of Medical Sciences that suggested the country could be facing a further 120,000 deaths over the course of the winter. Mattbeth looked defeated from the start as he tried to channel Boris’s mindless optimism. The track-and-trace system was working brilliantly because it had managed to track down 180,000 while missing an equal number of contacts. Realising that was the only even vaguely good news on offer, Hancock tried to claim the early reported successes of the Oxford and Imperial vaccine trials as a triumph for the government, rather than for the scientists. “We have a plan and it is working,” he said, fooling no one but himself.
There was a time when Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, used to do his best to boost Hancock’s confidence by offering him emotional support from the dispatch box. “You’re doing really well Matt. Honestly.” But even Ashworth hasn’t been able to keep up that level of encouragement in the face of repeated government incompetence, and so this time he just let rip with a long dose of honesty. The track-and-trace numbers were crap. The app was non-existent. Local authorities weren’t getting the data they needed. The government had ignored Sage advice. The chief nursing officer had been silenced by the government for not giving the thumbs up to Dominic Cummings’ Durham safari. There was no plan in place other than waiting on a miracle of a vaccine appearing. Wasn’t it time to level with the public? Over the last few weeks, Mattbeth has been getting progressively more tetchy. He’s done his best but it hasn’t been good enough. And even his best efforts have been undermined by Boris. He knows the government has been found out yet cannot bring himself to admit it. Because if he did then he might need to ask himself why he doesn’t have the self-worth to resign. Instead, time and again he allows himself to be trampled on. Hancock couldn’t contain himself. Rather than answer the questions, he attacked Ashworth for no longer being supportive. Just like Boris, he now mistakes reasonable scrutiny for a personal attack. The MPs in the chamber kept their heads down, trying to avoid making eye contact with the health secretary. It’s never comfortable to watch a minister breaking down in public."
2020-07-20T18:29:38Z,politics,Politics,Tory rebels are far from finished in push for tougher China policy,"When Mike Pompeo meets a group of Conservative backbench MPs on Tuesday who have been pressing for the UK to take a harder line on China, it will not be for a victory lap as some in Downing Street might hope. The hawkish US secretary of state wants to encourage the Conservative rebels to keep pushing for Britain to go further than banning Huawei from 5G phone networks and suspending the extradition treaty with Hong Kong. Not they need much encouragement. There are no shortage of Tory backbenchers who want further diplomatic and economic restrictions on Beijing, a cause espoused so keenly by former Brexiters such as David Davis and more centrist MPs such as Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, that they sometimes compete among themselves. “There are multiple issues we need to push ahead with as part a general China reassessment and we are keen that the government continues to move,” said Bob Seely, who helped organise a bloc of 50 MPs in a year-long campaign to demand that Huawei be blocked from future 5G networks. Top of the list now are calls for China to be barred from involvement in building nuclear power stations, whether as a minority investor in Hinckley Point, in Somerset, or as a prime contractor, as in the case of a proposed project at Bradwell in Essex. Others want a review of Beijing’s impact on UK higher education. More than 120,000 Chinese attend British universities, making a critical contribution to their funding, but there remains concern about China’s involvement in UK research in areas such as facial recognition and cryptography. The climate is changing so fast that Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory party leader, even called on Monday for a ban on TikTok, the popular video sharing app, “because of its proximity to Chinese intelligence services” – a point that defenders of the company have argued makes little sense given it is a home for “short, homemade videos”. But it is hard to escape the conviction that China policy is being driven by the Conservative backbenchers – many looking for a grand cause after winning the Brexit argument – in alliance with an aggressive, trade-obsessed White House. “Like a lot of countries, we are flapping in the wind,” said a political adviser who worked under Theresa May’s premiership. “But if Dominic Cummings wouldn’t let IDS run the Brexit campaign, why would he let him set the policy on China?” The hawks’ position has been helped by the crisis in Hong Kong, where China’s decision to impose a draconian national security law and in effect end the “one country, two systems” model has helped ensure there is Labour and other opposition support for a tougher line. Concerns loom large across the political spectrum about the brutal treatment of China’s Uighur Muslim minority, where there are reports of mass enforced sterilisation and detainment in “re-education camps”. Confronted with drone footage of blindfolded and shackled prisoners on the BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, tried to imply it amounted to a “fake accusation” and then that there may have been “single cases” of mistreatment. In the Commons on Monday, Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, was quick to support her opposite number, Dominic Raab, when he announced the suspension of the extradition treaty. “This must mark the start of a more strategic approach to China based on an ethical approach to foreign policy,” she said. Meanwhile, China defenders have almost evaporated, even though it is less than five years since David Cameron and George Osborne were plugging a new “golden era” in Chinese-British relations and encouraging companies such as Huawei and China General Nuclear to invest in the UK. Business lobby groups say there are now genuine worries that China could hit back with targeted restrictions on British business and multinationals such as GlaxoSmithKline and Rolls-Royce. But one business source added: “Nobody wants to speak out at the moment.” It is an astonishing change in sentiment in little more than a few months, partly fuelled by the impact of the coronavirus crisis. That revealed how the extent to which the UK and other western countries are dependent on Chinese manufacturing and trade – including in areas such as the supply of paracetamol and other drugs and the manufacture of personal protective equipment. Tim Summers, a senior consulting fellow on the Asia-Pacific programme at Chatham House, csaid: “There is not much nuance in the argument at the moment.” He added: “It seems to have got to the point where there are worries about the supply of plastic gloves, when the reality was that the NHS didn’t stockpile enough before the pandemic hit.” A letter signed by 17 Conservative backbenchers two days ago that called for the UK to suspend extradition arrangements with Hong Kong was only three paragraphs long and emotively argued. “We are all going to have to ask ourselves if we recognise the Chinese Communist party’s definitions of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion,” it read. There is little doubt that there is more to come, and there are even growing predictions of a decoupling between the west and China as countries such as the UK are forced to chose between a US-led bloc and a far eastern one, although there would be economic costs in doing so. China was the UK’s sixth-ranked destination for good and services, accounting for 3.6% of the total, while Chinese companies have made investments in the UK that have been welcomed by ministers, such as the purchase and rescue of British Steel and its plant in Scunthorpe by Jingye Group in March, which helped to protect 3,000 jobs. Veerle Nouwens, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said: “It is important for the UK to draw red lines around issues such as human rights.

2020-07-20T18:11:15Z,politics,Politics,MPs call for overhaul of China policy after UK suspends Hong Kong extraditions,"Conservative MPs and Labour are calling for the wholesale overhaul of relations with China after the government suspended extradition with Hong Kong and banned the export of riot control equipment following Beijing’s imposition of a sweeping national security law on the territory. Announcing the measures to the Commons, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, stressed the desire for continued cooperation with China, but said the actions were “a reasonable and proportionate response” to the law, which effectively criminalises most political dissent. The move, a week after the British government stripped the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei of any future role in the UK’s 5G network, seems certain to further enrage Beijing. Speaking before Raab’s announcement, China’s foreign ministry said it would be a mistake to suspend the extradition treaty and urged the UK “to take no more steps down the wrong path”. While Raab’s decisions were welcomed by both Labour and Conservative MPs, the foreign secretary faced calls to take more robust action, particularly over the mass repression of the Uighur population in China’s Xinjiang province which rights groups warn amounts to cultural genocide. A series of Tories who had long called for action over Huawei said the government must begin what Tobias Ellwood, a former Foreign Office and defence minister, called “a strategic overhaul of our foreign policy in relation to China”. “For decades we’ve turned a blind eye to China’s democratic deficit and human rights violations, in the hope that it would mature into a global, responsible citizen,” he told Raab. “That clearly hasn’t happened. Is this now the turning point where we drop the pretence that China shares our values?” In his statement, Raab said he was particularly worried about sections of the national security law that allowed mainland Chinese authorities to take control of cases and target actions outside of Hong Kong.
Saying this was a serious violation of the agreement that set out Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous status after the handover to China in 1997, Raab said extradition would be stopped unless Beijing gave “clear and robust safeguards” about how the law would be used. The UK does not have an extradition agreement with mainland China. The UK is also extending to Hong Kong an arms embargo that has covered mainland China since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, including a bar on equipment that could be used for crowd control, such as shackles and smoke grenades. Raab said: “We want to work with China. There is enormous scope for positive, constructive, engagement. But, as we strive for that positive relationship, we are also clear-sighted about the challenges that lie ahead.” Britain has already promised that up to 3 million Hong Kong residents will be offered the chance to settle in the UK and a path to permanent citizenship.Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, said she supported the measures, but called for action in areas such as Chinese investment in UK nuclear power stations, and a more generous approach in allowing entry to Hong Kong nationals, particularly younger people who were less likely to hold British National (Overseas) passports. “This must mark the start of a more strategic approach to China based on an ethical approach to foreign policy, and an end to the naivety of the golden era years,” she said, referring to the close links forged under David Cameron. “And if it does, he can be assured he will have our full support on this side of the house.” Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee and has been a leading advocate for tougher action against China, told Raab he welcomed the statement, but added: “Given his time before even entering here as a human rights lawyer, can I just ask why he hasn’t yet made an announcement on the abuse of the Uighur Muslim population in western China?” Bob Seely, the Tory MP who was a leading critic of Huawei’s role in the UK, told Raab he welcomed the actions over Hong Kong, but said: “The signal truth is the China we hoped for is not the China we are getting.” He added that a “much more significant reset in our relations” was needed. The government is expected to face continued pressure over the issue, particularly with decisions looming over Chinese involvement in nuclear reactors at Bradwell in Essex and Sizewell in Suffolk. As well as Hong Kong, there has been an upsurge in condemnation of Chinese actions in Xinjiang, where there is evidence of the use of mass internment camps, and there are claims Uighur women are undergoing forced sterilisation to reduce their population. Speaking during a visit to a school on Monday, Boris Johnson said such issues were deeply worrying but that he was “not going to be pushed into a position of becoming a knee-jerk sinophobe on every issue”. The president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews has written to China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, citing “similarities” between Chinese treatment of Uighurs and Nazi atrocities. Marie van der Zyl wrote: “Nobody could ... fail to notice the similarities between what is alleged to be happening in China today and what happened in Nazi Germany 75 years ago. ... The world will neither forgive nor forget a genocide against the Uighur people.”
The UK government is considering whether to take action under so-called Magnitsky laws against individual Chinese officials over the situation in Xinjiang."
2020-07-20T17:38:11Z,politics,Politics,Chief nurse was dropped from briefings after refusing to back Cummings,"England’s chief nurse has confirmed she was dropped from the Downing Street daily coronavirus briefing after refusing to back Dominic Cummings. Ruth May said that in a trial run for the 1 June briefing, she was asked about Boris Johnson’s chief adviser’s decision to drive his family from London to Durham during lockdown while his wife had suspected Covid-19. After she failed to back Cummings, she said, she was told she was no longer needed for the televised press conference taking place later that day, and she was never given an explanation why. Ministers and No 10 have denied reports that May was stood down over Cummings. Aides to the prime minister briefed journalists at the time that she may not have made it to the briefing because she could have been stuck in traffic. Appearing before MPs on the House of Commons public accounts committee on Monday, May said she had attended preparations for the briefing and was told she was no longer needed, without explanation. “It is indeed true I was dropped from the briefing, but that happened to many of my colleagues as well,” she said.
Asked if she was questioned in a trial run before the briefing about her views on Cummings’ behaviour during lockdown, May said: “We talk about lots of these preparations questions and of course I was asked about lockdown and rules to lockdown.” Asked by the committee chair, Meg Hillier, for her views on Cummings’ behaviour and whether it was a breach of the rules, May said: “In my opinion the rules were clear. They were there for everyone’s safety and they applied to us all.” She added: “I don’t know why I was dropped from the briefing, you would have to ask other people.” In May’s absence on 1 June, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, presented the daily slides on Covid-19 alongside Prof John Newton from Public Health England. Appearing before the Commons on Monday, Hancock was asked by his Labour shadow, Jonathan Ashworth: “Did he really acquiesce in the silencing of the chief nursing officer at the height of this pandemic?” Hancock did not respond to the question. On 12 June, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, told the daily briefing that May had not been blocked from attending. He said: “I don’t think it is true,” before adding that he was “sure she’ll be back here again”. Scientific and medical experts who appeared at other briefings alongside a politician were initially reluctant to get involved in the row surrounding Cummings, who while in Durham also made a 60-mile round trip to a beauty spot, which he said was to test his eyesight before a longer journey back to London. On 28 May, Johnson tried to prevent the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, from answering questions on the subject, before Whitty said that neither he nor Vallance wished to comment on politics. However, on 30 May, England’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, caused embarrassment for the government by saying, in response to a question about the alleged lockdown breach: “In my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear. In my opinion they are for the benefit of all. In my opinion they apply to all.” Responding to May’s comments, Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat leadership candidate, said the incident suggested ministers were “happy to silence the science when it suits them”. Downing Street has not responded to a request for comment."

2020-07-20T15:23:02Z,politics,Politics,Government's catch-up fund for English school pupils comes under fire,"The government’s Covid-19 catch-up fund for pupils in England is “badly targeted” and unlikely to prevent a further widening of the attainment gap between children from poor backgrounds and their wealthier classmates, according to critics. The Education Policy Institute (EPI) said that even before the pandemic disadvantaged pupils’ learning lagged 18 months behind by the time they sat their GCSEs, and surveys had shown they were much more likely to have suffered serious learning loss during lockdown. Yet instead of targeting the £650m extra funding where it was most needed, the EPI said the government had allocated the same amount of catch-up funding to schools in affluent areas as to schools in the poorest parts of the country, serving the most disadvantaged pupils. “It is difficult to see the rationale for such a decision,” said the EPI executive chairman, David Laws, “and it means that schools where as many as half or more of children are in poverty won’t have the extra resources they need to pay for interventions that we know can make a difference.” Laws, a former Liberal Democrat MP and a schools minister in the coalition, added: “It is concerning that the government has missed an opportunity to target extra funding to where it is most urgently needed. At a time when social mobility was already in danger of stalling, and with Covid significantly worsening the learning outlook for poor children, today’s decision could prove to be a costly mistake.” The government’s £1bn catch-up package to support pupils who have spent months out of school as a result of the pandemic, is made up of £650m to be shared across state primary and secondary schools across England in the next academic year, as well as £350m for a tutoring scheme which will be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. It was revealed in Schools Week on Monday, however, that almost £100m of that has been shaved off to provide catch-up tutoring for colleges and sixth forms who were left out of the original announcement. On general school funding, the prime minister visiting a school in Kent confirmed increases promised earlier – the second year of a three-year settlement – under which each secondary school in England will attract a minimum of £5,150 per pupil and each primary a minimum of £4,000 under the national funding formula from 2021. Labour’s shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the increases would still leave schools worse off in 2022-23 than when the coalition government came to power in 2010. “Far more must be done for every child to have the opportunity to reach their full potential,” she said. Liberal Democrat Education spokesperson Layla Moran said the Conservatives’ spending plans show no understanding of the challenges facing schools in September. “In the face of this crisis, spending plans announced last year are utterly unfit for purpose. The pandemic requires us to invest in education at all levels on an unprecedented scale.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, also on a school visit, highlighted problems with childcare and a shortage of summer holiday activities for school children in England as parents come under pressure to return to work. He said: “The prime minister has said he wants people to go back to work in August, but he hasn’t provided the childcare and the support and lots of families are going to really struggle. So these next six weeks are really crucial, I think, for parents and also for children.”"
2020-07-20T12:05:22Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson prepares to suspend UK extradition treaty with Hong Kong,"Boris Johnson has all but confirmed that the UK will suspend an extradition treaty with Hong Kong owing to a national security law imposed by Beijing, bringing another clash with China following last week’s decision over Huawei. Speaking on a visit to a school in Kent, Johnson said Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, would explain later on Monday “about how we are going to change our extradition arrangements to reflect our concerns about what’s happening with the security law in Hong Kong”. Raab is due to address the Commons on Monday afternoon and is widely expected to suspend extradition to Hong Kong in light of the law, which effectively criminalises most political dissent and can even target actions outside of Hong Kong or mainland China. The US, Canada and Australia have already taken similar actions over extradition to Hong Kong. Earlier on Monday a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, Wang Wenbin, said such a move by the UK, plus other mooted plans such as actions against individual Chinese officials due to rights abuses, would harm relations between the two countries. “These HK-related remarks turn a blind eye to the basic facts that the national security law is for the sustained success of one China, two systems,” Wang said, referring to the system by which Hong Kong has been governed since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. “We strongly condemn these actions. We urge the UK to take no more steps down the wrong path, so as to avoid further damage to China-UK relations.” The government said last week it would strip the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei of any role in the UK’s 5G network from 2027 owing to security concerns, which also enraged Beijing. Johnson, during the school visit, said he did not seek confrontation with China, but the UK had grave concerns about Hong Kong and widespread reports of mass repression and rights abuses targeting the Uighur population in China’s north-western Xinjiang province. These have included accounts of forced sterilisation of Uighur women and the incarceration of huge numbers of people in what appear to be concentration camps. “There is a balance here,” Johnson said. “I’m not going to be pushed into a position of becoming a knee-jerk Sinophobe on every issue, somebody who is automatically anti-China. But we do have serious concerns. We have concerns about the treatment of the Uighur minority obviously, about the human rights abuses. He added: “China is a giant factor of geopolitics, it’s going to be a giant factor in our lives and in the lives of our children and grandchildren. You have got to have a calibrated response and we are going to be tough on some things but also going to continue to engage.”
The UK government is considering whether to take action under so-called Magnitsky laws against individual Chinese officials over the situation in Xinjiang, which rights groups have said shows signs of being a cultural genocide. Interviewed on the BBC on Sunday, China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, insisted the Uighur people live in “peaceful and harmonious coexistence with other ethnic groups”, as he was confronted with footage of shackled prisoners being herded on to trains in Xinjiang. Johnson is under pressure from a number of Conservative backbenchers to take a more robust line over Huawei. On Sunday evening the chair of parliament’s defence select committee, Tobias Ellwood, said Britain has “been duped over the last couple of decades” by China.
He told BBC Radio 4’s Westminster Hour programme: “I really want to see a reset of our entire foreign policy, bearing in mind that we are sliding towards a cold war. We can’t do this on our own, we need to work with our allies. “We turned a blind eye to what was going on with the Uighur population, we turned a blind eye to the uneven trade situation whereby Chinese companies could operate quite liberally within the UK and elsewhere but our companies couldn’t operate within China and now I think it’s time to say enough is enough.” The UK has already promised that up to 3 million Hong Kong residents will be offered the chance to settle in the UK, and a path to permanent citizenship, in the wake of Beijing’s imposition of the national security law on Hong Kong. China will be high on the agenda when Raab meets his US counterpart, Mike Pompeo, in London this week."
2020-07-20T05:00:10Z,politics,Politics,"Financial aid needed for localised lockdowns, says Labour shadow chancellor","The local lockdowns that are key to the government’s strategy for tackling the next phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in England risk failure, unless they are backed with financial aid, says the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds. With parliament set to rise for the summer recess later this week, Dodds is urging Rishi Sunak to make a statement on how he will support firms ordered to shut down, and workers told to stay at home. “If we are to see those localised spikes, we’re saying that there needs to be some kind of package there to support jobs and employment. Unless you have that, you’re going to be risking people’s ability to comply with the guidelines,” she said. She highlighted the fact that the job retention scheme is now closed to new workers; and statutory sick pay, at £95.85 a week, is too low to cover people’s costs – with many workers not even eligible for that. “Already we’re seeing, because of issues around sick pay – the scope of it, the level of it – it could be quite difficult for people if they’re required to self-isolate for an extended period, or if you have those localised lockdowns,” she said. Boris Johnson announced new powers on Friday for rapid local lockdowns to be imposed in England, including the closure of specific sectors, and localised “stay at home“ orders. Dodds warned: “if there is insufficient financial support there, that means they are not as effective as they could be. And that would obviously have a very significant impact on all of us.” She suggested the job retention scheme could be reopened for affected sectors or regions; or local authorities could be allowed to use the discretionary funds allocated to them for fighting the virus, which as it stands, can only be spent in restricted ways.
In a wide-ranging interview, Dodds also: • Said Labour would not support tax rises in the autumn, when Sunak should be focused on growth. • Accused the Conservatives of taking an “ideological” approach to the crisis, drafting in the private sector while squeezing local authority budgets. • Repeated Labour’s call for the job retention scheme to be extended, for the worst-hit sectors. Dodds’ call for targeted financial help is the latest example of Labour’s cautious, methodical approach under Keir Starmer. The lack of radical policy proposals has exasperated some critics on the left of the party. But Dodds said with the nation in the grip of the pandemic, the public want the opposition to be focusing on the crisis, and offering solutions. “I think ultimately the UK has been in a really very very difficult situation. Excess deaths are extremely high compared with many other countries. We know that the economic impact has been also quite severe in the UK – the OECD said it was the worst in the industrialised countries. “So I think quite a lot of people would feel if the Labour party was only criticising, and not suggesting solutions, to get us to a better place, they would question what on earth we were doing. We really do need to fix the problems that continue to exist with our response to the crisis, and that is what we have been trying to do. Dodds sparked a flurry of comment earlier this month after appearing to flirt with the idea of a wealth tax, at an event in the run-up to Sunak’s summer statement – before insisting a couple of days later that now was not the time for increasing the tax burden. That is a message she is keen to repeat and she goes further, suggesting Labour would not be willing to support any tax increases in Sunak’s autumn budget. “I do think where the chancellor needs to be focused right now is on growth above all,” she said. “We’ve had some suggestions that at the budget in the autumn he will be making some changes to national insurance, or income tax or VAT. I think that really wouldn’t be helpful at this stage.” On the issue of whether that meant the autumn would be too early for any tax rises, she said: “Yes, definitely. I think so.” Asked why she was reluctant to put forward specific tax plans, she said that “first of all because we’re quite a long way away from a general election and we do have a policy development process that’s tailored to provide that manifesto. But specifically, I think it’s because we’ve got to have that focus on preventing additional unemployment and maintaining economic capacity. And that’s my absolute overriding concern right now.” The Resolution Foundation thinktank has estimated the budget deficit could hit a record £350bn this year – and Sunak warned MPs last week that “tough choices” lay ahead. The “10 pledges” Starmer made to Labour members during the leadership race included a promise to increase taxes on the top 5%. But party strategists are also extremely wary that specific tax policies could be seized on by the Tories. During the 2019 general election campaign, the Conservatives repeatedly claimed Labour planned to levy a tax on gardens, for example, despite the party having no such policy. (Dodds’s predecessor, John McDonnell, had said he would examine the idea of a stamp duty land tax, levied on property.) Dodds added: “Obviously I in the long term really want to see a much more progressive tax system; but in the short term to medium term, particularly while interest rates stay low, while we’ve got really really depressed demand, I do think the focus has got to be on increasing that economic activity, keeping people out of unemployment and trying to make sure they’ve got opportunities.” The cautious style appears to suit the UK’s first female shadow chancellor and a former university lecturer. The latter is a job she said she loved, and had imagined she would stay in, until a friend persuaded her to stand as an MEP. She was a contemporary of Sunak’s at Oxford University, graduating in the same subject – philosophy, politics and economics – though she didn’t think they “particularly remember each other”. But while PPE is often the degree of choice for wannabe leaders, Dodds said she did not arrive at university with a political career plan. With a father who ran an accountancy business, she said tax reform was a topic of conversation at home. “He was very committed to the tax system working properly – I heard a lot about that when I was growing up.” Asked whether she brought a different perspective to the job of shadow chancellor as the first woman in the post – and potentially the first female chancellor – she said: “Quite often it will be people who might have worked in finance for example who would end up in those roles traditionally. But of course women can have diverse experiences. I used to chair a debt and welfare advice centre on the council estate where I live, and that certainly gave me a lot of experience of how the economy impacts on individual households. “So I think people can have a diverse set of ways of experiencing the economy that are relevant. And we shouldn’t be privileging perhaps some types over other types”."
2020-07-19T23:00:02Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson to unveil pupil funding plan during school visit,"Boris Johnson will visit a school on Monday to boast about delivering a year-on-year increase in per-pupil funding – which Labour says will still leave schools worse off than a decade ago. The prime minister made boosting education funding a manifesto pledge last year, after school cuts were a significant issue in the 2017 general election. Confirming the second year of a three-year settlement, the government is to announce that each secondary school will attract a minimum of £5,150 per pupil and each primary a minimum of £4,000 under the national funding formula from 2021. In remarks released before his visit to a school in the south-east, Johnson said: “Every child deserves a superb education – regardless of which school they attend, or where they happened to grow up. “That is why we are providing additional funding now and for the future for every school – with those historically underfunded receiving the greatest increase.” But shadow education secretary Kate Green pointed to research by thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies, showing Conservative plans will still leave schools worse off in 2022-23 than when the coalition government came to power in 2010. Green said: “Additional funding for schools is necessary and welcome, but it was this Conservative government that cut school budgets for the first time in a generation, and only began to provide additional investment due to tireless campaigning from parents, school staff, and the Labour party.” The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, is also announcing more details of the £1bn catch-up fund to help students who have missed out on months of classroom teaching during the Covid-19 pandemic. The prime minister promised a “big summer catch-up” last month, as pressure mounted on the government over the failure to get all pupils back into schools. However, the first payment will only be made in the autumn term, with subsequent payments in the other two terms of the 2020-21 academic year. They will be set at £80 per pupil, so that a 1,000-pupil secondary school will receive £80,000, and a 200-pupil primary school £16,000. Headteachers will be encouraged to spend it on one-to-one help for struggling students. Separately, the National Tutoring Programme will allow schools to access subsidised tutoring from the second half of the autumn term for disadvantaged children. Another scheme will also help some of the most disadvantaged schools to recruit academic mentors to give one-to-one support to struggling children, in association with the charity Teach First. Schools will have to fund the national insurance and other employment costs of the mentors from their catch-up funding. Teach First chief executive, Russell Hobby, said: “We’re honoured to join the National Tutoring Programme and kick off recruitment of the first wave of academic mentors. Their salaries will be funded for schools and evidence shows that by working under the direction of experienced teachers they can be precisely deployed to support the children who need them most.”"
2020-07-19T21:30:00Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer accuses PM of placing parents in 'impossible position',"Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has accused the prime minister of putting parents in an “impossible position” by urging them to go back to the workplace next month, without offering any support for the struggling childcare sector. At a press conference on Friday, Boris Johnson called on the public to return to work where it is safe to do so from 1 August, after four months during which the government had recommended home working. But the change of advice came just as schools in England break up for the summer, with childcare settings offering reduced provision, and some clubs and many other activities unavailable. Cross-party MPs, business groups and equality campaigners had called for extra help for childcare in the chancellor’s summer statement. When challenged by MPs about the absence of any extra support for the sector, Rishi Sunak pointed out that nurseries can apply for existing government schemes, such as the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme. The National Day Nurseries Association has warned 71% of its members expect to operate at a loss between now and September, and a further 23% to just break even. It is calling for a “recovery and transformation fund” to help providers stay afloat, and adjust to the requirements of keeping children safe. Starmer said: “Despite ordering millions of parents back to the office, the prime minister has refused to provide any extra help for families, penalising parents by putting them in an impossible position. “Parents got a back-to-work notice on Friday just as the summer holidays began. But they got no support for structured activities, no summer catch-up schemes, and no support for a childcare sector on its knees.
“If we are going to reopen our society and economy safely and successfully, we need the public to have confidence in the government’s advice, we need test, track and trace to be working properly, and we need proper support for children to learn and for parents to get back to work.” He will press the point home at a school visit in Coventry on Monday, accompanied by shadow education secretary Kate Green. Johnson is keen to encourage more workers back into the office, to help revitalise town and city centre economies hit hard by the lack of business. At Friday’s press conference, he said he wanted to see businesses, “encouraging people to get back to work where that is right for that employee”. Thousands of job losses and widespread store closures at firms including John Lewis, Pret a Manger and Pizza Express in recent weeks have underlined the challenge facing city centres. Johnson is expected to demand ministers attend this week’s cabinet meeting in person, to set an example for office workers in other sectors. However, many MPs from both sides of the House of Commons have highlighted the difficulties of calling for a return to the workplace, at a time when childcare may not yet be available. Women and equalities select committee chair Caroline Nokes, a former Conservative minister, said she had tried to press the point home with her frontbench colleagues in the wake of the summer statement. “I was hugely disappointed and I’ve privately been lobbying Treasury ministers to say ‘look, think about the gendered response to Covid-19, think about how we get people back to work – childcare has to be part of that.” She added: “I just get crosser and crosser the longer time goes on, that this is a recovery designed by men, for men, and it’s not giving the answers families need.” The government has insisted all children must be back in school full-time in September, with many having had no classroom teaching at all since mid-March. However, local lockdowns could see schools in particular areas forced to close while an individual outbreak is dealt with. Industry group the Early Years Alliance welcomed Starmer’s comments. “If the government is serious about supporting parents and rebooting the economy, it cannot afford to sit by and watch thousands more childcare providers go out of business,” said its chief executive, Neil Leitch."
2020-07-19T14:53:44Z,politics,Politics,UK urges EU countries to ensure Britons living abroad can stay after Brexit,"The UK government is launching a multimillion pound communications campaign to reach the estimated 1 million British citizens living in the EU to ensure they know what steps to take if they wish to remain in their host countries after Brexit. And it is urging all EU member states to accelerate the process to enable British nationals to secure their rights amid concern among campaigners that some countries have not yet even opened schemes for UK citizens. “UK nationals living in the EU must be able to rely on the rights the withdrawal agreement gives them, just as EU nationals living in the UK can. “We continue to call on the EU and member states to protect the rights of UK nationals with faster implementation, longer application windows and clear communications, as the UK has done for EU citizens in the UK,” said a Foreign Office spokesperson. Their call comes weeks after the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, wrote to the vice-president of the European commission, Maroš Šefčovič, saying that while the UK had given EU citizens 27 months to apply for settled status, some EU member states were planning “short application windows that may not allow sufficient time for citizens to secure their rights”. The EU has confirmed that 13 countries, including France, where many British nationals live, have opted for a “constitutive” system similar to that in the UK requiring British nationals to apply for settled status. The remaining 14 member states have chosen the simpler “declaratory” system that allows British nationals to register their residency to demonstrate their right to continue to live, work or study in their chosen country. Spain, where an estimated 400,000 Britons live, has opted for the latter, giving campaigners hope that few will be left behind. It has also launched what local British campaigners are describing as a “warm” campaign, with the minister for inclusion, Hana Jalloul, telling Britons who want to remain that “this is, and always will remain your home”.
It coincided with a joint statement with the British ambassador to remind Britons their rights are “guaranteed” if they are living there before 31 December. The country’s national statistics show 360,000 British nationals have already registered to be in the country with 104,000 living in the Andalucía province, including 62,000 in the costas around Malaga. Alicante and Valencia account for a further 97,000, with 40,000 and 29,000 in the Canaries and Balearics respectively. Sue Wilson, the founder of Bremain in Europe, a campaign group for Britons in Spain, said the fact that the Spanish government have chosen a simple declaratory scheme allowing rights to be “guaranteed” without an application for settled state a “great relief to British immigrants”. “We are grateful to the Spanish authorities for making the process as simple, seamless and painless as possible.”
However, there is concern that there are tens of thousands of Britons who are off the radar, some elderly or vulnerable, and some who just don’t use the internet who may be more difficult to reach. The Foreign Office is working with three organisations in the country, including Age in Spain, with a big communications push to try to reach the over-65s around the Costas and Alicante. “I suspect a large number of people are out there who may not understand that there is an issue that they have to deal with because of Brexit, some of whom may not like to approach officials because they don’t know or fear how it might impact on things like taxation, health care,” said Helen Weir, the director of Age in Spain. Weir also said there was an important message to get out to relatives back in the UK. “If you have a relative in Spain who may not have residency or cannot cope with officialdom because they don’t speak Spanish or because they can’t cope with bureaucracy, you can contact Age in Spain and we can put them in touch with people who can help.” Of the 26 member states (Ireland is an exception, with British and Irish having reciprocal rights to remain in each others country after Brexit), Spain is considered one of the most advanced in preparations for the human cost of Brexit. France was due to open its application process on 1 July but has put it back to October because of Covid-19 and pressure will mount on countries to extend the deadlines for applications beyond 30 June next year to accommodate the challenges caused by the pandemic. So far, 14 countries have opted for declaratory systems, and some countries, including Sweden and Finland, which have opted for constitutive systems, have delayed the deadline for applications from June to October next year. Countries that have opted for the declaratory system are: Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain. The remainder have opted for the constitutive system. • This article was amended on 20 July 2020 to clarify both which countries have opted for a declaratory system, and that some of those that have chosen the constitutive system have extended their deadline for applications."
2020-07-19T07:22:43Z,politics,Politics,No 10 warned by Tory MPs over ‘sinister’ bids to suppress dissent,"Senior Tories are warning Downing St that its increasingly domineering attitude towards its own MPs will backfire, after its “sinister” decision to throw a veteran MP out of the parliamentary party. There have been concerns raised over the treatment of Julian Lewis, who scuppered No 10’s plans by being elected as chairman of parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC). Since Lewis’s arrival in the role, the committee has agreed to publish a sensitive report into Russian interference in British political life that had been blocked by the government before the last election. The report is due to appear this week. Russia has repeatedly denied interfering, and the Russian ambassador to the UK did so again on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, when he rejected claims that the Kremlin tried to steal Covid-19 vaccine research. Downing St had been planning to install the former minister Chris Grayling as the ISC’s new chairman, but was blindsided by Lewis’s successful bid for the job, which he won with the support of opposition MPs. However, the decision to strip Lewis of the whip has caused a backlash within the Tory ranks. Many MPs are blaming Boris Johnson’s powerful inner circle for their intolerance for any form of dissent. A number of concerns have been raised with members of the Tory backbench 1922 committee of MPs. Several figures said concerns had been relayed to the chief whip Mark Spencer by the committee’s chairman, Graham Brady, with many urging Spencer to reconsider. “Reducing the majority is hardly a genius move, but this will backfire in the long run,” said one concerned Tory.
Dominic Grieve, the former ISC chairman who was also removed from the parliamentary party over his Brexit views, said that Lewis’s treatment risked being part of a wider pattern of behaviour from No 10. “I think that you can see it as sinister, because the only rational explanation may be that the government wishes to politicise every aspect of government activity and parliamentary activity and party politicise it, that nothing else is tolerable and that they wish to exert constant and continuous control over a range of activities, which should be carried out by independent players,” he said. “And if they’re doing that to this parliamentary committee, what will they choose to try and do it to next? I think there is a legitimate reason for being very concerned about what they’re doing, even though this seems to me to be the theatre of the absurd.” MPs also believe that ministers attempted to soften the impact of the Russia report’s imminent publication by confirming that Russian actors “sought to interfere” in last winter’s general election. They pointed to a leaked NHS dossier that was seized upon by Labour during the campaign. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said any attempted interference was “completely unacceptable”. However, one critic said of the sudden admission: “It’s a bog-standard media ploy, but many governments have used it.”
The dossier is also expected to include an examination of political funding flowing from Russia to Britain and several Tory donors are said to be named in the report. However, the names are likely to be redacted when the report is published. One of the donors expected to be included in the dossier said he had not been given the chance to see its findings before publication. Electoral Commission records suggest that the largest Russian Tory donor is Lubov Chernukhin. Her husband, Vladimir Chernukhin, served as Vladimir Putin’s deputy finance minister from 2000-2002. She has donated hundreds of thousands to the Tories over the past year, previously paying to play tennis with Boris Johnson and dine with Theresa May. Her donations are completely legal because she is a British citizen. The long-awaited Russia report was compiled by the ISC under its previous membership. The report was sent to Downing St as far back as mid-October, but its publication was blocked by the government. Critics claim that the delay stopped questions being raised about Russian links to the Tory party before the December election. It took almost seven months after the election for Downing St to nominate new ISC members. It was the committee’s longest break since it was created in 1994. The absence of one of parliament’s most important committees caused cross-party concerns. It is tasked with overseeing the UK’s intelligence community."
2020-07-19T06:13:42Z,politics,Politics,Plaudits for Nicola Sturgeon fuel talk of Scottish independence drive,"Leading Scottish scientists have backed the nation’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, over her handling of Covid-19 – amid suggestions that contrasting government responses in London and Holyrood may be helping the cause of Scottish independence. The SNP government’s drive to achieve “total elimination” of the coronavirus differs from England’s bid merely to suppress its spread and, overall, Sturgeon’s approach is seen as more cautious than Boris Johnson’s. She resisted dropping the “stay at home” message for a period after it was abandoned in England, and decided to make masks compulsory in shops earlier than Johnson’s government did. In addition, Scotland has operated stricter rules about eating in public and easing social distancing compared with England. Although Scotland’s total number of deaths is above 4,000 and is higher than many countries with similar populations, new cases and deaths are now at very low levels, allowing the SNP to aim for an elimination strategy. For several consecutive days this month there were no deaths from Covid-19.
On the downside, Scotland has the highest death rate for coronavirus in care homes in the UK. Some 47% of all Covid-19 deaths have been in care homes in Scotland, while in England the figure is about 27%. On Saturday the SNP’s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, said that his party was not shaping its Covid-19 strategy in order to open new divides with England or to bolster support for an independent Scotland. But he said he believed the SNP’s management of the crisis had won respect. “We are not doing this to strengthen the case for independence,” he said. “But I think people are reflecting on the leadership that has been given. There is a reaction to that leadership that is perhaps creating more of a confidence in independence. I think that everything that is going on is probably strengthening the case.” Blackford expects the SNP to win a stronger mandate in next year’s Holyrood elections, which he says he will reinforce calls for another referendum. “I think there will be another referendum,” he said. Sturgeon’s “total elimination” policy is being backed by leading scientists. “She is perceived to be a very safe pair of hands,” said Dame Anne Glover, president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Scotland’s national academy. “She seems to have a single imperative, and that is to try to eliminate the Covid-19 virus in Scotland. I have not heard that as an endgame in England.” Professor Linda Bauld, of Edinburgh University’s Usher Institute, compared Sturgeon’s response to that of German chancellor Angela Merkel: “It is evident she is following the evidence closely herself. She is not just relying on people advising her. She is a bit like Angela Merkel. She is clearly spending a huge amount of time reading and absorbing material. I didn’t really hear that from the prime minister.”
Bauld added that she had not spoken to anyone who had been critical of Sturgeon’s ability to communicate clearly with the Scottish public. “She is highly regarded by scientists for that,” she said. In a move that led her political opponents to criticise her for political posturing, Sturgeon threatened recently to close the England-Scotland border, while Johnson has claimed no such border exists. While flights and trains to Scotland could be halted, few analysts believe the many roads between the two nations could be sealed off. There are tentative signs that Sturgeon’s handling of the crisis may be bolstering support for the nationalist cause. One recent poll showed 55% of Scots now favour independence.
Critics of Sturgeon, however, point to the fact that other small nations – such as New Zealand – have done far better at limiting the spread of Covid-19 within their borders and have much lower death rates. Labour MP and shadow secretary of state for Scotland, Ian Murray, said: “The first minister being a better communicator than Boris Johnson doesn’t mask the SNP’s catastrophic failures, and if the bar is to do better than Johnson then it is no bar at all. “As we ease out of lockdown more gently a few days behind England, performance in both Scotland and Wales is now better than some parts of the UK, but that doesn’t excuse the fact that Scotland has one of the worst death rates in the world. It’s no comfort that England is doing worse and the figures in Scotland are certainly not something to celebrate given the tragic loss of life.” However, Glover – who is based at Strathclyde University – defended Sturgeon. “New Zealand is an independent nation. By contrast, Scotland has no independent fiscal powers. Like Wales and Northern Ireland it could not borrow to raise funds for lockdown and so was entirely dependent on what happens in the UK overall in regard to providing support for furlough. It had to wait for England to act, belatedly as it transpires.” • This article was amended on 20 July 2020 because an earlier version referred to “the myriad roads between” Scotland and England. This has been changed to “the many roads between the two nations”."
2020-07-18T20:55:31Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock in new U-turn on coronavirus testing data,"The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has bowed to pressure from councils, which demanded full access to the names and data of people in their areas who tested positive for Covid-19, and those with whom they have been in contact, in another major government U-turn. Local authorities and public health officials have been complaining for weeks that they are being hampered in efforts to combat and prevent local outbreaks by lack of access to “named patient data” which would allow them to get straight to the sources of local outbreaks. Now the Observer has been told that Hancock, who has insisted repeatedly that local authorities have all the information they need from the track and trace system, is set to give way and allow access to the named data as well other information already provided, such as postcodes, so long as strict data protection rules and conditions are followed. A source close to Hancock said on Saturday night that an announcement was imminent and could come as soon as Monday. “Subject to necessary data safeguards, we will enhance the level of this detail to ensure that local public health teams on the ground have the information they need to fight this virus,” the source said. He added: “High quality use of data is critical to providing good public services. We’re providing more and more detailed data to local directors of public health who sign data protection agreements, to help them tackle local outbreaks and hunt down this virus.” Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester who has been pressing for named patient data to be handed over for weeks, so that local health experts can act to protect people in workplaces and elsewhere who may have been infected, welcomed the about turn but said it should have happened much earlier.
He said: “It is good that the Government has finally acknowledged the truth of what we’ve been saying for weeks: that local teams need access to named patient data, ideally on a daily basis, if they are to mount the most effective effort on the ground to contain this virus. Despite claims to the contrary, even from the Despatch Box, this has not been happening. “However, it should not have taken this long, and such a public campaign, to force them to comply with their own law. Going forward, it would be in the Government’s own best interests to involve, consult and listen to local leaders much more. The stark reality is that we are heading into a dangerous winter without a vaccine and councils will need every bit of help they can get if they are to be able to protect their communities.”
Under the new arrangements, Public Health England is expected to provide the names and data of those people who tested positive and their contacts to directors of public health working with local authorities. The latest shift on Covid-19 – following recent U-turns on plans for a tracing app and free school meals for the poorest children – comes after an announcement by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday that councils are to be given new powers to close shops, cancel events and shut outdoor spaces to manage local outbreaks. Boris Johnson has described the government’s £10bn track and trace system as “world beating” but council chiefs and local directors of public health have been demanding full data access so they can work in tandem with the national track and trace system, using their local expertise, with full information at their fingertips. Government officials said last night that Hancock had been keen on granting full access to named patient data for some time and was “very keen” on the change – despite having appeared repeatedly to deny that local authorities were been deprived of the information they needed. Louise Jackson, portfolio holder for public health and wellbeing at Bedford Council, said the flow of data had improved but there were still important gaps. “We are now getting full postcode-level data, but it’s still only being sent through weekly to local authorities, so it’s not real time. It’s not patient identifiable either. If Ministers are suggesting otherwise, then that is not true.” Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “Councils and public health officials have been banging on Hancock’s door for weeks. The government says it is a world beating system but it has cost £10bn and yet local experts have not been getting the data they need.”"
2020-07-18T16:00:25Z,politics,Politics,Johnson is asking Santa for a Christmas recovery,"There is little chance of the economy staging a full recovery by the middle of the decade, let alone by Christmas, as Boris Johnson believes is possible. Speaking with the optimism of a first world war general, the prime minister said on Friday that most restrictions on business activity would be lifted by December. This, he intimated, meant that for much of the population there will be a return to pre-coronavirus ways of working by the end of the year. He foresees workers by the million travelling to their workplace by public transport, while their children attend school every day and universities absorb hundreds of thousands of young people. His optimism was only tempered by the prospect of local lockdowns, which can now happen within hours after he gave councils greater powers to close specific premises affected by Covid-19. After months of suffering one policy misstep after another, there was every reason for a note of despair in the response from some business leaders. They were polite, but desperate for the government to lay down clear ground rules rather than leave it up to them to decide what constitutes a safe environment. They don’t want to spend vast sums opening up facilities only to close them again when a group of workers tests positive. Yet experts say that is just what is likely to happen when a mix of casual, part-time and full-time staff start travelling back to their workplace on packed buses and trains. Johnson wants city centres to hum with activity. It’s not clear how that happens when companies, fearing the costs of renewed lockdowns, opt to keep their white-collar workers at home.
No wonder that the boss of the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, has called for tax breaks on the costs of reopening businesses in his response to Johnson’s announcement. Marshall was one of the most vocal in calling for “crystal-clear official guidance” before employers could bring staff back in large numbers. As we know, crystal-clear guidance is not on the menu. Schools have asked for the same clarity as businesses seek. So have universities. “Do what you think appropriate,” comes the answer from one minister after another. “See how it goes.” The cabinet has proved incapable of clear leadership at every stage and that is not going to change. There is some activity within the great offices of state, but much of it is devoted to plotting how to remake the economy under instructions from Dominic Cummings, who doesn’t much like dull, slow-moving Britain and wants it to be more exciting. The problem with waiting for the Cummings revolution and leaving the emergence from lockdown to individual companies is that economic activity will remain stuck in second gear. As this newspaper has reported, economists from across the political spectrum agree it will take greater trust in plans to ease the lockdown and huge investments by government to bring the economy back to life. Free-market supporters have joined dyed-in-the-wool Keynesians to call for a step up in infrastructure spending, and not just to boost jobs in construction and engineering. They know the visible signs of an economy getting back on its feet are vital to creating the “animal spirits” of entrepreneurialism and investment that drive growth. Last week, sadly, provided relentlessly bad news on this front. The GDP growth figures for May showed only a 1.8% bounce-back from the near 26% fall of the previous two months. This revealed a distinct lack of impetus from the private sector as consumers, for so long the driving force of growth, remained reluctant to spend. Later, the Institute for Fiscal Studies unearthed figures showing the government’s £30bn boost to transport and infrastructure included £5.5bn taken from projects it had cancelled and £10bn of recycled cash overall. These cancelled projects in many cases addressed Britain’s climate challenge, mostly in the largest towns and cities. Without them, there cannot be a return to where GDP was before the crisis within agreed emission limits. It takes years to fashion such projects before they are shovel-ready; reviving them will take time and money. In other words, they have a shelf life, and once their sell-by date has passed, much of the preparation must be done again. Also, many schemes in London are paused, caught in a funding tussle between No 10 and the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan. A distaste for local authorities more generally impedes developments across the regions, as shown by moves by housing seceratry Robert Jenrick to centralise planning powers. This mix of dither and delay over coronavirus rule-making, of revolutionary Whitehall makeovers and plots against mayors will prevent even the most enthusiastic workers and business people from reviving the economy before Christmas. It will take much longer."
2020-07-18T15:00:24Z,politics,Politics,UK ministers ignore pleas to return ‘innocent orphans’ from Syria,"The Home Office has been accused of “alarming inaction” after making no apparent attempt to bring back any British children from Syria for the past eight months despite pledges of help from ministers. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, announced last October that “unaccompanied minors or orphans” in Syria could be returned to Britain. After three orphans returned in November, he hailed the move as “the right thing to do”. He added: “These innocent, orphaned children should never have been subjected to the horrors of war.” Boris Johnson described the children’s repatriation as “a great success”. But an estimated 60 or so British minors are still trapped in north-east Syria, and the government has repeatedly refused to say when any of them will be allowed to return home. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has so far not responded to a letter from Save the Children, sent last December, in which the charity asked how she intended to start bringing them home. Since then, the charity has repeatedly asked Home Office officials for a progress report on its attempts to repatriate unaccompanied children and orphans stranded in refugee camps but says it has been stonewalled.
The latest accusations follow Thursday’s ruling that Shamima Begum, currently in north-east Syria after leaving London at 15 to marry an Islamic State fighter, should be allowed home. The Court of Appeal said the 20-year-old, one of three east London girls who went to Syria in 2015, could only properly appeal against the government’s decision to revoke her citizenship if she came back to the UK. However, there is growing concern that the government will do nothing to assist her return. Yesterday her family said that any attempt by the UK government to keep Begum in Syria would be defeated. Tasnime Akunjee, the family’s lawyer, said: “However determined this particular government is in keeping Shamima Begum out, I can assure them that the family are more determined to bring her to safety”. Akunjee felt that the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces, who control the camp where Begum is being held, would be willing to help assist with her repatriation because of the court’s judgment. “If we have a court ruling saying that the British government must accept her but they are not moving on it, then it’ll be up to us to convince the SDF that that’s good enough,” said Akunjee. Orlaith Minogue, conflict and humanitarian advocacy adviser for Save the Children, said she was “extremely frustrated” over the British government’s refusal to help the plight of the British children. “We’ve repeatedly tried to engage the Home Office and Foreign Office on a progress report about what is happening and the state of the children’s safety, but we have received no further information or what steps have been taken. We are concerned at the alarming inaction,” she said. Other European countries, however, have made recent efforts to repatriate vulnerable citizens. Last month, the French government brought home 10 French children of suspected Isis fighters from north-east Syria.
Since Isis was ousted in March 2019, France has repatriated a total of 28 children from Syria. By contrast, the UK has brought back three orphans, and only then under significant political and public pressure. Minogue said: “When we had those statements from Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab [last year] they were under a lot of political pressure but since then we’ve heard nothing”. Meanwhile, the legal charity Reprieve reiterated calls for British mothers to be returned along with the children. There are currently more than 20 British families believed to be held in refugee camps in north-east Syria. “Children deserve to be given support to rebuild their lives in the UK and any charges that the adults face should be handled by the British justice system in British courts,” said Reprieve director Maya Foa. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK does more to support unaccompanied children than any EU member state”. They added that coronavirus had suspended all refugee resettlement activity, but would restart “as soon as possible once conditions allow”. Individuals linked to Isis who have been repatriated from Syria Kazakhstan: 600 More than 600 of its citizens have been repatriated from Syria, of which over 400 are children and at least 150 are women. Uzbekistan: 148 At least 148 Uzbek women and children linked to Islamic State have been returned from north-east Syria. Kosovo: 106 At least 74 children and 32 women have been returned from Syria. Russia: 35 The country has repatriated at least 35 orphans from Syria. France: 28 Has so far helped 28 children get home from Syria. United States: 23 The US has returned at least 23 people, including 15 children. UK: 3 To date has repatriated three orphans from Syria."
2020-07-18T14:49:46Z,politics,Politics,"Ministers can intervene if councils slow to act on local lockdowns, says Johnson","Ministers will gain new powers to intervene if local authorities do not act quickly enough against coronavirus outbreaks, Boris Johnson has said. In a series of tweets, Johnson announced ministers would be able to close “whole sectors or types of premises” in a given area, impose localised stay-at-home orders, prevent people entering or leaving certain areas, limit the maximum number of people at a gathering and reduce transport in local areas. This would be “guided by evidence”, he said. Johnson added the details would be outlined in draft regulations published next week. From Saturday, local councils have gained greater powers to help avert local lockdowns, including the ability to shut down shops, events and close public outdoor spaces. Johnson said that while these powers would “enable them to act more quickly in response to outbreaks”, they would “not always be sufficient” and ministers should be able to intervene. “I know that it will be hard-going for people affected by these local measures. It isn’t easy, and for some it may seem unjust that people just a short distance away can live their lives closer to normal,” he said. “But it has to be right that we take local action in response to local outbreaks - there is no point shutting down a city in one part of the country to contain an outbreak in another part of the country.” The prime minister said the government’s understanding of the epidemiology of coronavirus and its transmission had “vastly improved”, enabling “targeted, local action”. He said the government had already taken action in specific premises in Weston-super-Mare and Kirklees, and introduced targeted measures in Bradford and Blackburn with Darwen, alongside the localised lockdown imposed in Leicester at the end of June. The announcement comes after local authority figures welcomed the increased powers for local governments, with James Jamieson, the chair of the Local Government Association saying “councils know their local communities best and know how to address each unique outbreak”."
2020-07-18T14:45:23Z,politics,Politics,Covid-19 leaves firms ‘fatally ill-prepared’ for no-deal Brexit,"Many companies are now less prepared for a no-deal Brexit than they were a year ago and have yet to make any preparations for such an outcome, ministers are being warned. As a result of the coronavirus crisis, stockpiles have been wound down, Brexit-related staff redeployed and cashflows seriously depleted. Yet a potential no-deal outcome is now less than six months away. The latest warning comes from the Institute for Government thinktank, which also cites official data suggesting that 61% of businesses have made no preparations at all for the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December. It also warns that last-minute preparations will be extremely difficult for many sectors, as coronavirus-related government support is wound down and potential for stockpiling is diminished as warehouses fill up ahead of Christmas.
“The coronavirus crisis has not only held up progress on Brexit preparations but, in some areas, has actually set businesses back,” it warns in a new report. “Firms reeling from the economic consequences of coronavirus are poorly placed to prepare for Brexit: in many cases, they’re in a worse position than in the months leading up to the potential no-deal in October 2019. As the government’s own data shows, the majority of firms have not even begun to prepare. “Many businesses and public bodies have run down stockpiles built up ahead of a potential no-deal Brexit last year, either because it was not economically viable to maintain excess supplies or to mitigate the disruption caused by gaps and delays in supply chains caused by the coronavirus. Many firms have eaten into ‘rainy day’ cash reserves just to stay afloat – money that could otherwise have been used to prepare for Brexit.” Ministers recently conceded that many checks for goods coming into Britain would not be enforced when the transition period comes to an end, despite a previous insistence that controls would be in place. However, ministers have continued to stress that there will be no extension of the transition period. There are now mounting calls for sector-specific help ahead of the end of the transition period. The cost of extra customs declarations could be as much as £7bn a year, according to some estimates.
Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, warned: “The automotive industry has not the resources, the time or the clarity to prepare for a hard Brexit on top of the devastating impact of Covid-19. Negotiations need to be accelerated to secure a tariff-free and quota-free comprehensive [free trade agreement] with the EU. “With such a deal, a strong recovery is possible, safeguarding the industry and our reputation as an attractive destination for foreign investment. In the meantime, we urgently need the government to introduce sector-specific measures to support cashflow, such as business rate holidays, tax cuts and policies to boost consumer confidence.” Industry groups have also been urging members to make preparations where they can, especially among exporting companies. Dominic Goudie, head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation, said: “There are many things that businesses can and should be doing to prepare, and we are helping ensure our industry has the very best chance of being ready as further clarity emerges from the government about what will be required. “Many producers have been seriously affected by the closure of the hospitality sector, while staff have been redeployed from Brexit preparations to focus on the Covid-19 pandemic. “Businesses have seen their cashflow badly impacted, and this risks further reducing their limited capacity to stockpile short shelf-life ingredients and finished products.”"
2020-07-18T14:00:14Z,politics,Politics,Grant Shapps breaks ranks to book summer holiday abroad,"Grant Shapps has become the first senior UK politician to break ranks and declare he is taking a summer holiday abroad this year. The transport secretary said he and his wife, Belinda, had decided to take advantage of the relaxation of Foreign Office guidance on non-essential overseas travel. “My wife looked at all of these new changes that were made and has now booked a break for the first time for a couple of years,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Senior politicians had previously been queuing up to indicate they would be staying in the UK after the coronavirus pandemic threw international travel plans into disarray. Boris Johnson, who spent the new year in the Caribbean with his partner Carrie Symonds, said this week he would be holidaying in the UK. “This country is uniquely blessed with fantastic places to holiday, whether coastal or otherwise. And I am certainly going to be doing that, but I won’t necessarily tell you where at this stage,” he told reporters on Monday. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, have also chosen to enjoy the attractions of the UK. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said as far back as May that he would be remaining in the UK. Shapps had previously warned that anyone booking a holiday for August would be taking a chance, but he told the Today programme: “Of course, since that time the Foreign and Commonwealth Office have been able to change their travel advice. “We have established air bridges or international travel corridors to a number of different countries allowing that to happen. These are personal choices but we have issued guidance now for airlines to ensure that people can travel in a Covid-safe manner as well. So there is much more structure in place now as we approach the summer.”"
2020-07-17T17:49:45Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's plan for 'return to normality' met with scepticism,"Boris Johnson has held out the prospect of a “significant return to normality” by Christmas as he announced a fresh easing of lockdown restrictions in England – but his roadmap was met with a backlash from business leaders and claims he is making policy “on a wing and prayer”. After four months of encouraging the public to work from home to help contain the spread of coronavirus, the prime minister said from 1 August the onus would be on employers to decide whether staff could safely come back to the office. His blueprint could lead to a return for gigs, theatre performances and business conferences in the coming months. A lifting of restrictions on attendance at football matches could happen in October, Johnson said, and it “may conceivably be possible to move away from the social distancing measures” by November. Johnson said local lockdowns would be implemented quickly where needed, and he unveiled plans to hand local authorities greater powers.
He was careful not to claim that his proposals had been endorsed by the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Giving testimony to the House of Lords on Friday, both men struck a sombre tone, with Whitty reiterating in the strongest terms the need to maintain social distancing “for a long period of time”. “There is a very significant chance that it [coronavirus] comes back in force,” added Vallance. “Everyone that I’ve spoken to thinks it’s highly likely that this disease will continue to circulate and will come back in waves. And therefore the measures of reducing contact to reduce spread, the sorts of social distancing measures that we’ve talked about, and the hygiene measures that go along with that, will be necessary.” Johnson said his framework for a return to normality depended on staff talking to their employers “in a serious and grown-up way” and offices being made Covid-19-secure. But this drew criticism for being overly vague. Keir Starmer accused Johnson of making policy “on a wing and a prayer”. The Labour leader said: “We all want society to reopen, we all want our economy to start growing again. So we’ll look at the details of this plan. But the key now is confidence. Do the public have confidence in the measures the government have put in place? Do businesses have confidence in the advice that’s been given? And can we have confidence that the government’s scientific advisers support these measures? This can’t be done on a wing and a prayer. It requires a credible plan, and national leadership.”
Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “The government is passing the buck on this big decision to employers. Getting back to work safely requires a functioning NHS test-and-trace system. Yet progress on test and trace is still patchy, and the government is still refusing to support workers who have to self-isolate by raising statutory sick pay from just £95pw to a rate people can live on.” And the director of the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, said: “For many employees, returning to the workplace is contingent on schools reopening, the availability of wraparound care and the capacity of public transport.” In a further effort to encourage commuters as the government tries to kickstart devastated town- and city-centre economies, Johnson lifted the presumption against using public transport. “From today we are making clear that anybody may use public transport, while of course encouraging people to consider alternative means of transport where they are available,” he said. Despite warning of the risks of a winter resurgence in the virus, the prime minister maintained an upbeat tone in Friday’s speech and said measures were being put in place to mitigate the possibility of a second wave. He announced an extra £3bn for the NHS and a significant expansion of flu vaccinations.
Johnson said: “It is my strong and sincere hope that we will be able to review the outstanding restrictions and allow a more significant return to normality from November at the earliest, possibly in time for Christmas.” When Johnson was asked whether Vallance and Whitty had approved of the latest lockdown easing, he said the pair had briefed the cabinet on Friday morning but it was for ministers to make decisions. “I must stress that the chief scientific officer and chief medical officer give us advice, which we of course take very, very seriously, but in the end decisions are taken by the elected politicians,” he said.
Vallance, in his evidence to the Lords science and technology committee, said it was “incredibly important” to keep Covid-19 cases low in the winter. To help contain any new outbreaks, the government announced that from Saturday councils will have powers to close premises, shut outdoor spaces and cancel events. In addition, regulations set out in draft in parliament next week will allow central government to intervene in local areas by issuing stay-at-home orders, limiting the numbers at gatherings and preventing travel between different areas."

2020-07-17T15:00:09Z,politics,Politics,Key points of the coronavirus recovery strategy for England,"The government has published its Covid-19 recovery strategy for England, setting out a timeframe for a return to normality and measures to tackle the threat of a second wave and local outbreaks. These are the main points: Local lockdowns Local authorities have been handed significant new powers, to be used with “discretion”. From Saturday they can close individual premises and public outdoor places and prevent events taking place. Councils are required to notify the government as soon as possible after exercise of such powers and to review their decision at least once every seven days. They will be able to seek support from ministers to close schools or limit attendance to certain year groups. Draft regulations will be published next week detailing possible interventions by ministers “to address more serious and wider-spread cases”, which could include: Closing businesses and venues in whole sectors, such as food production or non-essential retail, or within a defined geographical area. Imposing general restrictions on movement of people, including requirements to stay at home, preventing overnight stays outside the home, or restrictions on entering or leaving a defined area. Limiting how many people can meet and whether they can travel in and out of an area to do so. Restricting local or national transport systems – closing them entirely or introducing capacity limits or geographical restrictions. Mandating use of face coverings in a wider range of public places. Preparations for a second wave Antigen test capacity – the test that tells you if you currently have the virus – is now running at more than 200,000 tests a day, compared with fewer than 2,000 at the start of March, according to the government. This target will increase to at least half a million a day by the end of October to tackle a potential winter outbreak. In his speech on Friday, Boris Johnson said the number of ventilators available to patients across the UK had risen to almost 30,000, up from 9,000 before the pandemic. Auditing is taking place to ensure winter stockpiles of equipment and personal protective equipment are at the right levels. Shortages of and supply problems with PPE were a recurring issue during the first wave of the pandemic. The UK’s biggest ever flu vaccination programme is planned to help relieve pressure on the NHS. A communications strategy to improve awareness of the service is being targeted at priority groups including black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, non-English speakers and others at particular risk. Backward contact tracing is being introduced to identify sources of outbreaks. An app will be introduced to enable individuals to book a test easily, and “if trials support it” allow for digital contact tracing. It will also let people scan the unique QR codes of venues they have visited to help with contact tracing. The government says there will be a trebling of the size of local health protection teams from 360 people to 1,100 by the end of July. An additional £3bn of funding is being provided to the NHS in England to get ready for winter, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also receiving additional funds. The cash is intended to enable the NHS to continue to use the extra capacity acquired from private hospitals and also to maintain the Nightingale hospitals until the end of March next year. Easing of lockdown Most remaining leisure centres – namely bowling alleys, skating rinks and casinos – are to reopen from 1 August, and all close-contact services such as those offered by beauticians will be allowed to resume. Beauty salons have been allowed to open since Monday but with restrictions on procedures carried out directly in front of the face. The government was accused of sexism after setting rules that allowed men to have their beards tidied but prevented eyebrow and upper lip waxing or threading – services largely, but not exclusively, used by women. Subject to the success of pilots, indoor performances – meaning gigs and theatre- will restart to live audiences from 1 August. Pilots will also take place, some from late July, in sports stadiums and venues hosting business events, with a view to wider reopening in October should they be successful. Wedding receptions with sit-down meals for up to 30 people will be permitted from 1 August. The document expresses hope for a return towards normality in spring next year “in all cases” but “by November at the earliest”. Returning to workplaces Details in the document are scant, with two sentences simply saying: “Give employers more discretion on how they ensure employees can work safely. Working from home is one way to do this, but workplaces can also be made safe by following Covid-19 secure guidelines.” Johnson fleshed this out somewhat in his speech, saying advice would be updated on 1 August, replacing the current guidance to work from home where possible. The decision rests on the shoulders of employers, who Johnson said would be asked “to make decisions about how their staff can work safely”. He added: “Whatever employers decide, they should consult closely with their employees, and only ask people to return to their place of work if it is safe.” It is a toning down of Johnson’s message last week that people should “go back to work if you can”, which prompted unions and business groups to raise concerns about a hasty return to the office."
2020-07-17T14:14:14Z,politics,Politics,"Johnson's coronavirus workplace guidance confused, warn unions","Business leaders and trade unions have told Boris Johnson he risks spreading confusion by making employers decide when to bring back their staff to offices and other workplaces. Warning that the prime minister was “passing the buck”, trades unions said more guidance and support was required to ensure a safe return to work from 1 August. John Phillips, acting general secretary of the GMB trade union, said: “The prime minister has once again shown a failure of leadership in the face of this pandemic. Passing the responsibility of keeping the people safe to employers and local authorities is confusing and dangerous.” Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said reopening the economy was vital for protecting jobs in the long-run but that the return to work needed to be handled in a phased and safe way. “The government is passing the buck on this big decision to employers,” she said. “Getting back to work safely requires a functioning NHS test and trace system. Yet progress on test and trace is still patchy, and the government is still refusing to support workers who have to self-isolate by raising statutory sick pay from just £95 per week to a rate people can live on,” she added. As the British economy slumps into the deepest recession for 300 years business groups said a safe return to work was contingent on schools reopening, and the capacity of the public transport system and wider public services. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “Companies, in discussion with their employees, will decide how and when to return to offices safely. To take those decisions, businesses need crystal-clear official guidance.” Josh Hardie, deputy director general of the CBI, welcomed the change in tone from the government but said firms would not be able to make decisions overnight. “Concern about infection is still high. The government’s announcements will not change that overnight, but changes in messaging on transport and further testing can lay a path to building confidence and helping those who want to come back to the office,” he said. “Businesses will now be closely examining government guidance. Clarity and consistency must guard against confusion.” Official figures show almost half of the working population in Britain worked from home in April during the first full month of lockdown. However, significant divisions have emerged between people who can and cannot work from home, with sharp differences split across incomes, gender, age, ethnic background, education and geography. As many as 57% of workers living in London did some work from home, the highest proportion in the country, compared with as few as 35% in the West Midlands and 38% in Yorkshire and the Humber. According to the Resolution Foundation, fewer than one in 10 of those in the bottom half of earners say they can work from home. Official figures show more than two-thirds of managers, directors and senior officials are working from home, compared with 16% of sales and customer service staff. Early signs from businesses suggest that Johnson’s easing measures are not shifting back-to-work plans. Retailers Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and John Lewis all said they currently had only a small number of staff working in their offices with most still working from home. Sainsbury’s said it was still unlikely to bring the majority of office staff back for several monthswhile Marks & Spencer is trialling an app which should help manage the number of people in its head office by allowing staff to book a time slot to attend. Some of Britain’s largest banks – among some of the biggest office-based employers in the country – said they did not plan to ask staff to return staff to work from next month. The Guardian understands that RBS, which has about 50,000 of its 65,000 staff working from home, is sticking with guidance it issued in May, that the vast majority of its workers will continue to work remotely until at least September. Only 400 staff in highly regulated roles, including from its investment bank, were asked to return in June. It will review its position this autumn. Lloyds is similarly sticking to plans that mean roughly 50,000 of its 63,000 workers will not set foot in an office until at least September. Most of those unable to work from home are bank branch staff, who count as essential workers.
Barclays has about 70,000 of its 80,000 global workforce working from home. Most of those going in to work are branch staff, and only 700 have been asked to return to offices across the UK, US and India over July and August. The insurance market Lloyd’s of London is not altering its plans either. It plans to reopen its famous underwriting room on 1 September at half capacity. It usually has 6,000 staff in the building, and 40 are due to return next week The building has been closed since March."
2020-07-16T18:44:51Z,politics,Politics,"Tired of being Boris Johnson's patsy, Patrick Vallance fights back | John Crace","Yesterday Boris Johnson committed himself to a public inquiry into the government’s handling of the coronavirus. He didn’t say when, though he gave the distinct impression that the ideal time would be a long way into the future. By when he would have had time to line up any number of patsies to take the rap for his own failures. One of whom is sure to be the government’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance. It’s fair to say that Vallance has been a little slow off the mark right from the very start of the pandemic. Not so much with the science – though he’s hardly excelled at that – but with PR management. For a long time, he was under the impressions that his prime role was to provide the government with independent scientific advice; it’s only over the course of the last few weeks he’s realised his real function was to be a human shield for Boris. And he’s clearly not happy about having been suckered in this way. So for Vallance, a two-hour appearance before the science and technology select committee was an ideal opportunity to lay the foundations of his fightback. A chance to redirect the blame to where it really lay. And in Greg Clark, the committee chair and former cabinet minister, he had someone who was only too happy to indulge him. Boris is only just beginning to realise that, for all his acolytes who fawn over every Latin word, he has some powerful enemies on the Tory backbenches. Satisfied that he was a full two metres away from the nearest committee member – there were only three of them in the room, the rest were virtual – Vallance ostentatiously removed his face mask and began to let rip. Was it still true that there had never been any significant occasions when the government had ignored the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) advice, Clark asked? The chief scientific adviser smiled benignly. His only job was to provide the government with the scientific evidence. What idiotic decisions happened to be taken as a result of that advice was completely up to the government. To suggest there was any correlation between the advice Sage might have given and government policy was absurd. Any overlap could only ever be a coincidence. Clark then gently tiptoed into trickier areas. The UK hadn’t had particularly good coronavirus outcomes – a euphemism for the highest mortality rate in the world – and it was hard to find any country that particularly admired the standard of our science. How did he account for that? “The outcomes have not been good,” Vallance agreed. But that was entirely because the UK’s data flow had been poor and because our test and trace systems were hopelessly inadequate. He and other members of Sage had been complaining to Public Health England and the Department for Health and Social Care about this for months, but neither body had taken a blind piece of notice. Just as he had flagged up concerns about the risk of transmission in care homes and been totally ignored. Not that Vallance wanted to lay all the blame at the government’s door. He was far too polite for that. Or possibly passive aggressive. When you’ve been taken for a fool for so long, it’s hard not to take some pleasure from exacting revenge. Face masks? He’d been all in favour of them long before the World Health Organization had jumped on the bandwagon. It was just that Boris hadn’t been that interested in what he had had to say. But then the prime minister did have a lot of other things on his mind at the time. The killer line came when Vallance insisted Sage had recommended an immediate total lockdown on 16 March. A bit late in the day possibly, given the rate of infection in the UK was increasing exponentially and that dozens of other countries had already introduced lockdowns, but still a good week before Boris could be bothered to getting round to doing anything about it. But then jockey club director, Dido Harding – soon to be chief executive of the track and trace system – had wanted the Cheltenham festival to go ahead and it would have been a shame for Carrie Symonds to have had to cancel her baby shower at Chequers. So all in all, it was probably worth the 20,000 extra deaths the week’s delay entailed. By now Vallance, normally one of the dourest, most-defensive of men, looked as if he was beginning to enjoy himself. The session was developing into gestalt therapy and he was on the brink of catharsis. All that pent-up hurt and resentment finally being allowed an outlet. Yes, things still were basically a bit shit. He couldn’t understand why the government’s testing programme was still so rubbish as on current evidence Matt Hancock didn’t have a prayer of reaching his winter targets. And yes, he knew that Boris was due to give a speech the following day encouraging people to go back to work, but his advice was for everyone to stay put at home. Back in No 10, Dominic Cummings was having a hissy fit as he wondered how to rephrase the government advice, but Vallance was on a schadenfreude high. All he had ever done was present the evidence as he saw it – even if he had been a bit slow on the uptake at times – and if the government had acted irresponsibly then it was nothing to do with him, guv. Over to you Boris and Matt. Hancock had been down to appear before the committee immediately after Vallance, but Matt had wisely excused himself by giving a statement to the Commons on extending the Leicester lockdown instead. Anything to buy himself a bit of time. Because after Vallance’s evidence, Mattbeth is going to need to come up with some creative answers next Tuesday. The blame game is only just beginning. And it could be the only fun thing to come out of the whole coronavirus pandemic."
2020-07-16T17:59:32Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Leicester's mayor 'angry and frustrated' as city kept in partial lockdown — as it happened,"Here’s a roundup of today’s key UK coronavirus developments: Some local lockdown measures in Leicester have been lifted by the health secretary. Matt Hancock said that while coronavirus cases per 100,000 people were still above average in the city, restrictions on schools and early years childcare could be lifted, while local authorities would be able to close non-essential shops where necessary. The rules will apply to the city of Leicester, as well as Oadby and Wigston in Leicestershire. Leicester’s mayor is “angry, frustrated” and “very disappointed” that some measures remain in place. Peter Soulsby said he believed the government had “released the Tory voters” from the restrictions in its amendment of the boundaries of the local lockdown, rather than focussing on the areas with a particular rise in cases. A further 66 people have died in UK hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for Covid-19. Although the Department of Health and Social Care death tally now stands at 45,053, the figures do not include all deaths including coronavirus across the UK, which are thought to have passed 55,000. Sage scientists advised the government to impose lockdown around a week before it was implemented. The government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told a science and technology committee that the group had advised the government to put the measures in place “as soon as possible” on the 16 or 18 March, after realising in mid-March that “we were further ahead in the pandemic than had been thought”. The government does not yet have capacity to carry out the 350,000 Covid-19 tests a day needed this winter. During the committee meeting, Vallance said the government “haven’t got the capacity to meet that at the moment”, in relation to a report by the Academy of Medical Sciences that suggested the tests would need to be carried out on people as they show symptoms of flu or coronavirus during the winter. Scotland has recorded its first coronavirus-related death in eight days. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the country’s total deaths now stands at 2,491, while 18,384 people have tested positive for the virus. About one in three companies plan to lay off staff over the next three months, a report has warned. The British Chamber of Commerce said 29% of businesses in a survey of 7,400 firms planned to cut the size of their workforce before November."
2020-07-16T17:51:39Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Raab belatedly acknowledges Russian threat – but why now?,"Dominic Raab has confirmed what everybody already knew: Vladimir Putin’s spies are busy trying to interfere in British democracy. On Thursday the foreign secretary laid out details of how Moscow hackers sought to meddle in last December’s general election by leaking details of confidential US-UK trade talks. The apparent beneficiary was Jeremy Corbyn. The then Labour leader produced the stolen document as proof that the NHS was “on the table” in negotiations with Washington. As Moscow plots go, the hack was pretty low-key. For some time the dossier, posted on Reddit, was ignored until it eventually found its way into the media ecosystem. The spies who disseminated it are believed to work for Russia’s foreign intelligence agency, the SVR. This outfit has a number of names, including Cozy Bear, APT29 and the Dukes. The hackers are veterans of numerous operations, including the audacious cyber-raid in 2016 against Democratic party servers and the then presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Raab’s announcement confirms that Putin is actively seeking to damage and disrupt UK politics. But the timing of the disclosure is curious. Downing Street revealed the news hours after parliament’s new intelligence and security committee – headed not by Boris Johnson’s preferred candidate, Chris Grayling, but by the now former Tory Julian Lewis – agreed to release a long-awaited Russia report. That will now be published next week. In the meantime, Raab’s move looks designed to give the impression that the Russians back Labour. It’s true that in cold war times the KGB covertly supported western communist parties, funnelling them large amounts of cash. Its most famous double agents, the Cambridge spies, were idealistic communists. But in recent years Putin’s preferred vector of influence has been the anti-EU far right. His agents have supported radical populist movements across Europe and beyond. Moscow has lent millions of euros to the party run by France’s Marine Le Pen. The Kremlin and its emissaries have built up strategic alliances with Eurosceptic forces in a host of western countries, including Italy, Austria and Germany. And the UK. What Raab failed to mention is that the Kremlin ran a significant espionage operation in 2016 in support of Brexit. It took place at the same time as Russia’s sweeping and systematic campaign across the pond to help make Donald Trump president. The two spy dramas overlapped. They often featured the same operatives and the same social media trolls, sitting in an office in St Petersburg. Downing Street aides downplayed the Russia report on Thursday. They said it contains little new. This may well be correct. Nonetheless, their apparent insouciance sits oddly with recent events. Johnson has burned through much political capital by trying to keep the report secret. His treatment of Lewis, kicked out of the Conservative party on Wednesday for outwitting Grayling, was nothing less than vengeful. That was the view of the former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, at least. There are several areas of potential embarrassment for Downing Street that may explain the prime minister’s behaviour. One of the witnesses who gave evidence to the ISC in its old incarnation was the former intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who headed MI6’s Russia desk. In 2006 he led the investigation into the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, killed by two Moscow assassins using a cup of radioactive tea. In a seven-page memo seen by the Guardian, Steele said he alerted British intelligence professionals in late 2016 to the possibility that the Russians had compromised Trump. The then prime minister, Theresa May, and Johnson as foreign secretary were briefed on this. But they allegedly chose not to investigate further, fearful of Trump’s reaction. Steele also told the ISC there were “indications” that Moscow had interfered in pro-leave groups. The then government didn’t pursue this either. Instead, according to Steele, it “threw a blanket” over both claims, putting party political interest and a UK-US trade deal above national security. More than their predecessors, May and Johnson were unwilling to call out Russian meddling, he suggested. It is unclear how much of Steele’s evidence has made its way into the final report. Some of it may appear in a classified annexe, shared only within Whitehall. The annexe may also address another tricky area for the government: party funding. Moscow-linked donors have – legally – contributed millions to the Conservative party over the past decade, and the cash has continued to roll in following Johnson’s election win. Putin, since becoming president two decades ago, has played a weak hand with exceptional skill. His goal, as ever, is to undermine the enemy and to exploit fissures within western societies. Raab’s announcement is belated acknowledgement of this fact. He now needs to admit that Russian interference is a cross-party problem and that the Conservatives have also been its beneficiary."
2020-07-16T13:15:13Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak’s Covid-19 package recycled up to £10bn spending – IFS,"Rishi Sunak has been accused of repackaging up to £10bn of previously announced government spending to form the backbone of his summer statement plan to save jobs during the pandemic. Serving the chancellor with a blunt rebuke, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said it was “corrosive to public trust” for the government to reallocate old funds and pass them off as new money. It said at least £8bn and up to a third of the £30bn coronavirus response package announced by Sunak in his summer statement last week would be funded from underspending on previously planned projects. David Phillips, an associate director at the IFS, said: “It makes scrutiny of plans more difficult and is corrosive to trust. While governments of all stripes will, of course, want to follow the adage of ‘repetition, repetition, repetition’ when it comes to highlighting the goodies they are funding, official policy documents should also be clear about when and where spending is expected to be lower than previously planned too.” The country’s leading tax and spending thinktank said the package unveiled by the chancellor included £5.5bn in transport and infrastructure projects announced by Boris Johnson that was in fact money reallocated from other schemes. The government has been clear that the infrastructure package announced in the prime minister’s “new deal” speech was from old money, representing instead the acceleration of previously planned investments. Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, wrote on Twitter: “All that extra money announced by govt last week not quite what it seems. The ‘Rooseveltian’ additional £5.5bn of capital spending represents an increase of precisely zero this year on budget plans. Is a reallocation from one set of projects to another.” In addition, the IFS said, the £2bn “green homes grant” announced by Sunak to help insulate Britain’s energy-inefficient homes had been allocated from previously announced spending, and the £400m for traineeships, apprenticeships, school leavers and careers advice in England was from an existing funding pot. Labour said the report was evidence that the government was doing too little to protect jobs as the British economy sinks into the deepest recession for 300 years, triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. Unemployment is expected to more than double this year, to hit the highest levels since the 1980s. Bridget Phillipson, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “The summer statement unravels with every passing day. Money targeted to those who don’t need it, money for second homeowners rather than social housing, and now money for new pledges using money for old ones. “Passing old money off as new is no way to save jobs.” Earlier this week, the government’s tax and spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said the chancellor’s £30bn plan to save jobs was worth about £20bn. It said this reflected the fact that many of the measures were already in its forecasts, and that it did not expect the government to pay out all of the £9.4bn earmarked for paying £1,000 bonuses to businesses bringing back furloughed staff. The IFS said the discrepancies in the chancellor’s statement emerged because the UK’s devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were in line to receive less money than would have been the case if the spending package were entirely new. It said the Scottish government would have got about about £750m via the Barnett formula – the system for allocating the share of new public spending to the devolved administrations – if the funds were new. Instead, Scotland will receive about £21m for the additional spending measures in Sunak’s statement. It will also get more due to the chancellor cutting stamp duty, with Holyrood set to receive about £120m in total, the IFS said.
Alison Thewliss, the Scottish National party’s Treasury spokeswoman, said the Tories had been “caught out bending the truth”, adding: “Much of the money is recycled and reallocated from previous spending, with just a fraction of new investment. When it comes to saving jobs, smoke and mirrors simply won’t cut it.” The IFS said reductions in spending in some areas and shifting the funds elsewhere was reasonable, because old projects may now be deemed less of a priority or infeasible due to Covid-19. However, it said, a lack of transparency over where spending would be lower had led to confusion over the scale of the support. Phillips said: “A lack of illumination leaves significant scope for misunderstanding and even misrepresentation of the UK government’s plans. So, can the UK government please turn on the lights?” A Treasury spokesperson said: “This suggestion is wrong. The Treasury has approved additional activity by departments as part of the plan for jobs.” • This article was amended on 17 July 2020. An earlier version which said that the Scottish government will receive about £21m for the additional spending measures in Sunak’s statement had not taken into account the cut in stamp duty, which brings the total up to about £120m. This has been corrected."
2020-07-16T10:52:45Z,politics,Politics,Julian Lewis: attempt to impose Grayling was 'improper request',"The new chairman of parliament’s intelligence and security committee has condemned Downing Street’s attempt to impose its “preferred candidate” Chris Grayling hours after being expelled from the parliamentary Conservative party. As the committee confirmed it would publish a long-awaited report into Russian interference in UK politics, Julian Lewis, a senior backbencher, said he did not respond to party whips to vote for Grayling as he considered it to be an “improper request”. The report is expected to be published next Wednesday, it is understood. His comments will pitch Lewis, a long standing supporter of Brexit and the armed forces, against Boris Johnson’s advisers who wished to impose Grayling upon the committee. The committee is regularly briefed by the security services and considers some of Parliament’s most sensitive information. Lewis was expelled from the parliamentary Conservative party on Wednesday after securing the prestigious ISC chairmanship with the support of opposition members. The committee confirmed on Thursday it would publish the report into Russian interference in UK politics before the summer recess. In a statement, Lewis said the 2013 Justice and Security Act explicitly removed the right of the prime minister to choose the ISC chairman and gave it to the committee members. “It was only yesterday afternoon that I received a text asking me to confirm that I would be voting for the prime minister’s preferred candidate for the ISC chair,” he said. “I did not reply as I considered it an improper request. At no earlier stage did I give any undertaking to vote for any particular candidate,” he said. A senior government source had explained Lewis’s ejection from the party by saying he “has been told by the chief whip that it is because he worked with Labour and other opposition MPs for his own advantage”. Johnson nominated five Conservative MPs for the committee last week – giving them a majority – and Grayling was widely expected to become chair. Sources said he and the government were “surprised” by Lewis’s decision to stand. Lewis, the MP for New Forest East since 1997, has twice chaired the House of Commons’ defence select committee. He was described by the former national security adviser Peter Ricketts as someone “with much wider experience of defence and security”. In Thursday’s statement, Lewis said Johnson had no right to dictate who chairs the committee. “The 2013 Justice and Security Act explicitly removed the right of the prime minister to choose the ISC chairman and gave it to committee members. I remember this well as I served on the committee from 2010 to 2015,” he said. “There is no other Conservative MP in the House of Commons with any past experience of working on the ISC.” Lewis’s chairmanship has paved the way for the Russia report, which was sent to Downing Street in October, to finally be released. The report includes evidence from UK intelligence services concerning Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. Following speculation the new committee chair, who was widely expected to be Grayling, could delay it further or rewrite it, a short statement from the committee said it would be released within days. A spokesperson for the ISC said: “The committee has unanimously agreed this morning that it will publish the report on Russia prepared by its predecessor before the house rises for the summer recess.” The government could seek to remove Lewis from the ISC by tabling a motion to replace him in the Commons, which MPs would have to approve. This tactic could run into trouble. Lewis has many allies on the Tory benches, including those who support increased defence spending. One senior backbench MP told the Guardian Lewis had charm, a quality that many of Johnson’s advisers lack. “Julian Lewis knows how to work the tearoom in a way that Dominic Cummings, who has insulted most MPs at one time or another, has never quite worked out. “When he stood to become chair of the defence committee, he would produce his own handmade leaflets – including photos of himself wearing Navy uniform – and walk MPs to the voting booths with a smile and a pat on the back. People like him.” The Conservative MP Peter Bone accused Downing Street of having a “huge hissy fit” over Lewis who is “exceptionally well qualified” and will do an “excellent job”. In the Commons, Bone asked if there would be an attempt to remove the new chair. “Will the Leader of the House confirm that he will not bring forward a motion to remove (Mr Lewis) from the ISC?” Bone said. Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg refused to rule out any such move: “[ Lewis] was playing ducks and drakes with the Labour Party and that is why the whip has been withdrawn,” he replied. Unlike previous chairs of the committee, the former transport secretary Grayling had little experience of security matters and was dubbed “failing Grayling” for a series of policy blunders during his time in government.
The former Tory cabinet minister and ex-chairman of the intelligence and security committee, Dominic Grieve, told BBC’s Newsnight: “What troubles me about this episode – quite apart from its utter absurdity, and now withdrawing the whip from Julian, who is indeed highly respected – is the mindset it gives about what on earth is going on in Downing Street. “Why did they try to manipulate this process? They shouldn’t have done. “The committee can only exist, the committee can only be respected ... if it is seen to be non-partisan and independent.”"

Rachel Maclean, MP and parliamentary undersecretary of state for transport, has also apologised to local residents in Ashford that they had to learn the news from the press. “We sincerely apologise that information on this matter made its way into the press before we were able to communicate with you directly,” she said. “We have not been able to inform you of our interest in the site before now for reasons of commercial confidentiality.”
News of the plans for the 1.2m sq ft “Mojo” site between Sevington and Mersham villages came out of the blue on Friday night, infuriating the local Conservative MP, Damian Green, who told Gove on Monday it was “wrong-headed” to agree a secret deal with no consultation with locals. He demanded to know what “environmental impact assessment” the government had conducted given the site was next to a planned housing estate and the local hospital. “So many new houses are being built in that area and it will mean people are buying homes in good faith not knowing this was planned. “It’s also close to the William Harvey hospital, where any disruption to traffic in the local area could literally be fatal,” he told Kent online. Maclean has confirmed that the site will get approval via the secretary of state and not the usual local planning processes through what is known as a “special development order”, or SDO. “We can however now confirm that the Department for Transport (DfT) has purchased the site and intends to make use of it in the context of our planning for the end of the EU transition period,” she said. “Our use of the site will require further planning consent, which the government intends to pursue by means of a SDO process,” she added. The site would be used both for customs clearance and as a holding pen for lorries if there was any congestion in Dover. She said: “First, government departments envisage using it as a permanent site for facilities related to future border processes, notably HMRC (as an office of departure/arrival for goods moved under ‘transit’ arrangements) and Defra (as a border control post for goods needing sanitary and phytosanitary checks). “Second, the site may also be used as a contingency lorry holding area for the particular, foreseeable risk of significant disruption at the end of the transition period.” Locals expressed anger at the potential noise and air pollution with the “stop-start” of lorries through the night and constant noise of refrigeration trailers. A Green party spokeswoman, Mandy Rossi, also expressed concern that the congestion on the roads would hold up ambulance services and could ultimately lead to the closure of the hospital as there is talk of a super-hospital to combine three A&Es in the county. The customs clearance site is needed from 1 January next year, when the UK leaves the customs union and the single market and all those who trade with the EU will require customs declarations in addition to other paperwork. HM Revenue & Customs estimates that 400m customs declarations will need to be processed a year but it only unveiled its detailed plans on Monday, less than six months before the most dramatic change to international trading systems since 1993, when the single market was introduced. Maclean told residents there would be no problems if businesses did their bit and got Brexit ready. “Significant problems at the border are not inevitable if businesses take the action necessary to prepare for the changes to come,” she said. The government is expecting to purchase or lease between 10 and 12 sites across the country for Brexit border facilities, including sites near other ferry ports, including Holyhead and Portsmouth, in a £427m infrastructure programme. Gove confirmed on Thursday that the government had identified five sites in Kent where it intended to build new infrastructure to carry out checks A DfT spokeswoman said: “This site will form part of our ongoing plans to help ensure the free flow of freight at the border as we make our new start at the end of the transition period.”"
2020-07-15T23:01:16Z,politics,Politics,"No-deal Brexit would hit 'red wall' areas hard, manufacturers warn","Britain’s manufacturers have warned Boris Johnson that former “red wall” seats won by the Tories in last year’s election would be at most risk of severe economic damage from Brexit talks collapsing. Sounding the alarm with less than six months before the end of the Brexit transition period, the manufacturing lobby group Make UK and the accountancy firm BDO said industrial areas in the north of England, the Midlands and Wales could face a “triple whammy” should a deal with the EU fail to emerge. On top of the economic hit to the country at large from coronavirus and Brexit, it said traditional industrial heartlands had greater trade links with the EU than other places, exacerbating the damage to jobs and growth should talks fail. In their regional economic outlook report, Make UK and BDO said regions with formerly solid Labour “red wall” constituencies had a high dependence on exports to the EU, as well as a higher-than-average dependence on manufacturing, which would put them at most risk from a no-deal scenario with barriers to trade and tariffs. It said almost two-thirds of exports from Wales, the north-east of England and Yorkshire and the Humber went to the EU, while the contribution of manufacturing to the economy overall in these regions was higher than the national average. Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of Make UK, said: “Should the UK fail to reach a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU, then those regions with a high concentration of manufacturing and a dependence on Europe as a major market will suffer a triple hit, given the impact of Covid-19. For some companies the combination may prove fatal.” Despite mounting fears over the scale of the economic damage from Britain exiting the transition period without a deal, the government has no plans to publish an economic impact assessment. The last time official analysis of the economic impact was published was in November 2018, as Theresa May struggled to get her Brexit deal through parliament. At that time, the government said Britain’s economy would be 9.3% smaller after 15 years under no deal than it would have been under remain. On Tuesday the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, told MPs on the Commons Treasury committee that it would be difficult for economic forecasters now to come up with an accurate forecast due to the coronavirus crisis. “Given all the uncertainty in our economy I don’t think it would be a particularly accurate or constructive exercise,” he said."
2020-07-15T19:15:34Z,politics,Politics,Civil servant in charge of bullying inquiry into Priti Patel to leave post,"The senior civil servant in charge of the bullying inquiry into the home secretary, Priti Patel, is to leave her post next month in another major Whitehall shake-up. Helen MacNamara’s new role as a permanent secretary in an as-yet unidentified Whitehall department will heighten speculation that No 10 is clearing the way for Patel to be cleared of multiple bullying allegations. The director general of propriety and ethics has previously been identified as the person blocking No 10 from clearing Patel in a report that has been sitting on the prime minister’s desk for several weeks. MacNamara, who deputised for ousted cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill, will now take up a new position in another major Whitehall department. Her departure is the latest in a string of moves which have included Sedwill’s departure as national security adviser as well as cabinet secretary, the acrimonious exit of Philip Rutnam as Patel’s Home Office permanent secretary and the early retirement of Simon McDonald as permanent secretary at the Foreign Office. Boris Johnson’s top aide Dominic Cummings, an avowed Whitehall reformer, has said “a hard rain” is going to fall on the civil service. The job of ethics chief is crucial and sits at the heart of the No 10 operation. The appointed candidate oversees the provision of advice to all government departments on standards and ethics issues and manages public appointments. One Whitehall source said: “This move is a signal that No 10 will move on anyone who might challenge them on the legality or ethics of what Boris and Cummings want to do. “Control that office and you no longer have to stick to the rules when it comes to outside appointments.” MacNamara conducted an inquiry into the home secretary after former staff from three different government departments claimed that Patel had been guilty of mistreating staff. Her inquiry interviewed former staff from the Department for Work and Pensions, where Patel worked as an employment minister in 2015, and the Department for International Development where Patel was secretary of state in 2017. MacNamara also interviewed staff from the Home Office while investigating bullying claims from Rutnam, who resigned as permanent secretary earlier this year. Johnson authorised the inquiry four months ago, and insisted at the time that Patel would be exonerated. Leaks from Whitehall have since claimed that Patel was about to be cleared, but it has not yet been released. A report in the Financial Times on Wednesday claimed that the findings were being held back because its “robust criticisms” of Patel could be embarrassing. Rutnam is suing the home secretary after accusing her of lying and of bullying staff in an explosive statement released in February. MacNamara was promoted to the grade of a permanent secretary by Sedwill just before he stepped down from the Cabinet Office. She is said by former colleagues to be hugely ambitious, rigorous and unflappable, and capable of most jobs across the civil service. Sedwill’s promotion of MacNamara was said by some insiders to be a way of ensuring that she was protected from being “thrown under a bus” once he stood aside, according to one Whitehall insider. One of the few senior women in the new Downing Street machine, she had previously been cited by government sources as evidence that Johnson’s No 10 operation is not overwhelmingly male-dominated. A senior government source said MacNamara had been promoted to permanent secretary in a major delivery department which had not yet been confirmed. There are currently vacancies in the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The cabinet secretary post is also vacant – though the government source said MacNamara would not be taking this most senior role."
2020-07-15T18:45:57Z,politics,Politics,MP who beat Chris Grayling to intelligence chair role loses Tory whip,"Boris Johnson was humiliated on Wednesday after Chris Grayling, his pick to lead parliament’s powerful intelligence and security committee, was unexpectedly rejected in an ambush by MPs. The former cabinet minister was defeated by fellow Conservative Julian Lewis – prompting an embarrassed Downing Street to kick the victor, who was accused of duplicitous behaviour, out of the parliamentary party. One source said Grayling “didn’t see it coming” as the nine members of the MPs’ committee voted five to four in favour of Lewis, with the four opposition members all voting against Grayling. A furious Downing Street responded by stripping the whip from Lewis – a Tory MP since 1997 – “because he worked with Labour and other opposition MPs to his own advantage”. The committee, responsible for oversight of Britain’s spy agencies, has agreed to meet again before recess and is expected to discuss publishing the long-delayed report into Russian interference in British politics. The Scottish National party’s shadow defence secretary, Stewart McDonald MP, said: “With his abysmal record of failure as a Tory minister, Chris Grayling is the only man who could lose a rigged election.” Labour MP Stella Creasy called Lewis’s ejection from the Tories “remarkable”, adding: “It doesn’t stop Julian being chair of committee or sympathy for him across house. It does make it more likely the long overdue report into Russian interference in our political system is published. A set of own goals of which even Sunderland would be proud.” Grayling had been the prime minister’s choice for months, but his appointment was controversial even amongst Conservatives because of his error-prone record as a cabinet minister. He presided over the collapse of Northern and Thameslink rail services and the granting of a no-deal Brexit ferry contract to a company with no ships. As justice secretary, he part-privatised the probation service and banned prisoners from receiving books from relatives, a measure that was overturned in the courts. He was also a prominent supporter of leave in the 2016 referendum campaign.
Downing Street thought that it had dealt with the threat to him securing the intelligence committee role when it nominated what it thought were five loyal Conservative MPs, who were expected to vote Grayling through when the body met this week. But No 10 had not banked on Lewis, a former defence committee chair, putting himself forward, confident that the three Labour and one SNP members of the committee would support him instead. The intelligence and security committee meets in secret. Its members decide who is to become chair when it is reconstituted after a general election – a process that has been delayed for months. The committee now has a short window before the start of the summer recess in which it could publish the Russia report, delayed since before the election when Johnson refused to clear it for publication. The document examines Kremlin interference in British public life and earlier this week the senior Labour MP on the committee, Kevan Jones, said “there was no reason why” it could not be released by next Wednesday. Downing Street says that the document is relatively anodyne, although it comes with a secret annexe. Others who have read it say there is considerable detail of interest worth examining. Opposition members of the committee are Jones and fellow Labour MP Diana Johnson, the SNP MP Stewart Hosie and the Labour peer Lord West. Aside from Grayling, the other Conservatives are backbench MPs Theresa Villiers, Sir John Hayes and Mark Pritchard. Downing Street had been pushing Grayling to lead the committee since March, but the process was held up partly by coronavirus and difficulties in finding five people who it thought would back him in the sensitive post. It said that it always made it clear “it was for the committee to elect its own chair”. Lewis has a track record of surprises. In the 1970s as a young man, he infiltrated the Newham North East Labour party, taking control of it briefly in a failed attempt to defend sitting MP Reg Prentice, who eventually defected to the Conservatives. Following Lewis’ success, Lord Ricketts, the former national security adviser, said the body was now in the “hands of someone with much wider experience of defence and security”. Lord Ricketts had warned that Grayling does not “match up” to the authority and reputation of former chairs. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael said Johnson had appointed “yes men” to the intelligence and security committee but “true to form … failing Grayling has been undone in his bid to be chair”. He added: “I hope we now have a committee with real teeth that can hold this government to account. That starts by publishing the report into Russian interference of our democracy before the summer recess so MPs can scrutinise it fully.”"
2020-07-15T18:44:01Z,politics,Politics,Labour set to apologise to antisemitism whistleblowers,"Labour is poised to make a formal apology to antisemitism whistleblowers as part of a settlement designed to draw a line under allegations made during the Jeremy Corbyn era, the Guardian has learned. The whistleblowers sued the party for defamation in the wake of a BBC Panorama investigation last year. No final settlement has been reached but sources said an agreement was imminent, prompting anger from Corbyn allies who accused the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, of capitulating. Seven of the eight whistleblowers – all former Labour staffers – who featured in the documentary instructed the prominent media lawyer Mark Lewis to take action against the party. They claimed senior figures had issued statements attacking their reputations and suggesting they had ulterior political and personal motives to undermine the party. Among the former Labour staffers taking action are the former head of disputes Sam Matthews; the former head of compliance Mike Creighton; Dan Hogan, a former disputes team investigator; and Louise Withers Green, a former disputes officer. Iain McNicol, the former general secretary who was the eighth interviewee on the programme, is not involved in the action. The Panorama programme Is Labour Anti-Semitic?, which was screened in July last year, made a number of serious claims about the party’s internal culture for dealing with complaints of antisemitism. In a statement when the programme was broadcast, a Labour spokesman called them “disaffected former officials” and said they had “worked actively to undermine” Corbyn and had “both personal and political axes to grind”. Both Corbyn and the Momentum founder, Jon Lansman, also suggested in statements following the programme that it had a predetermined outcome. It is understood a formal apology has been requested from the party, to be read in open court. Labour declined to comment. Labour is expected to settle a separate case with the veteran journalist John Ware, who led the Panorama investigation and who sued over a statement by Labour that the BBC had engaged in “deliberate and malicious representations designed to mislead the public” in its broadcast. Ofcom rejected 28 complaints against the programme for alleged bias, concluding it was “duly impartial” and included the Labour party’s response prominently throughout. Labour under Starmer has appeared eager to reach agreements to end ongoing conflicts over the party’s antisemitism crisis. Any apology will prove controversial among Corbyn loyalists, who questioned whether settling it is a good use of party funds. The Guardian understands legal advice provided to Labour under Corbyn’s leadership suggested the party could win the case. One Corbyn-supporting former member of its ruling national executive committee said: “It was clear advice: we were told that the Labour party would win the Panorama case. Then Keir came in and he seems to have decided to settle. If the legal advice has changed, it should be shared with the NEC, and they should be allowed to ask whether it is a good use of a significant sum of money.” Some of the whistleblowers were named in a leaked internal report this year that revealed what it called a “hyper-factional” environment, in which hostility to Corbyn’s leadership hampered the smooth running of complaints procedures. The leaking of that report, and its contents, are the subject of an independent review chaired by the QC Martin Ford. Starmer’s dismissal of his former leadership rival and party frontbencher Rebecca Long-Bailey last month, after she retweeted an article containing what a party spokesperson referred to as an “antisemitic conspiracy theory”, reignited divisions over the issue. Corbyn was among MPs who demanded a meeting with Starmer the next day to protest Long-Bailey’s dismissal. Meanwhile, Labour MPs are awaiting the findings of the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s (EHRC) investigation into allegations of institutional antisemitism. The party revealed this week that it had received a draft of the report. Many of the key individuals involved during the period under investigation, including the former general secretary Jenny Formby, Corbyn’s chief of staff Karie Murphy the head of complaints Thomas Gardiner and the director of communications Seumas Milne have since moved on. “Really, all the crucial people have left,” said one insider. One person with knowledge of the EHRC report’s contents said it was “not a killer blow” for any of the individuals involved, and its findings were carefully couched in “legalese”. Senior Labour insiders expect it to focus on the failings of the party as a whole, rather than indicting individuals for specific decisions. The Guardian understands several individuals who had been warned to expect to receive extracts of the report – suggesting they were being personally criticised – have not yet received them. Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner, have both said publicly they will accept the EHRC’s findings; but Labour’s lawyers are nevertheless scrutinising the draft report in detail. In a statement after receiving the report, to which the party has 28 days to respond, a spokesman said the party was committed to fully implementing the commission’s recommendations. “Antisemitism has been a stain on the Labour party in recent years. It has caused unacceptable and unimaginable levels of grief and distress for many in the Jewish community, as well as members of staff,” the spokesman said. “Tackling antisemitism within the Labour party is a priority and we are determined to take the further action necessary to begin restoring trust with the Jewish community. “We are committed to cooperating fully with the commission’s investigation and implementing its recommendations when the final report is published. We will be making no further comment.” Labour’s handling of antisemitism complaints prompted a number of high-profile departures, including that of the Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger, who said the leadership had allowed, “a culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation” to develop. The Labour Together report on December’s catastrophic general election performance cited the perception that Labour was divided – including over antisemitism – as one factor in its defeat."
2020-07-15T18:18:59Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Downing Street unable to back up PM's test-and-trace claim — as it happened,"We’re wrapping up this liveblog for today, so I’ll end with this summary. Have a good evening and thanks for reading. Boris Johnson for the first time committed to an “independent inquiry” into the coronavirus pandemic. The prime minister said it was not right to devote “huge amounts of official time” to an inquiry when the UK was “in the middle” of a pandemic. However, in response to a question from the acting Lib Dem leader Ed Davey, he said there would “certainly” be in inquiry “in the future”. Johnson indicated that he had not read a government-commissioned report setting out urgent measures needed to prepare for a possible second wave of coronavirus, telling the Commons only that he was “aware” of it. Johnson was questioned at length by Keir Starmer about the study by 37 senior doctors and scientists, published this week, and the need for an effective test-and-trace system to mitigate any new outbreak. The prime minister claimed the government’s test-and-trace system was “as good as or better than anywhere else in the world” – a claim Downing Street later failed to substantiate with evidence. The claim was made during a testy PMQs in which Johnson accused Starmer of “knocking the confidence” of the British people. A further 85 people in the UK have died of coronavirus in the latest 24-hour period, according to government figures. It takes the official death toll to 45,053, although the true figure is much higher when including excess deaths. Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, has said she was “deeply unhappy” with the much-criticised Public Health England report last month that failed to explain the reasons why people from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds were disproportionately affected by the coronavirus. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, described as “frankly ridiculous” the government’s insistence that face coverings do not need to be worn in takeaway shops – after Michael Gove was photographed leaving a Pret a Manger without wearing one on the day the government announced that face coverings would be mandatory in England’s shops from 24 July. Khan urged people to wear a face covering in all shops and takeaways: Stormont’s health minister, Robin Swann, will recommend to the Northern Ireland executive that the wearing of face coverings in shops in the region becomes mandatory. Swann said “everything possible must be done” to encourage the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor spaces. Chris Grayling, the former minister who is no stranger to career mishaps, has failed in his bid to become chairman of parliament’s intelligence and security committee. He had been widely expected to be elected to the post. Pubs in Ireland that do not serve food are set to remain closed until 10 August. Currently only bars that provide a substantial meal are allowed to sell alcohol."
2020-07-15T17:21:49Z,politics,Politics,Labour antisemitism row: the seven whistleblowers set to settle,"Seven former Labour staffers are expected to settle with the party after claiming it defamed them following a BBC Panorama programme that detailed a raft of antisemitism allegations, all denied by Labour. Sam Matthews He was Labour’s head of disputes and acting director of the governance and legal unit between 2016 and 2018, and the most prominent of the seven whistleblowers who appeared on Panorama. He claimed he witnessed “a deliberate attempt [by senior figures in the party] … to redefine what constituted modern-day antisemitism – mainly so they could let their mates off the charge”. He said he had considered suicide at his lowest ebb during the crisis. Kat Buckingham The former chief investigator in Labour’s disputes team told Panorama that the problem of antisemitism complaints was “massive”, “real” and “wasn’t constructed by embittered old Blairites, as we were frequently described as”. She said: “It would make no difference because … we had standards, we had clear rules that we had to try and uphold.” Mike Creighton He was director of audit and risk until 2017 and gave a contested account of an interaction with Labour’s then head of communications, Seumas Milne. Creighton said he told Milne the party should deal with top-level antisemitism cases more quickly. He also said Jeremy Corbyn should make a speech saying Israel had a right to exist, and alleged that Milne laughed at that suggestion – a claim Labour strongly denied. Ben Westerman The only Jewish member of the disputes team, he worked as an investigations officer for a year until 2017. He said he witnessed antisemitism and harassment during his time investigating the behaviour of constituency parties. “Coming from a family with a history of oppression because they were Jews, I thought this was intolerable,” he said. Martha Robinson One of the most junior staffers to go on the record, Robinson was a complaints administrator between 2018 and 2019. She said she spent “day after day” reading antisemitic comments from members, and claimed her recommendations for disciplinary action were often disregarded. Dan Hogan He worked as an investigations officer in the party for two years. In the documentary, he alleged that the former general secretary Jennie Formby brought in a number of new people after her appointment who “overruled us and downgraded what should’ve been a suspension to just an investigation, or worse to just a reminder of conduct – effectively a slap on the wrist”. Louise Withers Green A disputes officer, Green told the Guardian that a trip to the Holocaust memorial in Berlin convinced her to go public. “I wish there were more people that would speak out when things weren’t right, speak out against racism,” she said. “Even though this might be really horrible, in 30 years I’ll be really proud of myself that I’ve done it.”"
2020-07-15T16:06:53Z,politics,Politics,"Like a borderline sociopath, Johnson again misjudges the mood of the chamber | John Crace","It’s become a standard strategy for Boris Johnson at prime minister’s questions, ever since he got mullered in their first few outings. Unable to cope with the detail of Keir Starmer’s questions, he lashes out with diversionary tactics. Either accusing the Labour leader of doing something he hasn’t done, answering a completely different question or playing to the non-existent gallery of Tory backbenchers. There’s just one large spanner in the works. It’s not working. Because at every PMQs Boris merely reveals more of the true character he is trying to conceal. The thin-skinned, unprepared opportunist who cannot tolerate a word of scrutiny or criticism. It’s like dealing with a toddler. If you’re not 100% behind him, saying how marvellous he is, then you are totally against him. There are no in betweens. In terms of emotional development, Boris is barely out of nappies. How else can you explain Wednesday’s performance at PMQs other than as a full-on narcissistic breakdown? Starmer had started by asking about the lack of sector-specific support for aviation. Boris was outraged. Labour had broadly backed the chancellor’s bailout plans for other industries last week, so why was Starmer now choosing to make a fuss about widespread redundancies and BA’s plans to fire 30,000 employees and rehire them on worse terms and conditions? This was just talking Britain down.
“The Labour leader says one thing one week and another the next,” Boris yelled, hammering on the dispatch box with his index finger in a temper tantrum. This was quite some cheek as in the last few days we’ve had Michael Gove telling the Commons that there will be expensive and time consuming post-Brexit border checks – just about the only thing we will “build, build, build” are lorry parks – after assuring the country we would still have access to the single market. Not to mention Oliver Dowden reversing the decision to allow Huawei access to build our 5G network and poor Matt Hancock having to tidy up the mess the government had got itself into over wearing masks in shops. Starmer looked justifiably angry but did his best to control his emotions and moved on instead to the report from the Academy of Medical Sciences that had warned the UK risked another 120,000 deaths from the coronavirus over the coming winter. Wouldn’t now be a good time to make sure that the government’s test-and-trace system was working properly? Now Boris just leapt into the realms of fantasy. AKA pure Donald Trump. Our test-and-trace system was the envy of the world. The best there was. The very bestest, bigliest best. In which case the world might as well prepare for its end now as the test-and-trace figures are getting worse by the week.
Where once we were reaching 80% of the contacts – of the 25% of infected people we were managing to track – we were now down to barely 70%. At the current rate of decline, the whole system will be little better than guesswork in a few months. Or less if Mattbeth’s world-beating app makes an appearance in the meantime. “He should be building up the system, not undermining it,” Boris said, apparently unaware that no one had done more to reduce public confidence in the government’s response to the pandemic than him. Dominic Cummings excluded. Because at every opportunity, the prime minister has done too little, too late, which is one of the main reasons why the UK death figures genuinely are world beating. At this point, it dawned on Starmer that Boris almost certainly hadn’t read the report to which he had referred – a little slow on the uptake from the Labour leader as the prime minister never reads any reports of more than two paragraphs – so he asked him outright if he had. “Um ... er ...,” Boris hesitated. He was aware of the report. In the same way he is aware that he has children, but is unable to say exactly how many. And in the same way as I am aware of the space-time continuum but would be unable to explain exactly what the science meant to anyone. Though if it turned out that Boris only really existed in another parallel dimension then I’d happily settle for that. The Labour leader ended by basically accusing the prime minister of lying about the success of his government’s response and wondering what he might like to say to the families of those who had died – and of those who would die in the future – as a result of his negligence. It was a serious, solemn question. And one that was treated as a joke as Boris responded by saying Starmer had “more briefs than Calvin Klein”. I’m sure that gave all the bereaved a good chuckle. The prime minister’s ability to misjudge the mood of the chamber is borderline sociopathic. It had been yet another Johnson PMQs rocky horror show. A travesty of its true purpose and an insult to the country. People are dying. People are losing their jobs. People are terrified about the future. And yet to Boris it all still feels like a big game where the only thing at stake is his fragile ego. He did, when pushed by the Lib Dems’ Ed Davey, commit to a national inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic but not to any time soon. Certainly not in time to save any more lives this winter and certainly not before he has a chance to shift the blame on to someone else. At times like these, we need a leader in whom to believe. What we’ve got is a prime minister who urgently needs a therapist."
2020-07-15T16:05:20Z,politics,Politics,Labour and antisemitism: how the party became embroiled in crisis,"When did recent accusations of antisemitism within Labour begin? Concerns about the party’s ability to deal with instances of antisemitism were raised soon after Jeremy Corbyn’s election in 2015. Under his leadership of the party, there was a huge growth in the number of new members, many of whom were critics of Israel especially regarding its policies towards the Palestinians and its building of settlements in the occupied territories. There were claims that antisemitic tropes were being widely propagated on social media by leftwing party members. Corbyn and his supporters denied failing to tackle antisemitism, stating that he had fought against racism all his life. The first major row emerged in 2016 when the Labour MP for Bradford West, Naz Shah, apologised for an antisemitic Facebook post. In an effort to defend Shah, the former London mayor, Ken Livingstone, claimed during several interviews that Adolf Hitler supported Zionism. After one interview, Livingstone, a close ally of Corbyn, was confronted in front of television cameras by the Labour MP John Mann and accused of being “a Nazi apologist”. Livingstone eventually quit the party after a lengthy disciplinary process. How did Corbyn seek to investigate claims of antisemitism? Shami Chakrabarti, the former director of Liberty, was asked to investigate claims of widespread antisemitism within the party. She exonerated Labour but uncovered an “occasionally toxic atmosphere”. Corbyn’s critics claimed the report was a whitewash and questioned why she was given a peerage by Labour months after it was published. Why didn’t the Chakrabarti report succeed in drawing a line under the antisemitism claims? In 2017 and 2018, it became evident the party was receiving more complaints, with a backlog of hundreds of potential disciplinary cases. Labour MPs joined Jewish groups, including the Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and other anti-racism campaigners to demand action in an unprecedented “Enough is Enough” rally outside parliament. Corbyn apologised in April 2018 for hurt caused to the Jewish community by problems in the disciplinary process, and pointed to only 0.1% of members being under investigation for alleged antisemitic comments. The party also became mired in a row about whether to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, which it ended up ultimately approving. When did the complaints about antisemitism turn into a crisis? Last year, there were a number of high-profile resignations of MPs and peers over antisemitism – including the Jewish MP Luciana Berger – which dominated the news agenda once again. More Corbyn allies were accused of antisemitism. Chris Williamson, a then Labour MP, caused an outcry after saying the party had been “too apologetic” about antisemitism complaints. In May 2019, a member of Labour’s ruling national executive committee, Peter Willsman, was suspended after being recorded saying that the Israeli embassy was “almost certainly” behind the antisemitism row. That same month, the Equality and Human Rights Commission placed the party under formal investigation over whether it had unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish. The findings of that investigation are expected imminently. What did the 2019 BBC Panorama investigation allege? Eight whistleblowers spoke to the BBC for a programme broadcast in July 2019, with some saying they felt there was political meddling from Corbyn’s office in the process for handling antisemitism complaints. Seumas Milne, one of Corbyn’s closest aides and a former Guardian journalist, was accused of telling officials the party was “muddling up political disputes with racism” and must review processes. Jennie Formby, the party’s general secretary, was accused of attempting to interfere in who sat on a panel examining the case of Jackie Walker, a high-profile activist who was eventually expelled from the party. Labour strongly denied the allegations of political interference, saying the whistleblowers were disaffected former employees trying to undermine Corbyn. They started an action to sue the party for libel."
2020-07-15T12:35:29Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson indicates at PMQs he has not read winter coronavirus report,"Boris Johnson has indicated he has not read a government-commissioned report setting out urgent measures needed to prepare for a possible second wave of coronavirus, telling the Commons only that he was “aware” of it. Johnson was questioned at length by Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions about the study by 37 senior doctors and scientists, published this week, and the need for an effective test-and-trace system to mitigate any new outbreak. The 79-page report predicts that in a worst-case scenario, a resurgence of Covid-19 this winter could kill up to 120,000 people, and it says preparation for this in the coming weeks is vital to reduce the death toll. Starmer said: “I have to ask, in light of the last few questions: has the prime minister actually read this report, that sets out the reasonable worst-case scenario and tells the government what it needs to do about it in the next six weeks? Has he read it?”
Johnson replied: “I am, of course, aware of the report, and we are, of course, taking every reasonable step to prepare this country for a second spike,” bringing jeers from some opposition MPs. Starmer asked Johnson to commit to implementing all the recommendations of the report, which was commissioned by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser. Johnson did not do so, saying only that ministers would ensure the NHS was not overwhelmed by a second wave. Asked after PMQs whether Johnson had read the report, a Downing Street source said they did not know, as they had not asked him. A spokesman for Starmer said the report set out the potentially dire consequences of a second wave, adding: “It is deeply concerning that the prime minister hasn’t even bothered to read it.” The spokesman also condemned Johnson for his response to Starmer’s last question of the session. Starmer said he was meeting families bereaved by coronavirus later in the day, and asked Johnson what his message to them would be.
Johnson said he would do everything he could to prevent a second spike, but ended with a clearly prepared joke about Starmer’s legal past, saying: “He’s got more briefs than Calvin Klein.” Starmer’s spokesman said: “I think it tells you everything you need to know about the prime minister’s flippant approach to this crisis, and his style of leadership.” The leaders also clashed over the test-and-trace system for finding people potentially exposed to the virus, with Johnson saying the UK’s version was “as good as or better than any other system anywhere in the world”. Asked what was the basis for the prime minister’s claim, his spokesman cited statistics for the number of people the system had traced, but did not give any other evidence. . At PMQs, Starmer noted that proportion of contacts who had been tracked down had fallen in recent weeks. “What assurance can the prime minister give that the system will be fit for both purposes in the timeframe envisaged in this report – ie by this September?” he asked. Johnson replied by returning to a familiar theme of recent PMQs, accusing Starmer of selectively opposing government actions on coronavirus and “knocking the confidence of the country”. Starmer condemned Johnson’s approach. “It’s perfectly possible to support track and trace, and point out the problems,” he said. “And standing up every week saying it’s a stunning success is kidding no one. That isn’t giving people confidence in the system. They would like a prime minister who stands up and says: ‘There are problems, and this is what I’m going to do about them.’”
Answering a later question from Ed Davey, the Lib Dems’ interim leader, Johnson committed for the first time to holding an independent inquiry into the handling of the pandemic, while saying now was not the “right moment” for it. Asked when it might happen, the No 10 source gave no details: “He said an independent inquiry, and we’ll set out further details of the independent inquiry in due course.”"
2020-07-15T12:06:49Z,politics,Politics,Andrea Leadsom to review disadvantaged children's health,"Boris Johnson has appointed former cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom to carry out a review into how to improve health outcomes for babies and children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Leadsom said she would be focusing on the first 1,001 days of a baby’s life – from conception – and that her findings would contribute to the government’s “levelling up” agenda. “Ensuring that every baby has the best start in life is my passion in politics and I am delighted to be asked by the prime minister to chair a review of early years services on behalf of the government. “Infant mental health is about more than babies. It’s about improving our whole lives and striving for better outcomes that have a profound effect from cradle to grave.” She highlighted a range of problems faced by expectant mothers and new parents, from financial worries to mental health concerns. “There are all sorts of pressures,” she said. Challenged on whether the challenges had been exacerbated by cutbacks to Sure Start centres under successive Conservative governments, she said they are not always the right answer – with outreach being a better approach in sparsely-populated rural areas, for example. Leadsom said she had urged the prime minister to allow her to carry out a review, when he sacked her as business secretary in February’s reshuffle. “I made a really strong pitch, and Boris was genuinely enthusiastic,” she said. The review is due to report by next January, and will make recommendations to government departments. It will follow on from an inter-ministerial group Leadsom chaired when she was leader of the House of Commons, under Theresa May. She said she was “very worried” about the impact of the lockdown on babies and young children, with some face-to-face services scaled back, and unable to rely on parents for help. “Levelling up” was used as a slogan during the 2019 general election to underline the importance of regenerating regions outside London, and has since been used by ministers to describe the need to tackle other inequalities. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “We are determined to level up the opportunities for children, no matter where they come from or grow up.”"
2020-07-15T10:07:47Z,politics,Politics,Labour suspends Brighton councillor over alleged antisemitism,"A Labour councillor has been suspended over Facebook posts promoting alleged anti-Jewish conspiracy theories. Anne Pissaridou is the second Labour representative from Brighton and Hove to face investigation in relation to alleged antisemitic content, putting Labour’s minority control of the council at risk. Pissaridou, until recently the chair of the authority’s environment, transport and sustainability committee, was reported to the party’s compliance unit last week. In March, Nichole Brennan resigned as deputy chair of the housing committee after pictures emerged of her protesting against the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism. She remains under investigation. Both councillors were selected to run for Labour in the city with support from the leftwing Momentum group. In Pissaridou’s case, a Labour investigation will centre on a 2016 Facebook post she shared, which was taken from an alleged antisemitic conspiracy theory website.
It links a member of the Rothschild family with what it claimed to be the imminent collapse of the German banking system and warned about the need to stockpile food. The post includes a picture of a smiling Jacob Rothschild surrounded by bars of gold while an upset child grabs bottles of water. It is accompanied by a statement that the famous Jewish family had been in “de facto control of the world’s central banks for centuries”. Labour’s inquiry will also focus on a second post from August 2018 on a website run by Mike Sivier, who was expelled from Labour in the same year for posting comments online which the party said had breached its code of conduct on antisemitism. Sivier rejects the finding. The headline of the August 2018 post said: “Jewish Israeli journalist claims pro-Israel propagandists have ‘taken out contract’ to stop Jeremy Corbyn being elected.” Sivier says that his post, which quoted from an opinion piece by Haaretz columnist Gideon Levy, shows “no evidence of anti-Semitism”. In response to her suspension, Pissaridou said: “I am deeply sorry for my actions and any distress I have caused to the Jewish community. This happened several years ago, before I was a councillor, and the posts I shared do not reflect my views. “I do not seek to excuse my mistake. I deeply regret not properly reading information before sharing such hurtful links.” She said she would fully cooperate with any investigation. She will attend council meetings as an independent until Labour’s inquiry is completed. At least three other Labour activists in Brighton have been suspended from the party over allegations of antisemitism in recent weeks. A number have now left the party. In local government elections last year, Labour won just one more seat in Brighton and Hove than the Green party. • This article was amended on 16 July 2020 to make clear that Nichole Brennan resigned from the housing committee but not from the city council as an earlier version incorrectly said; neither has she been suspended from the Labour party. The Momentum group did not “select” Brennan and Anne Pissaridou to run for the council as originally stated; they were selected by the local party with Momentum support. The article was further amended on 20 July 2020 to clarify details relating to Mike Sivier’s expulsion from the Labour party in 2018, and to include his response to the findings made by the party and his position on the August 2018 web post."
2020-07-14T17:53:34Z,politics,Politics,Face masks to be compulsory in shops in England; UK death toll rises by 138 – as it happened,"Face coverings are to be mandatory in shops and supermarkets in England from 24 July, Matt Hancock confirmed. The health and social care secretary said a store can refuse someone entry if they arenâ€™t wearing one and call the police if thereâ€™s a problem. People who donâ€™t wear one will face fines of up to Â£100. Children under 11 and those with disabilities will be exempt from the new rule. The government will reach a decision about the future of Leicesterâ€™s local lockdown this week. The latest coronavirus data from the 14 days since lockdown was reimposed will be examined to determine whether restrictions can be eased. Data released on Monday suggested the rate of new cases of Covid-19 per 100,000 population in Leicester had fallen slightly. Blackburn with Darwen has introduced stricter measures to try to avoid a local lockdown after a rise in coronavirus cases. Wearing face coverings in all enclosed spaces, including workplaces and beauty salons, bumping elbows and limits on the number of people who can visit a household are among the measures, after 70 cases were recorded in the week to 11 July. The UKâ€™s death toll rose by 138 to 44,968. Thank you to everyone who got in touch today and to all of you for reading along.

2020-07-14T17:11:36Z,politics,Politics,Mattbeth fails to mask government's latest U-turn on covid face coverings | John Crace,"It can’t be long before Matt Hancock’s lucky pink tie springs to life and crawls away in shame. The tie and Matt have been an inseparable double act for several months now, but there’s only so much humiliation even a strip of polyester can take. Matt, though, appears immune to his own hubris. Rather, he wears it as a badge of honour. A sign of his indispensability to a regime that increasingly resembles that of a failed state, lurching hopelessly from one screw up to the next. Imagine the neediness – the lack of any self-worth – in that level of ambition. We’ve long passed the point where one member of the cabinet knows what another is doing. Left hand, meet right hand. On Friday we had Boris Johnson, having previously insisted that face masks were for wimps, saying that he thought it might be a good idea for people to wear them in shops. Though he stopped short of making it compulsory. On Sunday Michael Gove openly contradicted the prime minister and said it was down to the British public to use their old-fashioned “common sense”. By Monday, even the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, was hopelessly confused and declared that face masks should definitely maybe possibly be worn. All this took place against a background of months – if not years – of research into the spread of coronavirus in other countries, that indicated masks were an effective way of reducing the risk of infection in public places. Though apparently not in the UK. So it was almost an inevitability that come Tuesday, the government would be forced into yet another embarrassing U-turn and that the person to take the hit of making a statement in the Commons would be the health secretary himself. Hancock began on the offensive. The government had a remarkable record in its handling of the pandemic. Remarkable as in taking almost every key decision far too late and winding up with one of the world’s highest mortality rates. Infection rates were coming down and as long as we could all conveniently forget the recent report from the Academy of Medical Sciences that predicted a possible 120,000 deaths in a second wave in the winter, then we could all have a jolly couple of months while the lockdown was being eased. Oh, and by the way, Matt had now decided that masks in shops were a good idea after all. Though not such a good idea that they would be introduced immediately. Far better to wait another 10 days for that as the government had top level intelligence that the coronavirus had declared an amnesty and wouldn’t be infecting anyone before 24 July. Which will come as a huge relief to shop workers who have a mortality risk 60-75% higher than the rest of the general population. After 24 July, there would be a £100 fine for refuseniks: before then just a possible death penalty. Up till now, the shadow health secretary, John Ashworth, has tended to give Mattbeth the benefit of the doubt and tried to offer constructive criticism in his replies to ministerial statements. But this time enough was enough. How was it that the government consistently managed to make such a balls-up of all its messaging? It had been obvious from the start that face masks in shops were a good idea, so why the delay in implementing them? And while he was about it, perhaps Hancock might like to clear up the advice on work? Because the current government position was that it was a good idea to work both at home and in the office. Perhaps everyone could split the difference and do their work on public transport instead? Matt wasn’t at all happy at being talked to like this by Ashworth. He can take any amount of shaming from his cabinet colleagues, but he can’t face a reality check from the opposition and his reply was decidedly tetchy. No one would have done better than him. Which was true. No one would have been as good an option. There wasn’t much more to be said about masks in shops – no point in rubbing it in – so most Labour MPs chose to enquire about the failures of the track and tracing system. Which only made Hancock grumpier still. The Tory MPs mostly seemed to be under instructions to not mention the masks, though Desmond Swayne thought the whole idea of shopping in a face covering to be “a monstrous imposition”. Presumably it’s an Englishman’s right to spread germs wherever he pleases. Another Conservative, James Davies, also broke ranks – “don’t mention the war!” – by asking if masks should now be introduced in bars and restaurants. “No,” said Matt firmly, thereby ensuring he will be back in the Commons within a matter of days to make masks in bars and restaurants compulsory. The only plus side for Hancock was that he wasn’t the only cabinet minister having a bad day, as Oliver Dowden had earlier had to perform a U-turn on the government’s decision taken in January to allow Huawei to build the UK’s 5G network. Oliver isn’t the brightest – he makes Mattbeth look positively quick-witted – and he looked understandably miserable throughout. But then he was being asked to talk pure bollocks. It was fine to allow Huawei access till 2027 as the Chinese had given a written undertaking they definitely wouldn’t be doing any spying in the next seven years. And it had absolutely been the right thing for the government to give the go-ahead in January and then to change its mind now. No contradiction whatsoever. And certainly no pressure from the US over future trade deals. It had all been yet another calculated act to make the UK look as weak and indecisive as possible. The one thing at which the government currently excels."
2020-07-13T19:46:18Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak cannot just hope other big firms will follow Primark's example | Nils Pratley,"Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, readily conceded last week that there would be a “dead weight” cost to his policy of offering firms a £1,000 bonus for every employee recalled from furlough and kept in employment until the end of next January. That weight is the waste of rewarding firms for doing what they would have done anyway as the economy reopens. So it is good news, of a sort, for Sunak that some are too embarrassed to take the money. Primark was first out of the blocks at the weekend. The fashion retailer didn’t need a financial incentive to get 30,000 furloughed staff back in the shops and warehouses, so it would decline the kind offer of £30m of public money. Well played. Primark’s honourable stanceunderlines the shockingly poor design of Sunak’s “job retention bonus” scheme. Yes, in a few cases, a £1,000-per-employee incentive may change the financial calculation for an employer, but one suspects the numbers will be tiny. Jim Harra, the chief executive of HMRC, grasped the point when he formally told the chancellor that the scheme, with a theoretical maximum payout of £9.4bn, did not offer “value for money”. If it’s too awkward for Sunak to plead with big companies to follow Primark’s example, someone should be put on the case. An energetic junior minister could save a billion or two here. Fast fashion slowdown is best route out of warehouse scandal Another day, another clothing retailer facing reports of pay abuses in its supply chain in Leicester. This time it was Quiz promising a “full review” of auditing processes after cases were found of workers being offered £3-£4 an hour to make garments for the label. Meanwhile, the mini-recovery in the share price of Boohoo, the retailer that sources 40% of its garments from Leicester, reversed. The shares fell 18%. Investors have understood that this affair will not go away quickly. Any doubt on that point was removed on Friday when Aberdeen Standard Investments called Boohoo’s board’s response to last week’s revelations “inadequate in scope, timeliness and gravity”. As with Boohoo, the Times’ report about Quiz involved work being passed on to subcontractors, with visibility of the supply chain being lost (or not sufficiently sought). This is the aspect that deters some rival retailers. If you are truly committed to knowing every detail of where and how your clothes are manufactured, they say, Leicester’s textile industry is not the place for you. The location is seen as too risky – it’s too hard to gain 100% confidence in the quality operators. Some Leicester refuseniks, though, also make a more cheerful point. If visibility and trust improved, they are not averse to moving some manufacturing back to the UK. Price gains from off-shoring production are becoming harder to achieve; quick turnaround times and closeness to customers now have increasing competitive appeal for mid-market labels, not just the likes of Boohoo. Rehabilitation of the reputation of the UK textiles industry is clearly not likely to happen quickly after the revelations of the past fortnight. But a move upmarket, and away from fast fashion, looks the only promising route. BlackRock needs to be more muscular with climate laggards BlackRock’s conversion to sustainable investing came late. It was only in January this year that Larry Fink, the chief executive of the world’s largest asset manager, made the critical declaration that sustainability was “the strongest foundation for client portfolios going forward” – in other words, that being responsible can be financially good for you. There was still scepticism, however. Would BlackRock, even as it was ditching a few thermal coal companies from its actively- managed portfolios, use its immense voting power to upset the boards of environmental laggards? The only voting commitment sounded alarmingly weak: to be “increasingly disposed” to vote against boards. Well, the first post-epiphany results have arrived. BlackRock says in the past year it took “voting actions on climate issues” at 53 companies. That compares to with just six in the previous year. An eightfold increase is not quite as impressive as it may seem since most big European fund houses are still far more militant on voting. But it’s a start. If it signifies genuine change, keep pressing. BlackRock also placed a further 191 companies “on watch” on climate disclosures and policies, so there’s room to be more muscular."
2020-07-13T19:20:14Z,politics,Politics,UK to open 10-12 Brexit border customs sites in EU trading shake-up,"The UK government is to build “10 to 12” new Brexit border customs and controls sites across the country in a move that Michael Gove has said cements the mission to “take back control” from the EU. In the biggest shake-up to trading with the EU for 50 years, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster announced the £470m programme for facilities to process freight going to and from the EU, along with a 206-page document detailing new border controls. Five sites are likely to be in Kent and are expected to be operational by 1 January, when the UK leaves the customs union and single market. They will handle up to 400m customs declarations a year, insiders said on Monday, with HM Revenue & Customs writing to 12,000 businesses trading with the EU – who up to now have not had to fill in customs declarations – warning them of the changes ahead. Gove told the House of Commons that January marked “the next chapter of our history as a fully independent United Kingdom”, which could determine its own recovery path from Covid-19 without deferring to Brussels. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said that with this dramatic change to the trading regime announced just months before Brexit becomes operational, many businesses were wondering “whether the oven was even turned on” when Boris Johnson promised voters his “oven-ready deal”. She said government estimates of 400m customs declarations a year would add £12.8bn in costs to British business. The new trading system will be phased in over six months with checks on food and goods of animal origin, as well as customs declarations on imports and exports at the border by July. Government insiders warned the new systems and process would apply whether or not there was a free trade deal and said it was “an important message” to get across to businesses. Extra layers of controls with veterinary certificates and health checks will be required for the import of food, live animals including racehorses and the wooden crates or pallets on which they are carried. If a trade deal is struck there will be additional checks on the origin of the goods and possible tariffs, depending on the agreement with the EU. Together they represent the reversal of 47 years of no trade barriers, including when the single market was launched in 1993. Gove insisted that the government was still in confidential “commercial negotiations” for the Brexit border facilities including a 27-acre site on the outskirts of Ashford.
He rebuffed demands from several MPs to name the shortlist of sites, causing anger at the lack of consultation with local communities over what many fear will lead to noise, air and water pollution. Damian Green, the Conservative MP for Ashford, asked Gove “what environmental impact assessment has been done” for the proposed site in his constituency as it was next to planned housing and the local hospital. Government sources said some of the five sites in Kent would be holding pens, or lorry parks, and not facilities for checking customs, transit and health certificates. Sources in Kent believe Ebbsfleet International and the disused Manston airport near Ramsgate are under consideration for lorry parks in the event of congestion on the roads to Dover. Manston has recently been given the green light to reopen as an air freight cargo hub but could still be used next year as a contingency for traffic congestion on the roads to Dover. Tim Reardon, the head of EU exit at the Port of Dover, welcomed the confirmation of inland controls as gridlock was otherwise almost a certainty in the town. “They’ve taken on board the key principles that they need to get the processes moved away from the border, but there is still a lot of work to be done to finalise everything,” he said. Many industry leaders have warned that the government has left the infrastructure and IT systems too late to develop, threatening chaos in the first few months of 2021 if lorries arrive in Dover or Calais without the right paperwork. The government has already delayed the implementation of full border controls for EU imports for six months because of the coronavirus pandemic. The plan has caused internal friction at cabinet level, with the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, last week protesting it would leave the UK vulnerable to smuggling and a legal challenge by the World Trade Organization. On Monday there wasfresh sabre-rattling from former Brexit campaigners on the Tory backbenches about the likely shape of an EU trade deal. They have seized on a report published by the new thinktank the Centre for Brexit Policy, which argues that the government could repudiate aspects of the withdrawal agreement if it believes the EU not to be using its “best endeavours” to negotiate. The former Brexit minister David Jones, deputy chairman of the European Research Group, said the report had “crystallised a whole range of concerns” among Conservative MPs. In particular, they claim that EU demands of a “level playing field” compromise UK sovereignty. The former Brexit secretary David Davis said the government should threaten to reopen the financial settlement between the two sides as a negotiating tool. “We should say, ‘I think we need to talk again about the money,’” he said. Another former minister, Iain Duncan Smith, said he was convinced ministers were studying the report seriously. But asked whether the government was considering renegotiating the agreement, Boris Johnson’s spokesman said on Monday: “The prime minister already successfully renegotiated the withdrawal agreement, securing a new deal that works for the whole of the UK and moves us forward to a new partnership with the EU based on a comprehensive and ambitious free trade agreement.” Monday’s document also reveals new customs declarations reminiscent of pre-duty-free days. From January, anyone carrying goods worth more than £1,500 in a small vehicle will have to declare the goods using the red channel, with additional controls for more than £10,000 in cash. This will apply to couriers who are transporting it on behalf of business. Customs forms will also have to be filled out for people receiving goods through the post that do not exceed £900 in value."
2020-07-13T19:13:26Z,politics,Politics,Gove delivers a lorry load of oven-ready Brexit with no ingredients | John Crace,"Time can play tricks. But some of us can distinctly recall Boris Johnson and Michael Gove reassuring the country back in 2016 that not only would the UK retain access to the single market after Brexit, but that we’d also end up with a better deal. So it was somewhat disconcerting to hear the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster making a statement, outlining the government’s exciting £705m “let’s get going” advertising campaign, in which he basically told the Commons that everything we now got for free and with no hassle was about to get a whole lot more expensive and time-consuming. Not that Gove put his argument in those terms. Then there are few cabinet ministers more adept at reframing acts of deliberate self-harm as public service announcements. You might think that leaving it until five and a half months before the UK leaves the EU – especially at a time when the full impacts of coronavirus on the economy have yet to be determined – might be a little late in the day for the government to be finally getting round to working out the bare outline of its customs and trading Brexit infrastructures. But for the Govester, such last-minute planning is merely a sign of how well he has things under control. Everything was going to be just great, Gove insisted. Because when you really thought about it, building lorry parks, recruiting 50,000 customs officers, installing a new IT system, making travel insurance more expensive, paying more for data roaming charges and creating a load more red tape for business was just a minor variation on frictionless trade and borders. People had actually got fed up with how easy it had been to get both themselves and their goods into other EU countries. Where was the fun in overseas travel if you didn’t get to moan and blame the delays on Johnny Foreigner? Rachel Reeves, Gove’s counterpart on the Labour frontbench, appeared almost bemused by his apparent nonchalance. This was an oven-ready meal without any ingredients. Or even an oven. It’s also come to something when Labour gets to cite Liz Truss as evidence for the prosecution. But as Reeves observed, if someone as notoriously dim as the minister for international trade has noticed that the government’s current arrangements are open to challenge from the World Trade Organization, lack the necessary infrastructure at ports and could make the UK a centre for international smuggling, then there must be major problems. It just wasn’t happening, Reeves shrugged. There was still no guidance on customs procedures for Northern Ireland, 400m customs declarations at £34 a pop was a serious waste of time and money, and since when had any government IT system ever worked on time or on budget?
Let alone one that was being developed from scratch in under six months. Just think of Matt Hancock’s hapless test-and-trace app. And don’t get her started on the universal credit IT system. All this was water off a duck’s back to the Govester. The IT system would work because he had personally blessed it with holy water. The government had committed itself to a “build, build, build” programme and it was going to start by building at least 40 lorry parks at various ports around the UK. And he could give his word there was no danger of a lorry park being constructed near Dover. Because it was actually being built just down the road at Ashford. The Scottish National party merely thanked Gove for having advanced the cause of Scottish independence with a programme that was guaranteed to make life more expensive and difficult for everyone, while Labour’s Hilary Benn, Wes Streeting and Barry Sheerman tried to press him for more details. Were the lorry parks for lorries exiting the country or for those coming in? Or both? Was the Govester aware the economy had taken a massive hit during the coronavirus pandemic or was he hell-bent on doubling down on the financial hit? Words tumbled out of Gove’s mouth but none that constituted an answer to any of these questions. It’s still a mystery as to whether his polite insincerity is innate or an act of deliberate passive aggression. The more he tried to persuade MPs that everything being more of a waste of time and money was what he had meant by “taking back control”, the more plaintive some of the Tories became. Even they can see Classic Dom’s Brexit planning is an accident waiting to happen. Andrew Mitchell wanted to know if his doggy would still be able to come on holiday with him to France. “Of course,” said the Govester. Just so long as the pooch didn’t mind travelling alone four months later as that’s how long it would now take to clear quarantine. Julian Smith was almost in tears. Couldn’t we just turn back time and get a frictionless deal? Gove smiled indulgently. He had always been the man to put the R into fiction. Saddest of all was Damian Green, the Tory MP for Ashford, whose constituency would be home to Europe’s largest lorry park. Was there nothing that could be done to make it a bit smaller, or better still locate it elsewhere? Poor Damian. He has yet to realise that it was for the honour of having the “no deal” lorry park that many of his constituents had voted for him at the last general election. Come December, the penny may eventually drop."
2020-07-13T18:28:45Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: England and Wales ministers criticised for lack of action on face masks – as it happened,"Here’s a summary of today’s key UK coronavirus developments: Boris Johnson has said an announcement on whether face masks should be mandatory in shops will be made “in the next few days”. Speaking during a visit to the London Ambulance Service, the prime minister said he thought people “should” be wearing the coverings in shops. It comes after the government was criticised for its inconsistent stance on wearing face masks, which minister Michael Gove previously said was “basic good manners” but did not think should be made mandatory. Face coverings will be mandatory on public transport including taxis in Wales from July 27. First minister Mark Drakeford was also criticised following the announcement this afternoon, with Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price saying the guidance “doesn’t go far enough” and should be extended to other indoor settings. A further 11 people have died in UK hospitals, care homes and the wider community, after testing positive for Covid-19 – bringing the official death toll to 44,830. All of the fatalities occurred in England, while Scotland and Wales recorded no new deaths on Monday. The figures from the Department of Health and Social Care do not include all deaths involving coronavirus across the country, which are thought to have passed 55,500. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam has warned that the lifting of Leicester’s local lockdown “can’t be rushed”. The government’s deputy chief medical officer said public health professionals would need to judge that rates of the virus were “consistently and obviously” falling before measures could be eased, adding that the city’s current caseload made it “quite an outlier” still in comparison to the rest of the country. Passengers at Heathrow Airport were down 95% year-on-year in June. The airport’s chief executive said numbers fell “immediately” after the government’s quarantine policy came into force, with just 350,000 people travelling through the airport last month – down 95% on June 2019.

“I always voted Labour until the last election. I just felt [Jeremy] Corbyn wasn’t realistic, and wasn’t for the general public. He couldn’t make up his mind on Brexit and was always sitting on the fence on antisemitism. “Starmer is far more in touch with the people than his predecessor, and the government. He leads calmly and professionally, with honesty and integrity. He ensures that he knows the facts and asks incisive and very relevant questions. I remember people in ‘red wall’ areas saying they’d never voted Tory but couldn’t vote for Corbyn, but for Starmer there’s some respect. “He seems in touch with reality, and very statesmanlike. I think his background and past career all contribute. He’s very analytical and you trust him. I will definitely vote for him. I feel there is something that I can relate to and that makes sense to me. For the first time, we have a proper opposition emerging. I’ve been horrified by Boris Johnson and the present government, but I feel there’s hope now.” ‘He isn’t taking a stance on anything’ Kenny Field, 21, Portsmouth
“Keir Starmer is playing into respectability politics at the expense of people Labour should be trying to help. He wants to appear like a rational well-rounded leader, but he isn’t taking a stance on anything. He is merely playing the Tories’ game. “With anti-black racism, Labour always had the image of being the anti-racist party, and now that’s been brushed under the rug. His response to the Black Lives Matter movement is one of the reasons why black people are leaving the party, and I totally get it. Starmer has built his career in the justice sector, he should know that our justice system isn’t race-blind. Rather than acknowledging it, he just shuts down the conversation. He’s not taking a stance on trans rights, or carrying forward the green new deal. “I think Labour voters like myself who want the party to be more ambitious might hold our noses and vote for Starmer, but I’m not sure a lot of people will.” ‘He has no issue with calling out antisemitism’ Tom Rose, 22, recent graduate, London
“As a Jew, I now feel much more comfortable with the thought of Labour one day forming a government. Starmer seems pretty keen to tackle the malaise between the Jewish community and the Labour party and has no issue with calling out antisemitism. I was encouraged by the decisive action he took in firing Rebecca Long-Bailey, for example. “I was a Labour supporter, but I voted Liberal Democrat at both general elections under Corbyn over the antisemitism issue, along with a wider dissatisfaction at the way the party was run. I’m not sure I’m quite back there yet, but I’m not against voting Labour any more. “During this national crisis, Starmer has demonstrated his willingness to support the government where they are performing well, but is equally keen to call out the lack of clarity on various important issues, such as face masks. This more balanced approach is a fresh way of seeing an opposition behave.” ‘I feel so hopeless about the future now’ Margaret Brickland, 55, teacher, Newcastle
“I see Keir Starmer as a passionless leader who should, but isn’t, holding this government to account at a time when the most vulnerable people are dying simply because they are poor or old. Children are going hungry and being admitted to hospital because of malnutrition. Keir Starmer isn’t taking any action to protect the most vulnerable. It’s heartbreaking. I have no faith in him at all. “I am a self-confessed Jeremy Corbyn fan. I liked his honesty. He came across as caring and passionate, and he put the people first. I was a Labour member for five or six years but resigned after Starmer sacked Rebecca Long-Bailey. I had been considering resigning for a while, since Starmer was elected, but that confirmed it for me – he doesn’t want left-leaning people in the shadow cabinet. “Jeremy Corbyn gave me hope for my future, for my children’s future and for the country. But I feel so hopeless about the future now. Any Labour government is better than a Tory government, but I don’t see Labour winning the next election under his leadership.” ‘His approach during Covid-19 has been a masterclass’ James Hoddy, 36, NHS general surgery administrator, Gloucester
“I’ve been massively impressed. Starmer has taken a measured approach and he’s being proactive, saying [to Boris Johnson]: ‘I can see this problem coming, what are you going to do?’ He’s asking tough questions, taking control and making difficult decisions. That’s the sign of a good leader. “I’ve been a Labour member since 2005. I was a Corbyn supporter and voted for him in 2015 but I could see that whoever took over from him would have a difficult job. I voted for Starmer because he stood by an incredibly progressive, Nordic-style manifesto and wanted to unify the party. It was a no-brainer. “His approach in standing next to the government during Covid-19 has been a masterclass in balancing cheerleading and criticism. I can’t wait to see him get out there and talk to the public. That’s the one place where he’s still kind of stiff. He has made Labour more electable but he really needs to get into the groove of being a public speaker, but he’s a barrister so I think that will be easy to overcome.” ‘People see him as the grown-up in the room’ Chevan Ilangaratne, 26, bar school student, Beverley, east Yorkshire
“Having grown up in east Yorkshire in the loyally Tory-voting town that is Beverley, I have seen first-hand just how unpopular Labour was under its previous leadership. While many people feel very strongly about Brexit in these areas, my understanding so far is that people in my town, despite his remainer credentials, quite like Keir. They see him as a grown-up in the room with a willingness to speak his mind and be assertive where necessary. Many also view him as a serious man for serious times. Indeed, what people in the north care about, at least in my experience, is what you have to say and whether you’re willing to listen: they are much less concerned with where that person lives and what accent they may have. “Starmer has made the Labour party look serious, professional and constructive. We have seen that through the pandemic where Starmer has worked with and supported the government on issues of national interest; at the same time, he has offered criticism where he has felt it is necessary. This approach is not only mature and grown-up, it helps make Labour looks reasonable “Of course, Labour still has a mountain to climb and Starmer is no doubt aware of this. But after 100 days, the party looks to be in much better shape under their new leader, and it has started climbing that mountain.” ‘He could be a lot harder on the government’ Jude Stevens, 18, Sutton Coldfield
“Starmer does a fantastic job at PMQs usually, he’s very articulate and forensic, but often he doesn’t do a great job of holding the government to account on their many failings. With the huge amount of mistakes made, Starmer could be going a lot harder on them. “In the last few elections, young people have begun to turn out in higher numbers, especially for Labour, and that’s because we were inspired by the politics that Labour stood for – viable socialism, ambitious climate measures, huge funding for the NHS. “Labour is at risk of becoming a watered-down Tory party. For those of us on the left, if Labour continue this move to the centre, the Greens or a progressive Lib Dems could become a more appealing choice. It’s all well and good becoming electable but what’s the point if all you’ll do is maintain the status quo of the last 10 years?”"
2020-07-13T08:55:17Z,politics,Politics,Labour urges ministers to clarify 'muddle' over face masks in English shops,"Labour has demanded the health secretary, Matt Hancock, make a statement to parliament explaining whether face coverings are set to become compulsory for shoppers in England, as scientists and retailers push for a change to government guidelines. While masks are mandatory on public transport, this is still not the case for shops, and there is a lack of clarity over whether this could soon change. On Friday, Boris Johnson hinted at imminent change, saying there was a need for a “stricter” approach. However, Michael Gove said on Sunday face coverings would not be mandatory and the public should use their common sense. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, is to request time for an urgent question from the Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. If granted then ministers must attend the Commons on Monday afternoon to explain the situation. “Ministers are in a complete muddle. On Friday, Boris Johnson gave everyone the impression they would be mandatory, only for Michael Gove to contradict him on Sunday,” said Ashworth. “Ministers need to come to the Commons on Monday and clear up this confusion. People just want to do the right thing to stay safe. Clear guidance from ministers shouldn’t be too much to ask for.” Asked about the issue on Monday, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, said he was in the “mandatory perhaps” camp when it came to face coverings in shops. “Wearing them in an enclosed space where you’ve got lots of people, for example a busy shop, seems to be sensible. It’s all about increasing confidence,” he said. “I think the more of us that do the courteous and responsible thing, the more people you’ll see venturing out into shops.” For now, Buckland said, the government would merely be encouraging this. But he added: “If it becomes necessary to nudge people further, by taking further action, then of course we will consider that.”
Also speaking on Monday, the president of the Royal Society, Dr Venki Ramakrishnan, a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the evidence was “now quite strongly in favour of using face coverings in enclosed spaces where we’re likely to come into contact with strangers”. “I think that the government should be very clear, it’s not consistent to make it mandatory in public transport and not make it mandatory in other enclosed and busy public spaces because the behaviour of the virus is the same in all of these spaces,” he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain. He added: “Scotland made it mandatory and it’s not been a problem in Scotland. People have, since last week, been going about their business, going shopping, it gives people confidence. James Daunt, the managing director of Waterstones book stores, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that mandatory mask use could help restore confidence among shoppers. “I don’t think it is a huge factor, but I also think if it reassures people, then it is a perfectly reasonable measure to take,” he said. “I think it becomes normalised, clearly, when people start using public transport.” Scotland has already made face masks mandatory in shops. In England, masks have been required on public transport since 12 June. Johnson said in an online question and answer session with the public on Friday that he was looking at ways of “making sure that people really do have face coverings in shops, for instance, where there is a risk of transmission”. But Gove described the decision to wear a mask as “good manners” rather than a public health necessity.
Asked whether face coverings would become mandatory, Gove said: “I don’t think mandatory, no, but I would encourage people to wear a face mask, where they are inside, in an environment where they are likely to be mixing with others and the ventilation may not be as good as it might. “It is basic good manners, courtesy and consideration to wear a face mask if, for example, you’re in a shop.”
It was understood that Johnson was due to make a further announcement on the topic this week, but sources at No 10 suggested this was unlikely to happen."
2020-07-13T06:00:02Z,politics,Politics,Calls for 'X' gender option in UK passports to be raised in Commons,"Fresh attempts to force the government to introduce an “X” gender option on passports for non-binary people will be made in parliament this week. Stonewall, the LGBTQ+ charity, is backing a new private member’s bill demanding ministers recognise gender-neutral passports, which have already been rolled out in Australia, Canada and Germany. “There are hundreds of thousands of people in the UK who do not identify as exclusively male or female, but the Conservative government still refuses to give them the dignity of recognising their identities,” said Christine Jardine, the Liberal Democrats’ equalities spokeswoman, who will introduce the bill in the Commons on Tuesday, International Non-Binary People’s Day. “Introducing an ‘X’ gender option on passports is a relatively small change that would make a big difference to so many people’s lives. I find it utterly incomprehensible that this government still refuses to follow the example of so many other countries and make this change,” she added. The Home Office won the right not to issue gender-neutral passports to UK citizens in March following a legal appeal by the activist Christie Elan-Cane. However, the court’s three senior judges said at the time that if international trends towards more widespread recognition of “non-binary” identity continued, at a future date this stance could breach human rights. Bangladesh, Denmark, India, the Netherlands and New Zealand also include non-binary gender options on passports, and 18 US states allow residents to mark their gender as ‘X’ on their driving licence. The Home Office has previously argued that issuing passports with an X mark could bring additional costs. In the appeal court ruling in March, the judges deemed there was no positive obligation on the state to provide an “X” marker in order to ensure the right to respect for private life. On Sunday night, a Home Office spokesperson said: “We welcome the court of appeal’s judgment.” Nancy Kelley, the chief executive of Stonewall, said: “It’s vital that non-binary people are able to have their gender recognised on official documents, including passports. Travelling abroad can present many challenges for non-binary people, and trans communities more widely, who can face intrusive questions and difficulties at passport control.” Few private member’s bills become law but they can create publicity around an issue and pressure the government into taking action. Upskirting became a criminal offence after Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem MP , introduced a private member’s bill in the Commons. It was objected to by the Tory MP Christopher Chope but reintroduced by the Conservatives as government legislation and passed."
2020-07-12T21:30:14Z,politics,Politics,Holidaymakers urged to take out extra travel insurance post-Brexit,"Ministers are urging people to take out comprehensive travel insurance if they are heading abroad from January as they announce plans to plough £700m into a new border strategy. From Monday a new marketing campaign to get the public prepared for life after the Brexit transition period will include TV, radio and digital adverts. Advice for people in Northern Ireland is set to follow in a few weeks’ time as negotiations with the EU continue. As well as reminding people about insurance and checking passports are in date, the adverts will also be targeted at businesses exporting to or importing from the EU, reminding them to get an economic operators registration and identification number, or to register with the relevant customs authority. The new advice is part of the government’s ‘The UK’s new start: let’s get going’ campaign. Holidaymakers will need to take out insurance that covers health as the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) will only be valid up to 31 December 2020. Anyone wanting to travel to Europe with a pet from 1 January 2021 needs to contact their vet four months in advance. Michael Gove has announced that the £700m investment in the UK’s borders when the country leaves the single market and customs union on 31 December involves hiring 500 extra staff and building control posts. The financial package comes days after a leaked letter from the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, revealed her concern that the country will not be ready by the time the transition period comes to an end. But Gove said GB-EU borders would be secure by the end of the year. “Whether or not we secure a Canada-style trade deal with the EU during the course of negotiations that we are carrying out, we will be outside both the single market and customs union come what may,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show. “Government certainly needs to take some steps to make sure we are ready.” He denied the financial plans had come too late to be implemented by the end of the year.
Meanwhile, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was reported to be poised to introduce tax cuts and an overhaul of planning laws in up to 10 new “free ports”. Sunak is said to be planning to open bidding for towns, cities and regions to become free ports – where UK taxes and tariffs will not apply – in his autumn budget. The Sunday Telegraph said the ports would be fully operational within 18 months of the UK leaving the customs union and single market at the end of this year. The £705m package includes £235m for staffing and IT systems and £470m for port and inland infrastructure to ensure compliance with new customs procedures and controls. New border infrastructure will be built inland where there is no space at ports, while ports will get one-off financial support to ensure the right infrastructure is in place. On reports that the government has bought land in Ashford, Kent, to turn into an enormous lorry park – anticipating tailbacks as goods are checked at the border – Gove said that was not the government’s intention. “What we want to do is make sure freight travelling through Kent can get to Dover, on to the ferries and then into France as quick as possible. It may be the case that, not so much in Kent but elsewhere, that there will be specific pieces of infrastructure in order to smooth the flow of traffic,” Gove said. He said this was to avoid traffic jams and tailbacks on roads. The £705m relates only to the implementation of the UK-EU border, and the government is expected to publish specific guidance and measures for Northern Ireland later this month. In her leaked letter, Truss said she believed HMRC would apply the default EU tariff to goods in Northern Ireland on 1 January 2021, rather than a dual tariff system that the government has been trying to develop with a bespoke IT system. Gove was also questioned about why the prime minister had said in December 2019 there would be no checks at the border. He replied: “There will be some checks from products of animal origin that go from GB to Northern Ireland but we want them to be as light-touch and as minimal as possible. You will not have customs officers saying ‘halt’. What you will have are vets who will be suitably equipped in order to carry out surveillance.”"
2020-07-12T15:55:35Z,politics,Politics,Cross-party group of MPs to lead UK coronavirus inquiry,"A fresh inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus crisis will take its first evidence from bereaved relatives on Monday, amid growing calls for a full independent investigation. Families of those who have died will give their submissions in writing, via video call, or will arrange to do so in person to the new all-party parliamentary group (APPG) for coronavirus, led by a cross-party group of MPs. The MPs claim this is the first independent inquiry into the government’s entire response into the pandemic. The politicians involved hope their findings will be used to inform the government’s response before a potential second peak of the illness this winter. Other inquiries have taken place on specific elements of the coronavirus response since March. The House of Commons’ petitions committee launched its Government’s Response to the Coronavirus investigation, which has so far reported back on its impact on parental leave and students. The health and social care committee also began an inquiry in March looking at the management of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Liberal Democrat MP and APPG chair, Layla Moran, said: “From the neglect of care homes to the lack of an effective testing regime, each day brings more evidence of mistakes in the handling of this pandemic, and there is every indication that we will see a potential second spike this winter. “The country and the NHS cannot afford for these errors to be repeated. There is no time to waste when it comes to learning the lessons from the UK response to the pandemic.” Calls for a full judge-led public inquiry into the UK’s handling of coronavirus have been building over the last few months, from health professionals, bereaved families, policy experts, frontline NHS staff and MPs. The APPG’s inquiry, which will be completed by the end of the summer, is an initial focal point where the MPs say they can build up evidence. The Conservative MP and group vice-chair, Dan Poulter, said: “It is important that we learn lessons about what things we can do better ahead of the difficult winter months that lie ahead. “This winter, we are likely to face a second wave of coronavirus coupled with seasonal flu virus and it is vital that our health and care system is fully prepared for what is likely to come.” Labour’s Clive Lewis, Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville-Roberts and the SNP’s Philippa Whitford are also on the committee, along with the Green party life peer Jenny Jones. To give evidence, people can go to the March for Change website where the coronavirus inquiry will be opened for frontline workers and relatives to make submissions via a dedicated portal, anonymously if they wish. Professionals and trade bodies can submit evidence via email and it will be published. Polling this month by YouGov commissioned by March for Change found that 57% of British people feel there should an independent public inquiry into how the UK government has handled the pandemic. • This article and its headline were amended on 14 July 2020 to clarify that there have been other inquiries into aspects of the government’s response to the pandemic."
2020-07-12T15:33:53Z,politics,Politics,Local anger over plans for post-Brexit 'lorry park' at Ashford,"It is a competitive field when it comes to noise, but the sweet birdsong rising up from 27 acres of ragwort, overgrown grass and dense bramble hedgerows just about wins against the hum of traffic from the nearby M20 in Kent. But from Monday the victory for wildlife will end as the first machines and crews start work on a 27-acre Brexit customs clearance centre to process lorries coming from the EU into Dover from January, prompting anger from local residents, a Tory MP and other politicians. It is the first official infrastructure the government has finalised as part of a £705m package to put a Brexit border in place, with new IT systems and 500 extra Border Force officials. On Sunday, Michael Gove denied it amounted to a vast lorry park. The plans were secret until Friday when the local council was contacted out of the blue by the Department for Transport and told the land was now in public ownership and earmarked for “temporary capacity for the holding of delayed HGVs and facilities for border-related controls to be carried out by government agencies”. The lack of consultation has triggered anger. Damian Green, the town’s Conservative MP and a former close ally of Boris Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, said he was opposed to the site, tweeting that it was “unfair to Ashford” as it was “too near too many homes”. “I am strongly opposed to this, and have told ministers this,” Green told Kent Online. In a tweet that was subsequently deleted, he wrote: “No one has suggested using this site as a lorry park in the many years of discussions on the subject, and it is too near too many homes for it to be the right place.” Gove, the cabinet minister in charge of implementing Brexit, insisted on the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme it would not be a “lorry park”, but surveying the site on Sunday, the local Green party spokeswoman Mandy Rossi dismissed his remarks as “semantics”.
“If there is bad weather, or disruption on the tunnel or in Calais, lorries will have to stop somewhere, and even if the customs post only stops one in 100 trucks, that is still a lot as there are 11,500 lorry movements a day to and from Dover,” Rossi said. Liz Wright, a Green party councillor who represents the nearby Willesborough ward, described the plans “as a complete shock to local residents and … a further nail in the coffin for local democracy”. The site, branded “Mojo” by the developers, used to be farmland separating the historic Sevington and Mersham villages south-west of Ashford. It was allowed go to seed in the last year amid rumours it had been bought by Amazon. On Friday the Department for Transport contacted Ashford borough council to say the site was now in public ownership and a letter would be sent to residents telling them work would start on Monday “with fencing, grass and weed vegetation cutting, extensive survey work, the constructing of a temporary site office, and the constructing of a temporary access to the site from the A2070.” “Plans have not yet been finalised for the use of this site, but [it] is anticipated to form part of the department’s strategy to minimise potential disruption at Kent ports for the end of the transition period,” the letter says. “This is likely to involve temporary capacity for the holding of delayed HGVs and facilities for border-related controls to be carried out by government agencies (eg HM Revenue and Customs).” Wright said: “They have imposed this on the community with no notice. The local Ashford borough council has done its best to get the letter out to residents on time for Monday but it’s just a disgraceful way to treat local communities.” Peter Ricketts, a former diplomat and national security adviser who chairs the Lords EU security and justice sub-committee, branded the plans “pointless”.
Locals living on a lane that ends at the site are also concerned. Paul Tomlin said: “In an ideal world this would remain farming land, but we don’t live in ideal times. My concern is the noise, there is going to be a lot of it stop-start from lorries 24/7.”
John Baker, who has been walking in the Sevington area for 26 years, said: “It is devastating for people living here. Ashford has just become a development centre.” Ashford borough council’s deputy leader, Paul Bartlett, welcomed the plans, saying on Facebook: “A HMRC clearance depot is vastly preferable to the warehouses proposed by [owners] AXA/Friends Life and granted planning consent by ABC in 2015.”"
2020-07-12T14:44:48Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson accused of plan to 'emasculate' UK devolution,"Boris Johnson has been accused of planning an “emasculation” of the devolution settlement, with senior officials and politicians warning that plans for a post-Brexit UK-wide internal market will put Scotland and Wales on a collision course with Westminster. As support for Scottish independence shows a sustained polling lead and the Welsh parliament prepares for a debate on Wednesday about holding an independence referendum, the UK government has been accused of bringing a “statutory fist crashing down” as it attempts to regulate policy and standards across the four parts of the UK. Sources voiced concerns about a more aggressive approach towards devolution from a new generation of Conservative politicians. Some observers believe coronavirus has brought home the true extent of the devolved parliaments’ ability to diverge from London. Health is a devolved matter, and the four countries of the UK have reached contrasting decisions and timelines for imposing and easing lockdown measures. The Welsh government in particular has profound concerns about a lack of communication with the UK government. Its first minister, Mark Drakeford, has not spoken to Johnson since 28 May, which was also the last contact Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, had with the PM. Drakeford said last week: “If you are minister for the union [the title Johnson used when he became prime minister], speaking to the component parts of the union seems to me a sensible way of discharging those responsibilities.” Immediate concerns surround proposals to legislate for a post-Brexit UK internal market, which are expected to be published before the Commons recess this month and are believed to include two elements that could undermine the powers of devolved parliaments. First is a plan for an unelected oversight body that would hold any new devolved bills to a “market impact test”, which the Scottish government believes would have jeopardised Scotland-only initiatives such as free university tuition, minimum unit pricing for alcohol or the introduction of a smoking ban before the rest of the UK. Second is the proposal for a “mutual recognition regime” requiring regulatory standards in one part of the UK to be automatically accepted in others. Jeremy Miles, the Welsh counsel general and minister for European transition, said this would “drive a coach and horses through the capacity of individual governments in different parts of the UK to deliver policy objectives in their economies”. In practice this could leave them unable to reject UK government decisions on, for example, chlorinated chicken or genetically modified (GM) organisms, he said, adding: “If the UK government does what it tends to do, which is to deregulate, it will create intolerable pressures on the UK in terms of internal market.” A senior member of the Northern Irish assembly suggested that Michael Gove, who this month was appointed by Johnson to head up a cabinet sub-committee on the union alongside Rishi Sunak, is trying to reassert his government’s power over the devolved administrations. Michael Russell, Scotland’s Brexit minister, described “an inbuilt hostility to devolution” and said: “This group don’t believe, in the era of Brexit, that they should be sharing power with anyone. Some of them are senior ministers. They certainly don’t believe that there is any right for the Scottish parliament, or Welsh assembly [Senedd], to operate.” Sources in all three devolved governments describe varying degrees of frustration at the lack of consultation or clarity, although the Brexit withdrawal agreement’s Northern Ireland protocol means exceptional rules will be in place from January, which Johnson initially tried to dismiss, claiming there would be no checks on goods entering the region. While Miles insisted the Welsh government “want[s] the union to work”, he said any mutual recognition scheme “needs to be agreed between the four governments, not imposed by one, and it needs to be flexible and nimble, not a statutory fist crashing down across the UK.” Proposals to enshrine mutual recognition in law would “create a huge constitutional fight”, he said. “In essence it emasculates the devolution settlement. That’s not going to be tolerated.” The Welsh and Scottish governments have written to Gove setting out these concerns. Russell said his letter made it clear that “we’re not going along with it. If it’s a voluntary code we won’t observe it, if it’s legislation we’ll challenge it every inch of the way”. A UK government spokesperson said: “We continue to seek a shared approach to the UK internal market with the devolved administrations. Unfortunately, however, the Scottish government voluntarily withdrew from this piece of work over a year ago. We will continue to engage with all three devolved administrations on how best we can bring people together and protect businesses throughout the UK.”"

In an Observer poll today, 49% of all voters said Starmer had made them think more favourably about the Labour party, and two weeks ago, the poll showed he had overtaken Boris Johnson as preferred prime minister. However, Starmer has been criticised for his response to the Black Lives Matter movement, which has seen renewed support around the world following the death of George Floyd.

2020-07-12T12:00:13Z,politics,Politics,"Revealed: Dominic Cummings firm paid Vote Leave's AI firm £260,000","A private company owned and controlled by Dominic Cummings paid more than a quarter of a million pounds to the artificial intelligence firm that worked on the Vote Leave campaign. The prime minister’s chief adviser is declining to explain the reason for the payments to Faculty, which were made in instalments over two years. Faculty also declined to say what they were for. But the payments are likely to raise further questions about the relationship between Cummings and the data analytics firm he hired in 2016 to conduct data modelling around the EU referendum for Vote Leave. Earlier this year, Faculty was installed at the heart of the government’s response to the coronavirus crisis, conducting data modelling to help senior decision-makers and other government officials respond to the pandemic.
The Guardian has identified at least 13 central government contracts awarded to the firm since early 2018, collectively worth about £3m in revenue. The company said it had worked on more than 30 projects with public bodies since 2016. Lawyers for Faculty said it rejected any suggestion it received preferential treatment from the prime minister’s chief adviser, and that any work with the government had been won fairly and properly. However, they declined to say why Faculty received payments from Dynamic Maps, Cummings’ private consultancy firm. A Faculty company document seen by the Guardian indicates Faculty received almost £260,000 from Dynamic Maps across 2018 and 2019. Dynamic Maps is listed on the document as a “customer”. Cummings set up Dynamic Maps in October 2017 as sole director to provide “information technology consultancy activities”, according to Companies House records. He began the process of winding up the company last month. Little is known about his firm, which as a small company has only ever been required to publish limited accounts. However, Cummings was previously reported to have used the company for private consultancy work before re-entering government as Boris Johnson’s chief adviser when he became prime minister. The only other business relationship Cummings’ consultancy is known to have had is with Babylon Health, a healthcare startup backed by the health secretary, Matt Hancock. Cummings advised the company on its communications strategy and its senior recruitment, and was paid via Dynamic Maps. Faculty was founded in 2014 as a fellowship and mentoring startup called ASI Data Science. ASI would put physics and maths PhD graduates from top universities through a two-month data science training programme, while they were also on placement with a client company that might subsequently hire them. If they did, ASI would receive a fee. Cummings has written at length about the potential benefits of using talented individuals with accomplished scientific backgrounds to diversify and improve decision-making in organisations and in government. He recruited Faculty to work on the Vote Leave campaign in 2016. After Cummings was appointed chief adviser to Johnson last year, Ben Warner, a Faculty data scientist who worked with him on the Vote Leave project, was hired as an adviser to No 10 on data and technology. Warner is the brother of Marc Warner, the co-founder and chief executive of Faculty. Cummings has credited his unexpected victory in the EU referendum to “having experts in physics and machine learning do proper data science in the way only they can”. He believes lessons of the Brexit vote should be applied not only to future political campaigns, but also to government. “One of the many ways in which Whitehall and Downing Street should be revolutionised is to integrate physicist-dominated data science in decision-making,” he wrote in a 2016 blogpost.
Faculty said its government work had always been obtained through proper procurement processes. The company’s shareholders include two current and former Conservative ministers. John Nash, minister for the school system from 2013 to 2017, as well as his successor, Theodore Agnew, were both early investors in the firm after buying shares in 2016. The PR and communications firm Hanbury has also been a client for Faculty. Hanbury was co-founded in September 2016 by Paul Stephenson, Vote Leave’s director of communications, and is helping to carry out recruitment of special advisers for Downing Street.
“Hanbury has in the past worked with ASI/Faculty on a limited number of projects,” said a spokesperson, who declined to discuss the details of the work, citing confidentiality. “We are not currently working on any projects together.” Faculty’s recent government work has been its involvement in creating a Covid-19 datastore to help senior government officials respond to the pandemic. The work with NHSX, the digital innovation arm of the health service, is understood to have involved extensive data modelling. A Department of Health source described Marc Warner dropping Cummings’ name in his meetings, saying the chief executive of Faculty gave the impression he had the personal support of the prime minister’s chief adviser. “It felt like he was bragging about it,” the senior source said, saying Warner would casually tell officials: “Don’t worry, I’ll text Dom,” or “I’m talking to Dom later.” The impression left among civil servants was that the Covid-19 datastore was “a Cummings project”, the senior source said. Faculty said it had delivered work for hundreds of clients in more than a dozen countries, and that the majority of its work was in the private sector. It said it had never received or benefited from any favouritism by Cummings or any other political figure. The firm also said the political persuasion of its clients was immaterial, and that it did not take political positions. “We win work on the strength of our results that are achieved through our extensive domain knowledge and high technical competency,” it said. “We are committed to the safe use of AI and have published a number of scientific research papers and built practical tooling to help address this.” Faculty said the company no longer accepted commercial work from political organisations. A No 10 spokeswoman said all contracts awarded to Faculty followed proper procurement procedures. She said: “On becoming a special adviser, Mr Cummings started a new job and gave up any commercial roles; the necessary steps have rightly been taken to wind down his previous company. Special advisers have no role in authorising the expenditure of public funds.” The Scott Trust, the ultimate owner of the Guardian, is the sole investor in GMG Ventures, which is a minority shareholder in Faculty."
2020-07-12T10:18:04Z,politics,Politics,"Face masks in shops will not be mandatory in England, Gove suggests","Wearing face coverings in shops will not become mandatory in England, Michael Gove has suggested, sparking confusion over plans to stem the spread of coronavirus as the country emerges from lockdown. On Friday Boris Johson indicated he was considering making masks compulsory in shops and other enclosed spaces, but Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said instead that people could use their common sense. Despite criticism from scientists over an alleged slowness to act, he described the decision as “good manners” rather than a public health necessity. Asked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show whether face coverings would become mandatory in shops, Gove said: “I don’t think mandatory, no, but I would encourage people to wear a face mask, where they are inside, in an environment where they are likely to be mixing with others and the ventilation may not be as good as it might. It is basic good manners, courtesy and consideration to wear a face mask if, for example, you’re in a shop.” Earlier Gove had told Sky News that masks were appropriate on public transport and in shops to protect people in case someone was asymptomatic but capable of spreading the infection.
Government sources confirmed Johnson was in talks about taking a firmer stance on face masks after he said on Friday: “I do think we need to be stricter in insisting people wear face coverings in confined spaces where they are meeting people they don’t normally meet. That’s why it’s mandatory already on public transport. We are looking at ways of making sure that people really do have face coverings in shops, for instance, where there is a risk of transmission.” It was understood the prime minister was due to make a further announcement on the topic this week. Scotland has already made face masks mandatory in shops. In England masks have been required on public transport since 12 June. Labour has said it could support the mandatory wearing of face coverings in shops. Speaking to Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, the shadow business minister, Lucy Powell, said: “We think the government – instead of just showing a bit of leg occasionally on these things by briefing newspapers or saying things that are not clear guidance in press conferences, as the prime minister did on Friday – [should] get some clarity. “That’s really something that would get confidence back into the system and get people feeling that they can go to the shops, they can go to restaurants and go to bars.”
The Sunday Telegraph reported that the government was preparing to ease advice against using public transport to encourage people to return to work in person and use reopened shops, pubs and restaurants. The Department for Transport has removed from its website the guidance that public transport should be avoided except for essential journeys. However, it continues to suggest people work from home wherever possible and to cycle or walk instead of travelling by other means. It also suggests commuters should avoid rush hour if possible. Whitehall sources told the paper that encouraging people to use trains in a safe way would be a focus in coming weeks."
2020-07-12T06:11:06Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer faces a daunting challenge. But opportunities beckon for Labour,"First impressions count, and Keir Starmer has made a good one. His performance ratings are the best recorded for an opposition leader since Tony Blair took over the Labour party in 1994. Starmer is the first Labour leader since Gordon Brown before the financial crisis to be preferred to his Conservative opponent when voters are asked who would make the best prime minister. Starmer’s sharp attacks on a floundering Conservative government have landed well. The new leader has also made his mark internally, securing control of the party levers of power with remarkable speed and efficiency. Labour factions are calmed, if not fully reconciled, and the current unity and discipline is a sharp contrast to the chaotic feuding of the Corbyn years. For the first time in more than a decade, Labour has reasons to be cheerful. It will need all the optimism it can find given the challenges ahead. In 1994, Tony Blair took charge of a party with 271 seats, including 49 in Scotland. Starmer begins with just 202, the smallest parliamentary Labour party since 1935, and just one Scottish MP. The Conservative government he faces has increased its vote share in every election since 2001, even while presiding over a decade of austerity spending cuts, which it is now reversing, and years of wrangling over the Brexit process, which it now seeks to complete. Although Starmer’s ratings are strong, he is running well ahead of his party, who are still viewed with scepticism.
Labour faces a daunting political map. The party’s decades of dominance in Scotland are a fast fading memory, and revival there remains elusive with politics now firmly aligned around an SNP-Conservative fight over independence. Labour has also fallen back in the traditional mining and manufacturing towns of the Midlands and north of England which once formed the backbone of its support. Such seats returned Labour MPs for decades after the collapse of the industries which forged tribal loyalties to the party, but that loyalty has been fading since the Blair years and is now severely eroded. Voters who broke a lifelong taboo in backing Conservatives in 2017 or 2019 may be hard to win back again. The Labour vote continued to collapse in traditional heartland seats as Mansfield and Halesowen and Rowley Regis which elected their first Conservative MPs earlier, underscoring the challenge the party faces in reversing decades of slow local decline in many English towns. Even Labour’s greatest source of strength – its rude health in the nation’s big cities and university towns – is a source of weakness due to the operation of the electoral system. Its strongest current support comes from younger voters, graduates, professionals and ethnic minorities – groups who all cluster together in the same big-city seats. This produces towering Labour majorities in those constituencies, but leaves the party bereft of support in the much larger number of seats where such groups are scarcer. There are some causes for hope. Voters are less tribal now, and more responsive to changing political conditions. Levels of voter switching in the past three elections have been higher than in all previous cycles going back to the 1960s. Big swings are easier to achieve than hitherto. The issue agenda is also more Labour-friendly than for a long while. Polarised arguments over immigration and Brexit, which divided Labour internally from top to bottom over the past two decades, have been replaced by coronavirus and the challenges it poses for health services and the economy. Debates over health, public services and job security are favourable terrain for Labour, playing into areas where they retain strong sympathies from the electorate. If voter satisfaction with Johnson and the Tories continues its recent sharp fall, the pandemic may present Starmer with the same kind of opportunity John Smith and Blair enjoyed in the wake of the Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis of 1992. Voters can swiftly lose faith in a government they feel has failed them in a crisis, and they can be slow to forgive once the crisis has passed. Four years of strong economic performance did little to stave off disaster for John Major in 1997.
Labour will hope 2020 proves to be a similar political watershed. Anything short of a 1997 style swing may not be enough, particularly if the party remains moribund in Scotland. Analysis by Labour Together suggests the party would need a swing of 12% to secure a majority, larger than that achieved in Blair’s first landslide. Such a swing would also need to be truly national, renewing Labour’s support with the older and more socially conservative voters where the party is now weak as well as retaining its large advantages with the younger and more liberal voters where it is now strong. Such historic sea changes have happened before – in both 1945 and 1997 Labour surged to triumph when the public mood shifted decisively. But this parliament still has a long way to run. While Starmer has made a good start, he has a lot of work still to do, and however well he does it, Labour’s electoral fate will still turn on forces beyond any leader’s control. When voters survey the landscape in 2024, will they decide it is once again time for a change?"
2020-07-12T06:05:06Z,politics,Politics,"100 days on, Keir Starmer’s quiet revolution takes hold","Very little about Keir Starmer’s first three months as Labour leader has been easy, or remotely normal. On 4 April, the day he was elected, there was no fanfare as he was forced to issue a very sober, pre-recorded victory address from a front room of his house in north London, with the country in strict lockdown. Three months on, during a visit to Harlow, Essex, last week, he chose to wear a large plastic visor, putting distance between him and the voters, and safety first. “He was right to do that,” said one of his front bench, “because until then, not a single cabinet minister had worn a mask in public since this whole thing began. It was about setting an example. But I did think…how bloody weird.” Even now, as he approaches his 100th day as leader, it’s all very abnormal. Only a handful of his team has been going in to work in the leader of the opposition’s office in the Palace of Westminster. Normally it would be buzzing, with the leader dashing in and out, accompanied by aides. “Nowadays there are maybe four or five in at the most, but the offices are mostly empty, and people are working from home. We do all the shadow cabinet meetings remotely,” said one of his team. Coronavirus has, in many ways, made Starmer’s start more difficult. Particularly in the early stages of the pandemic, Boris Johnson and the government were very much centre stage, with Labour having to give its support as the nation demanded togetherness. For a Labour party on its knees after four successive general election defeats under his predecessors – Gordon Brown in 2010, Ed Miliband in 2015 and Jeremy Corbyn, both in 2017 and in December last year – some wondered how the new leader could get noticed. Could Starmer begin a recovery from Labour’s latest electoral disaster – its worst since 1935 – and one that some in the party believed could even be terminal? Today, however, there are signs of life in Labour where before there were very few. In late March, when the lockdown was announced, Boris Johnson and the Tories had regular leads over Labour of more than 20 points in the opinion polls, and Johnson’s own approval ratings were going through the roof. “I thought then that it would be 10 years at the earliest before we could even think of competing again,” said a shadow cabinet member. Immediately after he was elected, Starmer couldn’t compete in the ratings battles, largely because few voters knew anything about him. When he spoke on the leadership hustings, he had shown himself to be a rather leaden orator and had failed to catch much public attention.
But once in office, the former director of public prosecutions showed his lawyerly precision and calm with incisive performances week after week in the House of Commons. In a deathly quiet chamber devoid of baying Tories. Starmer suddenly looked the part, and an untidy and bumbling Johnson looked wrong for the times, and at sea. As the prime minister and government struggled, Starmer found his feet, people took notice and the mood in Westminster and among the public changed. In the Observer’s latest Opinium poll, that shift is reflected in startling terms. The Tory lead stands at just four points, and Starmer is beating Johnson on almost every metric. On competence, Starmer scores plus-28, while Johnson, damaged by the chaotic government response to Covid-19, is on minus-4. Asked about the two leaders’ ability to take key decisions, Starmer is on plus-18, Johnson on minus-7. Even on the issue of standing up for Britain abroad, the prime minister who delivered Brexit and won a general election having campaigned for it, is on plus-5, compared with the Labour leader’s score of plus-13. Some 49% of all voters in today’s poll say Starmer has already made them think more favourably of the Labour party. Two weeks ago, he actually overtook Johnson when people were asked who they thought would make the best prime minister. Peter Kyle, the Labour MP for Hove, who is on the front bench, says Starmer has shown qualities that people quickly recognise in a good leader. “He has been decisive, he has shown grit, he is professional, he looks at ease,” Kyle said. “I have been in the company of other political leaders and they exude this incredible tension and intensity. He seems comfortable, and that makes people trust him.” Starmer’s start may have been impressive but he still has an electoral mountain to climb, rebuilding a coalition of voters that is over-concentrated in big cities and too small overall, and that has been destroyed in Scotland and its former heartlands in the north and Midlands. But like Covid-19 itself, Starmer’s early time in charge has had effects no one could have predicted. Politically, just as the pandemic has transformed the previously little-known chancellor Rishi Sunak into a potential threat to Johnson, so it has changed Labour under Starmer into a force to be reckoned with again. It has bred more unity than otherwise might have existed. Certainly it has not been trouble-free. There have been grumblings from the left about Starmer’s sacking of the lead Corbynista Rebecca Long-Bailey as shadow education secretary (for refusing to take down a retweet that contained an antisemitic conspiracy theory). But attempts to have her reinstated, which were backed by the likes of John McDonnell, fizzled out. There was criticism from inside and outside the party too about Starmer’s ill-chosen words to describe the Black Lives Matter protests, which seemed to show a lack of feel for the epic nature of events that followed the death of George Floyd and for what the movement meant. Internal tensions were evident too over Starmer’s appointment of a new Labour general secretary, David Evans, who worked for the party under Tony Blair. But there has been no mass resignation from the membership, says Laura Parker, the former national coordinator of Momentum, because Starmer stood on a leftwing programme which he has stood by.
“Why would people leave when the centre of gravity has shifted? It may not have shifted as far to the left as some people want. But it is an anti-austerity, pro-common ownership party. It is a pro-peace party, and it is not a ‘relaxed about the filthy rich’ party – far from it,” said Parker. She believes it is probably too early to judge Starmer, as Covid-19 has drowned out everything else and given the new Labour leader no real chance to show his true policy colours. But she sees definite signs that the entire movement wants to come together under him if it can. “The vast majority of people do want to turn a page,” she said. “That does not mean the left is about to abandon all its principles, but there is an appetite for building more harmonious relationships.” Gradually Starmer is changing the rhetoric from Corbyn in a quiet revolution. In a recent Commons debate on global Britain and the merging of the Department for International Development with the Foreign Office, he played the patriot card. “I passionately believe in Britain. I am proud of this,” he said, adding that he wanted the UK to show global leadership. He also relaunched an organisation called Labour Friends of the Armed Forces. “You would never have had Jeremy doing that in a million years,” said another front bencher.
There will be calls soon, no doubt, from within the party for Starmer to go further than showing competence and some subtle repositioning. “We will at some stage need to hear what Project Keir actually is,” said one of his shadow team. “It takes a bit of time but the public will need to see more than just professionalism and doing well at prime minister’s questions. They will want to know what gets him up in the morning.” For now, though, the party, like the country, is getting to know Starmer. Michael Chessum, a former member of Momentum’s steering group, says the sacking of Long-Bailey and appointment of Evans have split the left and caused irritation. “But,” he said, “most members are probably willing to tolerate this, as long as the new leadership honours its promise to maintain Corbyn’s radical policy platform. The question is whether Starmer can really do this while at the same time completely changing Labour’s personnel and tone.” Across the party, the verdict is pretty positive about Starmer. Even Blairites who doubted him when he was shadow Brexit secretary have been impressed. Blair himself is said to have come round to thinking he has what it takes. But as he and everyone else knows, it will be what he does over the next four-and-a-half years that will really count. Highs and lows of the first 100 days Up: PMQs Keir Starmer has landed blow after blow against Boris Johnson at the dispatch box, leaving sketch-writers thumbing their Rogets for alternatives to “forensic”. Johnson’s ripostes have focused on painting “m’learned friend” as a slippery lawyer, making him look a little less like a prime minister and more like a defendant.
Up: Polls The Labour leader has risen in the polls and nosed ahead of Johnson last month. Today Opinium says 49% of people have a more positive opinion of Labour since he became leader. The party has also closed the gap with the Tories, from a whopping 51%-29% in April, when Starmer took over from Jeremy Corbyn. The Tory lead now stands at just four points, although support for Labour has plateaued at around 38% since the end of May. Up: Leadership Sacking Rebecca Long-Bailey for sharing an article containing an antisemitic conspiracy theory was praised as evidence of his willingness to tackle antisemitism and his decisiveness, in contrast to Johnson’s backing of Dominic Cummings and Robert Jenrick. He’s been rewarded with support from the Jewish Labour Movement, which had threatened to split from the party under Corbyn.
Up: Party management He has seized control of the national executive committee, Labour’s governing body, and the new general secretary is David Evans– a Starmer fan. That puts the Labour leader in control of policy, allowing him to avoid making any unnecessary announcements with at least four more years of opposition ahead. Down: Divisions Downside: Many on Labour’s left are suspicious that Long-Bailey’s departure is the start of a purge, and not sacking Steve Reed as shadow communities secretary for referring to Richard Desmond as a “puppet master” – another antisemitic trope – hasn’t helped. Unite’s general secretary Len McCluskey has given him a few friendly reminders who is still around.
Down: Black Lives Matter Although he took a knee with Angela Rayner on the day of George Floyd’s funeral, Starmer had to apologise later for appearing to devalue BLM by describing it as “a moment” – he’s taking unconscious bias training as penance for his first significant gaffe. Some black Labour members feel racism directed at Diane Abbott and Dawn Butler has not been taken as seriously as antisemitism. Down: Branding The sober, serious image may be a reassuring contrast to Johnsonian gallimaufry, but Starmer has lacked pizazz and personality. Cartoonists have yet to nail a Starmer persona and impressionists have lent heavily on their Ed Miliband material, while the Labour leader has steered clear of anything as frivolous as a joke. Down: Policy Clapping for the NHS rather than detailing health policy may be good politics now, but avoiding announcements comes with another risk – voters may have little idea what Labour thinks about pressing issues: Brexit, the new economic reality or any vision of how to escape the pandemic."
2020-07-11T18:29:52Z,politics,Politics,"Rishi Sunak is borrowing his way out of this crisis, but we'll all have to pay it back","Within days of Rishi Sunak becoming chancellor of the exchequer, the UK plunged into the deepest recession for at least 300 years. In extraordinarily difficult circumstances, the chancellor has demonstrated boldness, imagination, grip and excellent communication skills. He has outshone his cabinet colleagues in general and the prime minister in particular. The chancellor, however, will be aware that his most testing times are still to come. He has rightly focused on protecting the economy from the short-term consequences of Covid-19 and our response to it. But as he rightly said on Wednesday, in the medium term the public finances need to be put on a sound footing. By the autumn, he will need to tell us how he is going to do it. Much of the focus so far has been on the short-term implications for government borrowing. Rather than borrowing £55bn in 2020/21 as the Office for Budget Responsibility had predicted pre-Covid, we are probably heading towards an annual deficit of £350bn. For the first time since the early 1960s, the size of government debt will exceed the size of the UK economy. The government is likely to be relatively relaxed about the immediate surge in borrowing. It is able to get its debt away easily enough (in large part because of the actions of the Bank of England) and debt servicing costs remain low. But once we are through the immediate crisis, continued high levels of borrowing runs the risk of losing the confidence of the markets. If that happens, sterling will fall, debt servicing costs will rise and the country will face even more painful choices.
How much will need to be done to stabilise the public finances? It is hard to say with confidence at this point given that it will depend on how quickly we recover from the current crisis and the level of scarring in the economy. But, as Carl Emmerson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said, an estimate of a gap of £35-40bn looks reasonable, even before taking into account demands for higher public spending that will be very hard to resist. Once we are through the economic shock caused by Covid-19, the government will have to fill this gap with tax increases or spending cuts. Unlike the situation in 2010, it is hard to see that there are substantial savings to be made in government spending. The one obvious exception is the pension triple lock – if wages are stagnant (or even falling) and inflation is negligible, it would be an act of intergenerational unfairness to increase the state pension by 2.5%. But it is clear that tax increases will have to do most of the heavy lifting. To give an indication of the scale of the undertaking, a £40bn tax rise would be the equivalent of an increase of 7p on the basic rate of income tax or raising the standard rate of VAT by 6%.
The political challenge in raising tax by the necessary amount will be immense. Any plan will need to be seen as being fair – those with the broadest shoulders will have to bear the greatest burden – but must not undermine our attractiveness as a location for investment and wealth-creating individuals. It is also not yet clear that the Conservative party as a whole is reconciled to the reality that sound public finances will require higher taxes. The time to implement these higher taxes may some while off. Nonetheless, to reassure the markets of his fiscal credibility and to provide some certainty to businesses as to the tax environment, Mr Sunak will need to set out his tax-raising strategy at the autumn budget. It will be an even tougher test than anything he has faced so far."
2020-07-11T18:15:18Z,politics,Politics,"Competent, likeable, decisive: Keir Starmer beating Boris Johnson on all counts","Half of UK voters say they have formed a more favourable view of the Labour party since Keir Starmer became its leader in April, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. On Monday Starmer will mark his first 100 days since succeeding Jeremy Corbyn, and he has made a far greater positive impact with the electorate than his predecessor did in his early days in charge. The findings will encourage Labour MPs, members and activists, many of whom believed the party would face a minimum period of 10 years of rebuilding after their disastrous general election last December, and that Starmer would struggle to make an impact in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. But the reverse seems to be true according to Opinium’s findings. Significantly, 52% of voters now say they could imagine Starmer inside No 10. Two weeks ago, Opinium found more people cited Starmer as their preferred choice as prime minister (37%) than Boris Johnson (35%). The poll also shows Starmer is now strongly favoured by voters over Johnson when people are asked about the two leaders’ qualities – such as their competence, their ability to take decisions and get things done, and their ability to represent this country abroad.
The main downside for Labour, however, is that Starmer and his shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds are still well behind the Tory leadership team of Johnson and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, when it comes to economic competence and people’s faith in Labour’s ability to run the economy: 42% said they favoured Johnson and Sunak against 26% for Starmer and Dodds. Labour now stands four points behind the Conservatives overall, with the Tories on 42%, Labour on 38% and the Liberal Democrats on 6%. But this represents a remarkable turnaround from the end of March, just after Johnson announced a full lockdown and days before Starmer took charge, when the Tories were on 54%, 26 points ahead of Labour on 28%. Laura Parker, the former national coordinator of Momentum, the grassroots group set up to support Corbyn’s leadership, said that while there had been aspects of Starmer’s early leadership with which some party members had been very unhappy, including his response to the Black Lives Matter movement and the sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey, there was now a willingness across the party to work with him. That would continue, she said, unless he backed away from the radical manifesto on which he fought the leadership election. “We are going to have to build a broad coalition to beat this lot [the Tories] and after four election defeats the party left, centre and right have understood that,” she said. The extent to which Starmer has struck a chord with voters is underlined by responses when people are asked about the leaders’ abilities and qualities in specific areas. When asked about competence, Starmer scores a net positive result of +28 against -4 for Johnson. (These are the scores when the percentage of those who believe they are not competent are subtracted from the percentages who say they are.) On the question of whether they are strong leaders, Johnson scores -2 while Starmer is on +21. Starmer even does better than Johnson when people are asked who would be better at negotiating with the EU with Johnson scoring +2 and Starmer +4."
2020-07-11T17:31:18Z,politics,Politics,"Prove that Labour really is anti-racist, Dawn Butler tells Keir Starmer","Labour MP Dawn Butler has said she understands why the party is losing support with young black, Asian and minority ethnic voters and that Keir Starmer’s leadership must prove itself to be anti-racist to win members back. Speaking to The Observer, the former shadow equalities minister said: “I don’t blame anyone for being unforgiving and uncompromising in this moment. Young black people are seeking meaningful change and commitment and nothing less will do. I completely endorse that. The Labour party is an anti-racist party but it has to prove that. It’s not something that is a given, it is something that has to be re-earned.” The MP for Brent Central was forced to close down her constituency office in Willesden, north London, last week after a dramatic escalation of violent threats and racist abuse, with bricks thrown through the office windows. “We had no choice,” she said. “The safety of my four staff members, which include a black male and black female, is paramount and even though we have mostly been working from home in lockdown, it is clear we could no longer operate from there.”
During her 15 year career with the party, serving as member of parliament, Butler said she had faced a significant level of racist abuse throughout. “It’s not at the scale of Diane [Abbott, who receives almost half of all the online abuse sent to female politicians], but there is the N word, black bitch, go home, you’re diseased, you’re ugly. It is deliberate racial hatred, bullying, and intimidation. It got really bad after Brexit and again now since the death of George Floyd.” Butler has faced humiliation at work too. She was once escorted out from a members room in the Houses of Parliament by a police officer who didn’t believe she was an MP, despite being vouched for by her colleagues. Her staff have to monitor her inbox and Twitter account for her, as both are frequently targeted with hate. Last year, she was attacked on the tube by a member of her constituency who threatened to kill her. “I raised it with parliament and I was told that the abuse I was receiving wasn’t enough to warrant any special security measures. I was really nervous about travelling and anxious about taking public transport after that attack. How much abuse do I have to get before it was enough?”
On Thursday, Starmer condemned the abuse Butler had suffered. He tweeted: “I have spoken to @DawnButlerBrent to offer the Labour Party’s full support and solidarity. The racist abuse that Dawn and her staff have suffered is appalling. Dawn’s voice is vital. The racism that our Black MPs face has no place in society.” The Labour leader recently announced the party’s new racial equality strategy and committed to unconscious bias training after being criticised for his comments on Black Lives Matter movement. In a television interview he referred to BLM as a “moment” and dismissed one of the protestors’ demands to “defund the police” as “nonsense”. “Keir has gone some way to addressing what he meant when he called it a moment, and clarified he was referring to an historic moment. That’s important,” said Butler. Despite having served as shadow minister for women and equalities in the last cabinet, Butler was not involved in helping shape the party’s new racial equality strategy. “I wasn’t aware of it…I haven’t read it,” she said. She grimaced when asked if unconscious bias training worked. “Learning is always a good thing, so you should never dismiss anything that educates. Keir is going on a bit of journey at the moment with regards to Black Lives Matter,” she said."
2020-07-11T16:15:50Z,politics,Politics,Labour calls for immediate publication of inquiry into Priti Patel bullying claims,"An inquiry into allegations that the home secretary, Priti Patel, bullied staff must be published immediately amid claims the inquiry’s chief is resisting pressure from Downing Street to exonerate her, Labour has said. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, wrote to the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, on Saturday, saying the delay in publishing the findings is unacceptable. A Cabinet Office investigation was launched in March following claims that Patel, who denies all the allegations, mistreated staff and clashed with senior officials in three departments, including in her current role as home secretary. It is understood that the report has been completed. In a letter to Gove, Thomas-Symonds and the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, said the delay “creates the clear sense that the government is acting in the interests of a Conservative party elite, rather than the national interest”. They added: “We have been asking frontline public servants to make extraordinary sacrifices throughout this pandemic and it is only right that they have full faith in those in government who make demands of them. “This report must now be published immediately for it to be properly considered before recess begins, and we look forward to your confirmation of this.” The investigation was launched by the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, who was in effect sacked following reports of tensions between him and senior figures in Boris Johnson’s team in No 10. The Times reported a “standoff” between senior officials and political aides over the publication of the inquiry’s findings. The paper said senior civil servant Helen MacNamara is refusing to exonerate Patel from some of the allegations of bullying, despite the prime minister’s aides reportedly wanting the inquiry to say it found no conclusive evidence. Thomas-Symonds said in the letter: “It has been over four months since the government promised a report into whether the home secretary broke the ministerial code. There are now allegations of deeply inappropriate political interference in the publication of the report, both in terms of content and timing. The delay in producing it is totally unacceptable.” Sir Philip Rutnam, who was the Home Office’s permanent secretary, quit in February, accusing the home secretary of a “vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign” against him. The inquiry is separate to an employment tribunal claim he has also launched against Patel. The home secretary expressed concern at the “false” claims and allies described her as a demanding boss, but not a bully. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: “The prime minister asked the Cabinet Office to establish the facts of the case, in line with the ministerial code. That process is ongoing and we will respond to the letter in due course.”"
2020-07-11T08:00:06Z,politics,Politics,'It's a boys club': Johnson accused of running ‘blokey’ government,"Boris Johnson is being accused of overseeing an “incredibly blokey” government, as analysis of the latest Whitehall shake-up shows key decisions are in the hands of a tight circle of powerful men. The prime minister has proudly called himself a feminist, and when he was foreign secretary he was a vocal advocate of girls’ education as a “Swiss army knife” to tackle many of the world’s ills. But Westminster insiders say few women can break into the inner circle, dominated by Johnson, Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings. “It’s a boys’ club,” said one woman who has worked closely with Johnson. “I don’t think he realises what he’s doing. I don’t think he intentionally cuts women out, I just think he has a view of the female role and that is never at the top table.” One startling indicator of male dominance is the makeup of the cabinet committees where many crucial decisions are taken. Under a shakeup announced last month, the direction is set on key issues – including Brexit, the Covid-19 pandemic, the economy and climate change – by tight “strategy” committees of cabinet ministers, chaired by Johnson. Day-to-day implementation is then overseen by larger, “operations” committees, most chaired by Gove, which involve a wider group of relevant ministers. The strategy committees are overwhelmingly male, and entirely so for climate, which consists of seven men, and the domestic economy, which is made up of Rishi Sunak, Johnson and Gove, with others summoned to appear when required. For Covid-19 strategy, there are six men and one woman, Priti Patel, the home secretary. Covid-19 operations is all male with Gove in the chair, Sunak in attendance and Matt Hancock swapped in for the prime minister.
The approach echoes that taken at the height of the pandemic, when Johnson was hospitalised with the coronavirus and day-to-day decision-making was by a “quad” of senior ministers, all men. When the prime minister returned to the frontline and became exercised about the scale of the crisis in the tourism and hospitality industries, the “save summer six” given the task of kickstarting recovery were also all men. The culture secretary Oliver Dowden’s announcement on Thursday that beauty salons would be allowed to reopen followed a backlash from female Conservative MPs who complained on WhatsApp groups that the industry had been ignored. Jill Rutter, a senior research fellow at UK in a Changing Europe, said: “Cummings has always had this view that you can’t have decisions made in big committees, and most of the top jobs are done by men.” Tim Montgomerie, who worked for Johnson for a few months in Downing Street, complained in the New Statesman of what he called “Dom’s frat house”, complete with joshing nicknames – though one Whitehall source insisted the recently departed cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, also had a hand in creating what they called a “macho” culture. But the same word is also often applied by friends and foes to Johnson, who bulldozed his way through last autumn’s election campaign in a wide selection of hard hats, last month ordered a repaint of the prime ministerial plane, and recently dropped to the floor to perform a press-up for photographers. No 10 sources insist Johnson’s Downing Street is not hierarchical, and point to the head of his policy unit, Munira Mirza, and fixer Cleo Watson as examples of women to whom he listens. But Rutter said: “It’s Munira Mirza and a bunch of blokes: I think this is an incredibly blokey government.” She pointed to recent appointments of officials including the new permanent secretary at No 10, Simon Case, under whom will sit two senior directors, Tom Shinner and Simon Ridley. Among the women in cabinet, Anne-Marie Trevelyan’s Department for International Development is about to be wrapped into Dominic Raab’s Foreign Office, and Liz Truss’s Department for International Trade may yet meet the same fate – particularly after she clashed with Gove over post-Brexit trade. The work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, who oversees the complex welfare system and whose department has processed a dramatic surge in benefits claims throughout the Covid-19 crisis, never got the chance to front the daily press conference. The junior minister Penny Mordaunt is widely regarded as being on the naughty step after criticising Cummings’s trip to Durham during lockdown.
Several female special advisers have left, including Sonia Khan, a former adviser to Sajid Javid, who was marched from Downing Street by armed police after being sacked by Cummings and is currently pursuing a sex discrimination claim. No 10 insiders insist they are meritocratic, and complain of a lack of senior women to choose from. “It’s not a Conservative problem, it’s a politics problem,” said one, pointing out that lower ministerial ranks and junior jobs such as parliamentary private secretaries were much more evenly balanced. But Amber Rudd, the former Conservative home secretary who stepped down from parliament at the last general election, said: “The fact that they have concentrated power into such a small group means it’s easier to exclude women and make it look like a coincidence”. When Hancock, the health secretary, was challenged about ethnic diversity in Johnson’s cabinet, he said: “It’s diversity of thought that’s the really important thing when you’re taking those big decisions around the cabinet table.” Alex Thomas, of the Institute for Government, said the new committee system showed that a very small group are in control. “Whatever their protestations, this clearly is a centralising government, and this provides the mechanism to draw the levers to the centre,” he said. “The trio at the heart of government – Johnson, Cummings and Gove – is ever more apparent.” Rutter pointed to the daily coronavirus press conferences, chaired in almost all cases by a man, as another indication of where the power lies. “When you see their spokespeople, it looks a bit like a throwback to the 1960s – without Barbara Castle,” she said. No 10 hopes to hire a woman to chair the new televised daily lobby briefings that will form part of a radical shakeup of government communications, but their role will be to defend and explain decisions rather than make them. Sam Smethers, the director of the equality charity the Fawcett Society, said Johnson’s government had a “gender blind spot”, which she argued may have contributed to a string of issues including the reversal on free school meals and the lack of any support for childcare in Wednesday’s summer statement. “They just don’t get it,” she said."
2020-07-10T19:42:31Z,politics,Politics,Vast Brexit customs clearance centre to be built in Kent,"The government has secretly purchased 11 hectares (27 acres) of land 20 miles from Dover to site a vast new Brexit customs clearance centre for the 10,000 lorries that come through the Kent port from Calais every day. It will be the first customs post erected in the UK to deal with goods coming from the EU for 27 years. Work will begin on fencing off the vast 1.2m square foot “Mojo” site on the outskirts of Ashford on Monday. The local council were given only a few hours’ notice that the land was now in public ownership. After being informed on Friday afternoon, the council leader has been forced to rush out hand-delivered letters to local residents to warn them of the disruption, Paul Bartlett, a Conservative councillor, told the Guardian.
The letter, from Rachel Maclean, MP and parliamentary undersecretary of state for transport, will say: “We are writing to inform you that the Department of Transport has purchased the site known as ‘MOJO’ (Church Road, Sevington, Ashford). Preliminary works are scheduled to take place on the western parcel from Monday 13 July 2020. This will include: securing the site with fencing, grass and weed vegetation cutting, extensive survey work, the constructing of a temporary site office, and the constructing of a temporary access to the site from the A2070 link road. “Plans have not yet been finalised for the use of this site, but is anticipated to form part of the Department’s strategy to minimise potential disruption at Kent ports for the end of the transition period. This is likely to involve temporary capacity for the holding of delayed HGVs and facilities for border-related controls to be carried out by government agencies (eg HM Revenue and Customs). More detailed information will be provided in due course.” The emergency purchase of the site is expected to be unveiled on Sunday by Michael Gove, who is to tour TV studios publicising the government’s multi-million-pound Get Ready for Brexit campaign. Businesses are bracing themselves for the publication of the first official details of the new border operating model and immigration system on Monday. The government has been forced to introduce customs controls because of the decision to leave the EU’s single market and the customs union on 1 January. When the single market came into being in January 1993, trade barriers across the bloc disappeared along with tariffs that many will remember as marking the end of duty-free alcohol and cigarettes. But from 1 January, the UK will revert to a system whereby importers will have to make customs declarations.
There are fears locally in Kent that it could lead to massive congestion and tailbacks on the motorways from both the port of Dover and the Eurotunnel freightway in nearby Folkestone. Last year contingency plans known as Operation Brock had to be put in place to guard against gridlock in the event that the UK crashed out of the EU with no deal. Bartlett said it was no surprise that the land was going to be developed as it had been empty for almost 10 years and that HM Revenue & Customs operations would be more welcome locally than the rumoured Amazon warehouse. “It is a huge tick that this creates skilled jobs,” he said. But he was concerned about the government rushing the new trading environment through. “Boris [Johnson] needs to be careful that these customs and tariff arrangements are finalised and in place in time, because otherwise there could be serious congestion, and we don’t want that. “There is an enormous amount of trust involved in Boris and his counterparts in Europe to get us where we need to be for 31 December and time is not on our side,” he added. Multiple government spokespeople declined to comment on plans saying details would be revealed “over the weekend”."
2020-07-10T18:22:08Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus live: Johnson signals stricter face mask rules and says people should 'go back to work if they can' â€“ as it happened,Thatâ€™s all from our UK live blog for today but please follow the developments worldwide on our global blog.
2020-07-10T17:55:19Z,politics,Politics,"Face masks could be mandatory in shops, signals Boris Johnson","The government is considering making face masks mandatory in shops, Boris Johnson has indicated, as he was pictured wearing one in public for the first time. “As we get the virus down, in the way that we have, and we stamp out local outbreaks in the way that we are, I do think we need to be stricter in insisting that people wear face coverings in confined places,” Johnson said during a Q&A session with voters on social media. “We’re looking at ways of making sure that people really do have face coverings, in shops, for example.” On Friday, face coverings became compulsory in Scottish shops, but people do not have to wear them in stores in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. Johnson said new rules might be needed to overcome a lack of tradition around mask use. “It’s very interesting, because in places like China or Taiwan, the far east, they don’t actually have mandatory face coverings, it’s just part of the way they do things. Clearly we don’t have that culture here in the UK, and we have to think about how we make it happen and how we make it work.” Masks are mandatory on public transport in England, and official guidance says people should also wear them in shops and other enclosed spaces, but Johnson and his senior team have rarely been photographed wearing one. The prime minister was seen publicly in a mask for the first time on Friday, donning a bright blue one in his Uxbridge constituency. Senior scientists had urged ministers to wear masks in public more often to set a good example. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, was pictured without a mask while serving a meal to customers in a restaurant following his mini-budget this week, and he has also been photographed bumping elbows with people as a greeting.
Other politicians have been less wary of face coverings. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, prompted a boom in sales of a brand of tartan mask after wearing one for an event where she outlined new Scottish rules for combating coronavirus. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, was pictured this week wearing a full protective visor during a visit to an engineering firm in Essex. The Liberal Democrat leadership candidates Ed Davey and Layla Moran have also been seen in masks. Prof Anthony Costello, a former director at the World Health Organization, criticised Sunak for not wearing a face covering while serving meals to promote the “Eat out to help out” scheme. He said it was “a terrible mistake” and urged ministers to set an example and wear face coverings in enclosed spaces. Costello told a briefing of the Independent Sage group that recent research from Hong Kong had highlighted theincreased coronavirus risk in indoor spaces, with most clusters of infections coming from “mask-off” settings such as bars, restaurants and gyms. “Our message is: wear masks indoors, wear masks in public places, and I think ministers should be setting a good example, and they are not doing that right now, particularly in England,” he said. The Independent Sage committee was set up by Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser, amid concerns about the transparency of the government’s own Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Speaking at the same briefing, Prof Susan Michie, director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at UCL, said fresh concerns around possible airborne transmission of the virus, as well as evidence of the effectiveness of masks in Germany, had “tipped the balance in favour of wearing masks in indoor, enclosed settings”. She said: “We are not a society that is used to wearing face masks, so we need to get every single lever that we can to make this happen. We’ve obviously had it made compulsory on transport, but that is not enough. We need a good mass education, persuasion and training campaign, because people do need to wear the right kinds of masks in the right way in order to make them maximally effective.”
Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has been pictured in a mask, as has the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden. The culture minister, Caroline Dinenage, said on Friday that she wore masks designed and made by her son, a fashion student. A Downing Street spokesman, when asked if he could name any more ministers to have publicly worn a mask, said: “I don’t spend my time with individual ministers.” On Sunak’s elbow-bump greetings, the spokesman said: “The social distancing guidelines are clear, we have set out what they are, and all the ministerial team, including the prime minister, abide by them when they’re out and about.”"
2020-07-10T17:51:01Z,politics,Politics,Government launches new 'Get Ready for Brexit' campaign,"The government is set to launch a multi-million pound “Get Ready for Brexit” campaign on Monday, as businesses awaited details of the complex customs regime they will face. More information about the campaign, which will be partly aimed at Britons living in the EU, will be confirmed by Michael Gove in TV interviews scheduled for Sunday. The controversial Brexit border plans – which were criticised this week by the international trade secretary, Liz Truss – will be published on Monday along with fresh detail on post-Brexit immigration. A 90-page draft of the new border arrangements, “The Border with the European Union, Importing and Exporting Goods”, seen by the Guardian, lays bare the complicated new paperwork facing all businesses from 1 January, whether there is a deal or not. Sources say a later draft runs to more than 100 pages and will give businesses the first confirmed details of the scale of the challenge they face in less than six months’ time. The draft version features flow charts and “process maps” instructing businesses on the steps they will need to take in future and needs a three-page glossary to explain some terms relating to importing and exporting.
It notes that from January, all businesses trading with the EU need to prepare for customs declarations, which have not been required since 1993, when the single market brought down trade barriers. A series of new inland customs clearance centres and border control posts are expected be built to alleviate congestion in ports including Dover, Portsmouth and Holyhead. New VAT and excise duty arrangements will also apply, with checks to confirm the ID of the driver and that the cargo matches the paperwork provided. Hauliers will be warned that if they bring in goods for personal use such as alcohol and cigarettes, they will have to be checked even if their cargo is cleared by customs. “When traders return to the UK, if they bring goods back in their baggage, they should go through the red channel at customs,” it says. Under a phased-in approach lasting six months, the government will hope to get tens of thousands of businesses familiar with the new system, but some fear the IT needed for the so-called “Goods Movement Vehicle Services” will not be ready in time. It will be trialled in Northern Ireland in November, according to an 11-page HM Revenue and Customs document seen by the Guardian. Last year, the government launched its first “Get ready for Brexit” campaign ahead of Britain’s planned departure on 31 October, urging businesses and individuals to prepare. It was halted three days before the UK was supposed to leave, as the EU granted another extension. It is believed that there will need to be a further campaign by the government if no trade deal is agreed with the EU. From 1 January an extra system would be in place involving tariffs on food, clothing and components in addition to the customs, VAT, security and health checks on animal and plant products. Checks will be phased in over six months, starting in January, a decision that led to conflict in the party, with Truss writing to Gove and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to warn that this could leave the UK “vulnerable” to smuggling and to a legal challenge by the World Trade Organization. While most of the communications will be aimed at businesses, the Foreign Office will also be launching a new advertising campaign on Monday to reach as many as possible of the estimated 1m Britons living in Europe to remind them of Brexit-related changes that will affect them. A government spokesperson said: “We are planning a comprehensive communication campaign from mid-July, to make sure people and businesses know what they need to prepare for the end of the transition period.”"
2020-07-10T17:42:30Z,politics,Politics,Downing Street seeks data expert to set up 'skunkworks' in No 10,"Downing Street is seeking applications for a £135,000-a-year data expert to set up a “skunkworks” in No 10, in the latest evidence of Dominic Cummings’ Whitehall shake-up. Cummings’ preoccupation with big data is well known, and he has recently urged ministers’ special advisers to swot up on superforecasting, a way of predicting the future using statistical analysis. No 10 has posted a civil service job advertisement for the head of a new analytical unit, who, the job description said, will work inside Downing Street for two years. “The analytical unit, known as 10 ‘data science’ or ‘10ds’ is a pseudo startup within No 10 designed to drive forward the quantitative revolution. The current plan is to establish a data engineering team, data science team, a skunkworks and an analytical deep dive unit,” it said. The term “skunkworks” was coined by workers at the aircraft maker Lockheed Martin to cover a small, loosely organised group working on innovative projects and unencumbered by bureaucracy. One of the priority policy areas highlighted in the advert for which “analysis is critical”, is “how to optimally achieve net-zero”. It said outside applicants can expect to earn £135,000 – or perhaps more for an “outstanding candidate” – a salary level likely to raise eyebrows in Whitehall. “The unit will ensure that No 10 is an intelligent customer of analysis, providing challenge and feedback across government,” the advert said. It warned that this may require “storytelling”, and the ability to “look through a different lens”. Creating the new unit is part of a radical shake-up of government, foreshadowed in a blogpost by Cummings in January, in which he highlighted the importance of data analysis. He also claimed “some people in government are prepared to take risks to change things a lot”. Michael Gove used a recent lecture to bemoan the lack of “hard, testable data” to evaluate whether policies conceived in Whitehall have worked well on the ground. “Government needs to be rigorous and fearless in its evaluation of policy and projects,” he said. Gove also suggested more data should be made public. “If government ensures its departments and agencies share and publish data far more, then data analytics specialists can help us more rigorously to evaluate policy successes and delivery failures,” he argued. News of the creation of “10ds” follows the announcement that Whitehall communications are being centralised, with scores of press officers laid off from individual departments, and their reporting lines shifted from their home department to Downing Street. A string of senior Whitehall figures have left their posts in recent weeks, including cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill, whose resignation was followed by the announcement that he would receive a compensation payment of almost £250,000."
2020-07-10T10:15:54Z,politics,Politics,Firm with links to Gove and Cummings given Covid-19 contract without open tender,"The Cabinet Office has awarded an £840,000 contract to research public opinion about government policies to a company owned by two long-term associates of Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings, without putting the work out for tender. Public First, a small policy and research company in London, is run by James Frayne, whose work alongside Cummings – the prime minister’s senior adviser – dates back to a Eurosceptic campaign 20 years ago, and Rachel Wolf, a former adviser to Gove who co-wrote the Conservative party’s 2019 election manifesto. The government justified the absence of a competitive tendering process, which would have enabled other companies to bid, under emergency regulations that allow services to be urgently commissioned in response to the Covid-19 crisis. However, the Cabinet Office’s public record states that portions of the work, which involved focus group research, related to Brexit rather than Covid-19, a joint investigation by the Guardian and openDemocracy has established. A Cabinet Office spokesman said this was because of bookkeeping methods, and insisted that, contrary to government records, all the focus group research done by Public First was related to the pandemic. The Cabinet Office, where Gove is the minister responsible, initially commissioned Public First to carry out focus groups from 3 March, although no contract was put in place until 5 June. Government work is legally required to be put out for competitive tender to ensure the best qualified company is appointed, unless there are exceptional circumstances, such as an unforeseen emergency. When a contract was finally produced on 5 June, it was made retrospective to cover the work done since 3 March. The Cabinet Office paid Public First £253,000 for the two projects listed as being Brexit-related and two more pieces of work done before the contract was put in place. Public First was required to conduct focus groups “covering the general public and key sub-groups”, according to a Cabinet Office letter. The firm was required to provide the government with “topline reporting” of their findings on the same day, with fuller findings reported the following day. The deal also included “on-site resource to support No 10 communications” in the form of a Public First partner, Gabriel Milland, being seconded to Downing Street until 26 June. Milland was the head of communications at the Department for Education when Gove was the minister and Cummings was his political adviser. The Cabinet Office said in the letter that it had commissioned the work from Public First for a total of £840,000 without any tender “due to unforeseeable consequences of the current Covid-19 pandemic”. According to further details published by the government under its transparency requirements, Public First was paid £58,000 on 18 March for its first focus group work, classed by the Cabinet Office as being for “Gov Comms EU Exit Prog”, then a further £75,000 on 20 March for work classed as “Insight and Evaluation”. On 2 April, 10 days into lockdown and with increasing numbers of people dying from Covid-19, the Cabinet Office paid Public First £42,000 for work listed again as “EU Exit Comms”. The first payment for work listed as being coronavirus-related was on 27 May: £78,187.07. A total of £253,187.07 was paid to Public First before the contract was entered into on 5 June.
The Cabinet Office spokesman told the Guardian that all the focus group work was related to the government’s Covid-19 messaging, and that the references to Brexit in the government’s official disclosures were misleading. He said the Cabinet Office accounts department did not immediately open a “cost code” classification for expenditure relating to the crisis, so the payments were initially allocated to an existing cost code, which included communications about Brexit. The political partnerships of Frayne and Cummings date back to at least 2000, when they worked together on Business for Sterling, the campaign against Britain joining the euro. In 2003, they co-founded a rightwing thinktank, the New Frontiers Foundation, and the following year set up the campaign to fight the proposed formation of a regional assembly in north-east England. Cummings has described that successful campaign, which was based on portraying politicians as a drain on ordinary people, as “a training exercise for an EU referendum”. Gove became the education secretary after the 2010 election, with Cummings as his chief political adviser, and Frayne was appointed as the department’s director of communications the following year. In 2010, Wolf, a former special adviser to Gove, was running the New Schools Network to promote free schools, which was awarded a £500,000 contract by the department that year without a tender. It was justified on the basis that it was the only organisation able to provide expert support quickly enough. The Cabinet Office contract with Public First is being challenged by the Good Law Project, which wrote to Gove on Thursday arguing that the absence of a tendering process was unlawful and not justified by the Covid-19 emergency provisions. In a letter telling Gove that they plan to seek a judicial review of the contract award, the project’s lawyers, Rook Irwin Sweeney, argue there is “apparent bias” in the contract going to Public First, due to their “close personal and professional connections” with Gove and Cummings. Asked if Public First’s links to Gove and Cummings were a factor in the firm being awarded the contract, the Cabinet Office spokesman replied: “This is nonsense. Public First were contracted to undertake this work because of their wealth of experience in the area. “Public First was awarded a contract to carry out daily focus groups across the country in response to the Covid-19 crisis,” the spokesman said. “They carried out this work to make sure the vitally important public health messages the government was issuing were the right ones. This work will continue to inform future Covid-19 campaign activity.” Rachel Reeves, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “It beggars belief that the government’s desperate defence of handing a contract for daily focus groups on Covid-19 to longstanding friends of ministers is coincidence, and to blame clerical incompetence for the reference to the work on Brexit. They should come clean about the purpose of this project, why this company was chosen without it going to tender and publish the research findings and recommendations for people to see for themselves.” Public First declined to comment."
2020-07-09T23:00:00Z,politics,Politics,"No-deal Brexit will raise cost of UK household staples, say retailers","The cost of household staples, ranging from meat and cheese to school uniforms and drinking glasses, will substantially increase if there is no Brexit trade deal, British retailers have warned. With just six months to go before the UK leaves the EU entirely by exiting the single market and the European customs union, retailers fear further damage to a sector already reeling from the coronavirus crisis, with 5,600 job losses announced on Thursday from Boots and John Lewis alone. In a report on the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the public should be aware that no deal will mean a hike in the prices of not just luxury goods but “ordinary household goods that every consumer has to buy and replenish”. “It’s not foie gras that we’re talking about, it’s mince, it’s cheese, it’s oranges, you know,” said Aodhán Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium in a Brexit press briefing. “It doesn’t matter whether it’s Great Britain, or it’s Northern Ireland, the people who will suffer most because of these cost rises will be those people who are most economically vulnerable.” The BRC has calculated that beef, which is imported in huge quantities from the Republic of Ireland, will go up in price by 48%, with cheddar cheese, another staple imported from across the Irish Sea, expected to cost 57% more. Oranges from Spain will cost 12% more, while the price of cucumbers will rise by 16%. Trousers imported from Italy will have a 12% levy slapped on them , porcelain kitchenware will also go up by 12% and drinking glasses made in Poland up 10%. Connolly said it was a misunderstanding to think that retailers and their suppliers had built up “huge Brexit war chests” and added that Covid-19 had exposed the fragility of the supply chain. “The ability and bandwidth, both financially and time-wise, of retailers to deal with a no-deal Brexit at the end of this year has been greatly diminished,” he said.
About half of all food consumed from restaurants or shops comes from the EU, with 30% of produce in supermarkets from the bloc. Trade deal talks continued this week in London, with the second face-to-face meeting between negotiators Michel Barnier and David Frost. Little was said to suggest that progress had been made and public pronouncements last week suggested they were a long way from a deal. Deal or no deal, the UK is facing a new trading regime from 1 January as the country exits the single market and the customs union, forcing customs and food health checks on goods entering the country. “That is going to increase a level of friction that we haven’t seen since 1972,” said the BRC trade expert William Bain."
2020-07-09T19:44:45Z,politics,Politics,What kind of revolution can follow the Tories' education crisis?,"Gavin Williamson was aware of at least one thing in his speech today in which he promised a revolution in England’s further education sector. “A lot of education secretaries across the years have said they want to support further education,” he told an empty room during his pre-recorded speech. “I know some of you will feel you’ve heard all of this before.” Anyone who had listened to Williamson’s recent predecessors would have a sense of deja vu, from the lament for the “forgotten 50%” of young people who do not enter higher education, to the desire to copy Germany’s much admired technical and vocational education routes. This time though a more menacing tone was aimed at higher education, principally universities in England, for somehow being too popular despite also being expensive and inadequate. But that was the fault of Tony Blair and his 50% higher education pledge, rather than whoever had been in power for the last 10 years.
Last week the first attack came from Michelle Donelan, the minister for universities, who was blunt. “Quite frankly, our young people have been taken advantage of, particularly those without a family history of going to university. Instead some have been left with the debt of an investment that didn’t pay off in any sense.” Then Williamson went further. In his speech – a preview of the Department for Education’s white paper on post-school education to be published in autumn and designed to bolster further education – his main target seemed to be universities. A plan “to tackle low-quality higher education” was somehow included between talk of apprenticeship levies and college rebuilding. “For too long we’ve been training people for jobs that don’t exist,” said Williamson, without naming any non-existent jobs. Even university vice-chancellors have by now figured out that things are going to get rough. To stop poaching, a student number cap has already been reimposed for this year’s admissions round. It was a Conservative-led government that abolished the cap on undergraduate numbers in 2015, and it may be about to return, permanently, to tackle “low-quality” courses. Between the lines in Williamson’s speech can be heard the words of Downing St advisers such as Alison Wolf, who has long complained about the complexity of vocational education in England. Hence his mention of “qualifications which no one takes, or that are poor quality,” being done away with. Another voice is that of Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s ill-fated special adviser at the Home Office and No 10. After failing to be elected as an MP last year, Timothy gained an appointment as a non-executive director of the Department for Education. Firmly a member of the “more means worse” brigade, Timothy’s views were confirmed when he discovered that his barber had a degree in football studies. But Williamson appears to have a plan for further education, aside from bashing universities. In his speech he repeatedly said that England’s colleges should be led by, and tailored to, their local communities.
The local employer link would in theory give further education a chance of emulating the German model. There are so many differences between England and Germany that transplanting a policy from one to the other is challenging, but the German model is heavily dependent on employers who fund vocational training through in-house apprenticeships. So perhaps that is what will emerge from Williamson’s white paper. But there’s much more to do. Williamson himself confessed that when he became education secretary he was shocked at how far adult education numbers had fallen. Kate Green, the shadow secretary of state for education, responded: “Any new support for further education is welcome, but it’s a bit rich for the government to complain about a crisis in FE that they themselves have created. Funding has been slashed by billions of pounds and support for learners scrapped.”"
2020-07-09T19:36:50Z,politics,Politics,Labour MP Dawn Butler closes office after receiving racist threats,"A Labour MP has been forced to close her constituency office after escalating racist threats towards her and her staff since she spoke out in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Dawn Butler, a former youth minister and the first black woman to speak at the dispatch box in parliament, said racism, death threats and attacks on her office and staff meant she had no option but to close her high street premises in Willesden, north London. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said the abuse she had received was appalling and she had his full support. Other MPs said they had deep concerns about attempts to silence her through intimidation. In a letter to constituents, Butler, who served as the shadow equalities minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said bricks had been hurled through her office windows. “I continue to receive on an almost daily basis threats of violence and death threats,” she wrote. “My staff have been attacked in the office, verbally assaulted coming and going from work, bricks have been thrown through the windows and the frontage has been smashed.
“I have had to work extensively with police and security staff to simply try and create a safe working environment for my employees. Many of these incidents were not made public in order to not encourage copycat attacks.” In 2018 windows at the front of the office were smashed, and more recently she received hate messages over social media, as reported by the Guardian in June. One message said: “There will come a time when you can’t breath[e], and we will all be happy,” while another said: “Come the revolution you will be one of the first.” Butler intends to hold surgeries at local libraries and the civic centre where, she said, it would be easier to maintain social distancing. She also said the rent on her office was becoming more expensive. Starmer said: “The racist abuse that Dawn and her staff have suffered is appalling. Dawn’s voice is vital. The racism that our black MPs face has no place in our society.” She was also supported by the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat. He tweeted: “Whoever is trying to silence ⁦Dawn Butler⁩ is threatening us all. We need to defend everyone’s freedom of speech and their right to choose who represents them. We cannot ignore this and see our democracy suffer.”"
2020-07-09T19:01:59Z,politics,Politics,Oliver Dowden unplugged: entering and exiting largely unnoticed,"Robbed. This should have been one of the greatest press conferences of all time. Just imagine. The lights go dim in Number 10 and the sound system belts out Eye of the Tiger. Moments later the strobes start flashing and Boris Johnson shadow boxes his way to the podium in a silk dressing gown. As the Survivor front man sings “Went the distance, now I’m back on my feet / Just a man and his will to survive”, Boris strips off the dressing gown to reveal his perfectly honed physique in a mankini. He then performs three star jumps and squeezes out one and a half press ups before performing his trade mark ‘Splash Down’ on Chris Whitty. There’s no coming back from that for the chief medical officer. Boris has still got it; “Don’t lose your grip on the dreams of the past / You must fight just to keep them alive.” Disappointingly, the hastily arranged Downing Street press conference didn’t quite pan out that way. What we got was something rather more pared down. No slide shows to let us know how many more people had died of the coronavirus or to cement the UK’s ranking near the top of the world mortality league table. Not even the chief medical officer or the chief scientific adviser to provide the sponges in the corner. Then again, maybe they weren’t totally on board with the health risks of what was about to be announced. What we got was a solo acoustic set from the culture secretary. Oliver Dowden unplugged. Which was something of a drawback as he has the air of a trainee sales assistant on the luxury goods floor of a department store. Posh, well-meaning, but not particularly bright. Somehow he managed to make what should have been a good news story, that all sorts of live events, sports, gyms, beauty parlours and tattooists, would be reopening sound rather underwhelming. Dowden began by saying that outdoor theatres and music venues would be reopening with new social distancing guidelines, so people could be flocking back to Glyndebourne in their ones and twos. Which might have been rather more enticing had the Glyndebourne website not already posted the news that all its live events for the rest of the summer were sold out. The 50 tickets that had been available had long since gone. It was less of a surprise to find that recreational cricket would be back in business from the coming weekend as Downing Street had spent hours watching videos of the Hemingford Hermits, officially one of the country’s worst teams, for which I had the honour of batting number nine and being fifth change bowler for the best part of 30 years. It had always been a point of honour for the Hermits never to stand within two metres of anyone or to field the ball cleanly. Having rattled through a list of activities – other than a visit to the National Gallery – that he would never have dreamed of doing himself, Oliver nervously took some questions and immediately came unstuck. How come the government was doing so much to help the entertainment industry when the redundancies in the retail sector were piling up by the day? “Um … er,” Dowden answered indecisively. Well the chancellor had made this splendid gesture in yesterday’s summer statement. “Eat out to …” Oliver’s eyes glazed over in panic. He had already forgotten the second half of the slogan. “Um … Eat out to … restart the economy.” Here’s what he imagined happening. People would get so excited by the prospect of a £10 voucher that on their way home they would get a bit carried away and treat themselves to a leather sofa. Some might even go completely wild and splash out on a new house that had gone up in price to offset the cut in stamp duty. It was all downhill from there. Inevitably, most journalists wanted more details on the science behind all this. After all, it seemed a bit odd that most schools couldn’t go back to normal until September yet the government was busy reopening gyms. By now Oliver was a beaten man. All he could offer was that he was sure the prime minister would never have sanctioned anything that put the public at risk. Er, hello? Have you met Boris. The whole point of Boris is that he thinks nothing of putting anyone, including himself, at risk. No one in government has a clue if the new measures will lead to a second spike, they just want a good news story to get them and the country through the next few months of the summer. “We are ramping up testing and tracing,” Dowden said helplessly, apparently unaware that the ‘world-beating system’ was still largely ineffective and was picking up only half of new infections at best. And no, there was no plan to move to mass asymptomatic testing because the current regime was already fully effective. Oliver fidgeted uneasily, moving his weight from one leg to the other as he said this. There is clearly something going on in his subconscious even if there is nothing much going on in his conscious. In an ideal world, the press conference would have ended with Boris being carried aloft on the shoulders of Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance while a tattooist inked ‘Champ’ on his pasty, chubby arm. Instead, Dowden sloped off largely unnoticed. Much the same way as he had arrived."
2020-07-09T18:28:41Z,politics,Politics,Chris Grayling closes in on role as chair of UK intelligence committee,"The accident-prone former cabinet minister Chris Grayling is expected to be appointed as chair of the powerful intelligence and security committee (ISC) next week after the Conservatives announced four other members who are expected to support him. The former transport and justice secretary has long been Boris Johnson’s pick for the job but the plan has been partly disrupted by months of wrangling as the Tories searched for colleagues willing to vote for him. Grayling was one of five Conservative MPs announced as members of the nine-person committee on Thursday night. It oversees MI5, MI6 and GCHQ and has the power to release the delayed Russia report, postponed from before the election. The others on the committee are the Conservative MPs Theresa Villiers, Sir John Hayes, Julian Lewis and Mark Pritchard, the Labour MPs Kevan Jones and Diana Johnson, the SNP MP Stewart Hosie and the Labour peer Lord West. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said: “It is then deeply concerning that the latest plan devised by Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson will aim to parachute Chris Grayling as chair of the committee by putting forward favourable Tory members who will vote him through as chair.” Opposition nominees were attempting to organise a rearguard action to block Grayling’s appointment, although that would require a Conservative to defect. Normally the Tories would have nominated a peer as a member, but the concern was that any nominee might be less likely to support the former minister.
Grayling is best known as an error-prone minister who presided over the collapse of Northern and Thameslink rail services and the granting of a no-deal Brexit ferry contract to a company with no ships. As justice secretary, he part-privatised the probation service and banned prisoners from receiving books from relatives, a measure that was overturned in the courts. He was also a prominent supporter of leave in the 2016 referendum campaign. The nine members were listed on order papers for the House of Commons and House of Lords, and they are expected to be confirmed after short debates next Monday. Sources said the nine would meet shortly afterwards to confirm who would become chair. It will then be up to the committee to decide whether to release the Russia report, which was blocked by Johnson before the election. It was cleared for release in December, shortly after his election victory, but its final publication remains dependent on the creation of the committee itself. The former ISC chairman Dominic Grieve, who quit the Conservatives and lost his seat at the last election, has called on the committee to publish the Russia report in full as soon as possible, although the new members will have the power to re-edit it. Downing Street has repeatedly said the report contains little that is revelatory, although others who have read it say it is a serious document worth scrutinising. Earlier on Thursday, one minister shrugged off claims the government had “dragged its feet” over the publication of the Russia report. Speaking in the House of Lords, Lord True described it as a “delicate matter”. “It takes some time,” he said, saying the delay was not unusual. The Liberal Democrat peer Paul Strasburger asked what the prime minister had done as foreign secretary when he was told of possible Russian interference in the 2016 EU referendum. Strasburger cited “alarming” evidence from the former MI6 officer Christopher Steele that the Kremlin had pushed for Brexit. “[This was] a serious attack by a hostile foreign power on the integrity of our democracy,” Strasburger said. The government has said there is no evidence of significant Russian interference in British politics, and True rejected the Lib Dem peer’s claim. “The result of the referendum was in the hands of 17.4 million people who I don’t think were bamboozled by KGB agents,” he said."
2020-07-09T18:21:46Z,politics,Politics,UK accused of 'empty talk' as Bahrain activists face death penalty,"The British government has been accused of “empty talk” over human rights as two pro-democracy campaigners in Bahrain face the death penalty. The UK has provided security advice to the island nation in the Persian Gulf for five years and funds a body that examines allegations of police mistreatment. Mohammed Ramadhan and Husain Moosa, leading figures in the pro-democracy protests of 2011, were arrested in 2014 and accused of killing a police officer. They say their confessions were extracted by torture. This Monday Bahrain’s court of cassation is widely expected to impose the death penalty, exhausting their final appeal against their convictions. James Cleverly, a minister in the UK Foreign Office, has resisted intensifying calls for the UK to withdraw from its arrangement with Bahrain, telling MPs on Thursday: “The Bahraini royal family have demonstrated a desire to improve their structures and transparency, and the resilience of their governmental structures. The oversight bodies we support are a part of that. While they continue to express the desire to improve their structures and head in a positive direction, we will maintain our support to enable them to do so.” He said the UK would continue to oppose the death penalty regardless of Bahrain’s actions, and that disengagement would not help the cause of human rights in the kingdom. Cleverly also touted the UK’s close relationship with Bahrain as making it possible for the British government to hold “candid conversations” with the king, including to express its opposition to the use of the death penalty. Harriet McCulloch, a deputy director at the charity Reprieve, accused Cleverly of “more empty talk about Britain’s ‘moral responsibility’ to protect human rights in Bahrain”. She added: “Two Bahraini men are likely to be sentenced to death on Monday, based on false confessions, following a UK-supported whitewash of their torture. It is not enough to have ‘candid conversations’ with Bahrain.” The level of pressure on the Foreign Office over the fate of Ramadhan and Moosa is unusually high, with ministers forced to come to the Lords and Commons in successive days to explain what pressure they were applying to save the men’s lives. Calls for a reprieve came from all sides of the Commons, including from two senior Conservatives: Peter Bottomley, the father of the house, and Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee. Both prisoners claim they were tortured, and Moosa alleges he was hung from the ceiling for three days before confessing. Stephen Doughty, a shadow Foreign Office minister, claimed confessions had been obtained by torture and that the two Bahraini security bodies that allegedly enabled the torture – the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) and the ombudsman for the Ministry of Interior – were funded by the UK government. He asked for positive evidence that UK advice to the SIU and the ombudsman had brought any practical benefit. “Since 2012, the government have provided over £5m of technical assistance [to Bahrain], yet the number of executions has increased and human rights abuses have increased,” Doughty said. Cleverley said the two bodies were relatively new and their abolition would be entirely counter-productive."
2020-07-09T16:52:21Z,politics,Politics,Labour warns UK recovery plan could end up wasting public money,"Labour has warned that Rishi Sunak’s £1000-a-worker job retention scheme could see money ending up in the wrong pockets, as the chancellor refused to rule out future tax rises to pay for his £30bn summer budget. Amid warnings from experts that much of the cost of the scheme could be banked by firms that would have kept staff on anyway, the shadow chief secretary to the treasury, Bridget Philipson, has written to HMRC’s chief executive, Jim Harra. She is calling on him to publish any internal analysis carried out by HMRC on the potential costs and benefits – and to appear before MPs. It has emerged that Harra had also warned the chancellor it was impossible to judge whether his plans to boost the economy were a good use of public funds. “Every penny given to those who don’t need it, when whole sectors of our economy are in trouble, is money not available to support jobs at risk, money not helping the families and firms in desperate need,” said Philipson. Harra took the relatively rare step of writing to the chancellor this week, in two separate letters, to request a formal “ministerial direction” to go ahead with both the jobs bonus, and the “eat out to help out” meal discount. The letters, and Sunak’s replies, were published by the government on Thursday. Sunak’s job retention bonus will hand employers £1,000 for every furloughed worker who is still on the payroll in January, three months after the job retention scheme ends. Harra said there was “sound policy rationale” for the scheme; but warned that as the principal accounting officer of the department funding it, he could not vouch for its “efficiency” – because it would be unclear how many additional jobs would be safeguarded. “It has proved difficult to establish a counterfactual for this scheme, which depends on the overall cost of the scheme and the number of extra jobs it would protect both of which are currently highly uncertain. That uncertainty also applies to the efficiency of the measure,” he said. In his reply, Sunak said there were “clearly compelling reasons to justify the introduction of this scheme”, claiming it would “play a vital role in supporting employers to bring their furloughed staff back to work”. Similarly, on the “eat out to help out” discount, Harra warned that the baseline for the scheme – to judge whether or not it has worked – “depends on the future demand for eating out in the absence of this scheme, which is currently highly uncertain”. He also warned of “potential losses” – suggesting HMRC believes fraudulent claims are a possibility. The treasury expects the £10 a head meal discount scheme to cost up to £500m. He stressed it was “entirely appropriate” for the chancellor to make his own judgment, given the severity and fast-moving nature of the downturn. A Treasury spokesman stressed that Harra’s warnings were needed because of a lack of time, and uncertainty about policy take-up. The same thing had happened, he said, when the jobs furlough scheme was introduced. “The system of ministerial directions is a normal part of business where the managing public money rules, for one reason or another, cannot be met,” the spokesman said. But the letters emerged after Labour had already seized on Sunak’s admission that there would be some “dead weight loss” in the job retention bonus scheme. In interviews on Thursday, Sunak said this dead weight was necessary to act at the scale and speed required even though it presented “some degree of moral hazard … in an ideal world we wouldn’t be doing those things”.
The Resolution Foundation thinktank pointed out that recent surveys suggested eight out of nine furloughed workers were set to keep their jobs anyway; while £1000-a-head might be too modest a sum to protect many jobs. Its chief executive, Torsten Bell, called it, “poorly targeted at those jobs that are most at risk of being lost”. In a series of broadcast appearances on Thursday after delivering his summer statement, the chancellor repeatedly refused to rule out future tax rises to pay for record public spending during the coronavirus pandemic. Sunak said it was “too early to speculate” when asked whether the government was planning to increase taxes to pay for the unprecedented public borrowing behind the coronavirus response. He said the extra spending announced in his mini-budget on Wednesday was intended to make the economic recovery as strong as possible but that it depended on whether Britons were willing to go out and spend. “We’ve moved through the acute phase of the crisis where large swathes of the economy were closed. We’re now fortunately able to safely reopen parts of our economy, that’s the most important thing that we can do to get things going,” he told Sky News. “But we won’t know the exact shape of that recovery for a little while – how will people respond to the new freedoms of being able to go out and about again. We have to rediscover behaviours that we’ve essentially unlearned over the last few months. “Unless activity returns to normal, those jobs are at risk of going, which is why we acted in the way that we did.” The chancellor said he was “not going to write future budgets now” when pressed on how the government would pay for the record borrowing behind the measures announced on Wednesday.
Sunak said the cost of not taking this action would be far greater but that such high borrowing was not sustainable and in the medium term ministers would “return our public finances to a sustainable position”. He said: “It’s difficult now to get exactly the right trajectory of that because we have an uncertain path ahead but as soon as we have a clearer path about that, we can look at the situation and make sure that our public finances are back on a sustainable footing over a reasonable period of time.”"
2020-07-09T16:39:15Z,politics,Politics,Man arrested in Solihull over suspected Â£500k furlough fraud,"A man from the West Midlands is the first person to have been arrested over suspected fraud with regard to the government’s job furlough scheme. The 57-year-old was arrested on 8 July in the Solihull area as part of an investigation into a suspected £495,000 fraud of the coronavirus job retention scheme. The man’s computers and other digital devices were seized, and funds in a bank account relating to his business frozen. He was arrested by officers from HM Revenue and Custom, which is responsible for overseeing the furlough scheme, under which the government pays 80% of the wages of staff, up to £2,500 a month, for those who have been stood down from work during the pandemic. Richard Las, acting director of HMRC’s fraud investigation service, said: “The coronavirus job retention scheme is part of the collective national effort to protect jobs. “The vast majority of employers will have used the [scheme] responsibly, but we will not hesitate to act on reports of abuse of it. This is taxpayers’ money and any claim that proves to be fraudulent limits our ability to support people and deprives public services of essential funding.” The man was also arrested in relation to a suspected multi-million pound tax fraud and alleged money laundering offences, HMRC said. HMRC said it had received more than 4,400 reports of suspected fraud linked to the scheme up until the end of June, more than 800 of which it had received within a month of the start of the furlough scheme. The authority is calling on anyone who is concerned that their employer might be abusing the scheme to report it to HMRC online. It is not possible for people to call the government’s fraud hotline because security measures now prevent calls being diverted to the mobile phones of HMRC employees working from home. HMRC said that 1.1 million employers have claimed more than £27.4bn through the furlough scheme, which has supported 9.4 million people. The scheme has been extended until October, although employers will have to start contributing towards staff costs from August. On Wednesday, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced in his summer statement that companies could obtain a £1,000 bonus for each member of staff they brought back from furlough and employed until at least the end of January. To claim furlough payments on behalf of employees, companies must be known and authenticated by HMRC, and workers need to have been on the company payroll on or before 19 March. The Guardian has previously received reports from members of the public who say that they have been asked to work for their employer while furloughed."
2020-07-09T16:16:00Z,politics,Politics,'No masks': Wagamama criticised over Rishi Sunak photo op,"Rishi Sunak was nowhere to be seen on Thursday at the central London branch of Wagamama where the chancellor did a stint as a waiter in a PR stunt that followed the announcement of his £30bn economic plan the day before, though his appearance left a bad taste for some. “He’s off today,” laughed one member of staff, as dozens of customers braved the pandemic to dine on lunchtime udon and ramen. Elsewhere, however, eyebrows were being raised. “Hey @wagamama_uk sort it out, please...no masks, nor visors...,” was just one of a number of hostile tweets directed at the company after the photo opportunity in which a barefaced and gloveless Sunak served food to customers and chatted at a close distance. “Do you let all your staff break procedures by not wearing masks when serving food to the public in the midst of a pandemic? Think I’ll give your place a miss thanks,” added another reply to a tweet by Wagamama, though some were also complimentary of the chain and the chancellor’s measures to kickstart the hospitality trade.
True to the “six safety steps” set out on the company’s website, a visored “safety host” was on hand to meet, greet and marshal arriving customers at the branch near Waterloo on Thursday. Inside, customers were seated apart among movable screens, while staff cleaned tables and sought to maintain a safe distance. But no other member of staff, including the smaller than normal team manning the restaurant’s kitchen, wore a face covering. The Guardian understands that there is a desire at least on the part of some to wear masks, though they say that the company has told them they cannot. Before coming to work, said one, they had been running through a checklist of potential symptoms. The absence of face coverings contrasts with other chains such as Comptoir Libanais, where some waiters have been wearing them. The Guardian has approached Wagamama – which has brought more than 2,000 staff back from furlough and will be among restaurants benefitting from a VAT cut and “Eat Out to Help Out” vouchers announced by Sunak – to ask for details of how its safety policy has been formulated and if staff are free to wear masks. Other safety steps being taken by the company include installing hand sanitiser stations and the introduction of contactless only payment via a website facility that also acts as a contact-tracing record. But there was also evidence of shakiness there. Customers clicking on what the website promised would be answers to frequently asked questions about how it was “staying safe” were met with a message telling them “nothing to see here” and stating that the page appeared to have been moved, deleted or did not exist. Sunak has bid farewell to his brief stint on the restaurant floor. Pivoting back to the political beat, he defended his social media messaging when asked about mockery of his penchant for posting graphics and soft-focus pictures overlaid with text – labelled ‘brand Rishi’ by some. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I’m keen to try and get our message across to as many people as possible and engage them, and if that means they poke some fun at me in the process so be it.”"
2020-07-09T14:43:12Z,politics,Politics,Ministers to ditch target of 50% of young people in England going to university,"Gavin Williamson has criticised the idea of wanting half of all young people to go on to higher education, describing it as an “absurd mantra” and signalling an end to a pledge made by Tony Blair in the 1990s that has been supported by successive governments. The education secretary said he wanted to see a revolution in further education and vocational training in England, and updated Blair’s motto, saying: “From now on, our mantra must be further education, further education, further education.” His speech was a preview of the Department for Education’s white paper on post-school education to be published in autumn, which aims to overhaul the types of qualifications offered by colleges to create a “world-class, German-style further education system”, according to Williamson.
He said: “I don’t accept this absurd mantra: that if you are not part of the 50% of the young people who go to university that you’ve somehow come up short. You have become one of the forgotten 50% who choose another path. “It exasperates me that there is still an inbuilt snobbishness about higher being somehow better than further, when really, they are both just different paths to fulfilling and skilled employment.” Much of Williamson’s speech criticised universities for their expansion in recent years, suggesting that they were failing to prepare graduates for the UK’s workforce. “For too long, we’ve been training people for jobs that don’t exist. We need to train them for the jobs that do exist and will exist in the future. “We have to end the focus on qualifications for qualifications’ sake. We need fundamental reform: a wholesale rebalancing towards further and technical education,” he said, arguing that workers with higher technical apprenticeships earned more than the average graduate. Universities UK, which lobbies on behalf of the higher education sector, was quick to reject Williamson’s claims, saying that more than 40% of courses offered by universities had a technical, professional or vocational focus, such as nursing. Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of Universities UK, said: “Increasing support for further education is an important move but it would be a mistake to view post-18 education as a binary choice between supporting either higher education or further education.” Williamson’s comments come after a record proportion of school leavers in the UK applied for university places this year, with more than 40% of 18-year-olds seeking to start undergraduate courses. In 1999 Blair made a pledge for 50% of young adults to go into higher education “in the next century”. That target was on track in 2017, when half of young people were likely to participate in higher education for the first time by the age of 30, with Blair’s target including those studying for vocational qualifications such as higher diplomas. While the Tories never explicitly adopted Blair’s policy, the party’s efforts in government have been an endorsement of the aim, including its 2015 decision to abolish the cap on the number of students each university in England could enrol. But Williamson accused Blair of failing those who weren’t able to go to university, saying: “When Tony Blair uttered that 50% target for university attendance, he cast aside the other 50%. It was a target for the sake of a target, not with a purpose. “Governments of all colours have failed to give the other 50% of young people the support and investment that they deserve. And all the energy and effort of our policy experts and media has been concentrated on the route that we took ourselves, driving more people into higher education.” David Hughes, the chief executive of the Association of Colleges, which represents further education and other tertiary institutions, supported the change and said Williamson’s speech was a “rallying call” for a more coherent education system. He said: “For too long, we’ve been fixated on a target set in a different era, by a different leader, when the needs of the country were vastly different. The 50% target felt right then and has now been achieved. It’s time to move on to a more ambitious target, one which recognises that the world has changed and the needs of the country and of its citizens have changed.” Williamson said that since becoming education secretary last year he had been “shocked to discover that while the number of people going to university has increased, the total number of adults in education has actually fallen”.
Williamson cited sharp drops in the numbers of people studying part-time or in adult education in England as reasons for concern. Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said further education had been hit particularly hard under the Conservative government’s austerity programme. “Further education is in dire need of funding, but that is because the Conservative governments of the last decade have decimated it,” Grady said. “Promising to scrap the 50% target of young people going to university might secure a headline but the road to our recovery from the current crisis does not involve cutting the proportion of young people accessing education.” Williamson’s announcement comes at a time of considerable danger for the higher education sector, which faces losing billions of pounds as a result of the coronavirus outbreak and its aftermath. This week the Institute for Fiscal Studies said 10 universities in England and three elsewhere in the UK were threatened by severe financial difficulties, with the sector to be hit by losses of £3bn to £19bn next year."
2020-07-08T18:58:52Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings to continue to take active role in government,"Last month, rumours across Whitehall had it that Dominic Cummings might take a less prominent role in No 10 following the humiliation of having to confess that he had travelled to Durham during lockdown. Instead, he appears to be front and centre again. He and the cabinet minister Michael Gove have overseen the departure of Sir Mark Sedwill, the government’s most senior civil servant; folded the Department for International Development into the Foreign Office; made plans to cut the government communications team of 4,500 people across more than 20 departments; and introduced a White House-style plan for televised briefings. There is more to come, say insiders. Following Wednesday’s announcement that Cummings has been granted permission to visit five of the UK’s top secret security sites ahead of the looming integrated review, he will have a role cutting waste in the ministry of defence. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union which represents the UK’s most senior civil servants, said: “Dominic Cummings may or may not have the answers to the government’s and the country’s woes, but what appears increasingly clear is that the centralisation of power and policy is the means by which the prime minister intends to execute it.” Cummings’ re-emergence has brought a sense of relief to some close to Downing Street. One source said: “It’s a bit like swimming with a shark – when you can see his fin, at least you know where he is.” Cummings’s projects Defence Cummings has written extensively about the need to stop wasteful spending in the Ministry of Defence, a department regularly criticised by the National Audit Office for failing to deliver multi-billion-pound schemes on time or within budget. Articles on his blog have argued in favour of using artificial intelligence and drone technology as opposed to traditional defence equipment. So Whitehall officials may be concerned to see that he appears to be spearheading Johnson’s review of armed forces spending. Any attempt to cut the budget or the personnel will face opposition from the military’s top brass and their supporters on the Conservative backbenches. Air capture Buried in the detail of Rishi Sunak’s summer statement on Wednesday was £100m of taxpayer backing for a leading-edge green technology known as “direct air capture”. It involves removing carbon dioxide from the air and compressing it into a form that can then be buried or stored. Cummings is enthusiastic about the technology, colleagues say– as is another government adviser, Tim Leunig– hoping the UK could become a world leader in it. It’s just one example of the government’s willingness to take bets on R&D with public money and one definition of what Johnson meant when he repeatedly promised to “unleash Britain’s potential” during the election campaign. Cummings is pushing through the creation of a UK version of Darpa, the US Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency, set up under Eisenhower in the 1950s, which backs new technologies and helped support the creation of technologies including the internet and GPS. The budget in March earmarked £800m to create the organisation, described as a “blue skies” science research agency. Communications Sajid Javid resigned during the February reshuffle, when he was told that his special advisers – including those dealing with the media – would be combined with No 10’s. Afterwards he joked that he wouldn’t comment on “Cummings and goings” – acknowledging the role of Johnson’s right-hand man in his departure. Last week it became clear that the change was just the beginning of a dramatic reorganisation of government communications, which will put Downing Street in the driving seat. While Cummings remains the lightning rod for criticism, the shakeup is as much the brainchild of Johnson’s director of communications, Lee Cain. Scores of departmental civil service press officers will see their jobs disappear, and those who remain will be line-managed by the Cabinet Office, instead of their own, home departments. Johnson’s team are scathing about the quality of some Whitehall press offices and want to centralise and standardise the messages emerging from government. Critics say it is a further blow to the independence of cabinet ministers. Recruiting scientists – and weirdos The government announcement on Wednesday, that it had created a new Office for Talent based in No 10 as a way to help leading scientists, researchers and others live and work in the UK, will come as little surprise to those who have observed Cummings closely. His obsession with bringing in scientists and outside talent into the orbit of No 10 has been a striking feature of Johnson’s seven-month tenure. In January, Cummings wrote a rambling blog calling for “weirdos and misfits with odd skills” to apply for new jobs in No 10. He wanted data scientists, economists, policy experts, project managers, communication experts and junior researchers, one of whom would become his personal assistant. Superforecasting Special advisers, whose contracts have been changed to give No 10 more power over their jobs, have been ordered by Cummings to read books promoting superforecasting as part of a training regime he arranged for the summer. At a recent briefing, they were told to read the 350-page book Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction by Philip Tetlock and High Output Management by Andrew Grove, which claims that “only the paranoid survive”. Cummings’ obsession with superforecasting, which examines how historical patterns can be used to make accurate predictions, was blamed for his recruitment of Andrew Sabisky, who calls himself a “superforecaster”. He was recruited to No 10 earlier this year but quickly stood down after it was disclosed that he had previously praised eugenics and argued that intelligence was inherited."
2020-07-08T18:26:36Z,politics,Politics,Liz Truss warns Boris Johnson over Brexit border plans,"An extraordinary cabinet row has erupted over Brexit with Liz Truss warning that Boris Johnson’s border plans risk smuggling, damage to the UK’s international reputation and could face a legal challenge from the World Trade Organization. The international trade secretary wrote to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and Michael Gove on Wednesday warning of four “key areas of concern” over their plans for the border next January. In a letter, dated 8 July, leaked to website Business Insider and also seen by the Guardian, she says: “Dear Rishi and Michael, I am writing to you to set out my key areas of concern on border policy and readiness for the end of the transition period and to seek your assurance that the concerns will be addressed.” She says she has written the letter in advance of the “border operating model publication on 13 July when the UK’s proposals for the border will come under renewed scrutiny both on the domestic and international stage”. Gove unveiled the new border Brexit regime last month for traders, announcing that customs and health checks required for goods imported from the EU would not be imposed immediately and instead be phased in over six months. But Truss warns the “staged approach” would “be vulnerable” to legal challenge by the World Trade Organization which could object to goods coming in from the EU being treated differently to goods coming in from elsewhere which are already subject to tariffs and quotas. She also raises concerns over smuggling because full checks will not be in place for all goods coming into the UK at borders from 1 January. “I would like assurances that we are able to deliver full control at these ports by July 2021 and that plans are in place from January to mitigate the risk of goods being circumvented from ports implementing full controls,” she wrote. Thirdly, she is concerned that some unscrupulous traders from outside the EU could exploit the lack of controls and get their goods across the border without tariffs or checks. Her fourth concern centres on a nascent scheme for traders sending goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Customs controls are being applied as part of the special arrangements for the region to avoid a border on the island of Ireland. She reveals that the digital application of the special tariff regime for Northern Ireland has been deemed “high risk” and “HMRC are planning to apply the EU tariff as a default to all imports in NI from 1 January 2021”. “This is very concerning as this may call into question NI’s place in the UK customs territory,” Truss wrote in relation to the potential imposition of tariffs. Under the Northern Ireland protocol, tariffs were to be imposed on goods entering the regime with rebates on all goods remaining in the region, such as goods going to local supermarkets. But the government has said that tariffs would not be imposed and business leaders assumed this was because they would have a sophisticated system in place, in time, to distinguish between goods remaining in Northern Ireland and those crossing the border into Ireland. Truss’s letter indicates that now is not the case. It comes as the environment secretary, George Eustice, revealed that the government is looking for some form of exemption for food arriving in Northern Ireland from Britain. “We will be trying to work out whether there can be special provisions on that, otherwise it will cause quite an issue,” he told a Lords committee, conceding that the “time is tight” to put any measures in place. Shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Rachel Reeves, said Truss’s letter “confirms fears that several ministers have been making things up as they go with a lack of awareness of the real world consequences of border policies they’ve had four years to develop”. A spokesperson for the Department for International Trade said: “We do not comment on leaks.” It said it was continuing its work and consultation with business to make the borders Brexit ready with a “new IT system to facilitate movement at the border”."
2020-07-08T17:23:23Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus live: Rishi Sunak unveils stamp duty cut, furlough bonus and August discount for eating out – as it happened","Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has unveiled what is effectively an emergency coronavirus budget, pledging new measures worth up to Â£30bn that are intended to help protect jobs when the current furlough scheme runs out and the economic crash starts to send unemployment soaring. By any normal standards the sums being spent are staggering, but the crisis has upended economic thinking and Sunak was criticised by the opposition parties for not showing enough ambition. (See 1.40pm and 4.34pm.) Many of the measures had been been written up or speculated about in advance, including a green homes grant (Â£2bn), a stamp duty cut (Â£4bn), a VAT cut for the hospitality sector (Â£4bn) and a kickstart scheme subsidising jobs for the young (Â£2bn). But there were some surprises. The most talked about may be one that was, at Â£500m, comparatively cheap - an â€œEat Out to Help Outâ€� discount scheme for people eating out in August, from Monday to Wednesdays. But the most significant, and expensive, was the Â£9bn job retention bonus. In his speech Sunak said the furlough system had to end in October. He explained: Leaving the furlough scheme open forever gives people false hope that it will always be possible to return to the jobs they had before. The job retention bonus will pay firms Â£1,000 if they retain furloughed staff, provided they are kept on until January. Arguably this might just delay the point at which people are made redundant. But, to coin a phrase, you could see this as flattening the curve. Here is our main story on the summer statement.
Here is a summary of the key points.
Here is a column on it from Martin Kettle, in which he argues that Sunak is â€œnow the most important person in the Conservative government, Boris Johnson includedâ€�.
And here is an extract from Martinâ€™s article. The long-term question for Sunak and his party is what kind of economy they are trying to create during this unprecedented time. His statement gave a hint about the need to return to sustainable public finances, but different sides of the Tory party can read different things into that. There was no strategic vision. The idea that there can be no going back to the old economic normal, on which much has been written, was ignored. There was almost nothing said at all about fiscal rules or about tax and borrowing. There was only a quiet admission that many of the jobs that existed before the pandemic have gone for good ... Where Sunak stands on this is not yet clear. He plays his cards close to his chest. By background and inclination he is a Thatcherite small-state, free-market politician. His style and language are centrist. But he was made chancellor by a prime minister who demanded control of economic policy in order to spend more. Thatâ€™s all from us for tonight. Thanks for the comments."
2020-07-08T16:56:41Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak the chancellor who can be trusted to do as he is told | John Crace,"That drink Boris Johnson was given at a nearby Wetherspoons at the weekend could just have been the best freebie Tim Martin has ever handed out. First up he got a 15% reduction in VAT, only some of which would probably get passed on to the punters. But he then got the promise of £10 meal vouchers for his slackest trading days of Monday to Wednesday. This was the kind of meal deal Big Tim could relate to. And who knows? It might even come in handy for his customers, provided they order twice as much as usual and take home the leftovers in a doggy bag that they can eat for the rest of the week. It’s a sign of the times that the chancellor’s summer coronavirus bailout package was greeted with little more than mild curiosity by politicians from both sides of the chamber. Only a year ago, a £30bn package would have been unthinkable economics for a Tory government, but now it’s just another drop in the ocean on top of the nearly £180bn already promised. What’s more, everyone knows this is merely the start. Come the autumn, billions more will be needed to even try to stave off a major recession and mass unemployment. Throughout his 25-minute statement, Rishi Sunak had looked profoundly unbothered about the sums he was spending. Then, to be fair, he has had rather more than his fair share of practice; over the past few months – ever since he unexpectedly landed the Treasury job after Sajid Javid stomped out when Classic Dom sacked his special advisers – he’s given the equivalent of eight budgets already. Come the end of the year, he’ll be well into double figures. And the coronavirus has made him demob-happy. Sums that might once have given him sleepless nights now barely raise his pulse. Then, apart from the Groupon-style voucher scheme, there was nothing in the chancellor’s statement that hadn’t already come pre-briefed. So Rishi rattled through his list of spending commitments as if he was reading out his shopping list. Though most MPs might, on reflection, have preferred some more money for a track-and-trace system that actually worked, as that really might have saved more lives. But you get what you get. So there was £9bn for firms that didn’t sack their furloughed staff until January. A kickstarter scheme for the young unemployed, which looked set to encourage people not to rehire their older, more expensive employees. A cut in stamp duty for houses under £500K. And £2bn in grants for homeowners to make their buildings more energy-efficient. Great for renters, that move. By the end, even the chancellor was having trouble sounding that interested in what he was saying. In reply, Labour’s shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, was caught between insisting that the bailout package had been totally inadequate to meet the scale of the pandemic crisis, observing that the Kickstarter Fund looked suspiciously like Labour’s Future Jobs Fund, which the Tories axed in 2010, and wondering how on earth the government was going to pay for it all. Rishi merely shrugged, amazed that anyone could question how the bill was going to be met. That sort of talk is so last year. These days it’s Tory policy to max out the credit cards. For most of the time Sunak had been on his feet, Boris Johnson had looked on like a proud dad, beaming extravagantly with every new spending promise. Rishi is the chancellor in his pocket. A man who can be trusted to do as he is told and who doesn’t have his eye on the top job. A Matt Hancock character, though with more brains. These days, Mattbeth’s ambition is limited to merely being allowed to remain as health secretary: something far from guaranteed given the ongoing disaster. Maybe he can one day look forward to being nominated as the next director for the World Trade Organization. After all, if Liam Fox can make that grade, then there’s hope for all of us. But towards the end of Sunak’s statement, Boris’s knee began to jiggle up and down uncontrollably, as if the excitement of the summer holiday spending plans had been replaced by a flashback to yet another disastrous encounter with Keir Starmer at PMQs. What’s more, it has been a totally self-inflicted wound, as all the Labour leader had to do was ask Boris six times to apologise for having blamed care workers for the high levels of care home deaths. Saying sorry isn’t Boris’s style, though. He’s yet to apologise or take responsibility for any of his actions – in his political or his private life – and he wasn’t about to start now. So he did what he always does when under pressure: he lied. He had never said the things that everyone had quite clearly heard him say. At times like this, you have to wonder just how emotionally damaged Johnson must be to behave in this way. It’s just our luck that at a time of crisis we have a car wreck of a prime minister in charge of the country. The more Starmer pressed him to apologise, the angrier Boris became. “You’ve become Captain Hindsight,” he snapped. In which case, this must make the prime minister General Oversight. Because his repeated assertions that no one had warned of the dangers of asymptomatic transmission are blatantly untrue. Scientists were flagging up this possibility in January, and for the government to have discharged untested patients into care homes was at best reckless. In the absence of proper data, any normal government would have erred on the side of caution. But Boris has never done caution. He is a compulsive risk-taker, the dealer who is watching for the card that is so high and wild, he’ll never need to deal another. Pushed into a corner by Starmer – a man he despises for his quiet, greater intelligence – Johnson could only yet again lash out wildly. Boris is so lost in his own bubble, he has no idea just how bad an impression he is making on the country. Yet there will be a reckoning. It may not be this summer. It may not even be this year. But Boris’s days are numbered. And his ending will be of his own making. His mistakes will not be forgotten; without humility, only humiliation awaits."
2020-07-08T16:56:05Z,politics,Politics,"Johnson authorises £248,189 'compensation' to Mark Sedwill","Boris Johnson has authorised a “compensation” payment of almost £250,000 to the outgoing cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, after he agreed to step down, it has emerged. The government made public a letter from the prime minister to the permanent secretary of the cabinet office, Alex Chisholm, approving the payment, which is likely to be put into Sedwill’s pension pot. In the letter Johnson says Chisholm had advised that, “in consideration of his employment position, and in the circumstances of his role being split, and Sir Mark stepping down early, it would be appropriate to make a compensation payment of £248,189”, and that it would represent value for money. Details of the payout were released after Sedwill made his first public appearance since his departure was announced, complaining that senior officials like him had become “fair game” for hostile briefings in the media. Britain’s most powerful civil servant told the national security strategy select committee that being briefed against had become a “regrettable feature of modern politics” as he was asked why he had agreed to leave the heart of government. “I’m not the only official that’s happened to – indeed, some others have had it worse – but we appear to be in an era where some of us are fair game in the media and I’m afraid it goes with the territory now. I guess my successor will have to deal with some of that as well,” Sedwill told the committee of MPs and peers. Johnson announced that Sedwill would stand down at the end of last month, ending weeks of speculation about the future of the cabinet secretary, who also holds the post of national security adviser. He had been accused by Downing Street sources in March of failing to get to grips with the coronavirus crisis, and was said to have fallen out with Johnson and his chief aide, Dominic Cummings, over the handling of the pandemic. Reflecting on that experience, Sedwill told the committee it was “never pleasant to find oneself, particularly as an official, in the midst of stories of that kind” and added it was difficult to deal with “briefings to which you can’t really reply, particularly those that are off the record and sniping away”. The committee hearing into Sedwill’s work as national security adviser began when he was asked abruptly by the committee chair and former Labour foreign secretary Dame Margaret Beckett: “You have resigned. Why?” Sedwill said: “I haven’t resigned. The prime minister and I agreed I should step down, it was by agreement. And that was essentially because we had concluded that it was time to split the jobs.” He added: “As we move into this next phase of dealing with Covid recovery, we concluded we needed a separate national security adviser, a separate cabinet secretary, and those people should see the prime minister through the rest of this problem.” Sedwill will leave government in September and a competition is open to all past and present permanent secretaries to replace him as cabinet secretary. His job as national security adviser will be taken on by David Frost, in addition to his existing job as chief Brexit negotiator."
2020-07-08T16:48:23Z,politics,Politics,Lord Patten: Trump's re-election would hurt efforts to stand up to China,"The re-election of Donald Trump will make it harder to form an effective alliance to prevent China from destroying the rule of law, the former governor of Hong Kong Lord Patten has said. Speaking to the increasingly influential China Research Group (CRG), a Conservative lobbying organisation, he said the wind was in the sails of those seeking to stand up to Chinese bullying, but that the US presidential elections would be very important in ensuring the liberal democratic case against China found support. “The Chinese can always win if they can pick off one country against another,” he said. “It is very, very difficult to make any coherent international policy work which goes to the fundamentals of being a liberal democracy that does not have the leadership of the US.”
Patten previously said the task of creating a unified approach on Hong Kong had been made more difficult by the fact that “the so-called leader of the west, the present American president, doesn’t seem to believe very much in alliances”. He urged Britain to take the helm in building this alliance, saying the UK had to play “a leading role in putting together an intelligent group of countries which are saying we are not prepared to have the 21st century destroyed in terms of the rule of law by the Chinese dictatorship”. Patten also called for Britain to independently examine every aspect of its economic relations and its future research coordination with China. He said a large part of the review should be into reciprocal access to markets and previous Chinese government commitments to make large-scale investment. “Being open about this would show we are not being scared witless,” he said. “We are facing some really difficult choices, but we have made those choices more difficult for ourselves because of the way we have behaved over the last 10 years or so.” The mood on the Conservative benches towards Beijing is increasingly antagonistic, and as a former Hong Kong governor, Patten’s strategic advice is increasingly sought by Tory MPs wrestling with how to respond to China’s rise and the imposition of new security laws in Hong Kong. During the CRG seminar he held off from directly saying that all international judges should pull out of the Hong Kong court of appeal, but said given the overarching Orwellian nature of the security law, “it does seem to me it is rather difficult [to see] how any judge with integrity can implement that”. Patten said the Hong Kong chief executive, Carrie Lam, could now select the judges for any trial and choose whether to hold trials in secret. He likened the security law to an “anaconda in the chandelier”. “You do not know when it is going to drop on you. That is the point of it. The definition of what you can actually do and get away with is going to be made on political grounds,” he said. Patten said the UK had to show greater solidarity with countries that found themselves in China’s sights. “When China uses hostage diplomacy, we should be in there complaining alongside the Canadians,” he said. “When they use trade bullying with Australia because the Australians ask for a full inquiry into how this virus started, we should make it clear we are on the Australians’ side. We should have been more publicly on the side of the Swedes, the Norwegians, the South Koreans when they are bullied by China.”"
2020-07-08T11:53:04Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson refuses to apologise to care workers at PMQs,"Boris Johnson repeatedly refused to apologise to care workers on Wednesday after claiming that some homes failed to follow “the correct procedures” during the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak. The prime minister said on Monday: “We discovered too many care homes didn’t really follow the procedures in the way that they could have, but we’re learning lessons the whole time.” At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, confronted Johnson with the remarks and pressed him to apologise. Johnson replied: “The last thing I wanted to do is to blame care workers for anything that’s happened. When it comes to taking blame, I take full responsibility for what has happened.” He praised care workers, saying rates of infection in care homes had fallen significantly. “That’s thanks to our care workers, and I pay tribute to them,” he said. But he claimed that on Monday he had been highlighting the fact that no one had known during the early stages of the outbreak what the right procedures were – a line used repeatedly by Downing Street since he made the comments. Urged again by Starmer to say sorry, Johnson said: “He keeps saying that I blamed or tried to blame care workers and that is simply not the case. The reality is we now know things about how the coronavirus is passed, person to person, without symptoms, that we just didn’t know.” Starmer pointed out that as many as one in 20 care home residents may have died in the pandemic, according to official figures, a statistic he called “chilling”. “By refusing to apologise, he rubs salt into the wounds of the very people he stood at his front door and clapped,” he said. Starmer also raised the issue of hospital parking charges, which reportedly could be reimposed for NHS staff. Johnson did not deny the reports. “Hospital car parks are free for NHS staff for this pandemic; they’re free now – and we are going to get on with our manifesto commitment to make them free for patients,” he said. He returned to an attack line he has used against Starmer repeatedly, accusing him of flip-flopping over his support for government policies, and teasing him for being a lawyer, saying he took one brief one week and another the next."
2020-07-08T11:49:22Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak backs down over tax on employer-bought Covid-19 tests,"The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has reversed a decision to force workers to pay income tax on Covid-19 tests purchased by their employers. HMRC guidance published this week stated that workers would face a taxable benefit in kind when their employer pays for coronavirus testing, meaning a reduction in take-home pay. But the Treasury select committee chair, Mel Stride, said the move was unfair, pointing out that workers could face mounting tax bills that risked discouraging them from getting checked. Now Sunak has relented, telling Stride that the government is “introducing a new income tax and NICs [national insurance contributions] exemption from income tax for employer-provided Covid-19 antigen tests.” The original guidance published by HMRC stated: “Coronavirus testing kits or tests carried out by a third party which have been purchased by you to provide to your employees are treated as a taxable benefit in kind on the employee.” Benefits in kind are those that workers receive from employers that are not included in their salary, such as cars. Employees have to pay income tax calculated on the value of these benefits, which is then deducted from wages through PAYE. The HMRC guidance made no mention of NHS staff or other key workers being exempt from the tax, and Stride warned: “Many employees, especially healthcare and hospitality workers, are required to undergo regular coronavirus testing. This new guidance is unclear and will worry a large number of workers.”
In a letter to Stride, Sunak clarified that Covid-19 tests were available “to a wide range of employees” via the government’s testing programme. He pointed out that care home staff have access to weekly testing whether they exhibit symptoms or not. “If an individual is tested through the government testing programme, no tax liability will arise. This means that in the vast majority of cases, those who need to be tested have been and will continue to be able to access testing through the government programme,” he wrote. However, he noted that Stride was correct in saying that “the provision of a third-party Covid-19 test by an employer to an employee constitutes a benefit in kind” and was therefore subject to income tax and national insurance contributions. He added: “As most workers will already be able to access tests for free through the NHS, we expect this to only impact a small number of individuals. However, given the importance of widespread testing, the government wants to ensure that all employers who wish to provide testing to their employees can do so without increasing their tax liability. We are therefore introducing a new income tax and NICs exemption from income tax for employer-provided Covid-19 antigen tests.” The exemption applies to tests that have taken place during the 2020-21 tax year. Stride welcomed the move, saying: “It would not have been right to increase the tax bill for workers every time that they had a coronavirus test. I’m glad that common sense has prevailed. And I’m grateful that the chancellor has listened to the Treasury committee and reversed this decision so swiftly.” A Treasury spokesperson said: “Given the importance of widespread testing, we want to ensure that all employers who wish to provide third-party testing to their employees can do so without increasing their tax liability. So we will introduce a new income tax exemption for Covid-19 antigen tests provided by employers. HMRC will amend their guidance as soon as possible to reflect this change.”"
2020-07-08T10:34:48Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings to tour sensitive MoD sites amid defence review,"Dominic Cummings is to visit the SAS and four other of the Ministry of Defence’s most sensitive sites, a leaked email has revealed, at a time when the armed forces are battling to avoid swingeing cuts in an upcoming review. MoD sources confirmed a personal tour had been organised for the prime minister’s chief adviser, which will also take in the specialist military research laboratories at Porton Down, Wiltshire. According to an email seen by the Sydney Morning Herald, the Cummings tour will also cover the Special Boat Service, defence intelligence and the Rapid Capabilities Office, which is responsible for special project development. Cummings has visited MI5 and MI6, the domestic and foreign intelligence agencies, twice already, it said.
The idea is to showcase some of the MoD’s flagship operations to an adviser who has complained that military procurement “has continued to squander billions of pounds” and who has written in his personal blog of the potential for drone warfare. The tour was deemed sufficiently important by Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, that he and his special adviser wanted to arrange its outline themselves before handing over to officials, according to the email. “The secretary of state explicitly does not wish anyone to engage Number 10 or Dominic Cummings on this,” the email said. “It is for the [the minister’s special adviser] and the secretary of state to engage in the first instance before delegating to officials.” It is understood Cummings’ clearance level was checked to ensure he was permitted to visit the national security sites on the list and to engage in open conversations with troops, researchers and intelligence specialists present. The prime minister’s press secretary said Cummings’ visit to military sites was a routine part of being an adviser. “He is the prime minister’s senior adviser so being in that position as you would expect he regularly visits government sites and meets ministers, similar visits have taken place involving senior advisers under previous governments,” they said. Downing Street has restarted an integrated review of defence and foreign policy, which was delayed by the coronavirus crisis. It aims to look at the strategic objectives for the armed and security forces for the next five years and is intended to feed into the autumn spending round. Over the weekend there was speculation that the armed forces faced significant cuts, including reducing the size of the army by nearly 20,000, to 55,000 personnel, but this was repeatedly denied by Wallace, who said the review process had hardly begun. Asked if Cummings is now leading on the defence review – assigned to the prime minister’s foreign policy adviser John Bew and civil service director general, Alex Ellis – the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “It’s really not unusual for senior government figures to visit government sites. The review will report back to the prime minister and Dominic Cummings is the prime minister’s senior adviser but it’s being conducted by John Bew and Alex Ellis.” On Tuesday, the Conservative backbencher Mark Francois warned the head of the armed forces that Cummings would “sort you out”, after a lengthy complaint about the MoD’s procurement processes. Speaking at the defence select committee, the influential Brexiter told Gen Sir Nick Carter, the chief of the defence staff: “Can we just make a plea to you. You are the professional head of the armed forces. Please nip back to the department and ask them to sort their bloody selves out, because if not, Cummings is going to come down there and sort you out his own way, and you won’t like it.” Cummings’ status within government appears to have rapidly recovered after he endured intense criticism for travelling to and around County Durham with his family during lockdown. His enthusiasm for the potential for military technology is well known. In March 2019, before he entered government, Cummings wrote: “A teenager will be able to deploy a drone from their smartphone to sink one of these multibillion-dollar platforms. Such a teenager could already take out the stage of a Downing Street photo op with a little imagination and initiative, as I wrote about years ago.”"
2020-07-08T06:16:16Z,politics,Politics,Summer statement: Rishi Sunak plans temporary job creation scheme for under-25s,"Rishi Sunak will respond to growing fears of a surge in youth unemployment from Britain’s pandemic-scarred economy on Wednesday with a £2bn temporary job creation scheme for the under-25s. Amid evidence that the fallout from the Covid-19-enforced lockdown has hit vulnerable young workers harder than other age groups, the chancellor will use his summer statement to announce that the government will fund six-month job placements for an estimated 350,000 18 to 24-year-olds. Sunak will announce a three-point strategy to support, protect and retain jobs but Whitehall’s concern about an imminent 1980s-style increase in youth unemployment was reflected in the government’s willingness to revive an idea used by Labour during the global financial crisis, and in the rapid timetable for the “kickstart scheme” to become operational. The Treasury said companies could start making applications for the jobs subsidies within a month and the first young people would be employed in the autumn. Although the economy is starting to open up gradually after its pandemic-enforced quarantining, Sunak has decided it is too risky to wait for his autumn budget to come up with a jobs package to help the heavy concentrations of young people working in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors. The chancellor’s statement is an attempt to stem the damage from a forecast 14% slump in GDP this year, according to the Bank of England, and a potential rise in the the unemployment rate from 3.9% to 15%, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Alongside the youth scheme, the chancellor will announce a £3bn programme to make homes and public buildings more environmentally friendly. According to reports, he will announce an immediate stamp duty holiday for homes at the lower end of the market, and cuts to VAT are also reportedly under consideration. The chancellor said: “Young people bear the brunt of most economic crises, but they are at particular risk this time because they work in the sectors disproportionately hit by the pandemic. “We also know that youth unemployment has a long-term impact on jobs and wages and we don’t want to see that happen to this generation. So we’ve got a bold plan to protect, support and create jobs – a Plan for Jobs.”
The Treasury said employers will be able to offer a six-month work placement for young people aged between 16 and 24 who are claiming universal credit and at risk of long-term unemployment. The state will fund each “kickstarter” job, covering 100% of the national minimum wage for 25 hours a week and with employers able to provide wage top-ups. People under 25 receive a lower national minimum wage, starting at £4.55 an hour for someone under 18, rising to £6.45 an hour for 18 to 20-year-olds and £8.20 an hour for 21 to 24-year-olds. The scheme is mainly aimed at people aged 18 and above because most 16 and 17-year-olds are in education or apprenticeships. The chancellor’s proposal received a cautious welcome from UK trade union body the TUC. Its general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Unions have been pushing hard for a jobs guarantee for young workers who lose their jobs during this crisis. “The chancellor has made a good first step. But we’ll be checking the small print to ensure every job provides proper training and a bridge to steady employment. “Employers must do the right thing. They should work with unions to avoid job displacement, create good opportunities for all young workers and guarantee they are paid at least the real living wage. “We must do all we can to avoid the misery of mass unemployment. The government should bring business and unions together in a national recovery council so working people are not made to pay the price of this crisis and ensure we build back better, right across the country.” In the first two months of the Covid-19 crisis the number of 18 to 24-year-olds claiming universal credit rose by a quarter of a million to almost 500,000, while 700,000 school leavers and university graduates will enter a depressed jobs market this summer. The Treasury said the subsidised jobs would give young people the opportunity to build their skills in the workplace, and to gain experience that will improve their chances of going on to find long-term sustainable work. Sunak is also expected to announce a £111m investment to triple the scale of traineeships in 2020-21, and an extra £32m for the National Careers Service. Kathleen Henehan, an economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “It is very welcome that the government has opted for a bold and ambitious scheme, with £2bn potentially meaning jobs for around 350,000 young people. This is exactly the kind of approach needed, learning the lessons of what worked in the financial crisis. “History also shows that it is crucial that these jobs are created quickly, with local authorities crucial in making that happen at anything like the scale the government intends. Three hundred and fifty thousand new jobs would be three times as many as were created under the Future Jobs Fund following the financial crisis, so delivery on this scale will be a huge challenge.” Young people are more likely to be furloughed, but Sunak made it clear in the Commons on Tuesday that he had no plans to extend the scheme beyond the end of October – which is expected to trigger a spike in unemployment. Currently, there are 9.4 million people on the furlough programme, which covers 80% of the wages of people temporarily laid off from their jobs. The chancellor rebuffed calls from Labour to leave the scheme in place for the hardest-hit industries, saying it would remain a nationwide “general subsidy” and would be scaled back next month before closing in October as previously announced. He also resisted pressure to offer extra help to the 1 million self-employed workers who miss out on all of the government’s subsidy schemes. “In terms of the design and the duration with which it lasts, the breadth of its coverage and the generosity of its support, it remains the most generous self-employment support scheme in the world,” he said. Conservative backbenchers have largely welcomed the government’s big-spending approach to tackling the Covid-19 downturn, though some traditionalists are beginning to sound the alarm.
Speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the veteran Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh said: “Can we hear from the chancellor and the prime minister less about high-spending lefties like President Roosevelt and more about good Conservatives like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher – less about subsidies and more about tax cuts and tax simplification?” Johnson appeared to hint last week that taxes could rise to pay for his spending plans, but he told the Yorkshire Post on Monday he has not abandoned a manifesto pledge not to raise the rates of national insurance, income tax or VAT. Other measures expected to be announced by the chancellor on Wednesday include a £3bn plan to green the economy."
2020-07-08T04:07:23Z,politics,Politics,How Rishi Sunak could kickstart UK's post-lockdown economy,"Rishi Sunak is preparing to announce a wide-ranging package of tax and spending measures to kickstart Britain’s economic recovery from the coronavirus lockdown. Designed to cushion the blow from rising unemployment and to help businesses back to their feet, the summer economic update on Wednesday comes as Britain grapples with the worst recession in living memory. Here are the key announcements to look out for from the chancellor.
Job creation scheme The chancellor will use the summer economic update to announce a £2bn temporary job creation scheme for the under 25s. In a three-point plan confirmed ahead of the statement, the government will fund six-month job placements for an estimated 350,000 18- to 24-year-olds, who are viewed as being at most risk of suffering the long-term consequences of unemployment during the crisis. Branded as the “Kickstart” job scheme, the package will include the government covering 100% of the national minimum wage for each young employee, for 25 hours a week. Employers will also be able to provide wage top-ups. Stamp duty A temporary cut in stamp duty – a tax levied on home purchases – could be announced by the chancellor to reboot the housing market after from three months of lockdown. Waiting until the autumn budget to implement the tax cut in England and Northern Ireland – it is devolved in Wales and Scotland – could dent property sales until then, meaning Sunak could announce an immediate cut on Wednesday. Sunak has drawn up plans to increase the threshold at which homebuyers start paying stamp duty from £125,000 to as much as £500,000, according to reports. VAT The rate of value added tax could be cut to boost consumer spending in order to kickstart Britain’s economic recovery, while supporting households that have experienced reductions in income during the crisis. Sunak has come under pressure to announce the change from former chancellors Alistair Darling and Sajid Javid. Targeted cuts for sectors of the economy hit harder than others could be used – with pubs, restaurants and cafes reportedly under consideration. However, a cut across the board from the current level of 20% to 17% would be expensive, costing the exchequer around £21bn in lost income.
Employer NICS Business leaders are urging the chancellor to cut employers’ national insurance contributions (NICs) to encourage firms to take on new staff. The chancellor is thought to be considering NICs holidays for employers as part of the stimulus package. Reducing employer NICS could be targeted to help companies in sectors hardest hit by the Covid-19 crisis, such as in hospitality, leisure and retail. Jobcentres Faced with a sharp rise in unemployment, Sunak is expected to announce that the government will double the number of work coaches, with more than £800m of funding. The extra spending, however, does come after a decade of cuts to support for unemployed people, with as many as one in 10 Jobcentres closed in the past decade. The new funding settlement will double the number of work coaches to 27,000, with 13,500 new recruits. Traineeships The chancellor will announce £111m of funding for new traineeships. These programmes for young people last up to six months and help teach key job skills, as well as offer work experience. The government will also offer businesses an £1,000 bonus to give work experience placements. Green spending Sunak is set to confirm the launch of a £3bn green investment recovery package to decarbonise public buildings and cut emissions from poorly insulated homes. It includes £1bn for public buildings – such as schools and hospitals – and a £2bn scheme to retrofit people’s homes. Under the plans, homeowners will be able to apply for vouchers of up to £5,000, with up to £10,000 available for some of the poorest families. Heating buildings accounts for almost a fifth of UK greenhouse gas emissions. However, campaigners have said £3bn falls significantly short of requirements to combat global heating.
Arts funding Britain’s beleaguered arts, culture and heritage industries will receive a £1.57bn rescue package to help weather the impact of coronavirus. Boris Johnson announced the plans over the weekend, although Sunak is expected to include the funding package in his economic update as evidence of the government stepping in with additional support for the hardest-hit sectors of the economy. The support pot for cultural organisations in England will consist of £270m in loans and £880m in grants. Funds will also be extended to cultural institutions and English Heritage, as well as to devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Funds for capital investment worth £120m will be made available to restart construction on cultural infrastructure and heritage construction projects paused because of the pandemic. Furlough scheme Business leaders, trade union leaders and Labour have urged Sunak to extend the biggest government support scheme launched since the onset of the pandemic. Since March, as many as 9.4m jobs have been furloughed at 1.1m companies, at a cost to the exchequer of £27.4bn so far. It is due to be scaled back from the end of July, and closed entirely by the end of October. Sunak has so far refused to allow an extension for especially hard-hit sectors. Voucher scheme The Treasury has been exploring plans to give all adults £500 and children £250 in vouchers to spend in sectors of the economy worst hit by the Covid-19 crisis. The idea, floated by the Resolution Foundation thinktank, was used in China in April, and could be used by Sunak to help reboot Britain’s retail, leisure and hospitality sectors."
2020-07-07T18:39:37Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak poses for pre-budget photo with £180 'smart mug',"For George Osborne it was a Byron burger and chips, with the upmarket chain undermining his bid to convey a man-of-the-people image. Philip Hammond settled for a personalised Emma Bridgewater mug emblazoned with his name. But the current chancellor, Rishi Sunak, appears to have gone one step further in the traditional pre-budget photo opportunity by posing with a “smart mug” costing £180. A series of snaps released by the Treasury show Sunak at work, with the expensive gadget on his desk as he pores over the details of the mini-budget he will deliver to the Commons on Wednesday. The Ember travel mug, reportedly a gift from his wife, Akshata Murthy, the daughter of a billionaire businessman, retails for up to £179.95 online, with a product description boasting that it “does more than simply keep your coffee hot”. It adds: “Our smart mug allows you to set an exact drinking temperature and keeps it there for up to three hours, so your coffee is never too hot, or too cold.” The 355ml mug is apparently dishwasher safe and even includes a charging coaster. It is a far cry from the image of Osborne chomping on fast food that he tweeted in 2013 on the night before he delivered the comprehensive spending review. The picture prompted ridicule, with the then chancellor accused of a misguided attempt to project a populist image. The Sun pointed out that the cheapest Byron burger was priced at £6.75, with the lowest priced McDonald’s at 99p. Osborne saw the funny side and later tweeted: “There I am working late on my speech, and I’ve got a takeaway hamburger, but it puts you on the front page of the Sun. It’s an occupational hazard.” In 2018, Hammond was pictured slurping from an Emma Bridgewater mug with his name and “chancellor” on the side."
2020-07-07T18:11:03Z,politics,Politics,UK Brexit negotiator meets EU counterpart in bid to revive talks,"The governmentâ€™s chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, is to host his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, for a private dinner in Downing Street on Tuesday evening in an attempt to revive flagging talks on a trade and security deal. Less than six months before the status quo transition period is due to end, both sides have expressed concern about the lack of progress in the negotiations. Barnier and his team of officials arrived in London on Tuesday and posed for photos wearing face masks. Informal talks between about 15 officials on both sides will take place in Whitehall on Wednesday.
The meeting follows the abrupt ending to the first round of â€œacceleratedâ€� face-to-face talks last week after which Barnier complained about a perceived lack of respect and engagement from the British government. Asked what would be on the agenda, Boris Johnsonâ€™s official spokesman said: â€œTheyâ€™re informal talks, so there is no published agenda, but you are fully aware of the range of issues that we need to reach agreement with the EU on. Discussions will cover everything from what the EU calls the level playing field, through to governance structures.â€� Downing Street said Frost and Barnier would dine on halibut â€“ perhaps surprising given that fish are one of the most contentious issues between the two sides. In a transcript of an interview with Barnier by a Lords committee published earlier on Tuesday, the EU negotiator accused the UK of continuing to seekâ€œthe advantages of being a member stateâ€� but with the right to diverge on regulations. He also warned that no deal would mean a cliff-edge for British exporters from 1 January as the EU had no intention of phasing in border controls like the UK. â€œWe will not delay things. As of 1 January, all products coming into the single market â€“ coming from any third country anywhere in the world, including yours, because you are a third country â€“ will be checked,â€� he said. Meanwhile, MPs have heard that EU citizens settled in the UK are being used by the Home Office as guinea pigs for a future digital-only immigration system. They will also face â€œsignificant problemsâ€� after Brexit unless the government provides them with a physical card to prove their right to remain in the UK legally, parliamentâ€™s Brexit select committee was told. A lawyer for the3million campaign group said some feared they risked ending up like the Windrush generation with difficulty evidencing their rights with landlords and employers. â€œThere is a lot of mistrust in the way that government does things, particularly the Home Office, and that has come about â€¦ because of a legacy of mistakes and because some very, very bad things that have happened to human beings. And I think a lot of EU citizens are very worried that this will happen to them,â€� he said. The rights of EU citizens have already been enshrined in the withdrawal agreement signed in January but the Brexit select committee heard that anxiety about their future rights remained high. â€œWords like angry, anxious, alienated, annoyed, unwanted, upset and unwelcome,â€� were the feelings cited in a survey of 3,000 EU citizens, which also found that 89% said they wanted a physical card. Concerns were also raised at about EU citizens wrongly being granted pre-settled status. As many as 1.3 million of 3.3 million people who had gone through the settlement process had been granted pre-settled status with fears raised several times in the past year that some people were accepting the inferior status without realising they were entitled to the full settled status. Piper told of the serious consequences for those that did not reapply or the vulnerable, such as children in care or people with dementia who for some reason miss the 30 June 2021 deadline for applications. Without the status, they would become unlawfully resident and lose their right to work and access to the NHS and housing until they acquired a legal status. Coram, the childrenâ€™s charity, recently published a report on children and settled status. It found that local authorities had secured status for just 500 of the estimated 9,000 children and young people in the care system. A Home Office spokesperson said: â€œNobody has been granted pre-settled status without first being offered the opportunity to submit evidence that they qualify for settled status. Both pre-settled status and settled status mean people can work, study, receive healthcare and access benefits and services as they do now. â€œThe EU settlement scheme also protects the rights of EU citizens in UK law and gives them a secure digital status which, unlike a physical document, cannot be lost, stolen or tampered with.â€�"
2020-07-07T17:03:47Z,politics,Politics,No 10 fails to apologise for Boris Johnson's care home remarks; death toll rises by 155 – as it happened,"The government has repeatedly refused to apologise after Boris Johnson said many care homes did not follow proper procedures on coronavirus, comments the head of a leading social care charity condemned as “clumsy and cowardly”. At least four pubs in England that reopened their doors for the first time on Saturday have been forced to close again after customers or staff tested positive for Covid-19. Asos and Next have dropped the fast-fashion brand Boohoo after claims that some factories supplying its clothes paid less than minimum wage and failed to protect workers from coronavirus. The number of unemployed people in Britain could soar to almost 15% of the working population if the country experiences a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has said. Hotel bookings for traditional regional tourist destinations in the UK are returning, as Britons plan summer trips to the seaside and the countryside, according to the owner of the Premier Inn hotel chain. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, came under pressure to reverse a decision to force frontline workers to pay income tax on Covid-19 tests purchased by their employers, as he was warned that it risked deterring people from getting checked for the coronavirus.
A mobile testing lab has been set up at JD Sports’ central warehouse in Rochdale after a small number of workers there tested positive for coronavirus. The Tory party annual conference is the latest political fixture to be affected by coronavirus with organisers confirming they are switching to a virtual format. That’s all from me.

2020-07-07T16:48:40Z,politics,Politics,Hollowed-out Hancock dies another death as he defends the indefensible,"We need to talk about Matt. Even with his new haircut – not that he particularly needed one, but all cabinet ministers had been under orders to have a pint and go to the hairdresser for a photo op on the first day of the easing of lockdown at the weekend – Matt Hancock is looking a shadow of his former self. His face looks drawn, his shoulders droop, and his previously even-tempered nature has become progressively more testy. You might even imagine he has been kicked out of his home and has taken to sleeping under his desk in his office, for every time he appears in public he is dressed in an identical suit and pink tie. Someone should break it to him that his lucky tie isn’t that lucky. The only lucky break the health secretary has caught in the last few weeks is the prime minister’s decision to abandon the daily Downing Street press conference, sparing him the ritual of being humiliated at least twice a week live on TV. But Matt still dies countless other deaths in his thankless task of trying to defend the indefensible: not just his government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, but Boris Johnson’s own personal take on it. With the government doing its best to try to persuade the country that the coronavirus is no longer such a big deal, the only way Labour can actually get any halfway reliable information about the progress of the pandemic is to ask an urgent question in the Commons. And the health secretary didn’t appear best pleased to be dragged in to answer it as he raced through a cursory update. The virus was more or less under control, he said, though Leicester was an annoying outlier, and people should be getting on with enjoying the summer. After all, we had a “world-beating” track and trace app that was capable of identifying at least 25% of people with the virus. Our cup runneth over. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, wasn’t particularly reassured. The fact that the number of infections in Leicester had dropped from 135 to 117 per 100,000 didn’t seem that wonderful when the German model for dropping local lockdowns was 50 per 100,000. Nor did the government seem to have grasped the economics of a sweatshop local economy that had resulted in so many infections. Mostly, though, Ashworth wanted an apology for the prime minister’s remarks blaming care home workers for the many thousands of excess deaths in care homes. Here Matt again sold his soul to the devil. It’s not the long hours he has put in that have contributed to his washed-out, hollowed-out demeanour so much as the lies he has been forced to tell that have corroded him from the inside. Hard to believe, but there was a time when Hancock knew right from wrong and would call it out. He knew Boris was a wrong-’un last summer when he stood against him in the Tory leadership contest, but when he was forced to drop out, Mattbeth let his ambition get the better of him. Boris had absolutely nothing to apologise for, Matt insisted. It was a total lie to suggest the prime minister had been trying to deflect the blame away from his own mishandling of discharging thousands of untested hospital patients into care homes at the the beginning of the pandemic crisis. The very idea that Boris might want to rewrite history ahead of any future public inquiry was unthinkable. For Boris was an honourable man. Someone for whom the truth was inviolate. A man who would never dream of promising £350m per week for the NHS and the mass immigration of Turks. A man who would never mislead parliament. All that the prime minister had been trying to say was that it had been impossible to know just how many asymptomatic patients might have been released into care homes. His words had been deliberately twisted and misunderstood by a Labour party – along with the rest of the country who had understood them only too well – in order to make political capital. Inside Hancock, a few more blood cells died. Mattbeth doth murder more than sleep. He also murders himself, for his body can no longer accept the daily compromises with the truth and is in full-scale revolt. In order to survive, the genuine Matt must die. Before long, the health secretary will appear only as a skeleton covered in a stretched parchment of translucent skin. Because to cover up Boris’s lies, Matt has to be complicit in his own increasingly tenuous grasp of the truth. Because most of us could have sworn that back in early March, Hancock had told the Commons that what made the coronavirus so deadly was the significant rate of transmission from asymptomatic patients. So both he and Boris were now speaking bollocks about not having shifted the blame to care homes. Other Labour MPs invited Matt to recant. It wasn’t too late. Debbie Abrahams asked Hancock to apologise for suggesting that the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, was too stupid to understand testing figures that didn’t actually exist. Angela Eagle begged Matt just to say sorry to the care homes. It might be asking too much of Boris to do so, but surely there was enough goodness still in the health secretary for him to manage it? For a moment, it felt as if Matt was tempted. But he doubled down on there being nothing for which the prime minister had to apologise. Weirdly, though, beneath all the weakness, I still feel there is something good in Matt. I may be a dupe, I don’t think he is beyond redemption. Boris talks of levelling up the country: what Matt needs to do is level with himself."
2020-07-07T13:11:23Z,politics,Politics,Conservatives confirm party conference will switch to virtual format,"The Tory party annual conference is the latest political fixture to be affected by coronavirus with organisers confirming they are switching to a virtual format. The annual event, which was due to be held in Birmingham in October, will be moved online, though party chair, Amanda Milling, said she still hoped some kind of physical event might be possible. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have already announced their autumn conferences will not go ahead as usual because of the virus. Milling said in an email to party members: “Due to the coronavirus we have had to review how we could hold a traditional conference in October this year. The party’s first priority is for the health and safety of members, delegates and attendees. “Following discussions with our partners we have decided that the Conservative party will host a virtual conference and move most of our conference in October online. “We are excited to be working with our partners and suppliers to produce the virtual conference and will provide further details shortly, with the full agenda going live in early September. “Party conference is a highlight of the political calendar and we know many people will be disappointed if they can’t attend conference in person.” The conference attracts thousands of delegates each year and is a significant party money-maker as organisations, exhibitors and lobbyists use it to rent spaces, host receptions and fringe events. The prime minister’s speech and others given by leading cabinet ministers are big draws but unlike other political party conferences it does not have any constitutional function and is more of a showcase for the party’s vision. Last year’s event held in Manchester temporarily looked in doubt during the prorogation fiasco when MPs voted against allowing a recess for the Tory party conference, which meant ministers were having to travel up and down to London to continue with business going on at the same time in the Commons. The Guardian reported in May how Labour’s annual autumn conference in Liverpool had been cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak, with an online event planned to replace it. The party conference, which would have been the first with Keir Starmer as leader, was to be held at the ACC convention venue in mid-September. The Liberal Democrats are also due to replace their conference, which was due to be held in Brighton, with a virtual version."
2020-07-06T21:30:13Z,politics,Politics,Chancellor set to announce £3bn green investment package,"Rishi Sunak is to announce a £3bn package of green investment to decarbonise public buildings and cut emissions from Britain’s poorly insulated homes as part of the government’s Covid-19 economic recovery plan. The chancellor will seek to use Wednesday’s summer statement on the economy to fend off criticism that his proposals lack ambition by insisting that he can “kick start” an environment-friendly revival through the creation of thousands of green jobs in the construction industry. Sunak will say that the extra money for decarbonising houses, schools, hospitals, prisons and military bases will help the UK meet its target of being a carbon net zero economy by 2050, and is likely to say that further green spending will be announced later in the year. Opposition parties and environmental groups said, however, that the green investment pledge was inadequate to meet the challenge posed by global heating. Rosie Rogers, Greenpeace UK’s head of green recovery, said: “Surely this is just a down payment? The German government’s pumping a whopping £36bn into climate change-cutting, economy-boosting measures and France is throwing £13.5bn at tackling the climate emergency. £3bn isn’t playing in the same league.” Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said: “We have consistently called or a recovery which has energy efficiency at its heart and will welcome any measures which achieve that. “But this needs to be part of a much broader and bigger scale strategy for getting on track for net zero, which includes a zero carbon army of young people being put back to work, investment in renewable energy and a plan to green our transport network. When the moment demands the most ambitious green recovery possible, the government has not so far risen to the challenge.” The Treasury said the summer statement was about “securing the recovery” and would be followed by two bigger events – a spending round and a budget – in the autumn. Sunak’s plan was on top of the £5bn of infrastructure spending announced by Boris Johnson last week.
Of the £3bn, the chancellor will earmark £1bn to improve the insulation and energy efficiency of public buildings, and to invest in green heating technology. Sunak will also announce £50m to pilot new approaches to retrofitting social housing at scale to make them greener, through measures like heat pumps, insulation and double glazing, which the Treasury said would support landlords to improve the least energy efficient social rented homes in England. Warmer homes for social tenants could lower annual energy bills by £200 a year for some of the poorest households, the government estimates. The UK’s homes are the draughtiest in Europe, accounting for about a fifth of the UK’s carbon emissions, but sporadic attempts at insulation programmes by governments over the last two decades have failed to make much progress. With the focus of the spending statement on jobs, it is thought most of the remaining £2bn will be spent on creating “green” employment opportunities for construction workers. The Conservative manifesto at the 2019 election promised to invest £9.2bn on improving energy efficiency in homes, schools and hospitals, saying that this, if done at sufficient speed, would create around 100,000 jobs. “The government remains committed to decarbonising buildings to keep us on track to reach net zero emissions by 2050,” a treasury spokesperson said. “The funding expected to be announced this week represents a significant and accelerated down payment on decarbonising buildings, to help stimulate the economic recovery and create green jobs. Allocations for future funding will be determined in due course.” Rogers added: “Of course this money is better than nothing, but it doesn’t measure up to the economic and environmental crises. It’s not enough to create the hundreds of thousands of new green jobs that are needed. It’s not enough to insulate all of the homes and buildings that need to be kept warm and more energy efficient. It’s not enough to ‘build back greener’, and it’s certainly not enough to put us on track to tackle the catastrophic impacts of the climate emergency.” Miliband has previously called for a huge green investment programme to create jobs, particularly for young people, in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, and to help tackle the climate emergency. Separately, the Liberal Democrats urged Sunak to zero-rate VAT on green products, including wind turbines, solar panels, bikes and e-bikes. The chancellor must not “miss this once-in-a lifetime opportunity to secure a green economic recovery”, Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at business group the CBI, said: “Investment in green jobs and technology must be at the centre of our efforts to revive the economy. “This £3bn package of measures will undoubtably fast-forward progress towards net-zero. With the government’s own manifesto promising £9.2bn on energy efficiency alone, we look forward to seeing the full details on delivery of its ambition to build back greener.”"
2020-07-06T18:51:35Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer to sign up for unconscious bias training amid criticism,"Keir Starmer has said he will sign up for unconscious bias training amid criticism of his response to Black Lives Matter protests and calls from a new co-chair of Momentum to “get Labour’s house in order” over racism. The Labour leader said the training was being introduced “for all of our staff and I’m going to lead from the top on this and do that training first”. He added: “I think everybody should have unconscious bias training. I think it is important. There is always the risk of unconscious bias and just saying ‘oh well it probably applies to other people, not me’ is not the right thing to do.” During an appearance by Starmer on LBC on Monday morning, a caller challenged him for describing the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement as a “moment” during a BBC Breakfast interview a week ago. That turn of phrase, and his dismissal in the same interview of calls to “defund the police” and divert the money elsewhere as “nonsense”, led to accusations that Starmer was belittling the grievances of anti-racism campaigners. Starmer insisted he had been misunderstood, telling the LBC caller: “What I was saying last week is that Black Lives Matter needs to be a moment, and I meant a defining moment and a turning point. I didn’t mean a fleeting moment.” A wider row in Labour has been fuelled by a leaked report on antisemitism that revealed WhatsApp conversations between party staffers including hostile comments about black shadow ministers under Starmer’s predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. The reported messages included ones describing Diane Abbott, then shadow home secretary, as “truly repulsive” and a “very angry woman” – a phrase critics said invokes a racist trope. Staff commented negatively on Dawn Butler’s appointment to the shadow cabinet, appearing to suggest her accusations of racism within Labour were untrue. Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, was also insulted. The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell wrote in an article for the Guardian shortly after the leak: “The alleged abuse of Diane Abbott, Dawn Butler and Clive Lewis, three prominent black shadow ministers, was appalling and, as others have commented, betrayed a deeply worrying underlying strain of racism.” The party has appointed a panel to investigate the content of the report and the leaking of it, and Starmer has said he will not comment on it until the results are in. Last month journalists at OpenDemocracy covering the story received a response from Labour describing criticism of the WhatsApp comments as “po-faced” and saying their tone reflected the expectation that they would remain “private and confidential”. Amid anecdotal suggestions that Labour is losing the support of black and other minority ethnic communities, Starmer held a “black reporter-only” press briefing last week in which he appealed to black voters not to leave the party. On Monday one of the new co-chairs of Momentum, Gaya Sriskanthan, said of Starmer’s response to the criticism that “taking a knee is not enough”, a reference to when the Labour leader was photographed kneeling in solidarity with those opposing anti-black racism. Sriskanthan, a climate activist, and Andrew Scattergood, a firefighter, were elected over the weekend to lead the grassroots movement, jointly taking on the role previously held by Jon Lansman. Sriskanthan said: “It’s a tragedy that so many BAME people are leaving Labour and Keir must deal swiftly with the racism revealed by the leaked report and get Labour’s house in order. “Momentum will do everything it can to make Labour a friend of social movements and welcoming for BAME people. Our party must reach out and work in earnest with the Black Lives Matter movement, not criticise it.” The Labour party has been contacted for comment."
2020-07-06T18:09:48Z,politics,Politics,Who was Sergei Magnitsky and how did UK sanctions come about?,"Who was Sergei Magnitsky? Magnitsky was a Moscow lawyer and tax auditor hired to investigate a particularly murky case of corruption. In 2007 a group of interior ministry officials managed to obtain a $230m rebate from the Russian state. They had fraudulently taken over three companies belonging to Hermitage Capital, an asset management firm. Most Hermitage staff fled abroad but Magnitsky stayed in Moscow and figured out the scam. The officials he accused had Magnitsky arrested and thrown in jail, where prison guards beat him up. He died in custody in 2009 after being refused medical treatment or family visits. He was 37. How did the UK’s Magnitsky law come about?
The success of the Magnitsky campaign is largely down to Bill Browder, Hermitage’s chief executive, who drove an international campaign to hold those responsible for Magnitsky’s death to account. Browder’s strategy was innovative. Realising there was zero prospect that the perpetrators would be punished in Russia, he pushed for asset freezes and travel bans abroad. Many Kremlin officials are extremely rich, and Browder calculated that depriving them of their wealth and ability to visit Europe and the US would hurt. Where has the Magnitsky legislation been adopted? The US Congress passed the first Magnitsky legislation in 2012. The law infuriated Vladimir Putin, who responded by banning the adoption of Russian children by Americans. Washington has subsequently broadened the list of sanctioned human rights abusers, adding individuals from Iraq, Myanmar and South Sudan. Several EU countries bordering Russia have followed suit with their own Magnitsky acts, including Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, as well as Canada and Kosovo. Australia is debating legislation. The EU agreed last December to enact a Magnitsky law but has yet to follow through because of the coronavirus crisis. Why has Dominic Raab acted now? Raab, the foreign secretary, has been engaged in the Magnitsky campaign for eight years, since his time on the backbenches. He paid tribute on Monday to cross-party colleagues who have long pushed for legislation, including the Labour MP Chris Bryant. Raab claimed on Monday the new law was an example of a post-Brexit “global Britain” acting as a force for good in the world. In fact, the UK could have enacted its own legislation earlier. All three Baltic states mentioned above have already passed laws while being in the EU. Who isn’t on the list? The government has so far taken action only against individuals involved in notorious and egregious cases. Critics say many high-profile perpetrators in Russia and elsewhere are not on the list. Those who are on the list are relatively minor figures. There is a compelling case for extending legislation to oligarchs and other Kremlin-connected people, some of whom own extensive assets in London. It remains to be seen whether Boris Johnson has the appetite to clamp down on dirty money coming into the UK from Moscow. There are also questions about whether senior Chinese officials should be targeted next for their role in suppressing protests in Hong Kong."

(See 5.05pm.) The UK government has said it will no longer publish data on the number of individual people being tested for coronavirus, after five weeks of failing to release such daily statistics. The Department of Health and Social Care has released figures suggesting that around a fifth of coronavirus tests sent out have effectively been wasted. (See 2.59pm.) Bereavement charities in the UK predict demand for their services could double in 2020 because of the pandemic, as struggling families of Covid-19 victims call on the government for more funding for grief counselling. Long-awaited UK government sanctions against human rights abusers, including a close aide to the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, have been unveiled by the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab.
Chinaâ€™s ambassador to the UK has said a ban on the Chinese tech company Huawei from playing a role in developing the UKâ€™s 5G network would damage Chinese trust in the UK and its belief that the UK can run a foreign policy independent of the US.

2020-07-06T16:26:22Z,politics,Politics,UK calls halt to daily data on number of people tested for Covid-19,"The UK government has said it will no longer publish data on the daily number of individual people being tested for coronavirus, after five weeks of failing to release such statistics. Downing Street said the decision had been taken because figures only count people having their first Covid-19 test, and as NHS and care staff can now often have regular tests, this could skew the statistics.
However, it drew criticism from Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who accused ministers of “dodging scrutiny” and covering up a failure to meet targets. The government still publishes daily figures for the number of tests carried out, and total testing capacity, but has not released a number for how many individual were tested since 22 May. At the time, the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it had been “temporarily paused”. On Monday, Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the DHSC had made this permanent, and would only publish daily figures for the number of tests. The figure for people tested will instead come out weekly, a week in arrears, as part of test-and-trace statistics. “This is because the daily people-tested statistic only counts new people being tested,” he said. “For example, someone who is tested in February and then tested again this month will only be counted once.
“Considering hospital and care home staff are now being tested on a regular basis, we don’t think this statistic would be an accurate reflection of the amount of daily testing that is taking place.” Justin Madders, the shadow health minister, said the situation was “an absolute shambles”. He said: “It seems that the real reason why the government stopped issuing figures for the number of people tested each day is because they never hit their 100,000 people a day target and they were too embarrassed to admit it. “It is clear that ministers are losing control over the testing regime and are failing to not only keep track of the tests but to ensure the results are returned swiftly.” Layla Moran, the Lib Dem MP who is heading a cross-party group seeking an independent inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic, said such data was “vital to ensure decision-makers are held to account”. She said: “First the government cancelled the daily press conferences, now they’ve stopped publishing the numbers of people who’ve actually been tested. It seems that at every stage, ministers are dodging scrutiny and covering up for their own failures.” The government has made a series of pledges on testing over the period of the pandemic, including a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, and then at least 200,000 tests a day by the start of June. However, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, later said the latter figure would be judged against the capacity for tests, not the number conducted. The latest daily figures show that in the 24 hours to 9am on Sunday, 164,849 tests had been provided, with the testing capacity for the day at 294,258. These figures cover tests to see if people have coronavirus currently, as opposed to antibody tests which detect whether someone had Covid-19 in the past. • The headline and text of this article were amended on 7 July 2020 to further clarify, in line with the article’s introduction, that the government has halted daily publication of data for numbers of people tested; figures will be released weekly."
2020-07-06T06:00:04Z,politics,Politics,Britain beyond lockdown: what we learned from two weeks on the road,"Britain is crying out for a better normal. Communities across the country are emerging from lockdown with a new sense of what is possible and what is necessary – and the answers to both go a lot further than Westminster’s efforts to drive the country back to business as usual. That was the overriding impression from a two-week reporting trip around Britain, asking people in different regions how they view recovery and whether there is an appetite for more fundamental change. The answer, overwhelmingly, was that we cannot just go back to the way things were, that there are elements brought out by lockdown that should continue, and that more needs to be done to prepare the country for the economic, mental health and climate crises to come. During the two-week trip, the Guardian reported on some of the communities worst affected by Covid-19, most vulnerable to economic shocks, and most interested in transition to a healthier, cleaner and fairer way of life. I visited Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Hartlepool, Aberdeen, Machynlleth, Fishguard and Bristol. Travelling by campervan, which doubled as a mobile office, hotel, restaurant and toilet, I interviewed more than 50 people, mostly in parks, hotels and shopping centres but also in a graveyard, and over phone and video calls. The Guardian also collaborated with YouGov-Cambridge Centre and Jesus College Intellectual Forum at Cambridge University to conduct a survey of more than 1,600 people. The poll, carried out at the height of lockdown in May, found that the British public believed the pandemic had been bad for mental health (41% negative, 40% neutral and 16% positive) and bad for individual finances (31% worse off, 47% the same and 18% better off), but good for family relations (40% positive, 46% neutral and 11% negative). They also said it had been excellent for air quality (66% positive, 20% neutral and 3% negative) and the overall health of the planet (75% positive, 12% neutral, 4% negative).
The journey revealed how quickly local communities had adapted to ease the worst impacts of lockdown and build on the benefits. Social centres, community-owned pubs, food banks, green groups and art cooperatives repurposed themselves within days to distribute food and medicine, set up online counselling and cooking classes, and provide emergency financial support – sometimes in the form of £50 in an envelope – for the many zero-hours contract workers who were suddenly unemployed but not immediately able to claim benefits. “The virus gave us permission to be kind again,” said Sacha Bedding, manager of the Annexe community centre in Hartlepool. “We should celebrate the way communities have responded. Millions did a good thing.”
While communities have shown speed and strength, the national government has proved slow and inept. The UK has so badly botched its response that the country is now recording more weekly deaths than the 27 EU nations combined. Britain’s economy has suffered more than that of any country in the G7. Harder to calculate is the emotional wellbeing of the nation, but the survey found higher levels of stress and many interviewees expressed concern about a looming wave of mental health problems. In an analysis of possible post-Covid-19 scenarios drawn up by the Long Crisis Network, the most compelling is a weakening of national and city institutions as they struggle to cope with a wave of crises that resemble “the latter, more frenetic stages of Tetris”. Alternatively, it predicts that these national and municipal institutions will act as a platform for ideas that emerge from communities and online. “Life becomes more local. The virtual is the new norm as physical travel seems daunting,” envisages the study. “Covid mutual aid networks evolve into essential assets in most places, balancing flexibility and informality, even providing hardship funds and peer-to-peer loans.” In many places, this is already happening. The reporting trip revealed how low-income Hartlepool has been less affected economically than affluent, globalised Aberdeen, where the collapse of oil prices prompted North Sea drilling companies to sack rig workers and engineers. In Hartlepool, a third of families were workless even before the pandemic struck. This meant the town had less to lose and its community support networks were already hardened by previous crises. “Instead of levelling up, we could see a levelling down,” Bedding warned. “Hartlepool could be the future for other towns.” Avoiding that means anticipating the next crisis rather than reacting only to the last.
After the financial crisis of 2008, the government put the onus for recovery on individuals by slashing public spending and encouraging UK consumers to splurge. That is less of an option now. Many people are still wary of entering shops and other public spaces. Despite the easing of the lockdown, most shopping centres were eerily empty. Angela Arnold, a coffee shop owner, said mindsets had shifted during lockdown. “I think it has changed people’s perceptions of shopping. We don’t just buy what we want. We feel like we have to justify it is what we need.”
The survey found that many people plan to improve themselves. Compared with life before the pandemic, the survey found people expect to keep in better touch with family and friends (48% more, 43% same, 6% less), visit parks (52% more, 38% same, 7% less), do physical exercise (50% more, 41% no change, 6% less), socialise with neighbours (33% more, 56% no change, 8% less) and eat healthily (38% more, 55% no change, 3% less). Respondents also said they aspired to drink less alcohol, produce less household rubbish and recycle more. There is also hope that lockdown will be good for the environment: 47% of people think it will be positive, 29% expect no change, and only 10% feel it will make things worse. But these good intentions could fade quickly without a strong sign from the government that the UK will not drift back to environmentally destructive economic habits. For all the prime minister’s talk of a “fairer, greener recovery”, he seems more interested in pouring concrete, laying tarmac and encouraging consumption. During the trip, mayors and academics said more could be gained if the state opened its wallet with investments to modernise the economy, create jobs and cut emissions. Car manufacturers need a jumpstart to switch production to electric vehicles, or they will be left behind by foreign competitors. In the north-east, plans for Europe’s biggest carbon capture and storage plant will give work to thousands and help cut emissions. In Aberdeen, wind turbine makers and hydrogen gas developers are creating jobs while oil companies are shedding workers. Across the country, the biggest employment boost could come from converting home heating systems. Although this may be less politically attractive to the prime minister than building “Boris hospitals”, it will do more to end fuel poverty and create jobs. The nation needs to convert 2,000 home gas boilers every day until 2050 to reach its legally binding net-zero carbon goal. There are also huge gains to be had from greater self-sufficiency and diversity in energy and food. At a community level, this is already happening. In Wales, the “land army” of volunteer workers are sharing their first harvest among the needy, promoting a “buy local” movement, and encouraging sheep farmers to devote more of their land to fruit and vegetables to reduce the risks of shortages and price spikes from imports. In Bristol, the working-class community of Lawrence Weston has opened a lockdown support centre and plans to build its own wind turbine, which would give it a revenue stream for the next 30 years.
Such strategic planning is essential. Community leaders know the health crisis is certain to be followed by a tsunami of unemployment, bankruptcies and mental health problems, and the ever more catastrophic effects of climate breakdown. As a result, resilience has gone from being a trendy buzzword for policy wonks to a priority for survival. During the lockdown, communities have shown themselves to be nimble and creative in these regards. This could be a building block for the future. Lucy Stone, a Dorset-based social entrepreneur who set up a community energy project in her village, believes collective local initiatives are creating a culture of “commoning” – sharing ownership, risks, benefits and decision-making. “You literally give people a stake. You don’t just consult them,” she observed. “This approach could accelerate action on climate and address the inequalities embedded in our current fossil fuel systems.” That is a far cry from Boris Johnson’s “build, build, build” attempt to return to business as usual. But it could bring people together, focus more on wellbeing than profit, and make the country more resilient to future shocks. It would also represent change on the scale the public desires."
2020-07-05T16:41:12Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Britain claps for NHS on 72nd anniversary – as it happened,"A further 22 deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK were recorded today, taking the total to 44,220. People across the UK have expressed their gratitude to the health service and its staff in a nationwide clap to commemorate the 72nd anniversary of the NHS. NHS England has launched a coronavirus recovery service to support survivors of the virus as they navigate the long-term effects. You can read more here. The chief executive of NHS England said the NHS was preparing for a possible second wave of coronavirus in the winter. Sir Simon Stevens this would be particularly difficult if it coincided with seasonal bouts of the flu, which has similar symptoms to coronavirus, so the NHS needed to roll out unprecedented flu immunisation schemes. Fears that emergency services would be overwhelmed after the reopening in pubs in England yesterday appear to have been unfounded. While the longer-term impact on the spread of the virus is not yet clear, police and A&E departments said they coped well last night. Despite the circulation of photos showing crowds and no social distancing in Londonâ€™s Soho last night, health secretary Matt Hancock said the vast majority of people were â€œdoing the right thingâ€�. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to roll out a new economic package focused on jobs on Wednesday. One of the largest studies into the long-term health implications of coronavirus launched in the UK today. Around 10,000 patients are expected to take part in the study, which has been given Â£8.4m by the government. You can continue to follow live developments on our global live blog:"
2020-07-05T15:05:15Z,politics,Politics,Met police urged to investigate Dominic Cummings' trip during Covid-19 lockdown,"The former chief prosecutor for north-west England has urged the Metropolitan police to launch an immediate investigation into Dominic Cummings’ trip from London to Durham at the height of the coronavirus outbreak. Lawyers for Nazir Afzal have written to the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, arguing that the behaviour of Boris Johnson’s chief adviser during the lockdown warrants a “thorough investigation”. They say the “continuing pressing public imperative to ensure strict compliance” with advice about the pandemic “makes this matter urgent”. Afzal’s lawyers point out that a three-day investigation by Durham police was confined to Cummings’ movement in County Durham and made no finding on why he left London when his wife was suffering coronavirus symptoms and a day before he fell ill with a suspected case. The letter to Dick says: “The apparent wrongdoing included actions in London, including Mr Cummings leaving his home without reasonable excuse on 27 March.” Afzal, whose brother Umar died of coronavirus on 8 April when he was self-isolating at home, has become the figurehead of a legal campaign to ensure that Cummings’ alleged lockdown breaches are fully investigated. As well as writing to Dick, his lawyers, Hodge Jones & Allen, have also written to the chief constable of Durham olice, Jo Farrell, and the director of public prosecutions, Max Hill, calling for further investigation of Cummings’ behaviour. All three letters say the information will enable Afzal, the Crown Prosecution Service and the public “to understand whether Dominic Cummings should be charged and prosecuted for breach of the health protection [coronavirus, restrictions] regulations 2020 and/or related offences”. They point out that a number of public authorities, including the police, have suggested Cummings’ bending of the rules had “undermined the importance of compliance and the made the task of police enforcement with the public more difficult across the country”. The investigation by Durham police found Cummings had probably breached health protection regulations when he took a 52-mile round trip to Barnard Castle with his wife and son on her birthday. The force decided to take no further action and made no finding in relation to the government’s “stay at home” guidance and Cummings’ initial decision to leave London for Durham.
The letter to Hill says Durham police’s investigation was “short, narrow and limited” and “did not consider the lawfulness of Mr Cummings leaving London, or other alleged wrongdoing”. It said: “We emphasise on behalf of Mr Afzal that it would be misconceived for the police or the Crown Prosecution Service to approach Mr Cummings’ conduct as if it were insufficiently serious to warrant prosecution at this stage … The seriousness of Mr Cummings’ wrongdoing is an assessment for prosecutors to make, once they have been given the relevant evidence by police and other investigators.” Each of the letters includes a nine-page annex setting out what is known so far about Cummings’ movement during the lockdown alongside the relevant rules at the time. It also includes a list of the “further information required”. Dick, Farrell and Hill have been given 14 days to respond. Afzal is worried that the Cummings affair has damaged public confidence in the law. He said: “I am concerned that the police and prosecutors have not received all the relevant information and their decision making will be incomplete as a result. I am troubled that previous correspondence from people, including MPs, has gone unanswered.” He also encouraged anyone with information about Cummings’ movements during the lockdown to email his solicitor, Mike Schwarz, at mschwarz@hja.net. Schwarz said: “It is Mr Afzal’s simple wish and expectation that current senior police investigators and prosecutors are reminded of their responsibilities and carry out their during in Mr Cummings’ case. By failing to do so they would perpetuate the public’s perception that there is one rule for those in positions of power and another for ordinary citizens.” A spokeswoman for No 10 said it was not commenting on the issue. A CPS spokesman said: “It is not the function of the CPS to investigate allegations of crime. Investigations into alleged criminal conduct are a matter for the relevant police force.” The letters will add pressure on Johnson over the behaviour of his chief adviser. On a LBC phone-in on Friday, Gurvinder from Slough asked the prime minister why he could not see his mother before she died while Cummings could drive 264 miles to stay at his parents’ property at the height of the pandemic. “How do you expect the public to follow the rules if the people setting the rules don’t really care about them themselves?” he asked. Johnson said he “really, really” understood public concern about the issue, and added: “Most people in this country have shown huge forbearance and sacrifice, the overwhelming majority.”"
2020-07-05T09:30:38Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel's balancing act as home secretary,"Priti Patel did not betray so much as a flicker of anger. Her voice was calm, her shoulders steady, and she bit her lip only very briefly before responding to black MP Florence Eshalomi’s emotional call for her to acknowledge and act on the fears raised by Black Lives Matter protesters taking to the streets. She was “saddened”, she told the House of Commons, to be accused of failing to understand: “It must have been a very different home secretary who as a child was frequently called a Paki in the playground; a very different home secretary who was racially abused in the streets, or even advised to drop her surname and use her husband’s in order to advance her career.” She needed no lessons on racism from Labour, she said. It was an arresting exchange, more so since Patel rarely talks of such things. She prefers to cast herself as the immigrant shopkeeper’s daughter made good, in a consciously upbeat echo of her heroine Margaret Thatcher; a woman defined by overcoming adversity, not suffering from it. It’s a gung-ho attitude that has helped the Tories’ first female Asian MP rise to the top of a post-Brexit party. Yet it means surprisingly little is known about what makes the most senior woman in Boris Johnson’s cabinet tick. Even some of Patel’s colleagues are said to have been surprised by her vehemence towards Eshalomi, a thoughtful new MP of only a few months’ standing, and 32 Labour MPs warning that “being a person of colour does not automatically make you an authority on all forms of racism”. Some felt that as a woman of Asian heritage, Patel couldn’t claim expertise on black British experiences. Yet if there was a weight of history behind Eshalomi’s questions – she was thinking, she says, about her three-year-old son growing up and being targeted for stop and search – there was history too behind Patel’s response.
All her life, she has faced uncomfortable questions about reconciling her politics with her identity. How can she justify curbs on so-called low-skilled immigration, which might have stopped her own parents coming to Britain? How could she be cheerleader for the leave campaign, which some saw as xenophobic, or defend the hostile environment for immigrants that led to the Windrush scandal (while apologising to Windrush victims themselves)? She has been accused of selling out, letting herself be used as cover for racist policies; on social media she has been called a “coconut”, a racist term for someone deemed brown on the outside but white inside. Yet there is genuine anger among ethnic minority Tories both at charges of betrayal from the left, which they see as inflammatory in the current climate, and at what they see as pressure to conform to leftwing ideas of how they “should” think. For all the liberal fury Patel attracts, meanwhile, she can never go far enough for some on the right. She walks a similar tightrope to that described by Sam Gyimah, the black former Tory minister who defected to the Liberal Democrats, when he wrote recently that “many on the left were frustrated with me for not being black enough, and on the right for not quite belonging”. Priti Patel was born in London in 1972, to parents who had fled Uganda just before Idi Amin’s decision to deport all Asians. The Patels were originally of Gujarati Indian origin and she has said that her grandfather owned cotton and tea plantations overseas, yet they arrived in Britain with nothing. Her father dropped out of his studies to take low-paid work, eventually establishing his own chain of corner shops. His daughter grew up playing under the tills while her parents worked, then helping in the shop herself (it was a customer, the Conservative MP Cecil Parkinson, who first encouraged her to join the party.) She often talks of her gratitude to Thatcher for creating the conditions for her family to succeed, and like her, stands in an old rightwing tradition whose message is that if one person can succeed against the odds then others can be inspired to do so. It’s an ideology that doesn’t particularly emphasise solidarity with one’s own race, sex or class and often shifts responsibility on to people to solve their own problems rather than on society to change, reassuringly perhaps for those whose interests lie in society remaining roughly as it is. (Famously, Thatcher managed to become Britain’s first female prime minister while insisting that she didn’t believe in women’s lib, winning over men who might otherwise have felt threatened by her.)
After Watford Grammar, an all-girls comprehensive, Patel studied economics at Keele University, followed by politics at the University of Essex. She was still at university when John Major’s disastrous exit from the European exchange rate mechanism triggered the Black Wednesday crash, and a recession in which her parents’ businesses were badly hit. That helped seal what was to become a lifelong distrust of anything to do with the EU. Patel’s first serious job was as chief press officer for James Goldsmith’s Eurosceptic Referendum party, a forerunner to Ukip. But when it disbanded after the 1997 election she came to work for the new Tory leader, William Hague, an instinctive Eurosceptic. It was there, as a cub lobby reporter, that I first came across her; then in her mid-20s, she was friendly and energetic, with a sharp nose for news. As a rough indication of what Westminster culture in the 1990s was like for young women, I have an excruciating memory of being made to call her about a picture story my then boss insisted on running, the working title for which was “Priti by name, pretty by nature” (she was always immaculately turned out). She was very easygoing about it, given she wasn’t hired for her looks, but then she perhaps comes from that breed of Tory woman who associates complaining with playing the victim. She left Hague’s team in 2000 to work for the PR firm Weber Shandwick, followed by a stint at the drinks giant Diageo. It was during this period that she met and married Alex Sawyer, a marketing consultant and Tory councillor in Bexley, south London, while also hunting for a parliamentary seat. She was championed by some powerful names, including the then leader Iain Duncan Smith, but a winnable seat proved elusive (she ended up fighting the impossibly safe Labour seat of Nottingham North in 2005.) The big dividing line of the era was not yet Europe, but how far the Conservative party needed to change in order to win. In the battle between modernisers – anxious to detoxify the brand by getting more female and ethnic minority MPs elected – and more reactionary traditionalists, Patel was classed as a moderniser. She told the Daily Telegraph in 2002 that her party’s problem was so obvious “it’s in spangly colours and flashing lights; this party has got to progress… We are seen as the nasty party. At the last election we were against things but not for anything.”
Yet she was quick to say she had been taken out of context when she was quoted a year later by the Financial Times talking about “racist attitudes” in the party, words that could easily have damaged her chances with grassroots Tories already suspicious of the modernisers’ agenda. Already she was learning to walk a very fine line. Whether or not she chose to discuss it publicly, her allies certainly felt she was encountering prejudice both because of her ethnicity and her gender (selection panels were famously suspicious at the time of young women they thought might go on to have children). She was advised by at least one sympathetic senior MP to tone down the moderniser stuff, and stress her Euroscepticism instead. Shortly afterwards she landed the winnable seat of Witham in the Essex commuter belt, following a barnstorming performance before the selection panel in which she declared law and order was breaking down and backed capital punishment. (She endorsed it again on BBC Question Time nine years ago, but now insists she was never an “active supporter”; her hardline views on crime have, however, been consistent throughout her career. She is an instinctively authoritarian home secretary, whose reaction to graffiti being daubed on the Cenotaph last month was to suggest 10-year sentences for defacing war memorials). Although she didn’t emphasise it, winning Witham in 2010 was a genuine watershed moment. “Remember, until she gets elected that night, there has never been a British Asian woman elected; then there’s six that come in together,” says Sunder Katwala of British Future, the identity and immigration thinktank. “That just seems a million years ago now, but it wasn’t.” Although there have been male Asian MPs since 1892 and Diane Abbott became the first black female MP in 1987, one last hurdle to representation remained. Of the six who finally cleared it, Patel was the only Tory. Her first few months at Westminster weren’t easy. Her son Freddie was not yet two, and politically she wasn’t close to the clique around David Cameron. When she defied the whip in 2011 to vote for an EU referendum (not yet party policy), she knowingly blew any chance of early promotion. Yet hers was an unusually independent-minded intake, who decided early that slavish loyalty to the Cameron-Clegg coalition wasn’t necessarily in their long-term interests. Patel quickly allied with the so-called “new right”, mostly from more humble backgrounds than Downing Street’s Old Etonians and more hardline on issues such as welfare and the free market; together with Liz Truss, Kwasi Kwarteng, Chris Skidmore and Dominic Raab (all but Skidmore now in Boris Johnson’s government) she co-authored their mission statement, a book called Britannia Unchained. A trenchant defence of capitalism in a post-crash era, it complained that “too many people in Britain prefer a lie-in to hard work”. Yet what’s striking, rereading it in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, is that it opens with a notorious story from the previous year’s London riots. A young Malaysian-born student, newly arrived in Britain, had inadvertently cycled into the wrong place at the wrong time; first he had his jaw broken by a teenager who stole his bike, and then he was robbed by two others who pretended to help him. For Patel and her fellow authors, Ashraf Rossli symbolised the best of immigrant Britain, with his A grades and determination to succeed; his 17-year-old attacker, Beau Isagba, represented the worst of what his country had become. The story was intended to signal that “good” immigrants who worked hard to succeed were more than welcome, with the book lauding Asian tiger economies’ work ethic and high educational aspirations. But seen through a 2020 lens, what’s striking is the contrasting of an aspirational Asian teenager with a violent young man who – although the book doesn’t say so – was black. (One uncomfortable undercurrent of Patel’s clash with Florence Eshalomi is the way it suggested growing differences between BAME communities. A key demographic for the Conservative party is people of Asian and south Indian heritage, with socially conservative views on issues such as law and order and taxes; but they do poorly among black Britons, a gap arguably now being exposed by the Black Lives Matter movement. Eshalomi herself is clear that “what I experience as a black woman of Nigerian heritage is totally different to what she does” as the daughter of Ugandan Asians, and that one experience shouldn’t be used to silence the other.)
By 2013 Patel had been sufficiently forgiven by Cameron to join his policy unit, and by 2014 was a Treasury minister; after the 2015 election she was promoted to employment minister in the Department for Work and Pensions, attending cabinet. Yet when her prime minister finally called the Brexit referendum in 2016, she risked it all to support what was widely expected to be the losing side, campaigning volubly to leave. “She’s very popular among Brexiters because like everybody in the cabinet at the time who put their jobs on the line, that was a very brave thing to do,” says Suzanne Evans, the former Ukip deputy chair who was on the board of Vote Leave. “It’s a testament to her principles.” While some wonder how deep Boris Johnson’s Euroscepticism goes, nobody doubts Patel’s. When she unexpectedly backed Theresa May, rather than the more obviously pro-leave Andrea Leadsom, in the post-referendum Tory leadership contest, some saw it not as a mellowing of her views but as an act of revenge for Vote Leave giving Leadsom more airtime than her. May rewarded her with a poisoned chalice: her first cabinet job, but at the Department for International Development (DfID), something she’d publicly advocated abolishing. Undeterred, Patel hired the Vote Leave staffer Rob Oxley (later to become Johnson’s press secretary) as her special adviser and embarked on a very public search for waste to cut. By the summer of 2017, May’s authority was visibly draining away but Patel’s star was rising. Her crowd-pleasing speech to that year’s party conference strayed well beyond the aid brief into a ringing statement of her credo that “wealth is created by people and enterprise. I believe in people, markets and freedom.” A month later, the BBC broke the news that during a family holiday to Israel that summer Patel had met senior Israeli politicians without telling the foreign secretary, a startlingly cavalier breach of the rules. More intriguingly still, she was accompanied by the Tory peer Lord Polak, chair of Conservative Friends of Israel; given his impeccable connections among Tory donors, the instant assumption was that she was preparing for a leadership bid. To May’s fury, further details of undeclared contacts with Israel emerged, and Patel was forced to resign. She spent only 18 months on the backbenches before new leader Boris Johnson gave her not just a comeback but a big promotion to home secretary, with a remit to deliver on the promised control of Britain’s borders. It was seven months later that the first allegations emerged of her bullying, belittling and shouting at civil servants. Claims of a “toxic clash” with her permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam ended in Rutnam resigning, and threatening to sue for constructive dismissal. Similar stories began trickling out of the DfID and the DWP, where a formal complaint of bullying and harassment against the department was reportedly settled out of court for £25,000 with no admission of liability. Patel can be utterly charming, and disarmingly kind. When the bullying allegations emerged, 100 professional acquaintances signed an open letter to the Daily Telegraph in her defence. But with even her own husband reportedly calling her his “personal piranha”, colleagues don’t deny she has a temper, especially behind closed doors. As one puts it: “If you work with Priti Patel you see one Priti Patel, and if you work for her you see a different one.” Her pace is legendary – she rises at dawn, leaves late, and works through weekends – and she has no patience for being told something can’t be done, or having her convictions challenged.
Some however see her bulldozing style partly as a means of hiding her own insecurities in a department notorious for being a political graveyard. “I think she herself is incredibly insecure, and the way that plays out is kicking the nearest dog. She isn’t as smart as some of the previous occupants,” says one former Tory staffer. Although she was thrown a lifeline this spring when leaked reports of an inquiry into her behaviour by the cabinet secretary found no evidence of breaching the ministerial code, at the time of writing the full report has yet to be published. Nonetheless, some suspect her ambitions don’t end at the Home Office. “I think Priti’s ambition will be undimmed,” says a former Tory minister. “If she navigates [the bullying allegations] successfully she’ll be encouraged by that. She’ll see it as an attack by enemies that she has overcome. The Home Office is a poisoned chalice but if she can make a political success of it among the Conservative electorate and the MPs then why not? She has a following.” It’s a mark of how far the party has changed that some speculate its next leadership contest could be between Patel and the more pragmatic current chancellor, Rishi Sunak. But if the party has never looked more diverse, that’s not necessarily the same thing as more progressive. In his autobiography, David Cameron writes that of all the ministers who campaigned against him for leave, it was Patel’s behaviour during the referendum that “probably shocked me most”. There was unease in No 10 over her willingness not just to attack the government of which she was still part but to front inflammatory Vote Leave messages suggesting that immigrants were fuelling a shortage of primary school places, or wealthy remainers didn’t understand how immigration hurt the poor. Tories who have worked in government with her dismiss the idea that she’s a puppet, manipulated into mouthing other people’s slogans: “It’s her, it’s what she believes.” But those beliefs are perhaps more complex than is sometimes acknowledged. The points-based immigration system she is introducing has been widely criticised for excluding so-called low-skilled migrants, doing jobs that in some cases have proved vital during the pandemic. But to the dismay of some leavers, it contains no legal cap on the numbers coming in; she has ditched Cameron’s target for immigration to be limited to “tens of thousands”. During the referendum she repeatedly argued that ending unlimited free movement from the EU could mean Britain accepting more skilled migrants from former Commonwealth countries such as India or Pakistan, and she pushed hard inside cabinet for nearly 3 million Hong Kong citizens to be offered visas to live and work in Britain, amid escalating tensions with China. (Some wonder whether she sees parallels between the Hong Kong cases and her own parents fleeing Uganda; when asked why she devises policies that might have excluded her own family, she invariably insists they weren’t coming to Britain seeking work – as entrants under the points-based system will be – but escaping a hostile regime, suggesting they might be classed as political refugees). For now, her tough stances on immigration and crime make her critical to No 10’s plans. But is her position as secure as it looks? She is the most senior woman in cabinet, yet wasn’t officially added to the innermost “quad” taking all the big coronavirus decisions until June, and appeared only rarely at the daily coronavirus press conferences. The rightwing tabloids love her, but some old Whitehall hands wonder if those eye-catching headlines are coming at the expense of long-term strategy. “Her survival is dependent on her playing her part as a key cavalier in the culture war, and that’s the problem,” says a former Tory aide. And while the Conservative faithful still adore her, the unspoken rule seems to be that she doesn’t make them feel uncomfortable. “Priti Patel is loved by the grassroots, but that’s because she expresses the views of the grassroots,” says one former colleague, who argues her appeal lies in making the party feel good about itself for choosing her. But like all tightrope walkers, Patel must know that if she makes the wrong call, the ground can be a very long way down."
2020-07-05T09:24:09Z,politics,Politics,Hancock praises people for acting responsibly as pubs reopen in England,"The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has praised “the vast majority” of people who behaved responsibly as pubs in England reopened on Saturday. In an interview on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, he played down a claim from the chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales that social distancing could never work with people who were drunk. Asked for his overall assessment of how the easing of lockdown measures on Saturday had gone, Hancock said: “From what I’ve seen, although there’s some pictures to the contrary, very, very largely people have acted responsibly. “So overall I’m pleased with what happened yesterday. It was really good to see people out and about and largely, very largely, social distancing.”
Fears that the decision to schedule the lifting of lockdown restrictions for pubs in England on a Saturday might lead to widespread disorder proved unfounded, but John Apter, the Police Federation chair, said people who had been drinking were not complying with social distancing rules. In a series of tweets after a late shift in Southampton, Apter said he had seen “naked men, possession of class A drugs, happy drunks, angry drunks, fights [and] more angry drunks.” He said: “What was crystal clear is that drunk people can’t/won’t socially distance.” Asked about Apter’s comments, Hancock said that throughout the coronavirus crisis there had always been some incidents that were “very unhelpful”. But they were just a small minority, he said. “The large proportion of people, the vast majority of people, are, I think, doing the right thing..” Hancock said the government had a “balanced message” for the public: “People should enjoy summer safely, and of course the emphasis is both on enjoy and safely.”
Stressing the need for people to carry on with safety measures such as hand-washing, Hancock went on: “We have got this virus getting right under control, the number of new infections is under 600 on the last data, so it is really coming down in terms of the number of positive cases that we’re finding and that is good news. “But we’ve just got to have the resilience and resolve to stick at it and to be very careful in how we enjoy those new freedoms.”"
2020-07-05T07:01:35Z,politics,Politics,Gove and Johnson 'sold as slaves' at Oxford student charity event,"It may have only merited a few paragraphs in the student newspaper and have taken place 33 years ago, but an Oxford Union Society “slave auction” in which Boris Johnson and Michael Gove were involved is powerful proof of how politicians’ pasts can come back to haunt them. “Union slave auction” was the headline in Cherwell, the journal for Oxford students, on 12 June 1987. The small story has escaped the notice of the two men’s biographers and their profile writers until now. On Saturday, however, in the light of the Black Lives Matter protests, the prime minister and the cabinet office minister had some explaining to do. The Cherwell article tells how the auction, to raise money for the homeless charity Shelter, was billed at the time as “an opportunity to buy your favourite Union person for the evening”. Just under £100 was raised. It says Michael Gove “got himself a bargain at £6”, while Johnson and other students “were all sold in their absence” and adds that Gove, a candidate for the presidency of the Union, “attracted enthusiastic bidding”. Johnson has previously acknowledged that aspects of his behaviour as a student were unfortunate, particularly his antics as a member of the university’s Bullingdon Club, of which David Cameron and George Osborne were also members. In 2013 he said the all-male Bullingdon’s indulgences offered “a truly shameful vignette of almost superhuman undergraduate arrogance, toffishness and twittishness. But at the time you felt it was wonderful to be going round swanking it up.” Trivialising slavery is more difficult to explain in today’s political climate of heightened anti-racist feeling. Clive Lewis, the Labour MP for Norwich, whose father was born in Grenada, said: “You really don’t have to dig back into Gove’s and Johnson’s privileged student past to understand their current ‘light-hearted’ views on slavery and structural racism. Why would you? “They lead a political party whose MPs routinely defend with impunity ‘blacking up’, hostile environment and ‘empire 2.0’. One funded to the tune of millions by corporations and individuals on the frontline of the post-colonial exploitation of the developing world. When you understand what both men and their party are enabling today and preparing for tomorrow, their past actions come as much less of a surprise.” Shelter, which reacted to the death of George Floyd by saying it needed to do more to stamp out racial prejudice “and the systems which fuel it”, said it apologised if it had received a donation from the slave auction. “Shelter does not condone racism of any kind, and we are distressed to hear that anyone may have raised money for us in this way … We do not know if the money raised was received by Shelter. However, we extend our deepest apologies if so,” a spokeswoman said. No 10 and Michael Gove’s private office, who were sent copies of the Cherwell report, said they did not wish to comment. Student slave auctions to raise money for charity continued until recently in some universities. In 2017 at Loughborough, there were reports of two events called a “slave auction” and a “slave night” being advertised for new students. The events provoked an angry response from the university’s African-Caribbean Society (ACS), which said they showed a “blatant disregard for coloured people” and are now understood to have been banned."
2020-07-05T06:15:34Z,politics,Politics,"‘Slums of the future’ may spring from relaxed England planning rules, experts warn","Thousands of tiny, substandard “rabbit-hutch” flats could be created in commercial buildings left empty by the coronavirus economic slowdown under planning reforms championed by Boris Johnson. University College London professor Ben Clifford - who recently completed a government review of housing produced outside the conventional planning system - said allowing developers to turn a wider range of commercial properties into flats without planning checks could lead to a wave of substandard conversions. “Unless there are proper safeguards, we could see even more poor-quality, tiny flats being crammed into commercial buildings lacking amenities and green space,” he said. “These could be what others have rightly called the slums of the future.” Johnson last week pledged to bring forward the most radical reforms to the planning system since the end of the second world war, starting with an expansion of permitted development rights, which allow buildings to be repurposed without full planning permission. Clifford was last year asked by the government to review the quality of homes delivered through existing permitted development rights, which cover offices, retail and light industrial units. He urged ministers to publish the report, which was submitted in January. “The evidence in the report would help inform a debate that has already started about these important issues, which could lead to huge changes in many towns and cities,” he said. Clifford previously co-authored a report for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors that suggests 70% of flats produced by permitted development are below the government space standards, with some measuring just 15 square metres. Basements with little natural light and blocks on lorry-clogged industrial parks have been turned into flats by developers. Since 2015 more than 60,000 flats have been created through permitted development in England, with almost 90% coming from office conversions. “It is popular with developers because they do not have to make a contribution to affordable housing and local infrastructure,” added Clifford. “It’s often far more profitable than going through the normal planning system.” The latest changes will come into force in September. Details are expected later this month but it could cover banks, building societies, clinics, training centres and even gyms. “Under these proposals the government might allow a whole host of other commercial buildings to be converted to residential uses,” said Clifford. “It could lead to thousands of new conversions.”
Some areas have already seen a flurry of controversial office to residential conversions. In Harlow, Essex, half the new homes created in 2018/19 came from office conversions. The town’s Conservative MP Robert Halfon said he would be writing to the prime minister and the housing minister, Robert Jenrick, about the latest proposals. “I think it is a disaster in the offing,” he said. “If there are not proper controls on quality and developers are allowed to build ghettos for people on the lowest incomes then we will have a repeat of what we’ve had in the first wave of permitted development.” Halfon called for Clifford’s report to be published. “I’m in favour of liberalising the planning system” he said. “But permitted development is about quantity rather than quality.” Hugh Ellis, policy director for the Town and Country Planning Association, accused ministers of sitting on Clifford’s report because it did not align with their deregulatory drive. “The report will - I’m sure - show that permitted development has produced some dreadful outcomes,” he said. “Could it be that the government received a report raising very significant challenges about what they have been doing and they choose to ignore it?” According to the Local Government Association, more than one million homes granted planning permission have not been built by developers in the past decade. “Planning is not a barrier to building new homes,” said David Renard, the LGA’s housing and planning spokesperson. A housing ministry spokesperson said: “Like any other project, homes built under permitted development rights must meet rigorous building regulations. These new regulations will cut red tape and unnecessary bureaucracy while maintaining high standards, and make effective use of existing buildings in keeping with the character of their local area.” • This article was amended on 5 July 2020. An earlier version referred to UK, rather than England, planning rules, and described some flats measuring 15 metres squared, when that should have said 15 square metres."
2020-07-05T05:01:33Z,politics,Politics,Sunak considers £500 vouchers for all UK adults to spend in Covid-hit firms,"Radical plans to give all adults £500 and children £250 in vouchers to spend in sectors of the economy worst hit by the Covid-19 crisis are being considered by the Treasury. The proposals, drawn up by the Resolution Foundation thinktank, which has had recent talks with the Treasury about its ideas, are aimed at kickstarting economic recovery by triggering a highly targeted surge in spending. Under the plans the vouchers could only be spent in certain sectors, such as hospitality and “face to face” retail, as opposed to online. The proposals are similar to successful schemes already used in China, Taiwan and Malta. In April, the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the Covid-19 outbreak is believed to have started, issued 500 million yuan (£57m) in consumption vouchers for use in restaurants, shopping malls, convenience stores, and cultural, sports and tourist venues. Last night, ahead of a “summer update” on the state of the stricken economy by the chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday, the Treasury refused to rule out introducing a similar scheme in the short or medium term. The Resolution Foundation says its idea would be a more effective way to jump start a recovery than a temporary VAT cut, or one-off cash gifts from the state to individuals, which have also been considered in Whitehall. Economists say cash transfers into people’s bank accounts would probably be stashed away into savings by many higher income households, while a VAT cut would do less for lower income families because they tend to spend more of their money on VAT exempt items, or reduced, or zero-rated goods. The money could be allocated via vouchers or smartcards, and transactions could be made with the use of mobile phones. The thinktank suggests a one-year time limit for spending the money and that the scheme, which would cost the state around £30bn, could be closed down in the event of a second wave of Covid-19. Sources involved in the discussions said the Treasury might balk at a £30bn bill and opt for smaller sums if it takes up the idea, with the possibility that it could increase the value of the vouchers later if the scheme proved effective. Economic activity in the hospitality sector was down more than 90% in April and there are fears that many sectors will continue to be badly affected while social distancing remains in place. In Germany and France, where lockdown restrictions have already eased, leisure and retail trips remain more than 10% down on pre-crisis levels. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Social distancing has huge implications for firms in sectors like retail, hospitality, tourism and leisure that will last into the reopening phase. That is why the jobs of so many workers in these sectors are in the firing line. The chancellor’s recovery package on Wednesday should reflect this unique economic challenge. “As well as setting out the biggest ever peacetime job support programme, the chancellor should get Britain spending in places where it’s needed most. A universal high street voucher scheme to be spent only in these sectors would kickstart demand in the right parts of our economy, boost living standards and deliver targeted support to the businesses that need help the most.” The Treasury declined to comment on the plans saying the chancellor would outline “the next stage in our plan to secure Britain’s recovery” on Wednesday. This will include an extra £32m for the National Careers Service which ministers says will allow a quarter of a million more people to benefit from expert careers advice in their search for jobs. Sunak will say that the government will recruit hundreds more careers advisers – meaning close to 270,000 more people will receive bespoke advice to support them into the world of work. Meanwhile Labour warns today of “ghost towns” developing across the country as new figures show more than 80,000 hospitality, leisure and retail businesses have missed out on government grants to help them tackle the Covid-19 crisis. The figures from the Valuations Agency office show that 83,290 retail, leisure and hospitality businesses have received no grant support from government. These businesses, in higher rateable value premises, are often larger employers, with higher turnovers. Shadow business minister Lucy Powell said: “Unless the government steps up to save the high street many will become ghost towns, with thousands laid off, as a result. Labour is calling on the government to have a back-to-work budget this week, with the focus on protecting and creating jobs.” Polling by Opinium for the Bright Blue thinktank found that more than two in five (44%) of businesses participating in the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme reported they will have to lay off some, more or all of their furloughed staff when the scheme comes to a close at the end of October."
2020-07-04T17:19:14Z,politics,Politics,Stanley Johnson says Greece visit is essential to 'Covid-proof' villa,"The prime minister’s father, Stanley Johnson, has defended travelling to his villa in Greece amid growing condemnation by saying that he was making the property “Covid-proof”. Government guidelines state that British nationals should avoid all but essential travel, but his son Boris has refused to criticise the trip and, on Friday, suggested the media should raise the issue directly with his father.
Johnson senior, 79, posted a picture on social media of himself apparently arriving at Athens airport wearing a mask earlier this week. He told reporters that he was visiting on “essential business” before the letting season. However, there are no rules in Greece compelling landlords to “Covid-proof” homes for letting. He rents the property for £2,100 a week during peak season. Interviewed by Greek media outside the mountain villa in Pelion overlooking the Aegean sea on Saturday, Johnson senior said: “I don’t know what the reaction of the British public [is]. I’ve been, you know, not particularly … I came here to have a quiet time, to organise the house, so I’m not 100% up to speed.” He said he intended to return to the UK on 10 July. “People are longing to get here, so I’ve just got one week to get everything organised. And this is a country which has everything. But here I am, how could you be here and not look around at this fantastic place? “I’ve got a whole load of instructions about how to make the place Covid-proof.”
Asked about the photo he posted to social media, he claimed: “I didn’t put them up in a spirit of defiance or anything like that.” He added: “I’m not going to say whether my actions are correct or not – in any case, what happened, happened.” Caught on camera with a towel thrown over his left shoulder, seemingly after swimming, Johnson senior said it was vital that an air bridge was created “as quick as we can” to facilitate direct travel between the two nations. “How wonderful it would be if, quite quickly, the two governments could come to some arrangement.” Johnson senior flew to Athens via Sofia, Bulgaria, seemingly to circumvent Greek government rules against direct flights from the UK to the country, which has been praised for its handling of the pandemic – with deaths in the low three figures. On Thursday evening, he was photographed sitting alone in his favourite seaside restaurant with a bottle of red wine, as criticism grew that his actions could further undermine the public’s trust in government guidelines. The former MEP had long planned to travel to Greece, telling one Greek journalist in May that he had already booked his air ticket. “I’m very worried that we may not be able to [go] this summer,” he told the Greek daily Ta Nea. “We are in this country in lockdown and even if we can leave Britain it’s not clear to me that we would yet be welcome in Greece … of course I’d love to be there, even if I had to go and self-isolate in my house I’d do that.”"
2020-07-04T15:35:09Z,politics,Politics,Nigel Farage accused of breaking quarantine rules with pub visit,"The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, is facing claims that he broke quarantine rules by going to a pub when it reopened for the first time since lockdown. Farage tweeted a picture of himself holding a pint, saying he was the first customer in the establishment on Saturday. However, a post from 20 June shows he was in the US on that date and planning to travel to Tulsa, apparently in reference to a Donald Trump rally which took place that evening in the city. According to the i newspaper, Farage was spotted at the rally taking part in a panel discussion called “Team Trump on Tour”. The timing of the tweets and his presence at the rally indicate that he has been in the UK for less than 14 days. Government guidelines say that any resident or visitor travelling to the UK must self-isolate at the place they are staying for 14 days, except in very limited situations. Ed Davey, the acting Liberal Democrat leader, has written to Kent police asking them to investigate whether Farage breached quarantine rules, and said Farage was showing “flagrant disregard” for public safety. “There are clearly serious questions to answer for Nigel Farage. It is clear from his social media posts that he was in America on 20 June, and he was pictured at a Trump rally that evening,” he said. “Given the current requirements for visitors returning to the UK to isolate for 14 full days on their return, Nigel Farage appears to be in violation of the quarantine. “It is a responsibility of everyone to take the lockdown requirements seriously in order to stop the spread of the virus. By choosing to go to the pub when it appears he should have been staying at home, Mr Farage is showing a flagrant disregard for the safety of people in his community.” Farage denied having broken the regulations. Responding to the backlash, he tweeted: “To all those screaming and shouting about me going to the pub …. I have been back from the USA for 2 weeks and I have been tested –– the result was negative. Sorry to disappoint you.” But he did not clarify the date on which when he travelled back from the US, or deny that he had been present at the rally in the US 13 days ago. Farage was granted a special exemption from the US travel ban for his visit, which was deemed to be “in the national interest, as determined by the secretary of state, the secretary of homeland security or their designees”, according to the US Department of Homeland Security. Some Twitter users mentioned the apparent breach of quarantine restrictions in their reply to Farage’s post, with some tagging police forces to inform them that he had allegedly broken the regulations. Many pubs across England reopened on Saturday after more than three months of closure due to coronavirus restrictions, with laws allowing them to reopen from 6am provided they had a licence to do so."
2020-07-04T07:00:06Z,politics,Politics,Labour: unemployment could go 'way beyond anything we've experienced',"Unemployment could soar to levels “way beyond anything we’ve experienced before” unless the government extends the furlough scheme and gets to grips with the looming crisis, Labour has said. As the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, prepares to deliver his summer statement next Wednesday, the shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Nothing we’ve seen so far suggests that their response matches the gravity of the situation.” Tens of thousands of job losses have been announced in recent weeks in sectors ranging from airlines to retail, and the claimant count measure of unemployment has more than doubled to 2.8 million since the pandemic began. The government’s job retention scheme, which is currently paying 9.2 million workers’s wages, is due to be wound down in the autumn. Reynolds cited recent analysis from the Institute for Employment Studies which found that without intervention, a second wave of job losses as the furlough scheme is unwound could lead to the claimant count soaring to 4 or even 5 million. “That doesn’t sound alarmist, it doesn’t sound impossible,” he said “I cannot understand why the employment side of this crisis is not the main thing people are talking about. They can see it around them. The furlough scheme has touched every community.” Boris Johnson told the Evening Standard on Friday that the job retention scheme was “keeping people in suspended animation” and must end in October. Employers are being asked to make a progressively larger contribution to the costs of the scheme over the summer months. It is unclear whether alternative forms of support will be put in place to extend the help for hard-hit sectors such as hospitality or the arts. Reynolds said: “There should definitely be flexibility on the furlough scheme. That’s the biggest difference you could make. Extending it beyond the date that has been given, and recognising that some sectors can’t possibly make a contribution at this stage.” He was scathing about the government’s decision to reintroduce benefits sanctions, which have been suspended during the crisis. It means claimants can again be financially penalised if they miss appointments. “Unemployment is high, vacancies are down, the schools aren’t back, people are shielding – the idea that the answer to that is to dock people’s social support because they’re not out looking for jobs … it just looks unthinkable,” he said. Confirmation that sanctions were being restored only came after Reynolds asked the question of his opposite number, Thérèse Coffey, in the House of Commons. As well as extending the job retention scheme, Reynolds urged the government to introduce something like the Future Jobs Fund, the programme drawn up by Labour during the 2008 financial crisis, which created 100,000 taxpayer-funded jobs for unemployed 18- to 24-year-olds. Johnson has said young people will be offered an “opportunity guarantee”, giving them the chance of a work placement or apprenticeship; but it is unclear how this will be achieved. Reynolds claimed Johnson’s cabinet may be failing to grasp the gravity of the situation because “a lot of people in government are just so far removed from people who are going to be looking for jobs”. He said: “Politicians often overstate their memories of what it was like when they were growing up, but in the north-east in the 1980s – the miners’ strike, the shipyard closures – my sense of unemployment being the biggest problem around is definitely one I have from childhood. “And I think we know that if you’re unemployed during a crisis, the impact of that in years to come, you never really recover. It has such a scarring impact.” As the man with the job of drawing up Labour’s benefits policy for the next general election, Reynolds argues that the pandemic should be a “Beveridge moment” for the welfare state. Sunak poured £7bn into uprating universal credit and working tax credit payments in March, in what Reynolds says was an implicit acknowledgement that the safety net was inadequate. The government was also forced to create “whole new pillars of support” in the form of the job retention scheme and the self-employment support scheme because the generous “wage replacement” systems that exist in some other countries were not there, he said. “You’ve seen even the government say: ‘The system we’ve got isn’t going to get us through this crisis,’” Reynolds said. Reynolds first won his Stalybridge and Hyde seat in 2010, just as Labour lost power after 13 years. Before that he had worked for his predecessor in the seat, James Purnell. He has held a series of frontbench jobs since then, including rejoining Jeremy Corbyn’s team as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury after Corbyn saw off Owen Smith’s leadership challenge in 2016. After Corbyn stepped aside in April, Reynolds was one of several younger MPs handed prominent roles by Keir Starmer. He turns 40 next month. Like his frontbench colleagues Nick Thomas-Symonds and Annaliese Dodds – Starmer’s shadow home secretary and chancellor respectively – Reynolds has a reputation among colleagues for being clever, hard-working and unshowy. He has previously flirted with ideas considered radical in Labour, including striking electoral pacts with other left-of-centre parties in a so-called “progressive alliance”. His views on the future of the welfare state are being closely scrutinised by the Labour left for clues as to whether Starmer will abandon aspects of Corbyn’s legacy. Asked whether he stood by Labour’s promise to replace the universal credit system, Reynolds said: “We use the language of full replacement, because we are clearly opposed to some of the features of it, like the two-child limit and the benefit cap, and we feel the brand is too tarnished. And also we reject the ethos behind it – that punitive, stick-based system.” But he conceded that any new system would share key features with UC, including bundling once separate benefits into a single payment. “I’m listening to what people say, but my instincts are: because of the lack of a legacy system to go back to, there are merits in combining particularly out-of-work support and in-work support and housing benefit at the same time.” And it would make sense to bundle council tax benefit into the same payment, he added. Reynolds has previously expressed interest in the fashionable idea of a universal basic income – a flat-rate payment made to everyone. But he said there was no “magic wand” to resolve the complex challenges the welfare system needs to meet. “UBI comes up a lot in conversations with members. I’ve always been interested in it because I don’t like means-testing, and I think there’s something in that,” he said. But he warned that the idea faced “two very significant conceptual problems that might be so big they don’t have answers”: how to treat disabled people in the system, “because obviously disabled people need more support and they should get it”; and the wide variation in housing costs across the country caused by the dysfunctional housing market. He said Labour had “struggled” politically on welfare in the decade he has been in parliament, as the Conservatives imposed successive waves of benefits cuts. “It was George Osborne who was in the ascendancy after 2010 and we were reacting to it,” he said, referring to the former chancellor’s language of “strivers” and “skivers”. “The biggest problem about that Osborne language, apart from the fact it’s offensive about people, is that it attempts to divide people into a group of people who pay for the system and a group of people who pay for the support,” he said. “It was good politics for the Conservative party – you’d hear those words sometimes repeated back at you when you were canvassing – but it has left us fundamentally with a safety net that wouldn’t have got us through a crisis like this.”"

2020-07-03T17:14:00Z,politics,Politics,Johnson's father's visit to Greece 'could erode trust in guidelines',"The decision by the prime minister’s father to travel to his Greek villa in apparent breach of Foreign Office guidance has been criticised by a government scientific adviser. Boris Johnson has refused to condemn his father, Stanley, for flying to Greece, despite current advice for British nationals to avoid all but essential international travel. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists to government on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, said the incident could undermine the public’s trust in government guidelines. Reicher, previously reacted with disdain to Johnson’s defence of his senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, after his controversial visit to his parents’ home in Durham during the height of lockdown. Of the recent episode involving the prime ministers’s father, Reicher said evidence had shown that trust is more important for compliance at this stage than it was during the lockdown. “Erosion of trust undermines people’s willingness to use the test, trace and isolate system and in particular to give their information to the authorities,” he added. The social psychologist at the University of St Andrews said Johnson senior’s decision to travel may have undermined the government’s message during a “volatile situation”. “One of the best ways to undermine trust is the notion there’s one law for them and one law for us. It divides us from the authorities. There’s no doubt that this affects that perception in the same way that the Cummings affair did and therefore at the very best it’s not helpful,” he added. Johnson senior travelled to his Greek villa via Bulgaria, in order to avoid the ban on direct flights from the UK. However, during an LBC radio phone-in, the prime minister repeatedly refused to say whether he was “disappointed” with his father’s actions.
“I think you really ought to raise that with him. I am not going to get into details of family conversations,” he said. Earlier this week, Johnson senior, posted a picture on social media of himself apparently arriving at Athens airport wearing a face mask. The 79-year-old told reporters that he was visiting on “essential business” because he needed to “Covid-proof my property” before the letting season. The photograph appeared to have later been removed from his Instagram account. On Friday, Greek media carried photographs of him cutting a solitary figure in his favourite seaside restaurant, a bottle of red wine by his side. The photographs were taken late on Thursday. Greek officials, if privately dismissive of the British government’s handling of the pandemic, said Johnson senior had not broken any rules in entering the country even if he had flagrantly defied the travel advice of UK authorities. Despite Athens’ recent decision to prolong the suspension of direct air links with the UK until 15 July, Britons were still entitled to travel freely to Europe until the Brexit transition period ended, they noted. “We have banned flights, direct flights from the UK and Sweden until 15 July. If a citizen from these countries arrives in a different way to Greece, of course they can come,” said Stelios Petsas, a government spokesman. More than 3 million Britons traditionally visit the tourist-dependent nation, with the UK topping league tables in terms of foreign earnings. But the brazenness exhibited by Johnson’s father has also clearly taken Greek officials aback. The former Euro MP’s sudden appearance in Greece came amid mounting exasperation in Athens over “conflicting” leaks in London about possible air bridges and quarantine periods. “There’s a lot of eye-rolling,” confided one insider describing the reaction of the inner circle of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis. “There are so many conflicting signs … we’re lost for words.” Johnson senior had long planned to travel to Greece, telling one Greek journalist in May that he had already booked his air ticket. “I’m very worried that we may not be able to [go] this summer,” he told the Greek daily Ta Nea in an interview published in the spring. “We are in this country in lockdown and even if we can leave Britain it’s not clear to me that we would yet be welcome in Greece … of course I’d love to be there, even if I had to go and self-isolate in my house I’d do that.” The prime minister’s father has been holidaying in Greece yearly since acquiring an expansive 40-tree olive grove in Pelion, the peninsula jutting into the Aegean Sea off the coast of Thessaly, in 2001. He has also sought to capitalise on his investment. The two-storey, four-bedroom Villa Irene is advertised on Johnson’s personal website and managed through Real Holidays, an independent travel company based in Islington, north London. With its “spectacular views of the mountains and the sea”, the bolthole – regularly used by Boris Johnson out of season – has proved to be an equally nice earner for the family, bringing in more than £40,000 a year in rental income. Lower season for a week is £1,750 and ends on 20 June, and then it goes into peak season which is £2,100 through to 19 September. When contacted from Athens, Real Holidays confirmed that the villa, which is let from 1 May to 30 September, was fully booked this year barring one week at the end of the season. “It gets booked up very early, Irene, there are a lot of people who go year on year and book very far in advance,” said a travel planner at the company when asked about the villa’s availability. She added: “It’s sold on a weekly basis. We have clients due to travel mid-July but we can’t recommend that people travel at the moment, not with the austere guidelines in place.” Johnson explained the trip saying he had to set up “social distancing measures” at the property. No such rules apply to private properties being rented out in Greece. The owner, she said, was “flexible”. “He is based between the UK and Greece and I can talk to him. Pelion is a stunning area and unspoilt and authentic, and there aren’t that many villas in the area. It’s got a pool, you can walk down to a little cove, a little bay, swim in the sea and as I say we always get very stunning feedback.” Asked about Johnson, Matt Fisher, Real Holidays’ director, said: “We are not privy to speak about Stanley’s private life.”"
2020-07-03T16:42:04Z,politics,Politics,How UK air bridges descended into a coronavirus policy farce,"It’s competing in a crowded field. But after days of confusion, buck-passing and zealous over-briefing by officials, it has turned into one of the most chaotic policy rows of the entire coronavirus crisis. The air bridge fiasco won’t get the same forensic examination that care homes, testing and lockdown rightly deserve, but critics say it has been an omnishambles from start to finish. Over several weeks, the government has variously been accused of being reactionary and rudderless, while overpromising and unfairly raising the public’s expectations. And some of that has come from Tory backbenchers. One called it an “utter shitshow”. It has also provoked an almighty row with political leaders in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, described discussions about the travel arrangements as an “utterly shambolic experience”. There had been grumblings about the futuristic-sounding air bridge idea for weeks. The idea of forming agreements with individual countries to avoid a 14-day quarantine on return was on, then it was off. Yet the hostility from the backbenchesto the blanket quarantine strategy meant a solution had to be found. As the 29 June review date of the quarantine policy approached, country lists started flying around in the press – including popular Mediterranean destinations. Bermuda was thrown into the mix; Australia, New Zealand, Singapore.
On 23 June, a government source, who did not want to be traced back to their department, said it would be best to narrow the focus to a very small “core” of European countries, with Germany and Austria likely due to their low infection rates. The list, the source said, was likely to be released by the end of the week. The next day the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, told the transport select committee that he needed to speak to the devolved administrations but that he would come to parliament on 29 June to give more detail. It looked like a plan was about to be hatched. It wasn’t. A call to the Welsh government press office hinted why. Officials explained they had only just been contacted by Westminster with details of plans. The Scottish government told the same story. Nevertheless, on 26 June, the government briefed journalists that ministers had come up with a plan: to set up a traffic-light list of countries categorised by the Joint Biosecurity Centre. Travellers arriving from low-risk countries would be exempt from quarantine measures when they arrived in the UK, which would mean for example Britons could go for a two-week break and not isolate on their return. Talks were being had with France, Spain and Greece but the public still had to wait for the list of countries, with hopes it could be operational by 6 July. Greece threw a spanner in the works within days by banning all flights from the UK until 15 July. By Monday the wheels really started to come off. Instead of telling parliament about his plans, Shapps gave a written ministerial statement, still with no list of countries.
Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland was not being properly consulted. Nobody seemed to know when this announcement would be made. One government adviser said it would be Wednesday. Later, the same person said: “I’m hearing Thursday.” Another countered: “Thursday. Which was always the plan.”
Meanwhile, government departments were playing pass the parcel. The Home Office – in charge of borders – said the Department for Transport was leading on it. One backbencher said the Home Office had “run off and disowned it when it got difficult”. The Foreign Office, which oversees advice, directed all calls to the DfT.At one point, it was suggested the Department for Health and the Cabinet Office were also involved. The DfT said it had nothing new to announce. Officials in Wales and Scotland revealed that the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had in fact been dispatched to try to talk to his counterparts in the devolved nations, as one adviser put it to “sort them out”. He couldn’t. The original policy appeared to be on its knees, with reports that the green light for travel was due to be given to between 70 and 95 countries. The FCO had allegedly suggested it would be best to include a larger number of countries. Advisers from various departments sounded utterly exasperated at the briefings going on – which were clearly happening at a level much higher than political adviser. The DfT confirmed it had abandoned the idea of a “core” of European countries. Shapps publicly blamed the Scottish government for holding up the idea. Sturgeon pointed out the UK position had changed three times in 24 hours. Some advisers close to the process were aghast at Sturgeon’s claims Scotland had not been consulted. First, they said, the list of countries was always going to be fluid, and second Scottish scientists sit on the Joint Biosecurity Council that had been working on categorising countries by risk. At 10.30pm on Thursday, there was white smoke. The DfT said Germany, France, Spain and Italy would be among 60 countries the government intended to list quarantine rules for, but for England only. The full list of where Britons can travel to was due to be released at lunchtime on Friday. It was finally published mid-afternoon.

2020-07-03T16:05:31Z,politics,Politics,Scottish and Welsh first ministers attack UK's 'shambolic' quarantine rules,"The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have launched scathing attacks on the UK government’s “shambolic” handling of lifting quarantines on foreign travel.
In parallel press conferences in Edinburgh and Cardiff, Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, and Mark Drakeford, her Welsh counterpart, said they had struggled to get coherent information from UK ministers about which countries would be exempt and why. They said the UK government seemed to regard consultation with the devolved administrations in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast as an afterthought, even though all three had clear legal duties to make sure their decisions were lawful and proportionate. “Dealing with the UK government over the last few days has been an utterly shambolic experience,” Drakeford said. “Day after day we have attempted to get a sensible answer from the UK government of how they intend to make these changes, which countries they intend to extend the new arrangements to and I just have to say it’s been an impossible experience to follow.” Grant Shapps, the UK transport secretary, announced on Friday that travellers from France, Italy, Germany and Spain would be exempt from the requirement to self-quarantine for 14 days, and that restrictions on dozens of other countries and territories would also be lifted from 10 July.
Those changes only affect airports and ports in England, but major airports in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have extensive air links to overseas destinations which are due to slowly resume services. Shapps and Boris Johnson have insisted all three governments have been closely consulted. Shapps said the list of exemptions was devised with advice from the joint biosecurity centre, which includes the chief medical officers of all four UK administrations.
Sturgeon said her government could be sued or face judicial review if its decisions were unlawful or threatened public health. She said it was essential that every pathway that allowed the virus to spread was rigorously controlled if Covid-19 was to be eliminated. “Often the UK government’s attitude to four nations discussions appears to be that they make the decision and the other three nations just come along to rubber stamp the decisions [instead of] a proper discussion based on shared evidence and information, and an agreement [and] we come to a decision collectively,” she said. Drakeford said he decided to speak out after suggestions from Whitehall that the devolved administrations were at fault for the delay in producing the list of countries that would be exempt from restrictions. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said. The Welsh senedd, or parliament, is likely to adopt the UK government list next week and before 10 July since there was no evidence it posed a risk to public health, Drakeford said. But that assessment still needed to be properly authorised. Sturgeon said the Scottish government would accept lifting quarantine for low-risk countries but was nervous of doing so for those that were medium risk, since Scotland had succeeded in heavily suppressing the virus. Those decisions would be confirmed next week. Scottish airports have been heavily critical of both governments. The owners of Glasgow and Aberdeen said a four-nations approach was essential while Gordon Dewar, the chief executive of Edinburgh airport, said Sturgeon had ignored his warnings that failing to allow quarantine-free travel would cause long-term damage. “Scottish jobs are being sacrificed on a system that is unintelligible, unenforceable and that does not deliver the health benefits we all want,” he said. “With this decision we are in the very real situation that Scotland will get the worst of all worlds – a damaged economy and a policy which is very likely to be unworkable in practice and therefore has no practical health impact.”"
2020-07-03T12:50:27Z,politics,Politics,Downing Street plans daily televised briefings in PR shake-up,"Downing Street is to host White House-style daily televised press briefings and will hire an experienced broadcaster to act as spokesperson and become the face of the government. The successful candidate will be a political appointment and is likely to become a household name. Their responses to journalists’ questions could feature prominently on the evening news and any mistakes might be covered in detail. The recruitment process will start this month, with the intention of the system being up and running by the autumn. Downing Street hopes the successful candidate will be a woman, according to individuals with knowledge of the plan. The briefings, which will be held every afternoon in 9 Downing Street, will in effect be a relaunch of the daily coronavirus press conferences. These attracted large audiences at times but were recently stopped, with Downing Street blaming declining viewing figures. The BBC dedicated substantial airtime on both BBC One and its rolling news channel to the pandemic briefings, but broadcasters could face a conundrum over whether to show every daily press conference as government begins to return to normal. There could be objections from Labour if the government is seen to gain a disproportionate amount of airtime from broadcasters without including any opposition voices.
Boris Johnson confirmed the plans on LBC radio on Friday: “People have liked the more direct, detailed information from the government about what’s going on and I think they have particularly liked our brilliant scientific and medical advisers, possibly more than the politicians to be frank. “We do think that people want direct engagement and want stuff from us and so we’re going to have a go at that … I will pop up from time to time, I have no doubt.” Johnson’s civil service spokesman told reporters the new hire would be able to “answer political questions in a way that I’m not [able to]”. The spokesman said the daily coronavirus press conferences had shown there was a significant public appetite for information about government policy and on-camera press briefings would help “accountability and transparency”. However, they denied suggestions that the presenter Richard Madeley had been asked to apply. The plan is part of a wider shake-up of Whitehall press offices, under which government communications will be centralised and the number of departmental press officers reduced, according to the FT, which first reported the changes. In recent months, Downing Street and individual departments have adopted increasingly strong tactics against the media, pushing back on stories by issuing lengthy blogposts and using departmental Twitter accounts to tell people sharing stories that are critical of the government that they allegedly contain errors. The decision to hold a daily televised briefing also chips away at the lobby system. Before the pandemic, members of the lobby – the group of accredited political journalists who cover parliament and Downing Street – received twice-daily briefings from a civil service press officer, whose comments were largely made on the record. At these lengthy briefings, the government spokesperson is often repeatedly asked the same question by different journalists in an attempt to elicit an answer on a key topic. Until recently these briefings took place in a secretive room high up in a tower in the Palace of Westminster, but they were moved to Downing Street without consultation this year, to the objection of newspaper editors. There have been previous attempts to change the often opaque lobby system. A shortlived boycott by some outlets in the 1980s was followed by changes under Tony Blair’s director of communications, Alastair Campbell. But until now the briefings have largely taken place out of the public eye, unlike in many other countries where government press conferences have long been televised. The format is often associated with the White House, although Donald Trump has largely abandoned the traditional press briefing room. Another important question will be which news outlets are allowed into the briefings and whether they will remain restricted to the traditional lobby pass holders. Downing Street has increasingly begun using its own in-house photographer to cover the main events, with the images then issued to the media. In most instances, publications have used the approved pictures in the absence of anything produced by independent photojournalists."
2020-07-02T21:30:03Z,politics,Politics,"England is 'not out of the woods yet,' Johnson to warn weekend pubgoers","Boris Johnson will issue a sombre plea to the public to behave responsibly when pubs, bars and restaurants reopen in England on Saturday, warning them, “we are not out of the woods yet”. The prime minister will give a televised press conference on Friday, as the government struggles to strike a balance between protecting jobs by reopening key sectors of the economy and preventing a second wave of coronavirus infections. He will warn that customers who fail to abide by social distancing guidelines and other advice will be letting down their local landlords, hairdressers and cafe-owners – and could cause lockdown restrictions to be reimposed.
“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe. “But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down,” he will say. “Just as when we first locked down, we will only succeed in reopening if everyone works together. Because we are not out of the woods yet.” Ministers opted to allow a swath of businesses, from hairdressers to hotels, to reopen on the same day, as part of a package of “easements” government scientists conceded were “not risk-free”. When the sweeping changes were announced last month, the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, warned: “If people hear a distorted version of what’s being said, that says ‘this is all fine now, it’s gone away’ and start behaving in ways that they normally would have before this virus happened, yes, we will get an uptick for sure.” The body that represents A&E medics, the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, has issued a plea to pubgoers not to get “plastered” and overwhelm an already stretched health system. On Wednesday night, the Treasury deleted an upbeat tweet that urged the public to “grab a drink and raise a glass” because “pubs are back”, after it was criticised for being in poor taste during a pandemic that has claimed 43,000 lives in the UK.
But ministers have been keen to see pubs and other hospitality businesses reopen, to help limit likely job losses in the coming months. The leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said on Friday he had purchased a “yard of ale”, which he intended to drink in his local pub on Saturday night. “Last week, I suggested that people use a yard of ale to measure their social distancing, and I am glad to say that I have had a yard glass delivered. I am looking forward to visiting the Crown in West Harptree on Saturday to see whether I can get in the two-and-a-half pints that I believe a yard of ale contains,” he told MPs. “Whether I then drink the same is another question.”
At Friday’s press conference, Johnson may be challenged about his father’s decision to travel to Greece this week. Stanley Johnson posted pictures on his Instagram account showing him arriving in Athens, and at an airport in a face mask. He told the Daily Mail he was “on essential business” to ensure a property he rents out was “Covid-proof”. Government advice currently urges the public against all but essential international travel. Asked about the journey on Thursday, the prime minister’s official spokesman said: “It is for individuals to make the judgments themselves.”"
2020-07-02T18:09:34Z,politics,Politics,Gav’s brilliant back-to-school plan: pretend the pandemic’s as good as over | John Crace,"You would have thought that schools would have been fairly high up the list of the government’s priorities when lockdown was introduced back in March. That having millions of children stuck at home, reliant on online lessons and parental supervision to keep up with their schoolwork, might have raised a red flag or two at the Department for Education. Instead, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, and his team of ministers chose to take the lockdown as an extended furlough period. Only, unlike many others in the country, he was still on full pay as he caught up with old episodes of Pointless. So he was taken completely by surprise when the first few year groups returned to class at the beginning of June only to find that most schools were unable to comply with social distancing rules without turning large numbers of children away. Gav had had one job and he had blown it. But then, like most members of Boris Johnson’s cabinet, he was chosen for his inability rather than his ability. At some point most education secretaries invariably end up sounding like headteachers. Not Williamson. He is firmly stuck at the level of a sixth-former who is hopelessly out of his depth. Nothing he says comes with any real conviction or sense of purpose. He’s even lost the elan he once had of twice winning fireplace salesman of the year in 2006 and 2008. Now all he can aspire to is the dull monotone of the supply teacher praying for the class to end. Just shut up and go away. Having been told to go away and come up with a plan for getting all children back in school by September, Gav turned up in the Commons to deliver his homework in the form of a ministerial statement. I have a plan, droned Williamson. It is my plan. A plan by G Williamson (junior prefect). And his plan for getting all children back to school in September was to announce that all children would be going back to school in September. It was such a brilliant plan, he couldn’t think why no one had thought of anything like it before. Here was the deal. Schools were basically going to have to pretend the pandemic was as good as over, that all the vulnerable staff and children had dematerialised, and it was up to headteachers to make the system work as well as possible. Sure, there would be a few home-testing kits available, children would be kept in bubbles that would all burst come the first breaktime, and if possible everyone should walk to school, making sure no one arrived at exactly the same time. So the school day would now be staggered over a 25-hour period. And to prove he was serious, parents whose children didn’t turn up to school would be fined. In her first outing since replacing Rebecca Long-Bailey as shadow education secretary, Kate Green didn’t want to be the one to break it to Gav that it might have been a good idea to have more of a backup plan in case there is a second spike and further lockdowns are imposed, rather than just rely on a Panglossian “all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds” approach. After all, Labour are just as keen for children to go back to schools, given the growing educational inequalities that have been exposed over the past few months, so maybe it was as well to pretend that everything could revert to normal by placing a few hula-hoops on the floor. Instead, Green – as did many others – restricted herself to asking specific questions about consultation with staff, special educational needs, laptops for pupils on free school meals, bridging the attainment gap and ensuring a full curriculum that includes the arts, humanities and sports. Gav assured everyone that he was no longer asleep at the wheel and that all these things were at the very top of his inbox. At times like these, it was far better to pretend that everything was going to work just fine rather than concentrate on the details. The government wanted a good news story and this was about as close to one on schools as it was going to get. Gav’s saving grace is that he doesn’t realise quite how boring and incompetent he is. So when he sees MPs on all sides of the chamber nodding off, he takes the silence as a victory for his powers of persuasion. As if sensing that the Commons appearance had been vague and underwhelming, Boris Johnson sent Gav out to reprise his statement in the first Downing Street press conference for a couple of weeks. The only problem being that Williamson was just as vague and underwhelming the second time round. His plan to get all children back in school in September was still to get all children back in school in September. It was that cunning. Gav did find himself on the end of some rather trickier questions from the media than he had from MPs. How could he guarantee a world-class education when he wasn’t even sure how the system was going to work and large numbers of children still had no laptops for online learning? How come he hadn’t been able to come up with a better plan in four months? Wasn’t he ashamed that the pubs were opening quicker than many schools? At which point he began to get visibly tetchy. People should be getting behind his back-of-a-fag-packet plan rather than picking holes in it. Children were going back to school regardless. And if a few of them caught the coronavirus and passed it on to each other or family members, it was a price worth paying. Besides, there was going to be no need for more national lockdowns because … because he said so. So that’s all right then."
2020-07-02T17:44:15Z,politics,Politics,UK set to award Covid-19 testing contracts worth £5bn to private bidders,"The government is preparing to award coronavirus testing contracts worth an estimated £5bn to commercial bidders, in what critics fear is a “backdoor” subsidy to the private sector. The vast new budget, which works out at £2.5bn per year and will be managed by Public Health England (PHE), is equal to the entire annual spend on English NHS laboratories. The Department of Health and Social Care said it was creating a new national framework for testing which would replace current arrangements, with further details released “in due course”. The new plan, outlined in a public notice, dwarfs the budget for the current framework. Completed in 2017, its estimated cost was between £80m to £120m. NHS sources said they had been told the cash would be used to fund an expansion of Lighthouse laboratories. Created in April to boost Covid-19 testing capacity, they are at the centre of the storm over why it took until last week for local authorities to begin receiving postcode data on the spread of coronavirus in their communities.
It is understood that seven new commercially run laboratories are planned in the short term. That number could eventually rise to 29, one for each NHS pathology region in England. Run in partnership with private firms including the pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, the four existing Lighthouse labs in England and Scotland have been dogged by reports of thousands of lost and voided samples, slow turnaround times, and a failure to share data on results with GPs and local authorities. “The government know they’ve made mistakes and they seem determined to continue using the same model,” said Allan Wilson, the president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, the professional body for laboratory scientists. “We are campaigning for NHS labs to be allowed to bid for these contracts. This should not be exclusive to commercial partners. As an absolute minimum, whoever bids for this has to demonstrate clearly how they will integrate with the NHS, so that test results are immediately available to clinical staff and public health systems.” The project is the next step in Matt Hancock’s ambition to scale up homegrown testing capacity, making the UK less reliant on imports of chemicals and equipment. The notice says the framework will support “all five pillars of the UK testing strategy” launched by the health secretary in April. The framework will select a pool of contractors whose services can then be called on by all four nations, and by NHS trusts and local authorities. It will be in place for two years, with an option to extend, and the notice estimates its value at £5bn over the period. As well as providing new labs capable of processing 10,000 tests per day, the notice calls for manufacturing of specialist equipment, testing kits, and research and development. Allyson Pollock, a public health professor at Newcastle University, said the money should be used to build up publicly owned laboratories run by the NHS or PHE. “This looks like a big subsidy for industry through the back door to support the government’s policy of building a British diagnostics industry,” she said. Detailed results from NHS-run labs, which test hospital staff and patients, have been available from the beginning. But this is only a part of the picture. Tens of thousands of tests are carried out each day at drive-in centres and by mobile testing units, and then processed at the Lighthouse labs. Problems over IT systems and data protection meant that for two months, no detailed information from these tests was being sent to GPs, hospital doctors or local councils. The information blackout has been blamed for allowing the virus to spread undetected in towns and cities including Leicester, which was ordered to enforce local lockdown measures this week. Jo Martin, the president of the Royal College of Pathologists, said expanding the Lighthouse labs would create the same risk unless they were able to share data in a timely way. “It is really important that the data is easily accessible by those who need to be able to deal with infection in both primary and secondary care, but also those who need to trace related infection. I would like to see very close collaboration between any new endeavours and existing providers of pathology services to the NHS.”
Although data flow has improved, Lighthouse labs are still unable to say how many individuals they have processed tests for each day, and hospitals still cannot see whether a new patient has tested positive if their swab was processed in the Lighthouse system. “There needs to be clarity as to what the ultimate goal of all of this is,” said Martin McKee, an adviser to the European commission and a professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “It is a very large sum of money and the scale of the budget seems to go far beyond what is normally spent on purchasing equipment and diagnostics. The fragmentation of NHS services has been a major factor in the UK’s poor performance during this pandemic, so it is not obvious why you wold want to fragment it even further.” GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca were approached for comment. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said: “As part of an unprecedented response to this global pandemic, we have quickly established in a matter of months the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history. Private and public sector laboratories – including within the NHS – form a central part of this network, which is curbing the spread of the virus and saving lives. “Further details about the new National Microbiology Framework will be announced in due course.”"
2020-07-02T17:08:02Z,politics,Politics,"Attendance at English schools 'mandatory' from September, says Williamson – as it happened","Sir Keir Starmer has said that more pupils in England would be back in school now if the government had provided better leadership on this issue. (See 4.03pm.) He made the claim as the Department for Education published detailed guidance intended to show how all pupils in England would be able to return to school in September. (See 10.34am.) Ministers have accused Labour of not supporting the return of pupils, but Starmer sought to counter that charge by saying “many more children could be back now if there had been a better plan and better leadership”. As Richard Adams and Sally Weale report, the welter of recommendations and advice in the DfE guidance has led headteachers to complain of “mind-boggling” practical difficulties. At a No 10 news conference this afternoon, Williamson also confirmed that school attendance will become mandatory again from the autumn. (See 5.08pm.) But earlier No 10 suggested that headteachers should use their discretion in enforcing the law that can see parents fined for keeping pupils at home. (See 1.58pm.) Overseas holidays and visits to up to 90 countries will be possible for Britons from Monday without the need to quarantine for 14 days on return. As Kate Proctor reports, the Foreign Office is expected to lift its ban on non-essential travel to nearly all EU countries, British territories such as Bermuda and Gibraltar, and Australia and New Zealand. Nicola Sturgeon has told people in Dumfries and Galloway they cannot yet relax any lockdown rules after an outbreak of Covid-19 cases straddling the border with England. The National Care Association has accused the government of putting lives at risk by issuing false reassurance to care homes about out-of-date PPE at the height of the pandemic. Councils in England say they face a financial shortfall this year of over £1bn this year and will be forced to make further cuts to local services after warning that a Covid-19 rescue package unveiled by ministers did not go far enough. Suspected outbreaks of Covid-19 in workplaces in England almost doubled in the past week, prompting concern as more people return to their jobs. That’s all from me for tonight. But the coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here."
2020-07-02T14:01:29Z,politics,Politics,EU-UK trade talks break up early over 'serious' disagreements,"The latest negotiations in Brussels on an EU-UK trade and security deal have broken up early, with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, complaining of a lack of respect and engagement by the British government. The two sides ended the week’s talks – the first held in person since February – a day ahead of the jointly agreed schedule amid evident frustration at the lack of progress in bridging what both Barnier and his UK counterpart, David Frost, described as “serious” disagreements. “Our goal was to get negotiations successfully and quickly on a trajectory to reach an agreement,” Barnier said in a statement. “However, after four days of discussions, serious divergences remain.” The former French minister said Brussels had “listened carefully” to Boris Johnson when he had told the EU’s institutional leaders two weeks ago during a videoconference he wanted “political agreement” over the summer on the terms of a deal. Barnier added that the EU recognised the British red lines of “no role for the European court of justice in the UK; no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law; and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference”. But he suggested the EU’s willingness to be flexible on its initial demands in light of the British positions had not been met with similar understanding from Downing Street over Brussels’ red lines. The EU has hinted at a willingness to drop its initial asks of EU state aid being incorporated into domestic UK legislation, non-regression from the bloc’s environmental, social and labour regulations and the effective continuation of the common fisheries policy. But the EU negotiator said Downing Street needed to reciprocate with new proposals, adding there would be no deal without “level playing field” conditions in any potential treaty including on state aid. Barnier has previously insisted that in order to find compromise, the British government should at least publish its plans for how the UK’s domestic subsidy regime will work from the end of the year when the transition period ends. He further said in his statement there needed to be a “sustainable and long-term solution” on fisheries, taking into account the needs of European fishermen for certainty over their livelihoods and an effective all-encompassing dispute settlement mechanism to ensure both sides stick to their obligations. “And we will continue to insist on parallel progress on all areas,” Barnier said. “The EU expects, in turn, its positions to be better understood and respected in order to reach an agreement. We need an equivalent engagement by the United Kingdom.” The talks in Brussels, joined by smaller teams than in the past due to social distancing requirements, had been scheduled to continue through Thursday afternoon and into Friday with a final wrap up meeting between Frost and Barnier. But the two sides issued statements early on Thursday afternoon calling an end to the talks, as British officials led by Frost returned to London. “We have completed our discussion of the full range of issues in the negotiation in just over three days,” Frost said. “Our talks were face-to-face for the first time since March and this has given extra depth and flexibility to our discussions. “The negotiations have been comprehensive and useful. But they have also underlined the significant differences that still remain between us on a number of important issues.” Frost said the British side still wanted “an early understanding on the principles underlying an agreement” secured by the end of July. The two sides are due to resume talks next week in London. Meanwhile, a row continues over the failure of both sides to provide “equivalence” judgements by the end of June to allow financial service operators to continue to work across the UK and the EU. Last year, it had been agreed that decisions on the equivalence of the two sides’ regulatory regimes should be completed by 1 July. Earlier this week Barnier suggested the British government had been late in providing the necessary information to allow a decision to be made. John Glen, the economic secretary to the Treasury, told a Lords committee he was “slightly surprised” the EU had sent a thousand pages of questions, with almost 250 of them arriving “as late as the end of May”."

Speaking to the Evening Standard, the prime minister said he did not agree with the decision of Oriel College to take down its statue of the Victorian imperialist, as he was “in favour of people understanding our past with all its imperfections”. Johnson said: “I want to build people up, not tear people down. If we go around trying to bowdlerise or edit our history in this way, it’s like some politician sneakily trying to change his Wikipedia entry.”
Before the reopening of pubs, restaurants and other businesses in England this weekend, Johnson urged people not to be reckless, warning that more local lockdowns could follow, like that imposed in Leicester. “Do not undo the sacrifices you have made with reckless behaviour,” he said. “The public need to stay alert and realise that the threat is not over. Follow the guidance and behave responsibly so that this virus cannot re-emerge in communities across the country. “We are working through our roadmap but this could easily be undone. We do not want to see businesses have to close again. Here in London the virus seems to be very much in retreat. But as I said yesterday, the shark is still out there in the water.” Johnson will give a press conference at Downing Street on Friday. He said he and his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, would be going out themselves this weekend, while giving no detail. “We have plans, we are definitely going to mark the event,” he said. He also said he would take advantage of barbers and hairdressers reopening: “I will be having a haircut as soon as I can. It’s booked.” On the issue of the furlough scheme, Johnson indicated it would end as scheduled in October, even for sectors of the economy that will still be badly affected by coronavirus, such as theatre and the arts. Saying he was going to be “very, very blunt”, Johnson hinted that he wanted to move beyond the measure. “The best way forward for us now is to work together to beat the virus and get the economy back on its feet,” he said. “But I think people need to recognise that the particular restrictions that furlough places on you are not, in the long term, healthy either for the economy or for you as an employee. “You are keeping people in suspended animation. You are stopping them from actually working. I am being absolutely frank with you, we are pushing it out until October but in the end you have got to get the economy moving.” Johnson said China’s imposition of a draconian security law on Hong Kong was “plainly an unacceptable breach” of the 1997 handover agreement between London and Beijing, and he said he would examine the role of Chinese firms in the UK, such as Huawei in the rollout of the 5G mobile network. “On Huawei, I’m not against investment in this country,” he said. “This is an open market economy. But I don’t want to see our critical national infrastructure at risk of being in any way controlled by potentially hostile state vendors. So, we have to think very carefully about how to proceed now.” He defended his decision to replace Sir Mark Sedwill as national security adviser with David Frost, currently his chief Brexit negotiator. Frost is a former mid-level diplomat with little specific security experience.
Speaking during a Commons debate on the subject on Tuesday, Theresa May questioned why someone with “with no proven expertise” had been put in the role, in a rare direct attack from the former prime minister. Johnson said: “I didn’t hear what she said but I have the highest admiration for David Frost and he will do an outstanding job. And by the way, you know he is a very distinguished diplomat who has served in many, many different capacities.”"
2020-07-02T13:05:33Z,politics,Politics,UK officials 'put lives at risk' over out-of-date PPE for care homes,"The National Care Association has accused the government of putting lives at risk by issuing false reassurance to care homes about out-of-date PPE at the height of the pandemic. The body, which represents independent care homes, said it was appalled to discover official guidance that stated masks past their expiry date had been tested and were fit for purpose, was not correct.
Nadra Ahmed, executive chair of NCA, also said the wrong advice could mean care homes’ coronavirus insurance might be void, putting them at risk of potentially ruinous financial consequences. She said: “We had members contact us about the dates on the boxes they received and we sought clarifications on their behalf. We were told that they had been tested and were safe for use “We are appalled that due care and attention was not given to the risk of using these masks,” she added. “The masks have been used in services where there were already outbreaks and the consequence don’t bear thinking about.” The masks were sent to every care home in the country at the peak of the pandemic. At the time, stock was being diverted to the NHS and care providers were unable to access supplies of masks from their normal supply chains.
When the NCA raised a query that these masks were from a government stockpile and out of date by as much as seven years, they said the official response was that the masks had all been rechecked and were in working order. “In reality, we now learn, they were faulty and have only just been recalled – when most will already have been used months ago,” said Ahmed. In a recall notice issued by the Department of Health and Social Care on 26 June, care homes were told they must immediately stop using the Cardinal Health IIR masks and destroy them because of “a risk to staff” if the masks degrade. Ahmed said: “We face continued challenges as a sector because Covid-19 is still within communities. Insurers are taking Covid cover out of their policies on renewal whilst raising the costs to cover the businesses. Clearly, government will have to take full responsibility and liability for any backlash caused by their actions.” Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, said the incident had put staff and residents at risk, as well as putting homes at risk of serious financial consequences. “This clearly shows that some of the advice given by government throughout the pandemic turns out not to have been the right advice. “I don’t know how the government got it so wrong but we need to know who told care homes the equipment was safe, who gave them their advice and how that advice was so wrong,” he added. Both Ahmed and Green said the incident showed that the “protective ring” the government said had been thrown up around care homes was anything but protective. “Once again we note that care providers were at the back of the queue ,” said Ahmed. Green added, “I have never believed in this protective ring because I’ve never seen a single example of it. This incident is yet more evidence that it never existed.”
Sky News reported that the same masks were issued to GP surgeries and have also now been withdrawn, leading to concerns that thousands of medical and care staff may have been affected. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The safety of frontline staff has been a priority throughout this unprecedented pandemic. “After being made aware of a defect with some Cardinal Health Type IIR surgical masks, we urgently issued advice last week to health and care providers to check if their stock included these masks and to dispose of them. The issue is now resolved”."
2020-07-02T06:00:44Z,politics,Politics,Siân Berry and Jonathan Bartley face competition for Green party leadership,"The Greens’ incumbent leadership duo of Siân Berry and Jonathan Bartley are facing competition from two other candidates to remain in their post, as the party prepares for its two-yearly programme selecting its top officials. Berry and Bartley will be overwhelming favourites to win again, after they won almost 75% of members’ votes in 2018, taking over from the previous leadership combination of Bartley and Caroline Lucas. During their first stint in the job, which involves leading the party in England and Wales, Berry and Bartley oversaw highly successful local and European elections in May, and an increased vote share in December’s general election. Also standing to be leader is Shahrar Ali, a former deputy leader of the Greens, who came second in the 2018 contest. The other candidate is Rosi Sexton, a Green councillor in Solihull. The former mathematician and elite-level mixed martial arts fighter now works as an osteopath. Bartley and Berry are also both councillors, in London. Berry is also a member of the London assembly, and is the party’s candidate for the London mayoral elections, postponed from May due to coronavirus. Lucas, the party’s sole MP and still its best-know figure, spent two years as joint leader with Bartley, but decided in 2018 to step back, in part to focus on her Brighton Pavilion constituency, but also to spread the focus to other people in the party. Lucas became the Greens’ first leader in 2008 after the party dropped its previous system of two “principal speakers”. She was replaced as leader by Natalie Bennett in 2012, but returned in 2016, alongside Bartley. The Greens re-elect their leader, deputy leader and a series of other senior posts every two years. Amelia Womack, who has been joint and then sole deputy leader since 2014, is standing for another term in the post. She is also the favourite to win against five other candidates, among them Cleo Lake, a Bristol councillor and former lord mayor of the city. The other candidates are James Booth, Andrea Carey Fuller, Nick Humberstone and Tom Pashby. Hustings will take place this month, with members able to vote from 3-31 August, and the result announced soon afterwards. Bennett, who is now a Green peer, said: “I’m proud to see such a strong and diverse group of candidates ready to build further on the growing strength of the Green party, following record-breaking European and council elections last year and a strong performance in the general election.”"
2020-07-02T01:05:10Z,politics,Politics,'Raise a glass': UK Treasury faces backlash after hailing pubs reopening,"The Treasury has been accused of taking an irresponsible approach to the coronavirus epidemic after a backlash to a post on its official Twitter account that hailed Saturday’s scheduled reopening of England’s pubs. “Grab a drink and raise a glass, pubs are reopening their doors from 4 July,” the tweet read, while a graphic carried the message: “Pubs are back.”
Many of those condemning the post, which was soon deleted, accused its celebratory tone of being in poor taste given that the virus has killed at least 43,000 people in the UK. The tweet came as Leicester was put back under lockdown conditions amid a localised outbreak and fears were expressed about numbers of cases being seen in Greater Manchester.
The Labour MP Geraint Davies said: “This is wholly irresponsible publicity by the Conservative government, which will fuel a resurgence of coronavirus infection and death in England.” According to the Financial Times, research conducted on behalf of the hospitality industry has suggested many people across the UK are concerned about the reopening. “We know that currently 13% of people who were frequent pub and bar goers are not going to go back,” said Paul Flatters, chief executive of Trajectory Partnership, which carried out the research. The FT reported on 12 June that about a fifth of customers were expected to go to the pub less often than they used to once they reopened. Boris Johnson has been criticised over his confused messaging at a time of national crisis. While he warned people not to “overdo it” as he announced the lifting of some lockdown measures on 23 June, he also said: “Frankly, I can’t wait to go to a pub or a restaurant even if it’s not compatible with the diet that I’m on. “I think people need to go out, I think people need to enjoy themselves and rediscover things that they have been able to do for a long time. I want to see bustle. I want to see activity.” He told seaside towns to “show some guts” when asked how they might be expected to deal with the possibility of crowds flocking to take advantage of the hot weather and loosening rules. And he added: “It is very, very important that people who do represent seaside communities, places where UK tourists will want to go, should be as welcoming as they can possibly be.” Shortly afterwards, he condemned people “taking too many liberties” as a major incident was declared on the south coast due to large crowds on the beaches. A Treasury spokesman said: “We got it wrong on this and the tweet was quickly removed.”"
2020-07-01T18:08:46Z,politics,Politics,MPs ask Robert Jenrick long list of questions about £1bn land deal,"Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, is facing a demand to appear before a parliamentary committee to respond to unanswered questions about his relationship with the Tory donor Richard Desmond and the £1bn Westferry property deal. The housing select committee has disagreed with Boris Johnson’s claim that “the matter is closed”, asking Jenrick to appear before them on 13 July and sending him a list of 26 questions about the affair. The demand will ensure the row over the deal continues, despite efforts by Johnson to deny that the ministerial code has been broken. He has refused to refer Jenrick for investigation by the outgoing cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill.
Jenrick overturned a decision by the council and the government’s planning inspectorate in order to approve a 1,500-apartment, 44-storey development proposed by the former media baron and pornographer at Westferry Printworks, a former printing plant in east London. Emails between civil servants were released last week by the housing secretary after pressure from Labour, and suggested that Jenrick was “insistent” the decision was passed in time for Desmond to avoid a £45m community levy to the borough. Desmond later donated £12,000 to the party. Parts of the 129 pages that were released were redacted. Clive Betts, chair of the committee, wrote to Jenrick on Wednesday saying that the committee usually resolves not to scrutinise individual planning decisions but is making an exception in this case. “The committee respectfully disagrees with the prime minister’s assertion that ‘the matter is closed’ and believes that important lessons must be learned. “Given the particular high-profile of this case and the opportunity to learn further lessons, we feel it is important to make an exception and consider the rigour of the process without becoming the arbiter of the decision itself,” he wrote. The letter goes on to outline questions about Jenrick’s meeting with Desmond at a Conservative party fundraising event on 18 November. The minister, sitting next to the media baron, was lobbied and shown a video about the housing development. The ministerial code states “if a minister meets an external organisation or individual and finds themselves discussing official business without an official present – for example at a social occasion or holiday – any significant content should be passed back to the department as soon as possible after the event”. Betts asked why Jenrick took nearly four weeks to tell the department about the meeting, and asked him to provide a full note of the meeting or explain why it does not exist. The minister is also asked to explain whether Johnson or anyone in his office ever discussed the planning application with him; and why none of the representations made by Desmond before approving the development on 14 January have been included in the decision letter. The committee has asked Jenrick to respond to 26 written questions by 6 July. Labour claimed the move to approve before Tower Hamlets council’s community infrastructure levy (CIL) came into force would have saved Desmond’s Northern and Shell company up to £50m on the scheme, which was reported to be worth £1bn. In one document released by the government last week, a civil servant in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government wrote: “On timing, my understanding is that SoS is/was insistent that decision issued this week ie tomorrow – as next week the viability of the scheme is impacted by a change in the London CIL regime.” Text message exchanges revealed how Desmond lobbied Jenrick to expedite the development to avoid the need to pay the levy to Labour-run Tower Hamlets council, the poorest borough in London, saying: “We don’t want to give Marxists loads of doe [sic] for nothing!” Jenrick has consistently denied wrongdoing and removed his approval for the scheme over “apparent bias” last month. The government has been approached for a comment."

This live blog is now closed. Head over to our global live blog for all the latest coronavirus updates from around the world:
2020-07-01T15:54:34Z,politics,Politics,Predictive text? Why Superforecasting is top of Dominic Cummings' reading list,"Name: Superforecasting. Age: First published in 2015. Appearance: Hardback, paperback, Kindle or audiobook – your choice. It’s a book, is it? Yes, by Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner. The full title is Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction. What’s it about? It’s about how most experts are rubbish at making predictions, but some people are very good at it, and how you can learn to be more like the latter. So, how can I? Read the book and find out. Just tell me. No. You must read it. Who says? Dominic Cummings. And read it carefully as there will be questions. Questions? When? At an away day next month. Supplementary reading includes High Output Management by Andrew Grove, a business classic from the author of Only the Paranoid Survive. How did I miss this assignment? You must have skipped the weekly meeting Cummings held with government advisers. I did, but only because I’m not a government adviser. This is not the first time he has recommended the book. “Read Philip Tetlock’s Superforecasters, instead of political pundits who don’t know what they’re talking about,” he told reporters in February. In response to what? To questions about the appointment of Andrew Sabisky, a government adviser and self-proclaimed superforecaster who, it transpired, had previously espoused eugenicist views. How did such a controversial thinker get into Downing Street in the first place? He answered a call from Cummings for “misfits and weirdos” to apply for jobs at Number 10. Could someone with finely honed prognostic skills not have predicted all this? I knew you were going to say that. Returning to February, can you remind me how Cummings was superforecasting the Covid-19 response back then? According to a Sunday Times investigation, he revealed the government’s strategy at a private engagement, which those present paraphrased as “herd immunity, protect the economy and if that means some pensioners die, too bad”. That panned out well. Cummings denies this. At any rate, by March he was embracing a more proactive response to the coronavirus. As I recall, he went so far as to get Covid-19 symptoms. True. Then he superforecast that it would be a good idea to drive to Barnard Castle during lockdown in order to test his eyesight. And I predicted he would get the sack for that. Shows what I know. Read the book, mate. Do say: “Forecasting is not a talent; it’s a skill that can be cultivated.” Don’t say: “Don’t worry, Dominic. I read the first 15 pages and then I guessed how it would end.”"
2020-07-01T15:51:48Z,politics,Politics,Boz the Bluster gets hammered in PMQs ‘whack-a-mole’ | John Crace,"Boz the Bluster. Can he fix it? On the evidence of his latest outing at prime minister’s questions, the answer is a categorical no. Right now you wouldn’t trust Boris Johnson to get himself dressed in the morning, let alone get dragged around the park by Dilyn the dog. Six months into his term of office, he already looks a spent force. A man desperately playing catch-up as he tries to respond to events that are out of his control. “We are the builders, you are the blockers,” he said, towards the end of his reply – if you can call it that – to Keir Starmer’s final question. “We are the doers, you are the ditherers.” Even the most loyal Tory backbenchers in the chamber looked to be taken aback by that. Labour had not had anything to block – even assuming they wanted to – as the Tories had not built anything in the past decade. And when it comes to dithering, the prime minister has elevated it into an art form. Dithering is what Boris does best. He is a man who wants to be liked, someone who tries to keep his failings and infidelities hidden to avoid any unpleasantness or confrontation. So the decisions he does make are invariably made too late. Take coronavirus; while other countries were going into lockdown, Boris just let things roll for another 10 days, waiting on a miracle that never came. Partly because he didn’t want to be responsible for the upheaval that would follow, but also because he didn’t want Carrie to have to cancel her baby shower at Chequers. Since easing lockdown restrictions, Johnson has opted for a “whack-a-mole” strategy of targeting localised outbreaks. It’s also the new tactic he has adopted for PMQs. Only in this instance it is him that’s the mole. Boris would never admit it in person – far too proud and narcissistic – but part of his subconscious appears to have accepted he has met his match in the Labour leader. In his previous outings against Starmer he has run through all the familiar defensive tropes from his Oxford Union debating repertoire – scorn, sarcasm, bluster, answering a different question – but has on every occasion been comprehensively outplayed. So all that’s left to him is to try and play dumb by sticking his head out of the hole and hope he can scamper back for cover before he gets whacked. Unfortunately, Boris is not the most nimble on his feet, and he’s as bad at “whack-a-mole” PMQs as he was at all the others. Six times he put his head above the parapet and six times he got clobbered. It was going to take more than a couple of paracetamols to deal with the headache. He was facing an entire afternoon on a morphine drip. Starmer opened with the Leicester lockdown. How come it had taken so long to introduce the new restrictions when there had been evidence of a local spike 11 days ago? Boris went into full blame mode. He had actually noticed the rise of infections back on 8 June and had sent more testing units to the city but unfortunately the people of Leicester had failed to act as they should have done. The government was socially distancing itself from its people. That wasn’t quite true, the Labour leader observed. What had actually happened was that the government hadn’t shared the pillar 2 tests – the drive-through and self-testing – with the local health authority so no one in Leicester had a clue just how bad things were. In fact the mayor of Leicester had confirmed exactly that on Wednesday morning. Boris had no answer other than to burble and bumble. A tell-tale sign that he was lying. Thereafter it just got worse and worse for him. Starmer invited him to indulge in self-reflection – never Johnson’s strongest suit – and say sorry for having been so flippant the previous week in urging MPs of seaside towns to “show some guts” – a comment that had provoked a major incident in Bournemouth with an influx of 500,000 people to the beach. “Pifflepaffle, people have to act responsibly,” he said. Right. Just as Dominic Cummings had acted responsibly on his Durham safari. The rest was just white noise. Boz the Bluster couldn’t understand why Labour wasn’t giving him more applause for the 25% of people it was managing to reach through its “world-beating” track and trace system rather than negatively focusing on the 75% of people it was missing. It’s hard to know which is the icing on the cake right now: the mothballed app or the track and trace system. All that is clear is there’s not much in the way of cake to put any icing on. So it went on as Boris appeared to disintegrate, completely losing touch with any semblance of reality. The £5bn infrastructure project he had announced the day before had miraculously expanded overnight into a £650bn spending programme. That’s inflation for you. “There will be plenty of wonderful things,” he said, with characteristic penetration. The future was going to be like a bumper edition of the Generation Game, with towns across the country fighting over who was going to win the cuddly toy. Nor could Johnson offer much hope on jobs. Other than the hope that companies in the hospitality and services sector should try not to make people redundant. Still, look on the bright side. If all businesses in the entertainment industry did go bust, then their employees could retrain as apprentices and “build, build, build”. Boris was left to mouth empty, three-word Classic Dom slogans. And Tory MPs were left to wonder why they had never previously noticed that their emperor had no clothes."
2020-07-01T15:12:33Z,politics,Politics,No new NHS patients prescribed cannabis oil since legalisation,"There have been no new NHS prescriptions for full-extract cannabis oil since the medicinal use of the drug was legalised more than 18 months ago, the Guardian has established. Wealthier families and those who can successfully raise funds pay about £2,000 a month to access full-leaf cannabis medicines via private prescription for children with rare forms of treatment-resistant epilepsy, while poorer parents are unable to afford the prescriptions. Experts say that, despite the drug’s legality, rigid prescribing guidelines for doctors set by the British Paediatric Neurological Association – which cite a lack of clinical research and reference disputed theories about the mental health effects of cannabis – make getting hold of the medicine on the NHS difficult in practice. A freedom of information (FoI) request to the NHS business services authority confirmed there were no new prescriptions for the oil in England between its legalisation and the end of February. There is understood to have been no change since. On the NHS, full-extract cannabis oil imported from the Netherlands has continued to be prescribed to just two children with rare forms of epilepsy, Alfie Dingley and Sophia Gibson, who both received emergency interim licences from the Home Office in summer 2018 following high-profile campaigning. “The government’s medical cannabis legislation has been a disaster,” said Hannah Deacon, the mother of eight-year-old Alfie, who used to have up to 500 life-threatening seizures a month but can now ride his bike and go to school – with his seizures hugely reduced. “If you look at the children who have been given it privately, they are doing extremely well. It’s just terribly cruel and incredibly unfair that we should benefit and other children cannot.” Deacon has written to every member of the cabinet to express the “abject despondency” parents feel due to the lack of access, after their hopes were raised by legalisation, with thousands of children enduring hundreds of serious seizures a month which it is hoped could be dramatically eased with medicinal cannabis. She has received just one reply so far, from the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who, in a letter addressing her as “Bridget”, began by saying that cannabis use was detrimental to the mental and physical health of communities. Prof David Nutt, the former government drugs adviser who is behind Twenty21, a large medical registry now providing free full-extract cannabis oil to patients in the UK suffering from a variety of conditions, to address the block on prescribing, said there was “mounting real-world evidence” of the efficacy of medical cannabis. “I suspect many doctors are afraid of cannabis after years of fear-mongering and just want to be spoon-fed by the pharmaceutical industry,” he said. With the growing demand from patients unmet by the NHS, there have been at least 313 private prescriptions for unlicensed cannabis-based medicine items, including full-extract oil, since legalisation in November 2018, the FoI data showed. Full-extract oil contains both THC, the psychoactive part of cannabis that remains illegal for recreational use, and CBD, which is now commonly sold on high streets. Many believe oils including both cannabinoids are most effective in vastly reducing, and even precluding, seizures due to a synergetic so-called entourage effect. Steve Rolles, senior policy analyst at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, pointed to Germany, Israel, the Netherlands and Canada, where full-extract oil is available through public healthcare systems, and said the UK system was not designed to deal with multi-component plant-based medicines. “Unless some kind of bespoke regulatory framework can be found that reduces barriers to access, the more risky scenario of unregulated self-medication with illegally sourced supplies will continue,” he said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We sympathise with those patients dealing so courageously with challenging conditions. “Since the law changed, two cannabis-based medicines have been made available for prescribing on the NHS for patients with multiple sclerosis or hard-to-treat epilepsies, where clinically appropriate. This follows clear demonstrated evidence of their safety, clinical and cost effectiveness. We have also changed how we regulate imports to improve supply and reduce costs. “However, more evidence is needed to routinely prescribe and fund other treatments on the NHS. We continue to work with the health system, industry and researchers to improve the evidence base and identify what more we can do to minimise the cost of these medicines for patients, NHS or private.”"
2020-07-01T12:30:14Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson challenged at PMQs over Covid-19 test data,"Confusion over the level of Covid-19 testing data available to Leicester city council during its recent outbreak in cases intensified as Boris Johnson claimed his government had shared information. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, used prime minister’s questions to raise serious concerns from the local authority that it had only known about 80 new positive cases in a two-week period in June when the real figure had in fact been 944 cases. The city is the first place in England facing a lockdown from Thursday, when non-essential shops and schools will close, except for the children of key workers. Peter Soulsby, the mayor of Leicester, said he had been trying to access data from central government for weeks. Johnson accused Starmer of being mistaken, as both “pillar one and pillar two data have been shared not just with Leicester but with all authorities across the country”. “There were particular problems in Leicester in implementing the advice and getting people to understand what was necessary to do but let’s face it, we’ve had to act, the government has acted and [the Labour leader] wants to know whether we’ll act in future to ensure that we protect the health of the entire country and I can tell him that we will,” the prime minister said. Starmer said the local authority had not received pillar two testing data, which comes from tests carried out in the community, until last Thursday, meaning there had been a “lost week” while the virus continued to spread. “I spoke to the mayor of Leicester this morning and I know the prime minister spoke to him yesterday and it’s absolutely clear he didn’t get that data until last Thursday. I doubt he told the prime minister something different yesterday. “The prime minister can’t just bat away the challenge. These are matters of life and death and people’s livelihoods.” Pillar one tests are those undertaken on NHS staff, care workers and tests in hospitals. The Labour leader described as “flippant” Johnson’s claim that local councils should “show some guts” when it came to allowing visitors to flock to their areas, when days later Bournemouth had to close and the local authority declared a major incident after thousands of people travelled to the beaches there. Starmer asked the PM if he regretted his remarks. Johnson said people had to behave responsibly if they were going to visit other parts of the country. “I made it absolutely clear if people, if they’re going to travel to the seaside, take advantage of the easing of the lockdown, they must observe social distancing,” he said."
2020-06-30T19:13:47Z,politics,Politics,Why Boris's zero emission aircraft may be mission impossible,"Will Boris’s Jet Zero ever fly? The prime minister’s call for Jet Zero on Tuesday may owe more to his fondness for a punchy slogan than any realistic view of how UK aviation might develop in the next three decades. “We should set ourselves the goal now of producing the world’s first zero-emission long-haul passenger plane,” Boris Johnson said. “Jet Zero, let’s do it!” But as far as the technology goes, Johnson might have more luck building a garden bridge to France than getting British-made, long-haul, zero-emission passenger planes in service before 2050.
Short-range electric flight is, for the very smallest planes, already a reality. Multiple firms, including UK start-ups, are working on zero-emission eVtols – electric vertical take-off and landing craft, or flying taxis – but the concepts are primarily for domestic inter-city travel, with only a handful of passengers on board. Battery weight and range means that manufacturers currently view larger electric planes as feasible only for short-haul flights – and even then the focus is largely on hybrid-electric, with jet fuel needed for take-off. The big UK contribution to this vision, a Rolls-Royce-Airbus collaboration called the E-Fan X, was quietly canned during lockdown. EasyJet, should it survive, has long spoken of its hopes for a short-haul electric regional plane, and engine trials with a partner in the US, they say, have been encouraging. Meanwhile, work continues at Cranfield university and elsewhere, trying to convince sceptics that hydrogen could eventually be a viable fuel for passenger jets. Plants to produce synthetic jet fuels could be part of a net-zero mix (although not zero-emission when burned in flight). Low-emission flight – rather than no-emission – is currently the overwhelming ambition of civil aviation engineers. Johnson’s target for a UK-built long-haul zero-emission plane before 2050 may, alas, swiftly crash-land with reality."
2020-06-30T18:34:22Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer wins change in Labour NEC election rules,"Keir Starmer has faced down objections from Labour leftwingers to secure a change in the way members of the party’s ruling national executive committee are elected. At an explosive meeting on Tuesday, Starmer was also confronted directly about a BBC Breakfast interview in which he described Black Lives Matter as a “moment”, and dismissed calls to “defund the police” as “nonsense”, the Guardian understands. The national executive committee (NEC) agreed by 19 votes to 12 to introduce a single transferable vote (STV) system for its CLP (constituency Labour parties) section, which represents grassroots members. The change is a relatively modest one, but it underlined the speed at which Starmer has seized control of the levers of Labour party machinery. It took Corbyn many months to secure a stable majority on the NEC – and more than a year before his pick for general secretary, Jennie Formby, was in post. Councillor Tom Miller, co-chair of the Open Labour campaign, which had been calling for the change, said, “this is a long overdue reform, that brings NEC elections in line with other major Labour party elections such as leadership contests. This will ensure members’ votes count.” In another sign of the transformation wrought in the party under Starmer’s leadership, it emerged that Seumas Milne, Corbyn’s most senior adviser and an executive director of the party, is leaving his Labour post. Friends believe he is planning to write a book. Asked about Milne’s departure, a Labour spokesman said, “we don’t comment on staffing matters”. Starmer and his allies believe the change to a proportional voting system, which had the support of the Electoral Reform Society, will dilute the power of “slates” of rivals from either wing of the party. But it was fiercely resisted by leftwingers on the NEC, amid simmering tensions in the wake of Starmer’s sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey last week, over claims of antisemitism. One NEC member, Huda Elmi, from campaign group Momentum, said the NEC had “decided to wage war on member democracy”, calling the change a “stitch-up”. A group of NEC members, including Unite’s assistant general secretary Howard Beckett, are threatening to launch a legal challenge against the decision, which they say constitutes a “rule-change”, and should be put to a full Labour conference for approval. With this year’s gathering cancelled, that could potentially delay any change for more than 12 months. NEC members were also told by the party’s new general secretary, David Evans, that Labour’s membership is 580,000 – as high as the level reported during Corbyn’s leadership. During the meeting, which lasted more than six hours, Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner, were repeatedly challenged by left-wing NEC members over the switch to STV and other fraught issues such as his comments on Black Lives Matter. Starmer’s allies have insisted he was using the word “moment” in the sense of “epoch”, to emphasise the significance of BLM – but some party activists and staff complained that the remarks appeared to suggest it was a passing phase. Challenged about what he meant at the NEC meeting, the Labour leader spoke for four to five minutes, but declined to engage in an argument, NEC sources said. One person present described his response as “sucking the air out of the room”. Separately, 13 NEC members wrote to Starmer and Rayner in advance of the meeting, claiming that the party’s press office had dismissed concerns about potentially discriminatory behaviour by Labour staff revealed in a leaked report. The 860-page internal report, which emerged in April, described what it called an “abundant evidence of a hyper-factional atmosphere prevailing in party HQ in this period, which appears to have affected the expeditious and resolute handling of disciplinary complaints”. It included hundreds of private WhatsApp exchanges between named members of Labour staff, discussing Jeremy Corbyn and his close aides in insulting terms. The report’s contents, and the leak itself, are now being investigated by an independent review, chaired by Martin Forde QC. In a the strongly worded letter, seen by the Guardian, the 13 NEC members demanded an explanation of comments released to the website Open Democracy by the party’s press office. The comments appeared to dismiss as “po-faced” concerns about insulting WhatsApp messages revealed in the report, stressing they were private communications. In their letter to Starmer, the NEC members said: “The comment from the Labour party defends racist, sexist and abusive language in the WhatsApp groups, and denies that these messages between then senior party staff display a discriminatory culture within the Labour party.” Signatories included Howard Beckett, Mick Whelan, the secretary general of Aslef, and the NEC’s chair, Andi Fox. A Labour party spokesperson insisted the comments actually formed part of a statement from Labour’s lawyers, responding to claims made by Open Democracy about a specific member of staff, which should not have been sent via the press office. “For the avoidance of doubt, we are clear that the comments that have been quoted do not in any way represent the party’s position in relation to the contents of the leaked report overall and do not prejudge the outcome of those investigations,” the spokesperson said."
2020-06-30T18:10:53Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson returns to his happy place: upbeat, vague and incoherent","The past few months have been a bit of a downer for Boris Johnson – just one bad news story after another. So it was time for a rewrite. The equivalent of Dallas series nine when it turned out everything had been a dream. Boris would go back to his happy place of last year’s general election campaign, when all he had to do was turn up and say the same old bollocks about “getting Brexit done” and “levelling up the country” and people would be fawning over his every word. So at the Dudley Institute of Technology in the West Midlands, Johnson rehashed one of his old campaign speeches for the relaunch of “Love Boris”. Only without the bits about Brexit, which was well and truly done now, given that this was the last day he could have asked the EU for an extension to the transition. Here was Boris at his most upbeat. His most vague. His most incoherent. God help baby Wilfred if Boris ever gets round to reading him a bedtime story. There was the briefest of nods to the coronavirus pandemic, but even here Boris didn’t want to kowtow to all the doomsters and gloomsters who had picked holes in the government’s response over the past few months. Yes, a few people had died and it was awkward that there was a spike in the infection rate in Leicester just as he was planning to ease lockdown restrictions elsewhere in England, but couldn’t we all forget about the bad stuff just for today? Why not concentrate instead on all the hundreds of thousands of people the government hadn’t managed to kill and the millions who had been saved – for the time being, at least – from unemployment through the furlough scheme? Then we got down to the nitty-gritty. Boris didn’t want to draw comparisons with Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal, though if others did, he wasn’t going to complain. Only FDR had spent 40% of US GDP on a whole load of job creation schemes, while Boris was stumping up the princely sum of 0.2% of UK GDP. Or £5bn of old money that had already been promised in the March budget. As so often with Boris, his whole speech was based on a lie. He was acting as if he was announcing something new when the money had already been accounted for. You can get away with recycling old columns for the Daily Telegraph, but you quickly get found out as prime minister. It also turned out that the £5bn was going to have to go an awfully long way as Boris listed the various infrastructure improvements he had in mind for schools, hospitals, roads and housing. Though it did also sound as if he thought hospitals were funded out of philanthropy, as he went out of his way to praise the £35m that Captain Tom had raised for the NHS. All this, though, depended on Operation Speed – something the prime minister may have taken too literally, as the entire speech sounded as if it was being delivered by someone off his head on amphetamines. Just one long gabble of barely connected sentences with only a passing nod to reality. Planning rules would be ripped up. Honest Bob Jenrick had merely been a month or two ahead of the game. There would be no more room for “newt-counting”, as the French and Germans were well ahead of us in housebuilding. Just as well we were leaving the EU then. Boris didn’t even appear to realise that he was now promising to build in eight years what he had originally promised to build in five. Speed can do that to you. Having raced through a long list of government infrastructure projects – Boris is going to get a hell of a shock when he realises who has been in government for the past 10 years to let things get so bad – he was momentarily concerned that some traditional Tories might think he was a communist for even daring to suggest doing more for those who had been hardest hit by austerity. Not that there had ever been such a thing as austerity. That was just a word dreamed up by the Labour party along with David Cameron and George Osborne. So just to make sure that everyone knew he also cared deeply about the filthy rich, he proposed a weekly “clap for capitalists” night. Just as on Thursdays the public had gone out on to the streets to applaud the NHS and emergency services, Friday should be the day we go outside to thank Richard “Dirty” Desmond and the other multimillionaires who had done so much to Make Britain Great Again. Though we must be sure to clap very loudly, or some of them might not hear from their tax havens abroad. Predictably, Boris struggled when it came to the questions. He merely shrugged when it was pointed out to him that £75 a head probably wouldn’t go that far and that right now more people were worried about the more immediate concern of whether they would still have a job in a couple of months than building projects that might take years to complete. “Um,” he said, sure that jobs in the hospitality and services sectors would soon be back on stream. “Wait for what Rishi has to say next week,” he added, before getting himself into a tangle by committing himself to a public sector pay freeze or a tax rise. Let the chancellor sort that problem out. Boris looked to his handlers before heading for the exit. It had been a shambles, but it had served a purpose. For a few hours he had got people talking about things that may or may not happen instead of coronavirus. And he’d conveniently diverted attention away from Michael Gove’s hopeless efforts to explain to the Commons why the best way to ensure a diverse and decentralised government was to stuff No 10 with trusted “yes men”."
2020-06-30T17:11:08Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus death toll rises by 155; employers in Leicester lockdown can re-furlough staff – as it happened,"Boris Johnson has refused to rule out raising taxes to meet the costs of tackling the Covid-19 crisis, as he promised to use infrastructure spending and planning reforms to â€œbuild, build, buildâ€� his way out of a looming recession. Theresa May has launched a forthright attack on Boris Johnsonâ€™s government over the appointment of the EU negotiator David Frost as the UKâ€™s national security adviser. Downing Street has been accused of sowing confusion and anxiety in Leicester as it imposes the first local lockdown to combat a surge in Covid-19 cases in the city, with the health secretary facing demands to pinpoint how the measures will work. Britain and Brussels have each accused the other of holding up a decision on the City of Londonâ€™s ability to do business in EU markets from next year, prolonging the financial servicesâ€™ state of uncertainty about the future. The Bank of Englandâ€™s chief economist has said the UK economy is on track for a V-shaped recovery from the Covid-19 crisis, but warned that a surge in unemployment could nudge the country off course. The ONS has said that by mid-June excess deaths were no longer occurring in the UK. That means the death rate was back in line with what would be expected for this time of year. Thatâ€™s all from us for tonight. Coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog."
2020-06-30T16:42:42Z,politics,Politics,"Psychic energy in, newt counters out: Boris Johnson’s magic economic potion","Boris Johnson delivered his vision for the country’s post-lockdown economic recovery in Dudley, West Midlands, on Tuesday, standing at a podium emblazoned with the words “Build, build, build”. As well as setting out his “levelling up” agenda and plans for a “new deal”, he talked about zero-emission jets, “psychic energies” and told journalists he was not a communist. Preparing for the worst The prime minister used his speech to spell out the economic “generational challenge” ahead and why he believed this required a massive programme for investment. He said the country was in the period between “the flash of lightning and the thunderclap”, “with our hearts in our mouths”, awaiting the full economic fallout from coronavirus. By setting out plans for building and infrastructure projects, dubbed “Build back better”, he said financial recovery was possible even though coronavirus was still “circling like a shark”. The things they got right Boris Johnson was keen to justify the government’s much criticised coronavirus response. He admitted there were lessons to learn, but insisted that there had been achievements, citing the 10-day installation of the Nightingale hospitals, the furlough scheme, the British companies manufacturing ventilators and the University of Oxford’s trials for dexamethasone.
Levelling up Johnson said he was doubling down on his well-used 2019 general election commitment to make regions of the UK more equal. As a former mayor of London, he said he did not want to impede the capital’s success, but to fix the “indefensible gap in opportunity”. His “build, build, build” message included schools, hospitals, homes, rail and road, with priority projects falling under the banner of Project Speed. Tax He dodged direct questions on whether taxes would go up to pay for the huge levels of investment, suggesting the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, would set out measures in due course. After being challenged to say whether he was more Margaret Thatcher or Gordon Brown when it came to taxation, he eventually said his natural instinct was to see taxes reduced, but as the country faced significant challenges, he would try to ensure the burden on the public remained “reasonable”. On borrowing, he said the government was planning to “invest now, when the cost of borrowing allows it”.
Optimism Johnson claimed to have the “magic potion for dark times” ahead. In characteristically colourful language, he said the country must distil the very best of the “psychic energy” of the last few months. “Let’s take the zap and elan of the armed services who helped to build the Nightingales, the public spirit and the good humour of the entire population, and let’s brew them together with the superhuman energy of Captain Tom. Let’s take that combination, that spirit, bottle it, swig it.” Planning The prime minister promised to take a scythe to the red tape of the planning system, mocking the “newt counting” that could lead to lengthy holdups and prevent projects from being built. His proposals would be the most radical since the second world war, he suggested, lamenting that UK procurement took 50% longer than Germany’s and that the UK built 2.25 homes for each 1000 people in 2018 compared with France’s 6.8. Asked whether he was prepared to stand up to middle England and Nimbys over building projects, he said: “I believe this country has got the space on brownfield sites and land that could be developed if it had the right infrastructure.” ‘I am not a communist’ Perhaps fearing he may have worried his free-marketeer support base with talk of a Roosevelt-style new deal, Johnson bizarrely explained that he was not a communist. He suggested capitalists and wealth creators should receive an NHS-style clap for their work for the economy. “My friends, I am not a communist … Yes, of course we clap for our NHS, but under this government we also applaud those who make our NHS possible, our innovators, our wealth creators, our capitalists and financiers.” The union The prime minister said he believed Scotland had been advantaged by its membership of the union in the coronavirus pandemic, because workers had been able to use the furlough scheme. “I believe the union has more than showed its worth,” he said. He added that there would be a new study of all future road, rail, air and cross-sea links between the four nations, seen as a nod to his Scotland-Northern Irish bridge idea. He also promised to complete turning the A1 into a dual carriageway. Technology The prime minister said the UK would try to build the first zero-carbon plane. “We should set ourselves the goal now of producing the world’s first zero-emission long-haul passenger plane. Jet Zero, let’s do it,” he said. Keeping tech innovators in the UK rather than losing them to the US was key for British jobs, he said."
2020-06-30T15:12:14Z,politics,Politics,Rights of UK citizens in EU at risk as member states' legislation not yet in place,"British citizens living in the EU may face significant work and travel hurdles from next year because member states have failed to get to grips with the impact of Brexit on their rights, MPs have been told. As many as 23 EU member states have yet to implement systems to document the future rights of the estimated 1.2 million British citizens already living on the continent, who are in the dark over their future rights and obligations. “Anxiety levels are very high,” Michael Harris, a member of the EU-wide activist group British in Europe (BIE) told the Brexit select committee on Tuesday.
With 200 days to go before the end of the transition period, some countries have not even published draft legislation. The UK launched its system for EU citizens last March, with more than 3.3 million people granted pre-settled or settled status to remain in the country after Brexit. Harris raised particular concerns for an estimated 100,000 British citizens in southern Spain, many of whom have lived there “under the radar” and said it would be a huge challenge to communicate to them by the end of the year, with particular difficulties in reaching elderly people and those in care homes. Spain, home to more than 300,000 Britons, has said it will be implementing a “declaratory” system, which means British people who live there will not be illegal when the transition period ends. However, Harris said this did not mean it would be “plain sailing”. Britons may yet require documents proving their status after 31 December to go back and forth to the UK, as Britons will no longer be in the “benevolent EU regime”. While Spain has already declared what it is doing, as has France, BIE said it had concerns about the wider failure of the EU to publish a list of systems that each country intended to implement. Kalba Meadows, a BIE member who represents an activist group in France, said: “Across the EU things are very, very much further behind than they are in the UK.” Countries have a choice of putting in place a declarative or following the UK with a “constitutive” system, which requires citizens to make an application for their post-Brexit status. So far, all the EU has said is that 13 countries have opted for the constitutive route and 14 the declaratory, but it has not said which countries are opting for which system. Only Italy, the Netherlands and Malta have begun implementation, MPs heard. France was due to launch a constitutive system from 1 July, but on Friday, the country postponed this to October because of the coronavirus pandemic. The SNP MSP Philippa Whitford warned of the consequences of the delays across the EU. “We do not want to see another Windrush right across Europe,” she said. BIE also expressed concern over the loss of people’s free movement rights, which will threaten their right to work across borders, and the lack of an EU-wide recognition of professional qualifications. It expressed renewed concern the issue was not been taken seriously enough by both the UK and EU leaders. Jane Golding, the co-founder of BIE, said: “We haven’t had any indication from either side that this is a topic that has been discussed in any detail as part of the future [relationship] negotiations. And I think that it really is a question, I suppose, of the level of ambition on mobility rights that the UK seeks in the future negotiations.” Meanwhile, campaigners in the UK have called on ministers to make changes to the EU settlement scheme because of the coronavirus pandemic. About 30 charities and organisations signed a letter to the home secretary, Priti Patel, setting out their concerns. The letter marks exactly a year until the deadline for applications expires. EU citizens have been told to apply by June next year in order to carry on living and working in the UK after freedom of movement with the European Union ends. The letter says: “We are concerned that the government has not taken appropriate steps or made the adequate adjustments to the EU settlement scheme necessary to protect EU citizens and family members from Covid-19. We believe the Home Office must work with other government departments to resolve the following issues as a matter of urgency.” The latest estimates show overall 3,612,400 applications have been received, with 3,319,000 finalised since the scheme began, leaving a backlog of about 293,400 still awaiting a decision."
2020-06-30T15:08:32Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's 'loose change' is hardly Roosevelt's New Deal | Larry Elliott,"It’s easy to see why Boris Johnson wants to be seen as the new Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Like FDR, he is in charge of an economy in deep trouble. Like FDR, his sympathies are with the capitalist not the communist. Like FDR, he accentuates the positive. So it was perhaps inevitable that the prime minister harked back to the New Deal of the 1930s when he announced in Dudley that higher spending on infrastructure was key to the UK’s recovery from recession and to the government’s levelling up agenda. A day when lockdown restrictions were reimposed in Leicester was not the time to echo Roosevelt’s “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself” line but in every other respect Johnson was happy to be compared to the four-time president. FDR is, however, a tough act to follow, and it didn’t take long for the prime minister’s political enemies to point out that his 2020 UK “new deal” looks rather modest when compared with the original. An extra £5bn on infrastructure is the equivalent of 0.25% of the UK’s annual output, prompting Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, to say Britain had been “promised FDR’s loose change and some second-hand spending plans. While the US got the Hoover Dam, the pandemic-hit UK gets a re-announcement of repairs to some bridges in Sandwell”. In today’s money, Roosevelt’s spending programme amounted to $5,231 – approximately £4,300 – for every American living through the turmoil of the Great Depression, and was criticised by John Maynard Keynes for not being sufficiently bold. The £5bn pledged by the prime minister amounts to less than £100 a head – and represents an allocation of spending already agreed in Rishi Sunak’s March budget rather than new spending. Jan Crosby, UK head of infrastructure, building and construction at KPMG, said: “The programme should be even more ambitious – much larger and focused on other areas that also need levelling up – social housing; communities and high streets, digital infrastructure, championing accelerator infrastructure for the creation of new export industries.” Downing Street pointed out that Johnson’s infrastructure announcement was merely the start of a much bigger programme of capital spending planned for the next five years, which is true. Sunak earmarked more than £600bn in his budget – levels of inflation-adjusted infrastructure spending not seen since the mid-1950s. What’s more, the government will have a second opportunity to flesh out its plans when the chancellor makes his summer statement on the economy next week. This will be followed by a budget and spending review in the autumn. The original New Deal was not a total success. FDR cut public spending prematurely in 1936, plunging the economy back into recession the following year. Unemployment remained high even at the end of the 1930s and it took military Keynesianism – extra defence spending in preparation for US entry into the second world war – to bring about full recovery.
That said, Roosevelt started with a clean slate and his reforms fundamentally changed America. Unlike Johnson he was not in charge when the crisis began, and the US economy was slowly recovering by the time he arrived in the White House. The New Deal was not just about building dams and taking men and women out of the dole queues, it was about taming Wall Street, giving more power to trade unions, and showing that there was a different way of doing things. In his book Lessons from the Great Depression, Peter Temin noted that the “passive, deflationary” approach of FDR’s predecessor, Herbert Hoover, was replaced by an “aggressive, interventionist, expansionary” approach. Despite insisting that the government does not intend to “cheese-pare” its way out of recession, little Johnson said in Dudley would indicate that his “new deal” will be anything like as far-reaching."
2020-06-30T13:58:14Z,politics,Politics,Theresa May says UK's new national security adviser has 'no proven expertise',"Theresa May has launched a forthright attack on Boris Johnson’s government over the appointment of the EU negotiator David Frost as the UK’s national security adviser. The former prime minister accused the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, of promoting someone “with no proven expertise” to a crucial role at the heart of the UK’s safety. It follows an outcry from security officials and former senior civil servants at the decision to hand the job to Frost, who is expected to prioritise his role negotiating the UK’s deal with the EU while learning his new job. Though formerly a long-serving diplomat, Frost, known as “Frosty” among Johnson’s closest aides, has little direct experience of security matters. Unlike other national security advisers since the role was created in 2010, Frost is not a civil servant, but a political appointee. Frost will receive a peerage and replace Sir Mark Sedwill, who will also step down from his roles as cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, as part of a Whitehall shake-up announced on Sunday. May, who served on the national security council for nine years as home secretary and then prime minister, made her comments as Gove responded to an urgent question about Frost’s role in the House of Commons. She paid tribute to Sedwill, saying she had listened to expert independent advice from national security advisers for nine years, and noted that Gove had made a recent speech saying the government should be able to promote experts to key roles. “On Saturday, my right honourable friend said we must be able to promote those with proven expertise. Why, then, is the new national security adviser a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security?” she said. Gove replied: “We have had previous national security advisers, all of them excellent, not all of them necessarily were people who were steeped in the security world. Some of them were distinguished diplomats in their own right. David Frost is a distinguished diplomat in his own right.” As Gove spoke, May grimaced and shook her head. The former Labour minister Angela Eagle asked Gove to return to May’s question, saying he had failed to answer it. “What are his specific qualifications and expertise and why on earth was he considered for a second for this role?” she said. Gove replied: “The broader point is that David Frost is involved in one of the most complex diplomatic negotiations ever conducted and a diplomatic negotiation that relates specifically to defence and security cooperation as well as tariffs and trade. “He has been a civil servant for decades and it is the case that Mark Lyall Grant and Kim Darroch, who were national security advisers, were not people who were steeped in the world of intelligence and security. .” It is the first time that May has launched an attack on Johnson’s administration since she was forced from office last summer. She appointed Sedwill to the role as national security adviser in 2017. Later, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, backed Gove, saying in front of a defence select committee that it was not necessary for Frost to have a national security background, arguing instead that his experience dealing with Brussels would help. “I think negotiating with the EU sets you up pretty well to tackling an octopus which the national security construct can sometimes be,” the minister added. Wallace also said that Sedwill would “make a fantastic secretary general of Nato if he is successful in getting that appointment”, making him the first minister to publicly confirm that the outgoing cabinet secretary and national security adviser would be put up by the UK as a candidate for the top job at the military alliance next year. Frost, 55, will be the secretary of the 15-strong National Security Council, which meets regularly to discuss strategy. Meetings are chaired by the prime minister and include the heads of MI5 and MI6, GCHQ, and the country’s most senior military officers. The SNP’s home affairs spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry, said Sedwill has been forced out because he warned last year that Brexit could be a disaster. “So this is all about the revenge of the Vote Leave campaign, whose so-called mastermind [Dominic Cummings] is now pulling the strings of this government. “Although one does have to wonder about the masterly-ness of a mind that thinks a good way to test one’s eyesight is to go for a 60-mile drive,” she said. Despite occupying what was once a neutral role, Frost could be introduced to parliament as a Conservative, a Tory minister confirmed. Lord True told the House of Lords: “It is my understanding that he may be introduced as a Conservative peer, but I can’t confirm that.” In Gove’s speech on Whitehall reform on Saturday, he called for a push to retain expert advisers. “There are systemic problems which mean we often lose institutional memory and fail to build on hard-won success,” he said. Sedwill, the UK’s most senior civil servant, will step down from Downing Street in September and has also been handed a peerage. Johnson has discussed the possibility that Sedwill could be officially nominated to become Nato’s next secretary general. However, the post is not likely to become free until the end of 2022, when the incumbent, Jens Stoltenberg, is expected to retire after eight years in the role."
2020-06-30T12:34:09Z,politics,Politics,"London minicab charge discriminates against vulnerable, court hears","Imposing the congestion charge on minicabs entering central London while exempting taxis discriminates against vulnerable drivers and passengers, the court of appeal has been told. Around 94% of minicab drivers are from BAME communities, the court heard on Tuesday, whereas 88% of black cab taxi drivers are white. The £15-a-day charge, which affects around 113,000 minicab drivers in London, also disadvantages women, who are more likely to work part-time, and disabled or elderly passengers who have fewer transport options as a result of the charge, the court has been told. The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents workers in the gig economy, is appealing against a decision by the high court last year to uphold the congestion charge scheme overseen by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Ben Collins QC, for the IWGB, told the court that the mayor had chosen to target a vulnerable group of drivers and passengers in order to reduce congestion in central London. Minicab drivers, he said, are “working very long hours to make ends meet and provide for their families. These are very hard-working people for whom every penny counts.” The appeal comes as the congestion charge rose sharply this month, from £11.50 to £15 a day, while incomes from fares plummeted due to the Covid-19 lockdown. The congestion zone covers 21 sq km. There are around 21,000 taxis in the capital that do not have to pay the charge. Collins said the decision was a breach of duties under the Equality Act. Around 71% of minicab drivers live in the most deprived parts of the capital, he added. They earn, on average, £23,000 a year or less. The authorities had failed to weigh up whether the policy of removing the congestion charge exemption on private hire vehicles, known as minicabs, was a proportionate way of meeting the aim of reducing traffic without reducing the number of vehicles that could carry wheelchair users, the court was told. That traffic has been reduced by 1% was disputed by lawyers for the union. By discouraging minicabs, which are often have hybrid electric-petrol engines, while encouraging diesel-powered black taxis, it is alleged, the policy risks increasing pollution. Minicabs can carry wheelchair users, though usually when they are not sitting in their wheelchairs, the court heard. Zero-emission vehicles are exempt from the charge. Before the hearing, Faiz Saim, a London-based minicab driver and father of three, said: “The congestion charge increase is devastating for us. Especially on the back of Covid-19, which destroyed most of our business, I just can’t believe they’re doing this to us. “The other day I only got two jobs in the morning and every penny I earned went on congestion charge payments. I’ve lost my weekends with my children, since I’ve got to be out there seven days a week now. [The mayor] should charge the companies instead of us drivers. Uber can afford it. We can barely afford to keep food on the table.” Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of the IWGB, said: “Faced with the greatest economic crisis in 300 years, it is now more important than ever that London’s low-paid minicab drivers don’t face a discriminatory tax on the poor. It is a shame that the mayor has forced drivers to litigate in order to protect their livelihoods.” But Marie Demetriou QC, counsel for the mayor and TfL, told the court that they had considered the relatively greater impact on BAME, female drivers and disabled passengers and concluded it was a “proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aim of reducing traffic and congestion”. They had calculated the move would result in quicker, smoother journeys, fewer accidents, less noise and better air quality. She denied that it amounted to unlawful discrimination. “In striking the balance between competing interests under the Equality Act … the mayor’s margin of discretion is wide here,” she said. Judgement is expected to be reserved."
2020-06-30T07:00:05Z,politics,Politics,Britain beyond lockdown: can we make more space for nature?,"The first post-lockdown crops of the land army have been harvested. The food – chard, spinach, lettuce and radish – is being parcelled out to the local shops, market stalls and those in need. Now the volunteer labour force has its sights on a new goal: a land-use revolution that will make UK farming more nature friendly, plant-based and resilient to future shocks. At Machynlleth, a bucolic town on the southern fringe of Snowdonia, the recently formed Planna Fwyd! (Plant Food!) movement is encouraging sheep farmers to diversify into vegetable production as their ancestors did. Teams of volunteers have sown crops of potatoes and, once or twice a week, they now fan across the slopes to tend gooseberry bushes, peas and squash. Others distribute seed packets to local families and run online classes on how to grow plants at home. “If the whole coronavirus experience has taught us anything, it is that we should be more self-sufficient. It was terrifying seeing the empty shop shelves,” said Chris Higgins, a retired academic who gets as much back as he gives from the voluntary work. “It’s very enriching. Growing and cooking food and working together is a great way of engaging with the local community and nature at the same time.”
In the not-too-distant past, eco-farming in rural communes was considered a fringe activity, but many of its core concepts – local distribution, diversity and eco-system management – have become mainstream concerns in the wake of a pandemic that made the public appreciate the vitality of nature and the fragility of global supply chains. For many, the greatest upside of the crisis has been the respite for other species – deer on the beach in Hartlepool, mountain goats wandering the streets of Llandudno, more dolphins and porpoises in the harbour at Fishguard. In a nationwide YouGov-Cambridge Centre and Jesus College Intellectual Forum at Cambridge University survey, conducted in partnership with the Guardian at the peak of the lockdown, 75% of respondents felt the lockdown has been good for the environmental health of the planet. There were also strong expectations that the benefits to nature and the climate would continue after the crisis. The poll showed 47% believe the lasting impact of lockdown will be positive for the environment, 29% foresaw no change, and only 10% believed it would make things worse.
As the lockdown eases, Boris Johnson says the “nation is coming out of hibernation”, but unless more space is found for nature in the government’s recovery plans, wildlife will once again retreat, the soil degrade and the climate destabilise.
History shows the folly of trying to return to business as usual after a pandemic. In the 14th century, the Black Death disrupted trade, left crops unharvested and prompted devastating famines. The aristocracy attempted to regain lost revenue and authority with higher taxes and more restrictions. This created the conditions for Wat Tyler’s Peasants Revolt and the Welsh war of independence led by Owain Glyndwr. Today’s rebels want greater food security, lower carbon emissions and healthier commons that can provide clean water, fresh air and a stable climate for everyone. This is not just the Landworkers Alliance and Extinction Rebellion Farmers, but academics and former ministers who say it makes good business sense. Machynlleth – the first seat of government for Glyndwr in the 15th century – is today among the most progressive rural communities in the UK. The landscape is recognised by UNESCO as a globally important biosphere, it is the site of the Centre of Alternative Technology, and its council was the first in Wales to declare a climate emergency. The small population of 2,200 people is also home to a disproportionate number of influential thinkers, including Jane Powell, the coordinator of the Wales Food Manifesto. The writer and activist said Covid-19 had instigated a clamour for food democracy. “It has mobilised people. There is a huge uprising of people volunteering to distribute or grow food. They’ve seen the fragility of global supply chains. I think it has given people a sense of ‘gosh, it’s up to us’. We’d like to be better prepared next time. We need more control and knowledge.” In Wales – as elsewhere in the UK – the pandemic exposed the risks of excessively specialising in sheep and cattle for export. This was already a concern due to Brexit, which will end subsidies and reduce markets, and a broader consumer trend to eat less meat. Lockdown brought a sudden dearth of vegetables and a glut of lamb. Shocked consumers are calling for a more reliable local supply. Welsh hill farmers are looking for new revenue streams either by planting crops or charging for ecosystem services, such as flood control, wildlife habitat and peatlands that absorb carbon dioxide. “This pandemic gives us the permission to think differently,” says former Welsh environment minister Jane Davidson. “The UK government, particularly in a post-Brexit scenario, has the biggest opportunity since 1974 to redefine the role of food in the economy and to create the stewards of the land to ensure the country is resilient.”
Davidson is the woman behind one of the world’s most progressive pieces of legislation: the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act, which was passed by the Welsh Assembly in 2015. This obliges policymakers to think long term and take environmental limits into account. She says food is at the heart of this approach. “We are realising what is important. It is not finance, it is food producers, delivery truck drivers and shop workers. States should create new opportunities around food production. That is the kind of decent work that sustains people during a crisis.”
The 10-acre smallholder has just written a book on the subject, and says the focus should not be “rewilding”, but on reasserting the lost human role in nature. She says the UK should set up land commissions in the four home nations and use subsidies to encourage diversity rather than monocultures. This is likely to mean less sheep for export and more horticulture for the domestic market. Currently, only 2% of the fruit and vegetables eaten in Wales are grown locally. There is money to be made. Helen and Keith Lessiter run the vegetable, fruit and flower stalls at the farmers market in the Fishguard town hall. They have seen a surge in demand for seeds and plants. “We haven’t been so busy in 10 years,” says Helen. “Everybody wants to do their own growing. That is great. The more local production the better.”
The couple rent a cottage on 100 acres of land. When they started out, Helen was advised to have a gimmick that would set her apart from other traders so she wears a black bowler hat adorned with a pink ribbon and a garland of plastic flowers. Since the start of lockdown, such contrivances are unnecessary. She estimates business on her stall is up 70%, while sales of her plants through a local hardware store are 10 times higher than last year. “I hope this experience has made people appreciate what goes into food production. It has been classed as menial work for so long. Now people can see that it is not just a case of stick it in the ground and wait.” Farmers won kudos by donating to community support groups that kept people fed at a time of lay-offs and delayed social benefits that forced more than 6 million people to cut portions or skip meals. Rachel Stevens and Daniel Colborne, a middle-aged couple from Worcester, left jobs in engineering and factories to raise ducks, plant crops and create a woodland on a four-acre plot of land just outside Fishguard. At the start of lockdown, they lost sales from luxury hotels and instead donated their eggs to the “community fridge”, which distributes food to more than 300 residents. This helped them later benefit from the burgeoning “buy local” movement. “It has been a hard slog, but this crisis might help us in the long run. People have got a taste for what we have to offer.”
Such dynamism and idealism at the local level could morph into frustration, resentment and protectionism if the UK government’s Covid-19 recovery plans involve rural funding cuts and a rushed trade deal with the US, which would flood supermarkets with cheap, low-quality imports. This is the fear of Sam Robinson, a shepherd, who lives just outside Machnylleth. He recently planted half an acre of potatoes for the first time, which he sees as part of a welcome return to mixed farming. “I am a defender of lamb and beef, but it is great to see a return of diversity,” he said. He also works on woodland creation projects for farmers. “We’re seeing a huge surge of interest,” he said. “But what we achieve depends on support. So far, the Welsh government has made this a priority, which means funding is available.”
A change in land use is essential for the UK to get back on track towards its climate goals. Returning peatland, bogs and other habitats to their natural state could absorb as much as a third of the UK’s carbon dioxide emissions, according to the Wildlife Trust. Clive Faulkner, of the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust, said the region had proved it is possible to reskill farmers as environmental stewards and restore the land. “Twenty years ago people thought we were kooky, but now many are following.” He is now working on the holy grail of agrarian reform: how to value ecosystem services, find a buyer and establish a mechanism for payment. That had seemed within reach until Covid-19. Faulkner was given a grant from the Welsh government to set up pilot schemes. UK officials had discussed eco-system service payments as part of the agriculture bill, which is currently going through parliament. The fate of these long-term plans has been thrown up in the air by the pandemic and government urgency to jump-start the economy with a building boom. Faulkner urged the government not to neglect the countryside. “I worry about who will support the farming community,” he said. “Covid-19 is an amazing catastrophe, but it is not as systematic a threat as our broken relationship with the landscape.”"
2020-06-29T22:06:56Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Hancock announces local lockdown for Leicester — as it happened,"A streamlined application process will enable pubs and restaurants to get permission for on-street dining in around 10 days, a measure forming part of the governmentâ€™s Covid recovery plan. Outlining reforms aimed at boosting the hospitality sector as it prepares to reopen on 4 July, business secretary Alok Sharma stressed there were safeguards for local councils to refuse applications if they block the highway, the Press Association reports. Former Tory minister Caroline Nokes criticised the recovery plan, which has cross-party support, as being â€œdesigned by men for menâ€� as she questioned why barbers could open but not beauty bars. Speaking during the second reading of the Business and Planning Bill, Sharma said: â€œPublic safety and access for disabled people using pavements is of course absolutely vital, so I can confirm that local authorities will be able to refuse or revoke licences where appropriate.â€� He added: â€œThere are safeguards in place. This extension will not include premises that have been denied off-sale permission, or had it removed, within the last three years.â€� The Bill also seeks to reduce the planning appeal process from almost a year to around six months, extend the hours construction sites can operate to stagger working times and also allow bus and lorry drivers to extend their driving licences for a year without the requirement for a medical review, to free up time for GPs to deal with Covid-19. I will wrap this blog up now, many thanks for reading and commenting as always."
2020-06-29T21:30:48Z,politics,Politics,"'Absolutely fanciful': Boris Johnson's new deal not Rooseveltian, say critics","Boris Johnson will seek to wrap himself in the mantle of one of the most-revered American presidents in modern times on Tuesday, as he attempts to refocus his premiership by promising a “New Deal” for Britain in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. According to pre-released extracts, Johnson’s speech will highlight projects worth £5bn, which he will “accelerate”, including improvements to schools and hospitals, and “shovel ready” schemes such as parks improvements. Speaking in the West Midlands, he will claim his ambitions to rebuild Britain echo the achievements of Franklin D Roosevelt (FDR), who carried out a wholesale reconstruction of the US economy in the wake of the Great Depression and is remembered for large-scale projects such as the Hoover Dam. But critics of the prime minister will likely highlight there is no new money in the announcement. Some observers derided Johnson’s suggestion that his plan bore any resemblance to the 1930s White House. “The notion that he’s going to turn himself into FDR seems absolutely fanciful,” said professor Anand Menon, of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank. “FDR surrounded himself with experts, and drew on what they had to say, in a way that Boris Johnson so far has not.” Tuesday’s speech comes after a bruising few weeks for Johnson personally and his government, with poll ratings for both dipping dramatically as headlines were dominated by Dominic Cummings’ cross-country drive during lockdown, Johnson’s U-turn over free school meals, and allegations of cash-for-favours against Robert Jenrick. While Downing Street insisted Johnson’s speech is not part of a relaunch, No 10 is keen to restore its grip on the news agenda with upbeat messaging about the future. Johnson will say: “It sounds positively Rooseveltian. It sounds like a New Deal. All I can say is that if so, then that is how it is meant to sound and to be, because that is what the times demand. A government that is powerful and determined and that puts its arms around people at a time of crisis.
“This is a government that is wholly committed not just to defeating coronavirus, but to using this crisis finally to tackle this country’s great unresolved challenges of the last three decades.” Despite International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts suggesting the UK is on track for one of the worst economic downturns in the G7, Johnson will insist, “we will not just bounce back, we will bounce forward.” Among the projects the prime minister is expected to highlight are bridge repairs in Sandwell, digital upgrades to courts, and improvements to local high streets. He will also promise £1.5bn for hospital maintenance. To underscore his green credentials, Johnson will recommit to planting over 75,000 acres of trees every year by 2025 – and pledge £40m to boost local conservation projects and create 3000 jobs, including new Conservation Rangers. However, Green MP Caroline Lucas said: “The point about Roosevelt’s New Deal was that it was visionary – for the 1930s. Ninety years on, we need a different vision, so not a new deal, but a green new deal and that has to go far beyond tree-planting, welcome though that is.” Johnson’s spending announcements are intended to show that the government is sticking to its “levelling-up” agenda despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Too many parts of this country have felt left behind, neglected, unloved, as though someone had taken a strategic decision that their fate did not matter as much as the metropolis,” he will say. His language echoes that used by Jeremy Corbyn, who blamed the Brexit vote in 2016 on “people and places that have been left behind” – many of which went on to vote Tory in December. Whitehall sources said the prime minister’s speech would focus on the medium and longer term needs of the economy and that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, would be providing short-term support for growth in his summer update next month. “This is part of the same overall economic plan and the financing of it,” one said. The treasury has been working closely with Number 10 on Johnson’s package, which does not involve new spending but will allocate some of the £600bn-plus that Sunak earmarked in his March budget for capital projects over the next five years. The chancellor believes the government should show that it can spend the sums already pledged – the highest net investment since 1955 adjusted for inflation – before increasing the infrastructure budget further. The individual pledges have met the treasury’s value for money tests. The chancellor has been encouraged by the signs that the decision to open non-essential shops in England from 15 June has led to a bigger increase in spending than he expected. Despite pressure on him to announce a blanket cut in VAT, Sunak is keener on measures that boost employment and is looking at ways of providing targeted support for sectors such as hospitality, which have been badly affected by the three-month lockdown of the economy and where millions of jobs are at risk. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, urged the prime minister to show “a laser-like focus on preventing further job losses and supporting future employment”. Labour has been calling for a “budget for jobs”, to try and stem layoffs in the coming months. The chancellor is billing his summer statement as the second phase of a three-part response to Covid-19, following the emergency support provided in the spring and ahead of the budget and a spending review in the autumn. Last week, Johnson announced a radical reopening package that will see pubs, restaurants and hotels reopen on Saturday, in a move government scientific advisers conceded was “not risk-free”. Ministers have also been stung by the backlash from parents against the government’s failure to ensure more children could go back to school. Later this week, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, is expected to announce more details of the government’s plans for getting all children back to school in September. Johnson’s promise of more money for infrastructure projects comes alongside a shakeup of Whitehall machinery, which has already seen the departure announced of cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill, with more changes expected in the coming days."
2020-06-29T20:01:06Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson adores Churchill, but now he's flirting with Roosevelt","Among Boris Johnson’s numerous passing passions there seemed to be one love affair that was not fickle – his worship of Winston Churchill. As a lover of history and English exceptionalism, there seemed no chance that his eye would ever be caught straying from his hero. Even though the great historian JH Plumb once described Churchill’s historical output as “old whig claptrap echoing from chapter to chapter”, nothing seemed to dislodge Johnson’s loyalty. But suddenly he has been smitten by someone who was seven years Churchill’s junior: Franklin D Roosevelt. In his speech on Tuesday, Johnson offers himself as the architect of a modern day British New Deal.
It is not clear his new hero would approve. Churchill and Roosevelt struck up a wartime friendship credited with saving the world, but Churchill’s views of the New Deal itself were scathing. At the end of 1937 in a message entitled “What we ask of the United States” he called on President Roosevelt in the interest of the common anti-Hitlerite cause to abandon “this war on wealth and business, this ruthless war on private enterprise”. Johnson may not find the self-regarding narrative of the New Deal so attractive if he looks at its details. Yes, there was an element that was experimental and pragmatic to Roosevelt. He did not think government power lay just in spending, but in helping businesses overcome risk-aversion and in financing new opportunities for growth. Nor was he just preaching optimism and can-do. He knew capitalism had to change, and as a result came to be a man idolised by the union movement and American liberals. In 1936, seeking a second term, he was clear there was an enemy. “The forces of ‘organized money’ are unanimous in their hate for me – and I welcome their hatred.”
He went on: “I should like to have it said of my first administration that in it the forces of selfishness and of lust for power met their match, [and] I should like to have it said of my second administration that in it these forces have met their master.” He determined to remake capitalism for the poor and unemployed. The first New Deal brought in unprecedented government regulation of American banks and the stock markets, to avoid a repeat of the Depression. This included clamping down on speculative activities in commercial banks (including the Glass-Steagall Act). He also attacked corporate abuses rife on Wall Street. Throughout he was a great champion of the union movement through the National Industrial Recovery Act. This spawned the National Recovery Administration, which created corporatist collaboration between industry, unions and government to set minimum wages and maximum working hours, to set prices, and to write codes of fair competition. Nothing like that has existed in the UK since the 1960s Wilson government. The second New Deal in 1935 went further. He created the Works Progress Administration, focused on providing directly subsidised jobs building public works like post offices, bridges, schools, highways and parks. The WPA also gave work to artists, writers, theatre directors and musicians. In 1935 he also passed what is known as the Wagner Act, and created the National Labor Relations Board to supervise union elections and prevent businesses from treating their workers unfairly. By 1937, 8 million people had joined trade unions. In total, his system of loans and subsidies created 20m jobs. Faced by persistent court obstructionism in 1937, Roosevelt threatened to pack the Supreme Court. He asked Congress to empower him to appoint an additional justice for any member of the court over age 70 who did not retire. He sought to name as many as six additional Supreme Court justices, as well as up to 44 judges to the lower federal court. In the end he backed down, but his determination made the judges temper their creativity in interpreting the law. Johnson may on reflection decide it is safer to return to his first love."
2020-06-29T19:32:46Z,politics,Politics,Lib Dem MP Layla Moran targets rise in BAME board directors,"Britain’s top companies will be tasked with hiring more boardroom directors from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds under plans being drawn up by the Liberal Democrats leadership candidate Layla Moran. Announcing the policy in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests around the world, the favourite to replace Jo Swinson as Lib Dem leader said companies listed in the FTSE 350 should each have at least 15% of board directors from a BAME background. The target, which would be voluntary, would mean each firm having at least one BAME boardroom director on average. Moran said she wanted business to take the lead on the target, which should be met within five years, but that failure to make progress would require government intervention. Speaking in an interview with the Guardian to unveil the policy move, Moran said businesses needed to make their efforts to promote BAME representation at the top of the corporate ladder a priority. “I hear over again from activists and those making the case for this that it’s all words and no actions. It’s no longer good enough to pay lip service to these inequalities; we have to do something about it. “Many companies have been trying. However, I think it hasn’t been made a high-enough priority by a lot of them. Black Lives Matter has really highlighted the fact there is more that could be done,” she said. Moran is the bookies’ favourite to beat Ed Davey, the Lib Dems’ interim leader, to take charge of the party. The result of the leadership contest will be announced on 26 August. More than a third of Britain’s biggest companies are on track to miss a government-backed target to have at least one director from an ethnic minority by 2021. According to an update published in February by the Parker review, 37% of firms in the FTSE 100 had no non-white board directors. The figure rises to 69% of companies in the second-tier FTSE 250 index.
Limited progress has been made since 2017, when Sir John Parker, a former chairman of the mining firm Anglo American, led a review into boardroom diversity for the government. At the time, 51 firms in the FTSE 100 had no directors from BAME backgrounds, which led him to put forward the voluntary “one by 21” target. Despite the likely failure of many of Britain’s biggest firms to hit the target, Moran said she believed a voluntary, industry-led approach was still the best way to boost boardroom diversity. The Oxford West and Abingdon MP said she wanted to replicate the progress in increasing gender diversity in the boardroom led by Dame Helena Morrissey and the 30% Club, a group of senior City executives seeking to promote women on company boards. Women now hold a third of board positions in the FTSE 100, almost a year sooner than expected. Some countries have imposed boardroom gender quotas, including France and Norway, and have higher proportions of women on boards. Saying that the Lib Dems were the natural party of business and that she favoured a liberal approach rather than legislation, Moran said companies would respond to a tougher target. “A target like this would increase the amount of scrutiny and transparency the business sector would be putting on itself. It would be a real message of positive change in the current climate of Black Lives Matter, where people really want to see action,” she said."
2020-06-29T19:05:32Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's pick for national security post attacked as too political,"Security experts and opposition MPs on Monday condemned David Frost’s appointment as Boris Johnson’s national security adviser, arguing that his political status and lack of direct experience would undermine his effectiveness. Lord Ricketts, the first person to be appointed to the role when it was created in 2010, said it was his job to provide “politically neutral advice” to the prime minister, allowing the politicians to “work out what they wanted to do”.
“David Frost has explicitly been appointed as a political appointee. So that is confusing the lines between civil service advice and the political, the party-political angle which ministers normally bring and that worries me,” the peer added. Lord Wood of Anfield, a former foreign policy adviser to Gordon Brown, said all four previous national security advisers had been civil servants, and he argued their job was to coordinate security efforts across a range of ministries. “In the area of national security, the considerations of the PM’s political fortunes need to be nowhere near the reasoning of the national security adviser,” Wood said. “Being a political appointment means you have your eyes on the political consequences of actions, and the political motives of taking them in the first place.” Frost’s surprise appointment was announced late on Sunday in the aftermath of the departure of Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, who had also held the national security post since 2017. The aide to Johnson will start in the job in August and combine it with his existing roles as the prime minister’s Europe adviser and chief Brexit negotiator, also prompting complaints he would lack time to do the job properly. Created when David Cameron was prime minister, the national security adviser’s role is to coordinate the work of the national security committee, a weekly meeting between senior ministers and intelligence service chiefs. Former officials say the post was in part intended to formalise relationships between ministers and Britain’s spy agencies, who had been criticised for allowing themselves to become too politicised under Tony Blair in the run-up to the Iraq war. Alex Thomas, a former civil servant now based at the Institute for Government, said: “It’s right that the prime minister chooses who he wants around him, but one of the questions is whether there will be too much informal decision-making again.” Frost will be made a peer, although not a minister. To allow him to maintain his political status Whitehall sources said he was not expected to act as the accounting officer for the spy agencies’ £3.23bn budgets, a role that can only be undertaken by a civil servant. Conservatives close to Downing Street said that Frost’s appointment would bring focus to a policy area that Johnson was not believed to be particularly enthusiastic about. “I think it came as a surprise to Johnson how ruthless the Russians could be,” one adviser said. They also believe it is likely to allow for a change of heart on issues such as Huawei, where Sedwill and the intelligence agencies had advised the prime minister it would be safe to allow the Chinese company limited access to 5G networks. The policy is under review after a Tory revolt. Alan Mendoza, the executive director for the Henry Jackson Society, which has been leading the anti-Huawei campaign, said: “This is a chance for the government to reset its national security agenda beyond its previous narrow confines.” Unlike Sedwill, a career diplomat who had been posted in sensitive countries such as Iraq and Pakistan before becoming ambassador to Afghanistan and permanent secretary to the Home Office, Frost’s Foreign Office career peaked when he became ambassador to Denmark and the Foreign Office’s director of strategy at the end of the last decade. Few colleagues in the civil service believed Frost was going to rise much further. After a spell as a trade negotiator at the department for business, he left the civil service in 2013 to become the chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, where he remained a relatively low-profile figure. David Henig, a former civil service colleague, remembers Frost as “diligent and capable” but said that he would have had little or no dealings with the National Security Council previously because it was set up in 2010 as he was leaving the Foreign Office. Instead he retained political links through rightwing thinktanks such as Open Europe and the Henry Jackson Society. That paid off when he became a policy adviser to Johnson when the latter was foreign secretary between 2016 and 2018.
“Boris hired him because he was a bridge between the political class and the civil servants,” a former fellow special adviser said. “This is not a man who is anti-civil service, he just wants to make the machine work for the prime minister.” Known universally in Brexit circles as Frosty, the former diplomat returned to government after Johnson became prime minister, as his Europe adviser. He become the lead Brexit negotiator at the end of January with a 4o-strong team as the Department for Exiting the European Union was wound up. Frost was trusted sufficiently to regularly brief journalists on the state of the Brexit negotiations and, unusually for an aide, gave a blunt speech in Brussels in February where he warned that the democratic consent of the British public would “snap dramatically and finally” if the UK continued to be tied to EU rules."
2020-06-29T18:23:04Z,politics,Politics,Sedwill's exit seen as just the start of Whitehall revolution,"Dominic Cummings’ preoccupation with Brexit always went hand in hand with a desire to shake up the British state – and he has never made any secret of his withering disdain for the civil service. So, while Downing Street on Monday tried to play down the significance of the departure of Mark Sedwill, the talk around Whitehall is of a revolution under way. His exit – and the move to make Brexit negotiator David Frost the prime minister’s new national security adviser – is widely seen as just the beginning of a wider upheaval. Michael Gove laid the intellectual groundwork for the shakeup with a lecture at the weekend in which he set out what he regards as the main faults in the Whitehall machine. Some of these – that the civil service is too London-centric, and stuffed with generalists who move between jobs too quickly instead of acquiring expertise – would be familiar to most students of politics. Less diplomatic views of the civil service are set out in Cummings’ blog, in which the prime minister’s adviser claimed last year that Whitehall’s upper echelons acted as a “protected caste to preserve its power and privileges regardless of who the ignorant plebs vote for”. “Being in charge of massive screw-ups is no barrier to promotion,” he complained. “Operational excellence is no requirement for promotion. You will often see the official in charge of some debacle walking to the tube at 4pm (‘compressed hours’, old boy) while the debacle is live on TV.” He also criticised Sedwill’s predecessor Jeremy Heywood, who died in 2018. “The elevation of Heywood in the pantheon of SW1 is the elevation of the courtier-fixer at the expense of the thinker and the manager,” he wrote in June 2019. In January this year, as he urged “weirdos and misfits” to apply to work in Downing Street, Cummings condemned “confident public school bluffers” and warned that “if you play office politics, you will be discovered and immediately binned”. Eton-educated Johnson has sometimes been dismissed as a public school bluffer himself, and victims of Johnson and Cummings’ own ruthlessness say “office politics” is exactly what they excel at. In what appears to be another move to bring more control to the centre, a series of new cabinet committees were quietly announced on Monday, giving Gove and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, extensive oversight over policy as the country recovers from coronavirus. The Treasury is widely expected to be next in No 10’s sights, with the merging of its advisers with Johnson’s – the issue that prompted Sajid Javid’s resignation – seen as the precursor for a more drastic clipping of its wings. Cummings reportedly told a recent weekly meeting of special advisers that it was a mistake to see him as a centraliser. He said he wanted to empower individual departments – but he is known to have a spectacularly low opinion of most politicians. Asked about the prospects of a cabinet reshuffle, he told reporters waiting outside his home in February that kids’ TV superheroes the PJ Masks “will do a greater job than all of them put together”. Cummings had already centralised control over special advisers across the government, with an external agency, Hanbury Strategy, run by Vote Leave’s former director of communications Paul Stephenson, screening applicants. As for Sedwill’s replacement, No 10 has said it will be a current or former permanent secretary. It is likely to be someone more sympathetic to Johnson’s Brexit project and his brook-no-opposition, bulldozer style. A name in the frame is Antonia Romeo, currently permanent secretary at Liz Truss’s Department for International Trade which is widely deemed at risk of being rolled into the Foreign Office. Mark Wormald, currently permanent secretary at the Department of Health but previously at the Department for Education during Gove’s tenure, is also being mentioned in Whitehall. But Cummings and Gove have both made clear the government wants to do more than replace small-c conservative mandarins with more sympathetic figures. In his speech, Gove repeatedly made reference to the Great Depression-era government of Franklin D Roosevelt in the US. Roosevelt created a whole battery of new, publicly funded government agencies to roll out his New Deal programmes across the country. As Gove put it: “Roosevelt recognised that faced with a crisis that had shaken faith in government, it was not simply a change of personnel and rhetoric that was required but a change in structure, ambition and organisation. The establishment of new bodies such as the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, the Public Works Association, the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration demonstrated a willingness to break the mould of the past.” Some observers expressed scepticism about the comparison between Johnson and Roosevelt. Stewart Wood, the Labour peer and former adviser to Gordon Brown, said the prime minister’s “new deal” was likely to be mainly about differentiating his administration from previous Tory governments. “As an analogy it’s totally preposterous,” he said. “What they want is just to make a break from austerity and show that they’re different.” Crucially, some of Roosevelt’s agencies were staffed with political appointees – including a young Lyndon B Johnson, who used his leadership of the Texan outpost of the National Youth Administration not just to create thousands of jobs for out-of-work teenagers, but to build up a statewide political machine that he subsequently used to run for office. Johnson is keen to hold on to the former Labour heartland seats he won last December, and the advantage of bold, coast-to-coast spending pledges administered by shiny new agencies is that they should be clearly visible on the ground. He and Gove also both have a long track record of handing jobs to trusted friends, and their “new deal” is unlikely to be any different. “How many mates has Michael got to whom jobs can be given? That’s all it amounts to so far,” said one former colleague."
2020-06-29T15:59:18Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson bats back gentle lobs on Times Radio's tame debut | John Crace,"Call it a win-win. That’s if your smart speakers hadn’t shunted you off to a station in Malawi. Times Radio was looking for a big name to kick off the first show of its first day broadcasting, and interviews don’t come much bigger than the prime minister. And Boris Johnson was keen to drop a gentle reminder that Radio 4’s Today still was not forgiven for its lese-majesty, which was why he had not appeared on the programme for eight months. So shortly after eight in the morning Boris made his return to the first news organisation to have sacked him for lying. Not that the intervening 20 years or so have done much for his casual relationship with the truth, as he began with a long waffle about how things were going to be simultaneously remarkably hard and incredibly easy. Mainly he would be building a lot of things that he wasn’t entirely sure how he was going to pay for. “What you can’t do, I think, at this moment, is go back to what people called austerity,” said Boris, enigmatically. “And it wasn’t actually austerity, but people called it austerity.” Most of us could have sworn that even the Tories had called the decade from 2010 the years of austerity, but Boris was having none of that. It had all been just an illusion. People might have felt social services, benefits and other government spending had been cut, but they had been labouring under a misapprehension. Compared to what it might have been, it had been a time of plenty. And now there was going to be plenty more plenty. Surprisingly, neither of the two presenters, Stig Abell and Aasmah Mir, thought to challenge Boris on this. Nor did they raise much of an eyebrow at the trailed announcement of a £1bn schools building programme. A programme that Labour had earmarked 10 years ago and that Michael Gove himself had nixed as education minister. Still, to be generous, one could say that Boris had finally got round to admitting a mistake. There were moments when Abell and Mir briefly threatened some more probing questions. Not least on the summary dismissal of Mark Sedwill. Mark was just too good, Boris insisted, too talented to be kept on as head of the civil service. He deserved a far more important job. Like being kicked upstairs to the Lords where he could do no damage with his remainery views. Aasmah’s observation that most of the briefings against Sedwill seemed to have come from inside No 10 were met with the usual feigned, unconvincing innocence from the prime minister. Boris couldn’t imagine how anyone could believe Dominic Cummings might have dripped poison into receptive journalist ears. That just wasn’t Classic Dom’s style at all. The more serious question of No 10 being turned into a centralised Brexiter chumocracy with the appointment of David Frost – a man with no defence experience – to Sedwill’s former role as national security adviser went unasked. Throughout the interview, Boris was keen to promote himself as the UK’s reincarnation of Franklin D Roosevelt. And in one way he was making a decent fist of it, as he was gradually turning the interview into something of a cosy fireside chat. There was little on why the UK had the worst coronavirus death rate in Europe, why the UK had been so slow to go into lockdown, why patients had been kicked out of hospitals and into care homes or why he was so keen to avoid any kind of national inquiry. At one point Stig did get close to something rather more revelatory by asking what the prime minister had learned from his brush with death in intensive care. Here was a chance for Boris to get vaguely personal, to deviate from his usual standard Classic Dom-issue piffle-paffle. He could have said he wanted to be a better dad sixth or seventh time round. He could have said he had resolved to be less selfish. To go into therapy for his unresolved childhood issues. To understand why he was stuck in the permanent regression of a toddler tantrum. This is the normal stuff of near-death experiences. But Boris can’t handle anything too real, so instead he merely said he had come to the conclusion that too many people were obese. Wowza! Something every doctor in the country has known for years. So would he be thinking of imposing a sugar tax? “Um... er …,” said Boris. Steady as she goes. But he could now do one press-up – sort of – though he was unable to explain why he had chosen to demonstrate this to journalists from the Mail on Sunday. And he’d had the £900k paint job on his toy plane. But then, there was no need, because the answer was self-evident. We have a prime minister who is having a midlife crisis in full view. Soon he will be stripped to the waist like Vladimir Putin. The rest of the interview passed in a series of gentle lobs that were patted gently across the net. Dominic Cummings was just a great bloke who only had the good of the nation at heart. Sure Boris had some regrets, but none that immediately came to mind. And he certainly had no misgivings about not being asked about his slavish devotion to Honest Bob Jenrick. He could get used to this morning show. Perhaps he could make it a monthly date? “Boris Johnson, thank you very much,” Aasmah signed off. As a station opener, it had been just about perfect. A chance for the prime minister to witter on about his building projects, but no real news lines or anything to frighten the horses. Aasmah, Stig and Boris all looked to the control booth, waiting for the thumbs up from Rupert Murdoch. After all, he had been everyone’s real boss for the past 20 minutes. • This article was amended on 1 July 2020. An earlier version said incorrectly that Boris Johnson had not appeared on Radio 4’s Today programme “for nearly two years”, when his last appearance was in October 2019."
2020-06-29T14:10:15Z,politics,Politics,How does David Frost's new job affect Brexit talks?,"Brexit negotiations have resumed in Brussels in an attempt to break the deadlock over four key issues: fisheries, fair competition in trade, governance and security. Talks started on Monday with a two-hour, face-to-face meeting between David Frost, the chief UK negotiator, and the EU’s Michel Barnier, the first since the Covid-19 outbreak halted talks in March. As Frost and his team of a dozen-plus negotiators headed to Brussels by train on Sunday, it was being revealed that Boris Johnson had given him a new role (and a peerage) as his national security adviser. How does Frost’s appointment affect Brexit talks? The timing of Frost’s appointment could not have been more pointed. Although the vacancy has arisen because of the resignation of the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, on Sunday night, giving the post to someone who is leading arguably the most important international talks since the Iraq war in 2003 sends a strong message to Brussels that the UK is prepared to walk away if a deal cannot be struck in summer talks. Frost is due to take up his new role in September and this cuts perilously short the time in which to seal the comprehensive and ambitious deal Johnson claims he wants before the end of the Brexit transition period. The prime minister’s spokesman said on Monday Frost would not be replaced as chief negotiator but said he would continue to lead the negotiating team even after his appointment as security adviser. Many will be concerned that such double-jobbing will compromise his capacity for his Brexit role but he has the full support of Johnson, who describes him as a “serious diplomat, policy thinker and negotiator”. What is the remaining timetable for Brexit talks? This week is one of six rounds of week-long talks, five between now and the end of July, with the final round scheduled for 17 August. On the agenda are governance, fisheries, level playing field, trade in goods, trade in services, criminal law and judicial cooperation, energy and transport, participation in EU programmes such as science research, and continued mobility of social benefits for EU citizens in the UK and British citizens in the EU. What are the chances of a deal? Both sides have expressed the real prospect of no deal. Johnson said this month he wanted to see an outline of a deal emerge from the July talks while the European parliament president, David Sassoli, last week said the EU had been left concerned at the end of a video conference with Johnson two weeks ago over the lack of “enthusiasm” the prime minister seemed to have to find common ground on the most contentious issues. What are the main issues? The two sides remain fundamentally divided on the four key issues stated above but notably on the role of the European court of justice in dispute resolution and governance. Frost has said there can be “no halfway house” on the role of the ECJ or other EU institutions. The Cambridge law professor Catherine Barnard, an expert on EU law, recently told a government select committee it was “quite difficult to find a really good landing zone” here and not just because the UK objects to the ECJ. The problem is that what both sides will be striving to adjudicate are breaches of an international treaty rather than company contracts, meaning disputes over the Brexit deal “will be state to state rather than private party to private party”, she said. What about security and defence? Given that Frost’s new job will be to advise the government on this issue, it is ironic that this is the one topic the UK has decided not to engage in any negotiations although it can be argued that defence can be driven by events such as war and other platforms such as Nato. However, concerns have been raised over weaker security ties, on extradition, and on Britain’s desire to have continued access to real-time passenger records for counter-terror responses without conditions. Is there any hope? Yes. It is hoped that five weeks of face-to-face meetings might yield results as they allow more nuanced discussions in informal meeting in corridors and over dinners. This week’s meeting is restricted to about 16 people from each side compared with 100 in previous rounds, allowing for further frank discussion."
2020-06-29T13:26:09Z,politics,Politics,"Replacement of Sedwill with Frost 'highly unusual', says Labour","Labour has criticised what it called the government’s “highly unusual” decision to replace Sir Mark Sedwill as national security adviser with a political appointee who has little direct experience of the role, before a parliamentary question on the issue. After a series of former top officials condemned Sedwill’s departure as a sign the government was undermining the impartiality of the civil service, Labour secured an urgent question on the choice of a new national security adviser. Sedwill holds that role, as well as being cabinet secretary, the most senior post in the civil service, but will stand down from both jobs during the summer, following weeks of briefings targeting him. The search for a new cabinet secretary will begin next month. But Boris Johnson has already said the new national security adviser will be David Frost, who is currently the government’s chief Brexit negotiator with the EU. While he was formerly a long-serving diplomat, Frost has little direct experience of security matters. Also, unlike Sedwill and all other national security advisers since the role was created in 2010, Frost is not a civil servant but a political appointee. Gus O’Donnell, a former cabinet secretary, warned on Monday that political appointees were “more likely to be yes men”, telling the BBC: “I’m worried about the appointment of David Frost as national security adviser because I’m not quite sure how putting a special adviser in that role works.” Frost will also be made a peer. On Monday, Downing Street was unable to say whether he would take the Conservative whip or speak in the Lords. Nick Thomas-Symonds, Labour’s shadow home secretary, has secured an urgent question in the Commons on Tuesday about Frost’s appointment. He said: “We are in the midst of an unprecedented international crisis. It is highly unusual for the government to have proceeded in this manner, seeming to rush through a political appointment to a critically important role that needs to provide impartial expert advice. “There are a number of vital questions that must be answered, such as what criteria were used to select a candidate, and what process was followed when the appointment was made.” Downing Street rejected the charge that Sedwill had been forced out after two years in the twin jobs by Johnson and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings. Johnson’s spokesman denied Frost had been selected mainly because he would be loyal to the PM. “No, absolutely not,” he said.
Asked about Frost’s political status, the spokesman likened the choice to that made in places such as the US: “It is not unusual in other countries – ambassadors serve as national security advisers and ambassadors can be political appointees. David Frost has the status of an ambassador.” On the timing of Sedwill’s departure, he said the response to coronavirus was now reaching the phase of “domestic and global recovery and renewal”, and that Johnson needed a cabinet secretary and national security adviser “who can see him through the rest of this parliament”. But writing in the Guardian, Bob Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, said the practice of governments briefing against officials was “cowardly, unfair and undermining”. Kerslake added: “Ultimately everyone knows where such malicious briefings come from and it is within the prime minister’s powers to stop them.”
Speaking during a visit to a school in London, Johnson sought to distance himself from the briefing against Sedwill, saying: “There is an awful lot of stuff that comes out in the papers to which I wouldn’t automatically attach the utmost credence.” Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, told Sky it was “obvious” Johnson wanted to oust Sedwill: “Why you do so in the middle of a pandemic and a crisis instead of actually focusing on the crisis, is a question the prime minister needs to answer.” There was also some Conservative disquiet about the decision. The senior Tory backbencher George Freeman tweeted that it made sense to split Sedwill’s two roles, adding: “But a huge loss to lose Mark Sedwill who is an outstanding public servant & such a highly experienced Government official in midst of this crisis.” Frost will take up the new role in late August, meaning there is a new effective deadline for Brexit talks with the EU, which he leads, to have concluded by then or soon afterwards. Johnson’s spokesman said the UK had already been clear the talks “need to be concluded sooner rather than later”. The process of recruiting a new permanent secretary will start in early July, with applications to be invited from existing and former chief civil servants in departments, known as permanent secretaries."
2020-06-29T06:13:43Z,politics,Politics,Mark Sedwill to step down as UK's top civil servant,"Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK’s most senior civil servant, has announced he will stand down in September, prompting anger from former colleagues who say he has been unfairly smeared by Boris Johnson’s aides over the government’s coronavirus failings and for supposedly blocking changes in Whitehall. After weeks of tense negotiations over his job, Sedwill said in a letter to the prime minister that he would quit as cabinet secretary and head of the civil service. His other role as national security adviser will be taken by Johnson’s chief Brexit adviser, David Frost. His departure will be seen as a victory for Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s most senior aide, who has had a tense relationship with Sedwill, and Michael Gove, the cabinet minister who is pushing through a restructuring of government departments. Unnamed Downing Street sources told newspapers in March that Sedwill had failed to get a grip on the coronavirus crisis. Another source was quoted as saying that he had fallen out with Johnson and his aides over the response to Covid-19. In April, Cabinet Office insiders told the Guardian the claims were “shit-stirring” and “absolute crap”. As cabinet secretary, Sedwill was supposed to coordinate the work of permanent secretaries as they grappled with the lockdown, supplies of personal protective equipment, food supplies, prison releases and coronavirus tests. His resignation has been met with anger from former mandarins and comes weeks after other senior civil servants have either left their posts or are set to depart after the Conservatives’ election victory in December. Lord Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, said Sedwill’s departure followed unfair hostile briefings that attempted to blame civil servants for mistakes over coronavirus. “The recent hostile briefing against Sir Mark has been completely unacceptable and undermined a key role in government at a time of great national crisis. “I have great regard for Sir Mark and was responsible for the recruitment process that led to him becoming the permanent secretary at the Home Office. “I fear from some of the press briefing that had obviously gone on that the civil service is being made the fall guy for mistakes made in the handling of the pandemic. This is grossly unfair. We urgently need an independent inquiry to look at the lessons that can be learnt,” he said. Dave Penman, the head of the senior civil servants’ union, the FDA, said: “No 10 – or those around it – has sought to undermine Sir Mark and the leadership of the civil service with a series of anonymous briefings against him over many months. Not only is it a self-defeating and corrosive tactic, it’s also a cowardly one, safe in the knowledge that those who are briefed against are unable to publicly respond. “How would any potential candidate for cabinet secretary judge their prospective employers, given how the current cadre of leaders has been treated by them?” Fiona McLeod Hill, Theresa May’s former joint chief of staff, said: “This is a very sad day for the British government. I worked with Sir Mark closely for a number of years. He is exceptional. He also happens to be a very decent person. I remember how much he looked out for my former partner, Sir Charles Farr, who sadly passed away last year. I will always be grateful to him for that.” The appointment of Frost will also cause controversy, especially among security officials who may well question why a special adviser with no experience of national security has been appointed to the crucial role usually reserved for experienced hands with knowledge of MI6 and MI5. Known as “Frosty” among Johnson’s inner circle of advisers, he will also receive a peerage, it was announced on Sunday. Lord Ricketts, a former national security adviser, said that Frost’s apparent political appointment will radically change a role usually occupied by civil servants. “That completely changes the nature of the role, no longer a politically-neutral civil servant giving dispassionate advice. Plus he is made a peer, so will he be a minister accountable to parliament?” he wrote on Twitter. Sedwill’s exit from No 10 is likely to be part of a wider shake-up of top jobs across the civil service overseen by Cummings and Gove. Sir Philip Rutnam, a former permanent secretary at the Home Office, is suing for unfair dismissal after quitting in February, and Sir Simon McDonald, the permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, is leaving in September following its merger with the Department for International Development. After he leaves government service in September, Sedwill will be made a peer and will chair a panel on global economic security when the UK assumes the presidency of the G7 economic group of nations. He is also expected to take up another security-related role. In an exchange of letters, Sedwill said he had served both Johnson and his predecessor May in “extraordinary times”. “Two years ago, when my predecessor fell ill, your predecessor asked me to step in as cabinet secretary, and you asked me to continue to support you through Brexit and the election period,” he wrote. “It was obviously right to stay on for the acute phase of the Covid-19 crisis. As you are setting out this week, the government’s focus is now shifting to domestic and global recovery and renewal.” Johnson replied that Sedwill had made a “massive contribution” to public life over the past 30 years and had been a source of “shrewd advice”. “You have done it all in Whitehall: from Afghanistan to the modernisation of the civil service; from immigration policy to Brexit and defeating coronavirus,” he said. Sedwill, 55, the cabinet secretary since 2018 and national security adviser since 2017, has told friends he has been angered by negative briefings over many months. Sedwill, who attended cabinet and Cobra meetings, fell ill with the virus soon after Johnson, Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, and Matt Hancock, the health secretary. He informed the cabinet when the prime minister was moved to an intensive care unit. Whitehall officials said several candidates were being mooted to replace him, among them Tim Barrow, the UK’s ambassador to the EU. Occasionally abrupt, Sedwill made enemies in government. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, was sacked from his previous job as defence secretary after Sedwill led an investigation into a leak from the National Security Council and concluded Williamson was the source. Some senior civil servants have claimed he has failed to back Rutnam in the ongoing row over allegations that the home secretary, Priti Patel, bullied staff. Sedwill was born and grew up in Lincolnshire, attending Bourne grammar school. He studied international economics at the University of St Andrews and has a master’s in economics from St Edmund Hall, Oxford. After joining the Foreign Office in 1989, he had postings in Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq and Pakistan. Patel said on Sunday that significant Whitehall changes would soon begin. “This is the people’s government, delivering on the people’s priorities, and effectively any reforming government will be based around the type of delivery that our prime minister wants to drive for our great country and obviously have the right kind of support around him to deliver that,” she told Sky News. Gove set out his manifesto for reforming the civil service on Saturday in a lecture titled The Privilege of Public Service. The Cabinet Office minister said the “metropolitan” outlook of decision-makers had contributed to the government becoming “estranged” from the people."
2020-06-28T19:57:30Z,politics,Politics,Relationship between No 10 and Mark Sedwill was no longer tenable,"While Mark Sedwill may have been Theresa May’s “first and only choice” for the head of the civil service for his star quality and decades of experience, the so-called “securocrat” failed to hit the mark with Boris Johnson. Rumours of rifts between him and senior No 10 staff over the handling of coronavirus have dogged Westminster for weeks with accusations he has not taken command, although in reality Sedwill may never have quite recovered from his public warning that a no-deal Brexit would be a dire outcome for the UK. With some of Johnson’s most senior allies from the Vote Leave camp running Downing Street, it is likely he was viewed as a remainer at heart with the potential to obstruct the prime minister’s path. The wording of his resignation letter to Boris Johnson that “we have agreed I will stand down” speaks volumes of a dysfunctional relationship that was no longer tenable. Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is also well known to harbour less than complimentary views on Whitehall mandarins, preferring the talents of scientists, data analysts and physicists rather than civil service lifers. Cummings is reported to have warned just last week that a “hard rain” would soon fall on the civil service. If this move has been prompted by Cummings then it does much to re-establish his power base within Downing Street after it briefly looked on shaky ground when he incensed the nation by travelling to County Durham during lockdown.
The scene was also set for impending change within Whitehall when senior cabinet minister Michael Gove said in a speech on Saturday, he attacked “group think” within the civil service. There is no doubt that Sedwill wielded significant control. Not only was he cabinet secretary but he also occupied the role of national security adviser, an unusual arrangement that May preferred but which some felt did not provide enough variety of opinion at the very top of government. Wherever Johnson turned, he would have been within his orbit of decision-making. The fact the national security post has been immediately filled by David Frost, Johnson’s Brexit aide and a political appointment who is not a member of the civil service, shows that the prime minister perhaps feels more comfortable with a true Brexiter providing support on global relations and security. Sedwill was born and grew up in Lincolnshire, attending Bourne grammar school. He studied international economics at the University of St Andrews and has a masters in economics from St Edmund Hall, Oxford. After joining the Foreign Office in 1989, he had postings in Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq and Pakistan. With a CV suggesting connections with MI5 and MI6, Sedwill has been portrayed as a spook happier in the company of spies and soldiers rather than with those who want to wield a political axe. With the current occupant of Downing Street and Cummings both being uniquely fearless in proposing radical changes to Whitehall, and with the overarching principle of this government still being “getting Brexit done”, Sedwill’s presence has ultimately proved incompatible."
2020-06-28T17:51:40Z,politics,Politics,Virility test: Boris's press-up charm offensive falls flat,"It was a tough gig for Boris Johnson in his weekend media round, as he sought to persuade an anxious public that he was both as “fit as a butcher’s dog” and a hands-on father to a new baby. He might have fared better if he were more evolved as a man; as it is, he plainly equates parenting with femininity and strength with masculinity. And so, dancing between these polar opposites, it came to pass that he did an atrocious job of describing both. His involvement with his baby sounded just plain weird (“I’m both present and involved in a detailed way,” he declared, like someone who’s just been busted sleeping on a conference call). His athleticism was displayed mainly in the accompanying photographs, and that was his undoing.
Men – no offence – are obsessed with press-ups as an indicator of virility; it’s weird because so many things are harder (planks, pull-ups), but I believe it originated with Charles Bronson’s prison workouts, so that’s fine. It’s absolutely fine for a prime minister to be wooing national opinion by aping the self-fashioning of Britain’s most notorious armed robber. Nothing weird about 2020 whatsoever. It’s not the best example of the home exercise genre: for starters, he appears to be doing it in full office wear, complete with a tie. Nobody wants to be an athleisure nazi, but there is a foundational purpose to fitness wear, viz, it is breathable and moves with your body. He has a slight cat’s back posture, which if he were to attempt a real push-up in it, would lead to a lower-back injury pretty soon. And – making allowances for the completely inappropriate clothing, which makes his body rather illegible – his stance overall looks sloppy and shambolic, a hairs’ breadth from collapsing in a heap. Look at the way his head disappears, exhausted, begging for the sweet relief of gravity.
Many were discomfited by the image being so reminiscent of Putin, famously photographed on a horse, or with a leopard cub, or in an icy spring. The parallel should, above all, make us grateful that Johnson isn’t bare chested, which would be a truly chilling authoritarian display. Nevertheless, to see a prime minister wage a charm offensive using his biceps would be unfamiliar and chilling, even if he were using them correctly."
2020-06-28T16:56:49Z,politics,Politics,Jewish groups and MPs condemn Nigel Farage over antisemitic 'dog whistles',"Nigel Farage has been condemned by the UK’s main Jewish groups and MPs for repeatedly using language and themes associated with far-right antisemitic conspiracy theories, something for which he has been previously criticised. The Board of Deputies of British Jews said Farage’s airing of claims about plots to undermine national governments, and his references to Goldman Sachs and the financier George Soros, showed he was seeking to “trade in dog whistles”. The Brexit party leader, who has been criticised for agreeing to interviews with openly antisemitic US media personalities, was also condemned by the MPs who co-chair the all-party group against antisemitism. Much of Farage’s most recent use of such themes has been connected to the Black Lives Matter protests, and his belief that dissenting voices are being silenced. In a tweeted video message this month, Farage said the UK faced “cultural Marxism”, a term originating in a conspiracy theory based on a supposed plot against national governments, which is closely linked to the far right and antisemitism. In the same message, Farage said companies who pulled TV adverts from rightwing TV shows were being pressured by “Soros-funded organisations”. George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist and campaigner, is a regular target for antisemitic conspiracy theories. Farage had made the same claim about Soros three days earlier in an interview with the far-right news website Breitbart. In a recent opinion piece for the Newsweek website, Farage talked about “unelected globalists shaping the public’s lives based on secret recommendations from the big banks”. Goldman Sachs was the only bank he mentioned by name, echoing another common theme from far-right antisemitism. Writing in a separate Newsweek column, Farage said Black Lives Matter was made up of radical socialists trying to destroy nationalism, “oftentimes funded by globalists”, another term linked to such ideas. Amanda Bowman, vice-president of the Board of Deputies, said: “If Nigel Farage continues to trade in dog whistles and tropes about George Soros and Goldman Sachs, his decline into obscurity will continue apace. Mr Farage would do well to remember that this proud country has always rejected this sort of prejudice and fought wars to defeat it.” The Community Security Trust, a charity that works for the safety of Jewish people in the UK, said in a statement: “This is not the first time that Nigel Farage has used language that evokes antisemitic conspiracy codewords, but the deeper problem is that this search for scapegoats will keep requiring new enemies and new excuses, moving the national debate into more polarising and dangerous places.” Andrew Percy, the Conservative MP who co-chairs the all-party group on antisemitism, said Farage’s tendency of “simplifying everything into a grand conspiracy theory” risked spilling into racism. “These conspiracy theories have real world and dangerous consequences and are without question antisemitic,” he said. “So now he is being put on notice. Farage needs to cut it out before he causes further harm by providing further fuel to racist antisemitic tropes and conspiracy theories.” Labour MP Catherine McKinnell, the group’s other co-chair, said Farage was “like a bad salesman, peddling distrust and fear that someone is out to get us”. She said: “Talk of shadow cabals, Soros conspiracies and other nonsense has repeatedly been proven to find its roots in anti-Jewish racism. His choice of language, which echoes some of that circulating amongst the far-right online, is worrying and getting worse.” Farage’s representatives and the Brexit party were contacted for comment. A spokesman for Farage has condemned previous criticism of his language by Jewish groups and others as “pathetic” and “a manufactured story”. Farage has previously aired beliefs associated with antisemitism in a series of interviews with the far-right US conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones, and has called Soros “the biggest danger to the entire western world”. He outlined similar themes in an interview with Revelation TV, a tiny UK evangelical Christian TV channel. He was also interviewed at least six times by Rick Wiles, a far-right, antisemitic US pastor who subsequently used his web radio show to claim Donald Trump’s impeachment was a “Jew coup”. Farage remains leader of the Brexit party, which has largely halted its activities since December’s general election, although it could re-emerge if Boris Johnson extends the Brexit transition period. His parallel career as a media personality suffered a blow this month when he lost his show on radio station LBC. Farage has recently sought to establish himself as a web-based media commentator, making videos about the arrival of migrants in boats across the Channel. Farage’s representatives did not respond to a request for comment."
2020-06-28T16:00:09Z,politics,Politics,Revealed: Developers PM backed when London mayor give almost £1m to Tories,"Property developers connected to major construction projects approved by Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London have donated almost £1m to the Conservative party over the past year, the Guardian can reveal. Analysis of public records shows a significant cash injection from property tycoons linked to developments, including blocks of luxury flats with no affordable housing, which were signed off by Johnson and his deputy, Sir Edward Lister, who oversaw planning. Richard Desmond, the former owner of the Daily Express, is among the donors, along with the billionaire Reuben family and the Mayfair-based property firm Delancey owned by Eton-educated Jamie Ritblat. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing, but the fallout over a decision by the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, to approve Desmond’s controversial £1bn development in east London has attracted scrutiny of the relationship between wealthy property developers and senior Tories.
Details of the donations have emerged as both Johnson and Lister, now a senior Downing Street adviser who is reportedly in the running for a peerage, face questions about their ties to Desmond amid “cash for favours” allegations. Downing Street has refused to disclose Johnson’s contact with Desmond since becoming prime minister after it emerged the tycoon had donated £12,000 to the Tories, two weeks after Jenrick approved his proposed development. Jenrick has since reversed his decision after conceding it was “unlawful by reason of apparent bias”. Desmond has said the donation was too small to be significant. A spokesperson for the Conservatives insisted all donations were transparently declared and complied fully with the law. A Downing Street spokesman said all planning decisions by Johnson and Lister “were made with due process and a fair hearing in line with public law principles” and “any of suggestion of improper conduct is untrue”. “Party political matters are never a material consideration in planning,” he said.
City Hall originally approved Desmond’s proposed development on the Isle of Dogs in May 2016 after Johnson took control of the application, which Tower Hamlets council had rejected. Applications for the other developments connected to the latest crop of Tory donors were not formally taken over by the mayor, but proposals were referred to City Hall by local planning authorities for his approval. In April 2016, for example, Lister signed off on the redevelopment of Millbank Tower in Westminster, backed by David and Simon Reuben. The brothers, who made much of their fortune trading metals before building a property empire, are the second richest family in the UK with an estimated £16bn fortune, according to the Sunday Times. In November 2019, shortly before the general election, the Conservatives received £200,000 from a company co-owned by the brothers, European Land & Property, latest Electoral Commission data shows. The company was behind a separate development in Paddington, a 34-storey tower offering “the height of luxury living” that Lister progressed in 2011.
David Reuben’s son Jamie Reuben who is involved with the brothers’ business affairs, donated around £580,000 to the Tories between October 2019 and March 2020. A spokesman for the Reuben family said the brothers did not discuss either application with Johnson or Lister. The family’s donations “were made long after planning decisions had been made and were completely unrelated to them”, he said. The Electoral Commission data also shows Ritblat’s Delancey donated £100,000 to the Tories in December. Ritblat is the son of another high-profile property magnate, Sir John Ritblat. Delancey held several meetings with Johnson’s City Hall over a range of developments. The firm and its partners, Qatari Diar, bought the former Olympic athletes’ village in Stratford in 2011 as part of a reported £500m deal that Johnson championed. Lister signed off on Delancey’s plans for the former Olympic media centre in 2014. Internal emails obtained by the Guardian through a freedom of information request show Delancey met Lister a number of times to discuss their projects, including the Elephant and Castle shopping centre. In September 2013, two days after a dinner with Delancey, Lister set up a meeting between officials and senior executives at the firm to provide it with reassurance about the tube station at the site, the emails show. “I have agreed a meeting in two weeks’ time to try and push them to make the commitment!” Lister wrote. “This will be good news if we can pull it off.”
Three months later, Delancey and its investment partners completed a deal to acquire the shopping centre. The scheme, which has received significant opposition from local businesses and residents, was eventually signed off by the current mayor, Sadiq Khan, in 2018. A lawyer for Delancey said there was “no connection whatsoever” between any decision taken by City Hall and the company’s recent donation. He said there was nothing improper about any of the company’s interactions with the Greater London Authority. He insisted discussions with planners were in line with normal practice for any developer considering a major regeneration project. Irrespective of the political affiliations of the mayor “it is incumbent upon Delancey to deal with and have a working relationship with whoever is in office”, he said. Asked whether Ritblat had spoken to Lister since he entered Downing Street, the lawyer said: “Jamie Ritblat has spoken to Sir Edward a number of times during lockdown. He was asked to provide Sir Edward with some practical insight into the issues facing the real estate market in light of government lockdown because of the current pandemic.” Other developments Johnson gave the green light to include 22 Bishopsgate, a skyscraper in the City of London developed by a property business co-owned by Sir Stuart Lipton. Lipton donated £8,500 to the Tories in January. A spokesman for Lipton said the donation was “made entirely in a personal capacity and had nothing to do with his wider business interests”. Separately, the data also shows a return to political giving by Nick Candy, one of the wealthy Candy brothers, who contributed £100,000 to Tory coffers in March 2020. The Candy brothers have worked together in London’s high-end property market for decades.
A spokeswoman for Nick Candy said, however, that contrary to reports in 2013 he was not involved in a proposed luxury development near the Tower of London that Johnson had signed off in May 2013. She said SQ Guernsey, the company which bought the site for £34m, was a subsidiary of CPC Group which is 100% owned by Christian Candy, and that “any suggestion that Nick Candy has anything to do with the Sugar Quay project, despite previous media reports, is false”. She also said: “It is entirely false to state Nick Candy’s donation to the Conservative party in March 2020 was in any way connected to City Hall’s planning approval for Sugar Quay over seven years ago, or that it was connected to any other development project that was granted planning permission while Mr Johnson was mayor of London.”"
2020-06-28T15:08:14Z,politics,Politics,Ed Miliband: Starmer was right to sack Rebecca Long-Bailey,"Ed Miliband has become the latest senior shadow cabinet figure to back the firing of Rebecca Long-Bailey from Labour’s frontbench for sharing what he deemed to be an antisemitic conspiracy theory. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, sacked his shadow education secretary and Jeremy Corbyn supporter after she commented on an interview with the actor Maxine Peake. Following the death of George Floyd, Peake claimed Israeli forces had taught Americans how to restrain people with a knee on the neck. Long-Bailey’s sacking has ignited a vicious online row within the party. The general secretary of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, said it was an overreaction in a “confected row” and risked disuniting the party. The Momentum campaign group boss, Jon Lansman, who is Jewish, said he did not believe the remark by Peake was antisemitic. Peake later said she was sorry for being inaccurate. Long-Bailey, who ran as Corbyn’s heir in the leadership election, said she had not endorsed all parts of the article and had shared it because it was about the Tory response to coronavirus. Miliband, the shadow business secretary and a former party leader, said Long-Bailey was a decent person and not antisemitic but that Starmer was right to sack her. The reason the Maxine Peake interview was a problem “is not that it had a criticism of the state of Israel. I’m a big critic of what the Israeli government has done on a number of occasions. It was that it was a false criticism of the state of Israel, or rather the Israeli Defence Force, linked to the death of George Floyd, wrongly, saying that somehow tactics that killed George Floyd were linked to the Israelis,” Miliband told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show. “The problem is that over the centuries when calamitous things have happened, Jews have been blamed. That’s why there’s an antisemitism issue in relation to this and that’s why I believe Keir took the right decision. I think she made a significant error of judgment.” He said the move indicated Starmer was determined to get on top of the issue of antisemitism within Labour and it could not become a discussion point at the next general election. There have, however, been claims from those who backed Long-Bailey for the leadership that it was a factional move, and some members have threatened to quit the party. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, defended Starmer’s move. The Stalybridge and Hyde MP told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show that the sharing of an antisemitic conspiracy theory was not something that could be ignored. “We deserve no more chances with the Jewish community to win back the trust that has been lost,” he said. “Keir promised zero tolerance and that has to mean zero tolerance. And I’m afraid for that reason that change had to be made.” He said he worried deeply that people were still unable to understand why an article like that might have been offensive to Jewish people. “Throughout time there has been an antisemitism that has been about blaming Jewish people for all the problems in the world. A modern incarnation of that is replacing Jews with Israel,” he said. “If someone is looking at the terrible scenes in America and somehow trying to change the blame to Israel, the antisemitic warning lights should be flashing to anyone who sees that in print or hears something like that.”"
2020-06-28T14:59:48Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel backs Robert Jenrick over 'cash for favours' scandal,"The home secretary, Priti Patel, has become the latest senior Conservative to rally behind the housing minister, Robert Jenrick, claiming he was “transparent” in his involvement in the planning application of a Tory donor’s billion-pound housing scheme. The “cash for favours” scandal surrounding Jenrick shows no sign of abating after the Sunday Times reported a whistleblower as saying that officials had apparently begged him not to give donor Richard Desmond’s Westferry Printworks development in east London the go-ahead. Patel, like the prime minister, said the case was now considered closed. She told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: “The correspondence, the documentation is out in the public domain on this particular application – and rightly so. It is a significant decision, a significant application. “The papers have been published. The secretary of state has followed all issues around transparency.” Plans for 1,500 homes in the Isle of Dogs proposed by former Daily Express owner Desmond were recommended for refusal by the Tower Hamlets local authority. Jenrick overruled the decision and granted permission for the scheme in January. Emails between civil servants were released this week by the housing secretary after pressure from Labour, and suggest that Jenrick was “insistent” the decision was passed in time for Desmond to avoid a £45m community levy to the borough. Desmond later donated £12,000 to the party. Jenrick has consistently denied wrongdoing and removed his approval for the scheme over “apparent bias” last month. Patel insisted that the case has been been “discussed in parliament a number of times” and that all questions had been answered. “It is through that matter of transparency that the matter is now deemed to be closed,” she said. The cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, responded to the Labour party last week by letter, explaining that no action would be taken as the prime minister considered the matter finished with. Labour’s shadow housing secretary, Steve Reed, led calls for Jenrick to turn over departmental correspondence on the issue and attempted to force him to do so by holding a Commons vote. The heavily redacted papers were released beforehand. Following Patel’s interview, Reed tweeted that Jenrick had not been fully transparent and had “held back documents showing what advice officials gave and his WhatsApp discussions”. He added: “This case won’t go away until Jenrick comes clean.”"
2020-06-28T07:49:25Z,politics,Politics,"'What we've learned about Starmer is, if you pick a fight with him, you'll lose'","It is often said that new political leaders have defining moments when they show their steel and stamp authority on their parties. Neil Kinnock’s epic confrontations with the Militant tendency in the 1980s were seen as the battles that won him his spurs, although he was ultimately unsuccessful in his efforts to make Labour electable. For Tony Blair, the decision to ditch clause IV in 1995 showcased New Labour as a force on the political centre ground, one that would go on to win three successive general elections. This weekend a question many MPs are asking is whether Keir Starmer’s brutal sacking on Thursday of Rebecca Long-Bailey, the standard bearer of the Corbynite left in the shadow cabinet, could go down as a defining act of his leadership. Could it be the moment when the brilliant lawyer became the ruthless potential prime minister capable of inspiring fear as well as respect, and of challenging the Tories at the next election? Or alternatively could it prove to be a moment when he split the party, angered much of the membership built up under Corbyn, and destroyed the very unity needed to take Labour forward? Starmer’s people insist that the dismissal of Long-Bailey was nothing to do with any pre-ordained strategy or desire to purge the left. Nothing could be further from the truth, they say. “It was simply a matter of her defying his authority when he had been crystal clear about his determination to root out antisemitism. He likes Becky and had worked well with her. He was not trying to get rid of her,” said one senior party source. Long-Bailey was initially at fault, Starmer’s people say, when she overhastily shared on Twitter an article by the actress Maxine Peake in which Peake said that American police officers had learned tactics used in the incident that killed George Floyd in the US, including kneeling on people’s necks, from Israeli spies. The claims, denied by Israeli police, offended many in the Jewish community who regarded them as antisemitic and offensive. But worse was Long-Bailey’s subsequent refusal to delete the tweet when asked to do so by a senior official from Starmer’s office on the explicit instructions of the leader.
Starmer was on a visit to Stevenage when an aide showed him Long-Bailey’s original tweet, to which she added the comment “Maxine Peake is an absolute diamond”. A senior Labour official said: “Keir’s reaction was that she needs to delete it and she needs to apologise. There were multiple conversations with Becky but she refused to do it. She wouldn’t delete it. She basically thought it would look worse to delete it.” Starmer regarded Peake’s claim, for which the actress later apologised, as an “antisemitic conspiracy theory”. Instead of doing as Starmer ordered, Long-Bailey merely put out a new post saying her sharing of Peake’s article “wasn’t intended to be an endorsement of all of the article”. Some on the left took to Twitter to accuse her of backtracking and friends say she then felt boxed in and was even more determined not to apologise, for fear of further angering the left. She then failed to answer her phone for four hours as Starmer’s office desperately tried to get in touch to insist again that she remove the tweet. Once back in London Starmer did manage to contact her and told her: “I am going to have to stand you down.” Some in the Labour party suspect that Long-Bailey, more than Starmer, was looking for a confrontation, though her allies strongly dispute this. One of Starmer’s supporters noted how quickly leftwing MPs and union leaders came out in a chorus of outrage and treated her as a martyr. “The [socialist] Campaign Group roared into action pretty quickly around her. That was very noticeable,” one said. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, condemned Starmer’s action as “an unnecessary over-reaction to a confected row”, adding that “unity is too important to be risked like this”. The founder of Momentum, Jon Lansman, called the sacking “reckless”, while former shadow chancellor John McDonnell also registered his disgust and appeared to encourage the left to rally around against Starmer. While Starmer may not have wanted to be rid of Long-Bailey, plenty of Labour moderates believe the events of Thursday can only have done the new leader good. A Labour frontbencher said: “The public will see the contrast with the way Boris Johnson refused to sack Dominic Cummings and how he is hanging on to Robert Jenrick [the housing secretary accused of favouring Tory donor Richard Desmond in a planning case]. It is not a left versus right issue for Keir, it is one of leadership.” A senior Labour MP pointed out that Long-Bailey and the left had, unfortunately for them, picked a fight over a claim for which the author had gone on to apologise. “The hill that they decided to fight on and to die on has disappeared,” he said. Certainly the latest Opinium poll for the Observer – conducted on Thursday and Friday – suggests the incident has done Starmer no harm at all. For the first time since he became leader, Starmer is ahead of Johnson when people are asked who they think would make the best prime minister: 37% favour Starmer against 35% for Johnson. Starmer is also soaring ahead of Johnson in net approval ratings. The Labour leader stands on +27%, up from +22% a week ago while Johnson is on -7%, down from -5%. On Monday Labour’s new general secretary, David Evans, who worked for the party under Tony Blair between 1999 and 2001, and helped it win the 2001 election, takes the reins at party headquarters, succeeding Jennie Formby, who was a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn. His appointment will be watched very closely by all sides of the party. When he was chosen recently, a leftwing figure on the national executive committee said party members who joined under Corbyn “won’t forgive them if they allow a hard right general secretary to wage factional warfare”. One of Evans’s first tasks will be to organise Labour’s response to an investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into antisemitism in the party, due to be published soon. Starmer has already committed to accepting its findings and setting up an independent complaints process, but how the party deals with the moment will be telling. The left fears the party will be severely criticised for failing to tackle antisemitism complaints, particularly under Corbyn’s leadership, and that he and his team will be left to take the lion’s share of the blame. As shown by the dismissal of Long-Bailey – now replaced by Kate Green – Starmer’s leadership cannot yet emerge from the shadow that antisemitism has cast over the party. But after last week, one thing is now much clearer about the way Starmer will proceed. As one Labour frontbencher put it yesterday: “What we have learned in the last 48 hours is that Keir Starmer is not just a lawyer. He is ruthless too. He will act firmly. If you pick a fight with him you will lose.”"
2020-06-28T07:01:24Z,politics,Politics,The UK social media platform where neo-Nazis can view terror atrocities,"A UK-registered technology company with British directors is behind a global platform used by neo-Nazis to upload footage of racist killings. BitChute, which was used in the dissemination of far-right propaganda during the protests in London and elsewhere this month, has hosted films of terror attacks and thousands of antisemitic videos which have been viewed over three million times. The platform has also hosted several videos from the proscribed far-right terrorist group National Action, now taken down. Concerns about BitChute have been flagged in a new report, Hate Fuel: The hidden online world fuelling far right terror, produced by the Community Security Trust (CST), a charity set up to combat antisemitism. In response to the report, the company, based in Newbury, Berkshire, said in a tweet that it blocks “any such videos, including incitement to violence”. But the platform was still showing the full footage of the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings and an attack on a German synagogue until the Observer brought the videos to its attention. The far-right activist Tommy Robinson has a channel on BitChute with more than 25,000 subscribers. When far-right protesters recently descended on London and several other cities, BitChute’s comment facility carried numerous racist postings on Robinson’s channel, many of them making derogatory claims about George Floyd, whose death after being restrained by police in the US city of Minneapolis has sparked worldwide protests.
“Extremists know that they can post anything on BitChute and it won’t be removed by the platform unless they are forced to do so,” said Dave Rich, director of policy at the CST. “Some of the terrorist videos we found on BitChute had been on the site for over a year and had been watched tens of thousands of times.” He added: “It’s no surprise, therefore, that the website is a cesspit of vile racist, antisemitic neo-Nazi videos and comments. This is why there need to be legal consequences for website hosts who refuse to take responsibility for moderating and blocking this content themselves.” BitChute is one of several platforms alarming those who monitor the far right. Another, Gab, created in 2016, has a dedicated network of British users called “Britfam” that has 4,000 members and which far-right extremists use to circulate racism, antisemitism and Holocaust denial.
Last week the chief executive of Gab, Andrew Torba, sent an email to users attacking what he alleged was the “anti-white, anti-Trump and anti-conservative bias” on more mainstream social media platforms. Torba wrote: “If you are a conservative. If you are straight. If you are white. If you are a Christian: you should not be on Facebook, Twitter, or any other Big Tech product. Please understand: you are the enemy to these people. They hate you. They literally believe that you are a terrorist for wearing a Maga [Make America Great Again] hat. This isn’t hyperbole.’ CST analysis found that the messaging service Telegram hosts images and posts celebrating the British terrorists Thomas Mair and David Copeland, and other far-right terrorists. Billing itself as an alternative to Twitter, Parler is another social media platform rapidly gaining popularity, which describes itself as “a non-biased free-speech driven entity”. Though not included in the CST report, it is increasingly synonymous with the alt-right. The political commentator Katie Hopkins moved to Parler after being permanently suspended from Twitter on 19 June for contravening its ban on “hateful content”. Within a week Hopkins had already accrued 215,000 of the platform’s 1.2 million users. Extremism experts caution that deplatforming such individuals is akin to “whack-a-mole” in the sense that removing them from one platform often drives them to less regulated social media sites. Frequently a person suspended from a major social media platform such as Facebook or Twitter gravitates on to smaller platforms that tolerate more extreme content and offer a licence to spread more toxic narratives and use increasingly inflammatory language. On Saturday Hopkins used Parler to call on the government to “stop the invasion” when referring to small boat crossings of migrants. Many of these newer platforms promote conspiracy theories about Jews and other minorities, according to the CST. A familiar trope is the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, which alleges that Jewish organisations and synagogues are using mass immigration to undermine white western nations. The CST analysis suggests that the filming and livestreaming of terrorist attacks has become an integral part of far-right planning, and successful perpetrators are celebrated and glorified via striking imagery and memes.
The authors of Hate Fuel say: “Our report shows how a global movement of violent neo-Nazis uses social media to incite hatred, celebrate murder and turn terrorists into heroes. Far-right terrorism poses an urgent and lethal threat to Jews and other minority communities, and it is fuelled by a vast amount of online incitement hosted on websites that don’t seem to care. We need a global effort by governments, law enforcement and the tech industry, similar to their previous response to Isis propaganda, to turn this around.” Ray Vahey, founder and chief executive of BitChute, defended the platform. “BitChute is a startup that’s growing fast in a market that has been monopolised by YouTube,” he said. “It’s very challenging, but we are having an impact and it’s vital to consumers that companies like ours bring much-needed competition to a market like this. “One of the difficult challenges is moderation and this has been the case for Google as well. We continue to develop tools to ensure we can remove any content that does not meet our standards sooner.” BitChute said it had been in contact with UK counter-terrorism police and other organisations, who it believed could help it “improve our processes”. The platform said that while it shared the CST’s goal of reducing violence, deplatforming “the more extreme sides of the political spectrum” pushes “people to parts of the web where they could no longer experience a variety of viewpoints”. When asked if he seriously defended his platform streaming videos of terrorist atrocities, Vahey did not respond."
2020-06-27T21:01:28Z,politics,Politics,Starmer overtakes Johnson as preferred choice for prime minister,"Labour leader Keir Starmer has overtaken Boris Johnson as the public preferred choice for Prime Minister, according to the latest Opinium poll for The Observer. Starmer is preferred to lead the country by 37% of voters polled on Thursday and Friday last week, compared with 35% who say Johnson would be the best Prime Minister. While the Tories remain four points ahead of Starmer’s party on 43% to Labour’s 39%, the gap has closed from over 20% in February and early March when the Tories enjoyed a regular commanding lead as the country rallied behind the government, and Jeremy Corbyn was reaching the end of his time as Labour leader.
When asked about the relative performances of the government and Labour in reacting to the Covid-19 crisis, Starmer’s party stretched its lead by 9 points last week alone and now has a net approval rating of +13. This is the figure reached when the percentage of those who disapprove is subtracted from the percentage who approve. By contrast the Tory approval stands at -10, having been at +26 shortly after the full lockdown was announced by Johnson on March 23. After a week in which many people flocked to crowded beaches to enjoy the hot weather some 54% of people now think the UK is coming out of lockdown too fast, up from 46% last week. Meanwhile, most of the public (59%) continue to think testing levels for Covid-19 are insufficient. • This article was amended on 28 June 2020 because an earlier version said the Tories “remain four points ahead of [Labour] on 44%”, whereas the correct figure is 43%."
2020-06-27T16:16:23Z,politics,Politics,Robert Jenrick admits Israeli billionaire he had meeting with is family friend,"Labour has called on the beleaguered housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, to explain a ministerial meeting with a “family friend” who had a financial interest in the future of a rival mining project that Jenrick was overseeing. The Guardian revealed this week that Jenrick met the Israeli billionaire Idan Ofer while the then exchequer secretary to the Treasury was considering a request for financial support from Sirius Minerals for a mining project that would have rivalled Ofer’s own firm Cleveland Potash. A spokesperson for Jenrick said on Friday that Ofer was a “family friend” and that the minister had notified officials, who advised him to step back from the decision on Sirius. But the spokesperson did not say when Jenrick recused himself and the Guardian understands he retained oversight of Sirius’s request for support for at least six months after the meeting. Steve Reed, the shadow communities secretary, said: “Mr Jenrick must now tell us whether he declared his friendship with Mr Ofer to officials prior to the meeting, why he did not immediately step back from making the decision and what further discussions he had with Mr Ofer. “It’s time for some honesty. Mr Jenrick must come to the House of Commons to explain exactly what he’s been up to because the public are now worried that a new era of Tory sleaze has begun in earnest.” A spokesperson for Jenrick said: “Whilst exchequer secretary, Mr Jenrick met with a number of stakeholders to discuss electric vehicles and charge point technology. “This included a meeting with Mr Ofer, who has substantial experience in the industry. Officials from [the Treasury] attended those meetings and they were disclosed in his ministerial transparency data in the usual way.”
Earlier this week, Ofer told the Guardian he had met Jenrick to discuss the post-Brexit business climate. He said he could not recall if they had talked about the Sirius Minerals mining project, but that it would have been “touched on only briefly” if so. “Mr Jenrick recused himself from consideration of issues around Sirius Minerals,” the minister’s spokesperson said. “He did so before ministerial decisions were taken on the project, which I understand were taken after he had left HM Treasury in any case. Mr Ofer is a family friend. Mr Jenrick raised this with officials and voluntarily recused himself on their advice.” Labour has already reported Jenrick to parliament’s watchdog over separate claims about his relationship to the Conservative donor Richard Desmond while serving in his current role as housing secretary. Jenrick appeared to have acted “on direct instruction” from Desmond, Labour said, saving the property and media tycoon tens of millions of pounds on a £1bn property development in east London. The cabinet minister has so far had the support of Downing Street over his ties to Desmond but questions about his previous role at the Treasury will increase the pressure. As exchequer secretary, he presided over Sirius Minerals’ application for financial support for at least six months after meeting with Ofer, before handing responsibility for the project to Liz Truss in early 2019. In March 2019, one of Ofer’s other UK firms, the Mayfair-based Quantum Pacific UK Corporation, donated to the Conservative party for the first and only time, giving the party £10,000 in March 2019. Ofer has said the request for the donation came at the behest of Conservative Friends of Israel and was not discussed with Jenrick, who is a member of the group. Six months later, in September 2019, Sirius Minerals revealed that the government had refused to provide financial support, a decision that in effect left the company on the brink of financial collapse. Sirius was eventually bought out in a cut-price deal by the mining firm Anglo American in January 2020, wiping out the shareholdings of hundreds of small investors. Some lost most of their life savings because of the collapse, which Sirius Minerals said would not have happened if the government had supported the project. • This article’s headline was amended on 27 June 2020 to better reflect the text of the story."
2020-06-26T18:02:34Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus live: Boris Johnson tells people to stop 'taking too many liberties' on lockdown easing – as it happened,"That’s all for the UK coronavirus blog today - updates will be continuing on our global blog into the evening.

2020-06-26T16:23:38Z,politics,Politics,'We've bought the wrong satellites': UK tech gamble baffles experts,"The UK government’s plan to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in a satellite broadband company has been described as “nonsensical” by experts, who say the company doesn’t even make the right type of satellite the country needs after Brexit. The investment in OneWeb, first reported on Thursday night, is intended to mitigate the UK’s loss of access to the EU’s Galileo satellite navigation system. But OneWeb – in which the UK will own a 20% stake following the investment – currently operates a completely different type of satellite network from that typically used to run such navigation systems. “The fundamental starting point is, yes, we’ve bought the wrong satellites,” said Dr Bleddyn Bowen, a space policy expert at the University of Leicester. “OneWeb is working on basically the same idea as Elon Musk’s Starlink: a mega-constellation of satellites in low Earth orbit, which are used to connect people on the ground to the internet. “What’s happened is that the very talented lobbyists at OneWeb have convinced the government that we can completely redesign some of the satellites to piggyback a navigation payload on it. It’s bolting an unproven technology on to a mega-constellation that’s designed to do something else. It’s a tech and business gamble.” Giles Thorne, a research analyst at Jeffries, agreed. “This situation is nonsensical to me,” he said. “This situation looks like nationalism trumping solid industrial policy.” Every major positioning system currently in use – America’s GPS, Russia’s Glonass, China’s BeiDou, and Galileo, the EU project that the UK helped design before losing access to due to Brexit – is in a medium Earth orbit, Thorne said, approximately 20,000km from Earth. OneWeb’s satellites, 74 of which have already been launched, are in a low Earth orbit, just 1,200km up. Bowen said: “If you want to replace GPS for military-grade systems, where you need encrypted, secure signals that are precise to centimetres, I’m not sure you can do that on satellites as small as OneWeb’s.” Rather than being selected for the quality of the offering, Thorne suggested the investment was made to suit “a nationalist agenda”. OneWeb is nominally a UK business, with a UK HQ and spectrum rights registered in the UK through Ofcom. “Let’s give the government the benefit of the doubt: if the output the government wants is a UK-branded positioning system, a projection of UK power around the world and supporting the UK satellite industry base, then it is probably quicker and cheaper to smash the square peg of OneWeb into the round hole of a Galileo replacement than it is to do it from scratch,” said Thorne. On Friday evening a government spokesperson said: “We have made clear our ambitions for space and are developing a new national space strategy to bring long-term strategic and commercial benefits to the UK. We are in regular discussions with the space industry as part of this work.” OneWeb filed for bankruptcy in March in the US, where most of its operations are located, after failing to secure new funding. Previously, the UK aimed to build its own global navigation satellite system, which independent experts estimatedwould cost £3bn-£4bn. In December 2018, Theresa May, the then prime minister, said the UK expected to work with the US and other “Five Eyes” partners – a term for the multilateral intelligence agreement – to do so. But in May this year that project was put on hold, just weeks before a feasibility study into the scheme was due to be published, as its estimated cost ballooned to £5bn."
2020-06-26T16:04:58Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson hopes bullish approach can bring back the 'bustle',"When Boris Johnson announced that pubs and hairdressers could reopen from 4 July, his familiar optimistic bounce re-emerged for the first time in weeks. As the self-confessed scourge of “doomsters and gloomsters”, the prime minister visibly loathed having to tell the nation in March their local would be shut down by the government – and enjoyed telling them “bustle” can now return to the high street. “A new but cautious optimism is palpable,” he announced, though he also urged the public to deploy their common sense as they venture out again. With the virus now more under control – at least for now – he will use a major speech next week to switch the focus back to the “people’s priorities” of December’s Tory manifesto: including a rash of infrastructure projects aimed at “levelling up” Britain. “We’re going to be building loads of stuff,” said one Whitehall source. Some of the priorities, including a major boost to road-building, and a series of green investments such as electric vehicle charging, were already announced by Rishi Sunak in March. But Johnson is expected to push ahead with other plans, including building more of the 40 new hospitals promised during the election campaign – and potentially also handing schools pots of money to be spent on improving their buildings. With an urgent need to create jobs, as sectors hardest hit by the shutdown accelerate layoffs, relatively small-scale projects can be started much more quickly than the high-profile cable cars and bridges Johnson has tended to prefer in the past. Environmental projects such as refurbishing homes to make them more energy efficient – lagging lofts, for example – also create large numbers of jobs, rapidly. And they have the advantage of being geographically well-spread, giving Tory MPs up and down the country tangible benefits to point to in the run-up to the 2024 general election. Conservative backbenchers, including even some from the 2019 intake who owe their seats to Johnson, have grumbled in recent weeks about what they regard as shaky leadership by a centralised and insular No 10 operation. Many would cheer the prospect of increased investment in grassroots projects. Handing cash to schools would also have the advantage of reinstating education as a clear priority, after Johnson was stung by criticisms of his government’s failure to get more children back to school. Sunak is expected to make his own contribution to setting the government back on track later in July, when he holds what the Treasury is keen to insist will not be a budget, but simply a financial statement. He is under pressure from Labour, which has been hammering home the mantra that a “budget for jobs” is urgently needed. Sunak told the Yorkshire Post earlier this month that he was concerned about the fate of young people unable to find a job because of the crisis, and was looking at the “full range of things” he could do to help them. “There are different paths into work, and apprenticeships are a great path into it, and how we make sure we support companies to create those kinds of opportunities for young people, and for those who are going to be newly unemployed as a result of all of this. The full range of things, I’m having a look at.” A fan of bold political gestures, Johnson has even suggested the government could promise an apprenticeship for every young person. “In dealing with the fallout of coronavirus, we will be as activist and interventionist as we have been during the lockdown,” the prime minister has said. “Young people, I believe, should be guaranteed an apprenticeship.” Such a promise would echo the “young person’s guarantee” introduced by Labour in the downturn that followed the global financial crisis, which offered 18- to 24-year olds training or a job, after they had been out of work for six months. But creating sufficient jobs in the short-term, in an economy undergoing significant changes as businesses and families adjust to the new normal, is a formidable challenge. As for kick-starting the recovery from the Covid-19 crash, one widely reported proposal has been an across-the-board cut in VAT. Conscious that it is costly and poorly targeted, Treasury insiders stress no decision has yet been made, and highlight encouraging signs that consumer spending will bounce back strongly once more of the economy reopens. But a VAT cut targeted at specific sectors – hard-hit tourism, for example – is an alternative approach. Sunak could also opt to evolve the vast job retention scheme, which is due to close in October, into a smaller-scale programme of wage subsidies, perhaps topping up the pay of those who can be brought back into work part-time. Johnson knows his government will be judged harshly if next weekend’s risky package of reopenings – from museums to bingo halls – sparks a second wave of the virus. But with the economy already likely to be deep in recession, Downing Street also believes the bullishness that helped get Johnson elected is the right approach for the tough months ahead."
2020-06-26T11:38:00Z,politics,Politics,Labour reports Robert Jenrick to parliamentary watchdog,"Labour has reported the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, to parliament’s watchdog for appearing to have acted “on direct instruction” from the Conservative donor Richard Desmond. Following the release of a cache of correspondence showing numerous interactions between the two over a £1bn property development in east London, the minister has been accused of deliberately rushing through a planning decision to save the billionaire tens of millions of pounds due in tax. Boris Johnson declined to ask the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, to investigate the allegations, so Labour has asked Kathryn Stone, the commissioner for standards, to investigate whether Jenrick’s behaviour constitutes a breach of the MPs’ code.
The code states that members should act on all occasions in accordance with the public trust placed in them and behave with probity and integrity, including in their use of public resources. It also states that holders of public office should be as open as possible about all the decisions and actions they take. Labour says the documents show Jenrick appeared to be acting on direct instruction from Desmond, which it says was a serious abuse of powers he is supposed to exercise impartially. Steve Reed, the shadow communities and local government secretary, said: “There are still so many unanswered questions about Robert Jenrick’s unlawful attempt to help Richard Desmond dodge £150m in tax days before he made a generous donation to the Conservative party. “The prime minister has yet again shown woefully poor judgment by not referring clear breaches of the ministerial code to the cabinet secretary and he must now come clean himself about his own involvement in this case. “The government must publish all the remaining secret documents in this case to show the public what Mr Jenrick and the prime minister were really up to and prove that this is not the start of a new era of Tory sleaze.” Jenrick is fighting to keep his job after the documents revealed the extent of the contact between himself and Desmond before the minister signed off on the 1,500-home Westferry Printworks scheme.
Jenrick originally gave the development the go-ahead in January 2020, overruling Tower Hamlets council and a planning inspector. He subsequently reversed the ruling following legal action by the council, admitting that what he had done was “unlawful by reason of apparent bias”. The documents, released on Wednesday night to the communities select committee after Labour threatened to force a vote on the issue, revealed that Jenrick gave Desmond his phone number after the pair sat next to each other at a Tory fundraising dinner in November. Desmond also met Johnson at the event. The prime minister denies discussing the development with him. Desmond then lobbied Jenrick, telling him a decision was urgent because “we don’t want to give Marxists loads of doe [sic] for nothing!” Emails from officials suggest Jenrick did seek to expedite the approval of the scheme, with one message saying: “On timing, my understanding is that SoS [the secretary of state, Jenrick] is/was insistent that decision issued this week ie tomorrow – as next week the viability of the scheme is impacted by a change in the London CIL [community infrastructure levy] regime.” Jenrick is also facing questions over his links to wealthy Conservative donors after it emerged that he met an Israeli businessman with an interest in the future of a multibillion-pound project that the minister was overseeing. The Guardian obtained information about his ties to Idan Ofer, a London-based shipping and mining heir whose father, Sammy, was once Israel’s richest man. A spokesperson for Jenrick said he recused himself from decisions related to Ofer and disclosed his ministerial interests on appointment in the usual way. A spokesman for Ofer said they discussed the business environment in the UK, particularly post-Brexit. At a Westminster briefing, a Downing Street spokesperson did not respond to questions asking how many times Johnson met Desmond in the months before the scheme was approved or if Desmond sent Johnson text messages about the development. Referring to a letter from Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill to Reed earlier in the week which said that the prime minister considered the matter closed, the spokesperson said: “The housing secretary has set out his position, his account, in public. We have been clear that no-one in Number 10 discussed this planning application or appeal with Mr Desmond, or his representatives.” A spokesperson for Jenrick said Labour’s complaint is “unfounded, spurious and vexatious”. “The secretary of state has publicly set out a full account of his rationale for approving the planning appeal, and published all of the relevant documents for complete transparency. He has been clear that his decision was made with an open and fair mind.”"
2020-06-26T10:54:21Z,politics,Politics,Starmer faces backlash from leftwing MPs over Long-Bailey sacking,"Leftwing Labour MPs including John McDonnell are urging colleagues, “don’t leave, organise”, as the sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey provides a rallying point for critics of Keir Starmer’s leadership. McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn were among MPs who met Starmer on Friday morning to express their concerns. The Labour leader is facing a backlash from leftwingers in the party after abruptly removing Long-Bailey from her post as shadow education secretary on Thursday. At Friday’s meeting, held via video link, Corbyn urged Starmer to continue to take a tough line on the annexation of Palestinian territory, and to meet the leftwing group Jewish Voice for Labour. JVL supported Corbyn when he faced claims of failing to tackle antisemitism during his leadership. Part of Corbyn’s contribution to Friday’s meeting was obscured by a poor internet connection.
McDonnell later approvingly tweeted details of a grouping called Don’t Leave, Organise, of which JVL is a member. Set up in the spring, the group says its aims include “to prevent any rightward drift that may occur within Labour under Keir Starmer”. With Starmer already narrowly holding a majority on Labour’s ruling national executive committee (NEC), some are concerned about tens of thousands of members leaving the party, weakening the voice of the left inside the Labour machine. Long-Bailey’s removal on Thursday prompted criticisms from leading leftwing figures in the party, some of whom had previously been reluctant to confront Starmer directly. Long-Bailey had tweeted a newspaper interview with Maxine Peake, calling the actor an “absolute diamond”. In discussing the Black Lives Matter movement, Peake linked the behaviour of US police with Israel – something Starmer called an “antisemitic conspiracy theory”. Peake, a longtime Labour supporter, subsequently apologised. The general secretary of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, tweeted that Starmer’s decision was “an unnecessary over-reaction to a confected row”, adding that “unity is too important to be risked like this”. Corbyn has adopted a relatively low profile since stepping down from the leadership in the wake of December’s general election defeat. But Friday’s meeting underlines the fact that a well-organised leftwing caucus has been preparing to act as a focal point for dissent against Starmer’s leadership. The former deputy leadership candidate Richard Burgon has been building up the profile and resources of the Socialist Campaign Group, with the backing of McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor and Corbyn’s close ally. Burgon’s allies say he wants to make it into a leftwing version of the Fabian Society. In a statement released after the meeting, the Socialist Campaign Group said it had been “a business-like exchange of views”, which as well as Long-Bailey’s sacking had covered “the need for the Labour party, MPs, party members and supporters to speak out about Israel’s illegal annexation and ongoing human rights abuses by the government of Israel”. They later released a separate statement, signed by 21 MPs including Corbyn, McDonnell and Diane Abbott, saying: “In line with conference policy, Labour must recognise that any just peace must be based on self-determination for Palestine, with equality and human rights for all.” Corbyn’s allies have long felt that pressure over antisemitism has been used as a way of silencing legitimate criticism of Israel. An “emollient” Starmer told them, according to one witness, that he had no intention of letting that happen – and had been fighting for human rights throughout his life. Labour insiders also point to the fact that Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, has been part of a cross-party group pressing for an urgent question in the House of Commons on annexation, with a draft expected to be submitted to the party – and to named individuals – imminently. Long-Bailey’s sacking has rekindled tensions over Labour’s record on antisemitism under Corbyn’s leadership, which is under formal investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). An internal report leaked over Easter and apparently prepared for submission to the EHRC, blamed a “hyper-factional culture” at Labour HQ during the early years of Corbyn’s leadership for some of the party’s failings during that period. Starmer launched a review into the contents of the report, which included scores of strongly worded personal WhatsApp messages sent by staffers hostile to Corbyn, and how it was leaked. Chaired by the QC Martin Forde, the review panel launched a call for evidence on Friday. Forde said he could not compel people to come forward, but urged them to do so. “We cannot force anyone to bring information to us but I hope all those with an interest in the issue will see the value of contributing. That way we can build the fullest picture of the circumstances and content of the leaked report as well as the current culture and practices of the Labour party,” he said. The review’s terms of reference, also published on Friday, say issues it will examine include: “The extent of racist, sexist and other discriminatory culture within Labour party workplaces, the attitudes and conduct of the senior staff of the Labour party, and their relationships with the elected leadership of the Labour party.”"
2020-06-26T06:30:38Z,politics,Politics,Labour calls for judge-led review on strategy for lone attackers,"The shadow home secretary is calling on the government to launch a judge-led review into the official strategy for tackling attacks by lone terrorists. Following the attack in Reading on Saturday, in which three men were stabbed to death, Nick Thomas-Symonds has written to the home secretary, Priti Patel, calling for a review into how a range of public services that could intervene at critical points are functioning. The police determined that the incident in Reading should be treated as a terrorist attack, but with investigators keeping an open mind as to motivation. Such services would include probation, the prison system, mental health services, local authorities and housing providers, Thomas-Symonds said. The work would be to build on previous reports, such as the extensive work done by Lord Anderson when he was independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. The suspect in the Reading attack, Khairi Saadallah, is understood to have been on the radar of multiple public agencies, including MI5. In the middle of last year, MI5 had Saadallah under investigation as a person who might travel to Libya “for extremist reasons”. That claim was found to lack credibility and he was assessed as being far from the legal threshold for investigation. He had a history of significant mental health issues. The incident in Reading comes seven months after Usman Khan, a convicted terrorist, killed two people in an attack near London Bridge, and four months after Sudesh Amman launched a non-fatal knife attack on Streatham High Road. Both men, who were shot dead by police officers, had extensive contact with various authorities prior to the atrocities. Thomas-Symonds said Labour was willing to put aside party differences to work with the government on a review. “The police and security services have responded incredibly bravely to these incidents and foiled many more, thanks to their skill and dedication,” he said. “However, they cannot fight this battle alone. When looking to identify, monitor and, in some cases, treat subjects who pose an enormous risk to society, we rely on a wide range of services, such as probation, the prison system, local authorities, mental health workers, housing providers and many more. “That is why I have written to the home secretary to see if we can work together to set up a judge-led review, to undertake an independent assessment of the systemic response needed to address the highly dangerous and growing threat of lone attackers, with all necessary security safeguards in place. “Lone attackers, intent on causing carnage, have taken the lives of innocent people, injured more and caused enormous suffering to all those affected. Now we must come together and redouble efforts to ensure each of these vital services have the resources they need and are working together in the most effective and impactful way, ultimately in a bid to save lives.” Lord Anderson’s 2017 review outlined work on multi-agency centre (MAC) pilots. These involve identification of newly-closed high risk subjects of interest (SOIs), sharing of data by MI5 and counter-terror policing with other agencies, such as local authorities and government departments, and enrichment of that data from the databases of multi-agency partners. The review also highlighted some of the existing barriers to local partners’ involvement in managing subjects of interest, including challenges of resourcing. It said: “As to the delivery of management plans, some local authority representatives cautioned against unrealistic expectations of services such as mental health and community safety. “It is not difficult to see how intensive interventions could assist in the management of closed SOIs; but against, what was described to me as, a background of widespread recent degradation of local services, such interventions may not be generally available, and there was a degree of reluctance in local authorities to prioritise closed SOIs at the expense of other citizens, or to take on the risk of any failure to do so.” Patel has asked Jonathan Hall, the current independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, to look at how different agencies – including the police, probation services and security services – investigate, monitor and manage terrorist offenders."
2020-06-26T06:00:41Z,politics,Politics,Jenrick affair exposes a financialised planning system,"The moment the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, took his place at a Tory fundraising dinner at London’s Savoy hotel alongside Richard Desmond – and watched a promotional video of a planned £1bn development on Desmond’s phone – was not the first time a wealthy developer had become close to a politician with the power to block or approve plans. The planning system has historically cast developers and politicians in poacher and gamekeeper roles. But in recent years an increased focus on financial negotiations between public authorities and developers has made simple yes/no decisions into more complex transactions, sparking concerns the system lacks transparency and is vulnerable to corruption. After years of austerity, cash-strapped councils have become more reliant on using planning deals with developers to provide affordable housing and funds for community infrastructure such as schools and play centres. It was this financialisation of planning, in the form of the community infrastructure levy (CIL), that snared Jenrick and Desmond over the latter’s plan to turn a redundant printworks in east London into a £1bn housing-led development. The CIL is a per-square-metre charge which councils have been able to apply to large projects since 2010.
Jenrick’s decision to overrule the local council’s rejection of the plan and intervention to affect how much Desmond’s company would have to pay towards local infrastructure, tied him up in knots. At one point he had to tell Desmond by text that they could not meet because it was important “not to give any appearance of being influenced by applicants of cases that I may have a role in”, documents revealed. But he also urged civil servants to expedite the decision, to apparently help Desmond avoid an additional £45m cost from the CIL. He eventually had to quash his own approval, conceding the decision was unlawful. Multimillion-pound negotiations such as over Desmond’s CIL payment now form the centrepiece of many planning applications. Section 106 agreements – deals over how much affordable housing and other community benefits developers will fund – have long been standard. But since planning changes by the coalition government in 2012, developers have also been able to complain to planners that their demands are eating too much into their profits. They are allowed to present financial viability studies, essentially spreadsheets based on often speculative and hard-to-check numbers which argue that if they spend too much on affordable housing, they won’t make enough money. These have often not been made public. All in all, a planning system that used to be concerned primarily with land use has become much more about land value. Each side appoints financial consultants to probe the other’s workings, creating “an arms race”, according to Bob Colenutt, author of The Property Lobby, an investigation into the housing crisis. “The negotiations go on behind closed doors and thousands of units of affordable housing are at risk,” he said. “It is murky and not transparent. It also causes delay when the developers argue about not being able to provide policy-compliant schemes.” The desire of developers to win support from politicians and public officials outside of the public forums of planning committee meetings has also spawned lobbying consultancies dedicated to persuading planning committee members and other politicians to back their clients’ plans. Desmond, for example, used the Thorncliffe lobbying firm for his east London scheme. It promises to “build support among politicians” for planning applications and claims a 95% success rate in getting approval. Its website declares that it employs elected councillors and says its team adhere to the highest ethical standards. An investigation by the Guardian in 2018 found nearly 100 councillors in the capital worked for property companies or lobbying and communications consultancies involved in planning. Some also sat on planning committees. One politician to often meet with these consultants as well as their clients was Robert Davis, the former chairman of Westminster city council’s planning committee, who was entertained or received gifts almost 900 times, often from property industry figures including lobbying companies, between 2012 and 2017. He once registered two lunches on one day. He denied any impropriety before quitting as deputy leader of the council following the Guardian’s disclosures. Boris Johnson, who believes the Jenrick matter is “closed”, knows the planning system well from his eight years as mayor of London, when he had the power to approve or veto major developments and to negotiate levels of affordable housing. “The system is one of negotiation,” said a major developer speaking on condition of anonymity. “When Ken Livingstone was mayor of London, everyone knew he wanted to do the last part of the deal. You would turn up in front of Ken and he would do business.” One scheme Johnson considered when he was mayor was a plan by the billionaire Reuben brothers to turn Westminster’s Millbank Tower into 200 apartments and a 150-bedroom five-star hotel. He approved it in April 2016, concluding that “the maximum reasonable amount of affordable housing in this instance is zero”. Developers have raised their eyebrows at Desmond’s admission that he directly lobbied Jenrick – seeing it as something of an own goal. “As a developer the last thing you do is talk to the secretary of state because you get into exactly this [controversy],” said one. “You know not to get anywhere near the politicians.” At a council level, it is different. Council leaders and planning committee chairmen can be approached before planning applications are submitted. Developers know they have something councils badly need: cash. The pressure on councils to use planning to deliver funds to invest in public services had only been increased by austerity, said Nick Johnson, a former director of the Manchester-based property developer Urban Splash, making them “alert to the opportunity of planning deals to prop up their finances”. “There’s a real tension,” he said. “You have to question whether they are being completely objective about the decisions they are taking.”"
2020-06-25T21:03:16Z,politics,Politics,Rebecca Long-Bailey sacking reignites Labour turmoil over antisemitism,"Keir Starmer is facing a showdown with the left of Labour after his decisive sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey reignited the party’s internal turmoil over the issue of antisemitism. In a swift move, Long-Bailey was summarily dismissed as shadow education secretary for sending an approving tweet about an interview in which the actor Maxine Peake said the US police tactic of kneeling on someone’s neck was taught by the Israeli secret service. This was emphatically denied by Israel, and Peake later retracted the claim. By then, however, Long-Bailey had been fired. Her approval of the interview, in which Peake also talked about her new film and her support for Jeremy Corbyn, led Jewish groups to demand she delete her tweet and apologise. Instead she sent another message saying she did not endorse “all aspects of the article”. Less than three hours later, a brief statement from Starmer’s office said he had asked Long-Bailey to step down. It said: “The article Rebecca shared earlier today contained an antisemitic conspiracy theory. As leader of the Labour party, Keir has been clear that restoring trust with the Jewish community is a number one priority. Antisemitism takes many different forms and it is important that we all are vigilant against it.” In an online press briefing with reporters, Starmer went further. “I asked Rebecca Long-Bailey to step down from the shadow cabinet for sharing the article,” he said. “I didn’t do that because she is antisemitic, I did it because she shared the article which has got, in my view, antisemitic conspiracy theories in it. “My primary focus is on rebuilding trust with the Jewish communities. I didn’t think sharing that article was in keeping with that primary objective.” The swift action brought praise from Jewish groups and from Labour MPs who had been critical of Jeremy Corbyn’s handling of complaints about antisemitism in the party. Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said the decision showed Starmer was “backing his words with actions on antisemitism”. She said: “After Rebecca Long-Bailey shared a conspiracy theory, we and others gave her the opportunity to retract and apologise. To our surprise and dismay, her response was pathetic. Her position as shadow education secretary was therefore untenable.” The co-chairs of the all-party parliamentary group against antisemitism, Labour’s Catherine McKinnell and the Tory MP Andrew Percy, said they welcomed Starmer’s “zero-tolerance approach and decisive action”. Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who was one of Corbyn’s staunchest critics on the issue, tweeted: “This is what a change in culture looks like. This is what zero tolerance looks like. This is what rebuilding trust with the Jewish community looks like.” But in sacking Long-Bailey, the only notable Corbyn supporter to still have a top shadow cabinet job, Starmer stirred intense anger from the left of the parliamentary party, and he faced pressure to reinstate her. Amid reports that the left-leaning Campaign group wanted a meeting with Starmer or were planning a statement of solidarity with Long-Bailey, the BBC said on Thursday night that Starmer would meet MPs on Friday to address their concerns. A series of individual MPs condemned the decision, some of them arguing that Peake’s view had not been antisemitic and others saying the move indicated a narrowing of views in the party. John McDonnell, who was shadow chancellor under Corbyn, tweeted: “Throughout discussion of antisemitism it’s always been said criticism of practices of Israeli state is not antisemitic. I don’t believe therefore that this article is or ⁦⁦@RLong_Bailey⁩ should’ve been sacked. I stand in solidarity with her.” Jon Trickett, a shadow Cabinet Office minister under Corbyn, said he was alarmed. “Keir said he wanted a unity cabinet and he wanted people from across the party. If he narrows the gene pool down much further, he will potentially get into trouble,” he said. Momentum, the Corbyn-backing movement within Labour, said in a statement that Starmer “says he wants party unity, then sacks the most prominent leftwinger on the frontbench for no good reason. It’s a reckless overreaction”. McDonnell later shared a petition calling on Starmer to reinstate Long-Bailey. Following the publication of the interview with Peake, the Independent linked her allegation to a report from Amnesty International. The paper later retracted this claim and Amnesty International said that it had never reported that Israeli secret services taught a “neck kneeling” technique. “For years, we’ve documented appalling crimes under international law and human rights violations meted out to Palestinians by members of the Israeli security forces, though the precise nature of the training offered to US police forces by Israeli officials is not something we’ve documented,” it told the New Statesman. “Allegations that US police were taught tactics of ‘neck kneeling’ by Israeli secret services is not something we’ve ever reported and the article in question has rightly been amended to acknowledge that. “The US police themselves have a longstanding record of using excessive force against members of the public – including Black Lives Matter protesters, something we reported on earlier this week.” In a Twitter thread following her dismissal, Long-Bailey said her initial tweet of clarification had been made in “wording agreed in advance by the Labour party leader’s office”, but that Starmer’s team then instructed her to delete both her original tweet and the update, which she refused to do. She said: “I could not do this in good conscience without the issuing of a press statement of clarification. I had asked to discuss these matters with Keir before agreeing what further action to take, but sadly he had already made his decision.” Long-Bailey had initially tweeted: “Maxine Peake is an absolute diamond,” linking to an interview with the Independent in which the actor said the practice of kneeling on a person’s neck – which led to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis – was “learnt from seminars with Israeli secret services”. Peake later said she had been wrong, tweeting: “I feel it’s important for me to clarify that, when talking to The Independent, I was inaccurate in my assumption of American police training & its sources. I find racism & antisemitism abhorrent & I in no way wished, nor intended, to add fodder to any views of the contrary.” Long-Bailey was seen as the standard bearer for the pro-Corbyn wing of Labour in the race to succeed him as leader. She won just under 28% of members’ votes, while Starmer took 56%. Upon taking over, Starmer pledged to tackle complaints about antisemitism within parts of Labour that many Jewish organisations said had been treated with insufficient seriousness under Corbyn. This article was amended on 26 June 2020 to clarify how Maxine Peake’s comments were reported by the Independent."
2020-06-25T20:45:38Z,politics,Politics,Starmer's removal of Long-Bailey has rekindled Labourâ€™s civil war,"“I will tear out this poison by its roots,” Keir Starmer said of antisemitism in his party, when he made his acceptance speech as Labour leader in April. Few colleagues doubted therefore that he would seize the earliest possible opportunity to make an example of someone – but by sacking his leadership rival, Rebecca Long-Bailey, he has reignited Labour’s civil war. Members of the Socialist Campaign Group of MPs, including John McDonnell and Richard Burgon, had been biding their time on the backbenches – sometimes making more strident criticisms of the government than Starmer’s, but remaining scrupulously loyal in public. Now one of their own has been ruthlessly removed, they will feel emboldened to make their voices heard more loudly. McDonnell, who worked closely with Long-Bailey as shadow chancellor, said he stood in “absolute solidarity” with her. Compared to some of the most egregious examples of antisemitism in the Labour party that have received publicity in recent years, Long-Bailey’s appeared to be a borderline case. She enthusiastically retweeted an interview with the actress Maxine Peake, in which Peake drew a link between Israel and the US policing methods that resulted in the death of George Floyd – calling Peake an “absolute diamond”. The first version of the article, in the Independent, said Amnesty International had suggested some US police forces had received training from the Israeli secret services, thus apparently legitimising the comment – though the sentence was later changed. One shadow cabinet colleague said their first thought was that Long-Bailey had probably not read the whole article, and was just endorsing its central thrust, that leftwingers should remain in Starmer’s Labour party. Momentum founder Jon Lansman, who is himself Jewish and remains on Labour’s national executive committee, said he had emerged from a party panel considering antisemitism cases to retweet Long-Bailey’s original praise of Peake. But Starmer wants to show that the days of debilitating debates about the finer details of what constitutes antisemitism are over. In stark contrast to Boris Johnson, for whom the whiff of corruption has not been sufficient to merit the sacking of Robert Jenrick, the appearance of antisemitism is enough for the new Labour leader. And he will know that the public do not engage with the details either – but will get the message that a high-profile party figure has been sacked over antisemitism. Just as the very public resignations of Luciana Berger and other Labour MPs despairing at their party’s record on antisemitism showed the public that Labour had a problem, Starmer will hope this sacking demonstrates that he is dealing with it. One ally of Starmer claimed Long-Bailey had form, citing a video of a rally that emerged during the leadership campaign in which she failed to challenge a member who attacked the “Israeli lobby”, which they claimed included Tom Watson and Margaret Hodge. Indeed, some of the most spirited clashes during the largely polite leadership race came over antisemitism. In February’s Newsnight debate, Emily Thornberry said she and Starmer had both raised antisemitism repeatedly in the shadow cabinet and called for regular reports on tackling it, adding: “I don’t think Rebecca did.” Long-Bailey shot back “I did, I think you’ll find”, prompting Starmer to warn: “Let’s not descend into scoring points.” But the party’s record on antisemitism, and the very public row it generated, is inseparable in the minds of many of Jeremy Corbyn’s allies from what they saw as the relentless internal war waged against his leadership from inside the party machine. A report prepared under Corbyn’s leadership for submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and leaked after his departure, detailed a “hyper-factional atmosphere prevailing in party HQ” in the first year or more of his leadership. Party officials’ personal WhatsApp messages showed them referring to Corbyn and his team in insulting terms, and even expressing disappointment at 2017’s better-than-expected general election performance. The report claimed the party’s compliance department saw its central task as weeding out leftwingers who might support Corbyn in a leadership challenge – not methodically processing an escalating caseload of antisemitism claims. Against that backdrop, team Corbyn regarded media reports about antisemitism, and his failure to get to grips with it, as just another front on which his leftwing leadership was under siege. When Long-Bailey was sacked on Thursday, her supporters immediately saw it through the same lens: concluding that Starmer had seized the opportunity to purge one of the few remaining leftwingers from his frontbench. As far as policy goes, there is little evidence that Starmer is abandoning Corbyn’s legacy – though in the grip of a national emergency and with no general election due until 2024, there have been precious few policies at all. But in terms of personnel, many have been alarmed about what they see as the jarring contrast between Starmer’s message of “unity” during the leadership campaign and the comprehensive clearout of the Corbynite left he carried out once he got the job. One Starmer-sceptic also pointed out that Long-Bailey, who represents a leave-voting constituency, had been sympathetic to Brexit, during the bitter internecine battle over the party’s stance that raged throughout last year. Perhaps it didn’t help, either, that Starmer was visibly irritated last week when Boris Johnson wrong-footed him at prime minister’s questions by pressing him to say he thought it was safe for children to go back to school. Starmer’s allies insist he has worked closely with Long-Bailey on schools policy; but some more centrist Labour MPs have accused her of listening too intently to teachers’ unions, and not enough to parents, as she warned about the risks of wider reopening. For these reasons he may not lament her departure from the frontbench, but Starmer’s allies insist he would deal just as determinedly with claims of antisemitism even if they came from a close political friend. Chatter among the exiled Corbynites was already about whose actions will be singled out for censure in the EHRC’s report on Labour’s handling of antisemitism complaints. After Thursday, they can have no doubt how Starmer will respond."
2020-06-25T18:48:04Z,politics,Politics,Long-Bailey's sacking sparks focus on reporting of US-Israeli police links,"Keir Starmer’s decision to sack Rebecca Long-Bailey as shadow education secretary after she shared on Twitter an interview with the actor Maxine Peake has focused attention on links between US police forces and their Israeli counterparts – and how those connections have been reported by some media outlets in recent weeks. In a wide-ranging interview with the Independent, Peake made the claim – which she later retracted – that the brutal US police tactics that left George Floyd unable to breathe in Minnesota, sparking global Black Lives Matter protests, were a direct result of Israeli training.
“Systemic racism is a global issue,” Peake told the Independent. “The tactics used by the police in America, kneeling on George Floyd’s neck, that was learnt from seminars with Israeli secret services.” Long-Bailey retweeted the interview with Peake – which was headlined “People who couldn’t vote Labour because of Corbyn? They voted Tory as far as I’m concerned” – with the comment “Maxine Peake is an absolute diamond”. Starmer said he felt compelled to sack her because “I do not consider sharing that article furthered the course of rebuilding trust with the Jewish community”. The Independent originally contextualised Peake’s comments with a denial from an Israeli police spokesperson that they would recommend kneeling on a suspect’s neck, before referencing a 2016 blog post by Amnesty International USA on how US police forces are regularly trained by Israeli officials. Several hours later the interview was updated to include a stronger denial from an Israeli police spokesperson insisting “there is no tactic or protocol that calls to put pressure on the neck or airway”. An editor’s note was also attached, distancing the Independent from Peake’s claim: “This article has been amended to further clarify that the allegation that US police were taught tactics of ‘neck kneeling’ by Israeli secret services is unfounded.” The connections between US police forces and the training offered by the Israeli state has come under increased media attention in the wake of Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. This has generated viral posts and media coverage that has sometimes extrapolated from known facts to make broader unsourced claims. There is no doubt that there are many programmes involving Israeli officials offering training to US police forces. Some programmes are conducted on US soil in conjunction with the Israeli embassy, such as a 2012 event where 100 officers from Minnetonka – a city 8 miles from Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed – were trained on how to combat terrorists. Other programmes, often organised by pro-Israel organisations based in the US, involved flying small groups of officers to Israel for training programmes. Such police exchanges are not uncommon. This recent interest has led to coverage in sites such as Middle East Eye focusing on which US forces have been involved in these exchange programmes, though most have not drawn any link between the Israeli training and the tactic used to kill Floyd."
2020-06-25T18:45:09Z,politics,Politics,Robert Jenrick faces questions over meeting with Israeli mining heir,"Robert Jenrick is facing new questions over his links to wealthy Conservative donors after it emerged that he met an Israeli businessman with an interest in the future of a multibillion-pound project that the minister was overseeing. The housing secretary is already under pressure to resign over a disclosure that he “insisted” that a £1bn property development be rushed through so that the Tory donor Richard Desmond’s company could save £45m. The Guardian has obtained information about his ties to another billionaire, Idan Ofer, a London-based shipping and mining heir whose father, Sammy, was once Israel’s richest man. Departmental registers reveal a meeting on 21 March 2018 between Jenrick, who was then exchequer secretary to the Treasury, and Ofer, the ultimate owner of the UK mining company Cleveland Potash. At the time, Jenrick was assessing whether to offer state support for a new potash mine being built by a rival company, Sirius Minerals, which was set to provide intense competition to Ofer’s loss-making business. A spokesman for Jenrick said he recused himself from any decisions on the Sirius project, but did not say when. The Guardian understands that Jenrick retained oversight of Sirius Minerals’ application for financial support from the Treasury for at least six months after his meeting with Ofer in March 2018. Liz Truss, then the more senior chief secretary to the Treasury, is understood to have taken over the job of assessing Sirius’s application for support, but not until early 2019. One of Ofer’s other UK firms, the Mayfair-based Quantum Pacific UK Corporation, subsequently donated to the Conservatives for the first and only time, giving the party £10,000 in March 2019. In September 2019, Sirius Minerals revealed that the government had refused to provide financial support, a decision that effectively left the company on the brink of financial collapse. Sirius was eventually bought out in a cut-price deal by the mining firm Anglo American in January 2020, wiping out the shareholdings of hundreds of small investors. Some lost most of their life savings due to the collapse, which Sirius Minerals has said would not have happened if the government had supported the project. A spokesperson for Jenrick said: “Mr Jenrick recused himself from decisions on the Sirius Minerals project. He disclosed his ministerial interests on appointment in the usual way. The meeting that took place on 21 March 2018 with Mr Ofer was to discuss electric vehicles and charge point technology and was attended by a [Treasury] official.” The spokesperson did not say whether Jenrick and Ofer had met on any other occasions. A spokesman for Ofer said: “Mr Ofer met Mr Jenrick and his team at the Treasury and discussed the business environment in the UK, particularly post-Brexit. Mr Ofer attended the meeting on his own. “Mr Ofer can’t recall if it [the mining project] was discussed, but if it did it would have been touched on only briefly because the main subject of conversation was the wider business and economic environment in the UK.” He added that the £10,000 donation via Ofer’s Quantum Pacific business was made at the behest of Conservative Friends of Israel. Jenrick is a member of the group but Ofer said the donation had not been discussed with him."
2020-06-25T18:06:37Z,politics,Politics,Rebecca Long-Bailey sacked from shadow cabinet in antisemitism row - as it happened,We are pausing the UK blog for now. You can head over to our global blog for all the updates on the coronavirus -
2020-06-25T18:02:31Z,politics,Politics,Starmer strikes without warning while Johnson hangs on to Honest Bob | John Crace,"It was quite the contrast. At the first hint of antisemitism within the Labour party, Keir Starmer unceremoniously sacked Rebecca Long-Bailey as shadow education secretary. No ifs, no buts, no special pleadings, no final warnings. A party leader determined to put the equivocation of the Corbyn era behind him and taking decisive action when required. It was all rather old-school politics. Then there was the moral vacuum that passes for the current Conservative party. Having already crossed every red line in a desperate attempt to hang on to Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson is now extending the same largesse to his housing secretary. If Robert Jenrick had a hint of decency he would long since have resigned. If Boris had a hint of decency he would have sacked him. But the Tories are now so compromised they just dig in and hope the country has a short memory. They may be disappointed in that. When you’re fighting for your political career, the very least you’d hope for is another cabinet minister to rally to your defence on the morning’s media round. But Robert “Honest Bob” Jenrick had to make do with Nadhim Zahawi, a junior business minister whose rise to middle management owes more to unquestioning loyalty to whomsoever he needs to be unquestioningly loyal – there was a time when he was one of David Cameron’s biggest cheerleaders – than on ability. Fair to say, it was an awkward 90 minutes for all concerned which raised rather more questions about Honest Bob than it answered. Zahawi started by saying there was nothing to see here. Honest Bob had given a full account of his dealings with the one-time pornographer Richard Desmond’s Westferry planning application in the Commons the day before – an account that had been in parts contradicted by documents released later in the day – and that the prime minister had full confidence in his housing secretary. Then Boris could hardly say anything else, given that a matey photo of the prime minister with an arm round Dirty Des had emerged overnight. It was case closed, said Zahawi hopefully. The BBC’s Justin Webb, LBC’s Nick Ferrari and TalkRadio’s Julia Hartley-Brewer all begged to differ. Perhaps we could just run through the sequence of events just three more times to see if we could clear up why everyone except a handful of people inside No 10 thought something dodgy had taken place. Perhaps Boris and Classic Dom’s sense of smell had still not returned after catching the coronavirus and they had failed to detect the whiff of sleaze. Nadhim started to sound sweaty. He had banked on being asked to explain why allowing a whole load of people to get pissed in pub car parks was an important step towards maintaining physical distance and reducing the rate of coronavirus infection. Instead he was forced to lumber to Honest Bob’s rescue, a task made even harder by the fact that his two synapses only rarely connect. So let’s start with the fundraising dinner. Was it just a total coincidence that Desmond, who was relying on the support of the housing secretary to approve a controversial planning application that had already been turned down by Tower Hamlets, happened to be sitting at the same table as Honest Bob? “Oh yes,” said Zahawi. Honest Bob didn’t have a clue who he would be sitting next to. In fact, he made a point of never asking who was going to be at any meeting he attended because he enjoyed the element of surprise. Then we came to the four-minute video of the development that Dirty Des had shown Honest Bob on his phone at the dinner. Ah! That was easily explained. Honest Bob had thought he was being shown a highlights clip of classic Readers’ Wives. And the housing secretary giving Dirty Des his personal mobile phone number? That was the kind of thing Honest Bob did all the time. Off the top of his head, he couldn’t think of anyone who didn’t have the minister’s number. That though was just the aperitif. Because after the dinner Dirty Des had texted honest Bob to ask him to get a bend on as he didn’t want to give the Marxists at Tower Hamlets £50m to help some of the most deprived communities in the country. Only then had Honest Bob replied that maybe they shouldn’t be having this conversation as it might look as if he was giving him preferential treatment. Which rather implied that was precisely what was going on. Then there had been silence until Honest Bob had rushed through the application, against all professional advice, the day before Dirty Des would have been liable for the £50m. “It was all about viability,” Zahawi said limply. There’s something rather pathetic about a politician who doesn’t know when to stop digging. Dirty Des wouldn’t have made as much profit if he had been asked to build a few more affordable homes that would be totally unaffordable to most people in the borough, so it was best to give the go ahead to the scheme that netted the developer the biggest return. Nadhim was sorry that Dirty Des had only made a £12,000 donation for a £50m saving. Still a benchmark of sorts had been set. If you live in Doncaster and stood to make a £50,000 profit, the Tories would be happy to nod it through for £12. Zahawi wasn’t the only one in search and rescue mode. There had been indications that after the first meeting of the liaison committee – the supergroup of select committee chairs that gets to interrogate the prime minister twice a year – that Bernard Jenkin, the committee’s chair who had been personally parachuted in by Boris himself, might not be the tame patsy he had first appeared. But on the Today programme Bernie was keen to correct the impression that he might have some kind of independent thought. When he had called for a review into the government’s handling of the pandemic, he didn’t mean it to be an inquiry into finding out any awkward facts of how the government could have avoided achieving the highest death rate in the world. “A review should not be about looking back,” he explained. Which was odd because most people understand the word review to mean precisely that. “It should be a rapid, forward-looking assessment of national preparedness.” So not so much a review as a preview. Not for the first time this morning, it was looking like the government was hell-bent on taking the country for fools."
2020-06-25T17:35:09Z,politics,Politics,Rebecca Long-Bailey: the Corbynite favourite who fell foul of Starmer,"Rebecca Long-Bailey was a fundamental part of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the Labour party, often seen warming up for him at speeches and glued to his side in the Commons. She was one of his most senior female frontbenchers as shadow business secretary and handily added northern working-class credentials to his heavily London-based team. Despite only becoming an MP in 2015, Long-Bailey was a natural choice as the leftwing successor to Corbyn, winning the backing of the union Unite for her “brains and brilliance” and the campaign group Momentum to run for the leadership against Starmer. Her loyalty to her former boss was unshakeable but it also led to ridicule, notably when she rated him 10 out of 10 as a politician just months after his crushing general election defeat.
Born in Salford in 1979 to a docker and trade unionist, Jimmy, and Una, a shop worker, she has spoken frequently about her upbringing, and how growing up she remembered the stress of the constant threat of redundancy facing her father throughout the 1980s. After attending local state schools she went to Manchester Metropolitan University to study politics and sociology. She then trained as a solicitor and specialised in commercial, property and NHS contract law. She joined the party in 2010 and grew more politically active thereafter. Others in the party have often commented on her relative obscurity. Some say she “came up through the unions”, and the latter have continued to loyally endorse her and her strong socialist politics. She was selected for the Salford and Eccles seat when Hazel Blears stood down in 2015, easily winning that year’s election. In parliament she was first appointed shadow minister for the Treasury in John McDonnell’s team. He often spoke of “Becky” having huge potential within the party for her work ethic and being on top of her brief. She became shadow chief secretary to the Treasury and then shadow business secretary in 2017. From that point on she was regularly sent out on the airwaves to represent Corbyn and also deputised for him at prime minister’s questions, after the usual choice, Emily Thornberry, was ditched for criticising the party’s Brexit policy. Her “green new deal” policy, developed under Corbyn, was a key part of the 2019 election manifesto and her own subsequent leadership bid. When she lost out to Starmer, her popularity on the left of the party ensured her a frontbench role, as shadow education secretary, replacing her friend and London flatmate Angela Rayner, who was elected deputy leader. Much has been made of her quiet private life. She said her perfect Friday night was eating a Chinese takeaway and watching Netflix in her pyjamas with her husband, Stephen Bailey, a marketing executive. For some, her home on one of the most expensive roads in Salford, dubbed “Monton Carlo”, did not quite square with her vision of being the party’s next socialist leader. But she is well-liked by councillors and party members in her Salford constituency, where her energies will now inevitably be focused."
2020-06-25T15:08:45Z,politics,Politics,The three housing controversies Robert Jenrick is facing down,"Even as someone still only 37 when he became a full cabinet minister last year, Robert Jenrick began as a relatively little-known member of Boris Johnson’s government. In the words of one profile, the MP for Newark since 2014 “rose without trace” – at least until now. Over the past few months, the communities secretary has faced a series of controversies, which in the past would perhaps have sunk a minister. There have been three main issues: His many homes – and movements between them While he has represented Newark, in Nottinghamshire, since winning a byelection in 2014, Jenrick has been criticised for having few ties there. The MP, a former solicitor, owns two properties in London, as well as Eye Manor, a Grade I-listed home in Herefordshire, and local people have complained they do not see him as much as they would like. At the peak of the coronavirus lockdown it emerged that Jenrick had visited yet another property, his parents’ home in Shropshire. While he conceded he had done this, he said it was to drop off food and medicines and he had not entered their house. It also emerged that Jenrick had travelled between London and Eye Manor, rather than his home in Newark. The Richard Desmond planning decision
As communities secretary, Jenrick has the power to intervene in planning decisions. In January, he did that, overruling an east London council and the government’s planning inspectorate to approve a £1bn development of flats for the former newspaper magnate Richard Desmond. Jenrick pushed through the decision a day before a community levy would have come into force, providing £45m for Tower Hamlets council to spend on local infrastructure. The council challenged the decision in court and Jenrick backed down, conceding a potential for bias.
It later emerged he had sat next to Desmond at a Conservative party fundraising event in November, where the former Express owner had shown him a PR video for the 44-storey development. Two weeks after the planning decision, Desmond gave the Conservatives £12,000. Amid increasing political pressure, Jenrick’s department released correspondence relating to the case that showed Desmond had texted him about the issue, and that Jenrick had urged officials to complete the process before the infrastructure levy came into force. The government insists Jenrick did nothing wrong, but further developments could sink his ministerial career. Jenrick’s own planning applications
This week it emerged he had enjoyed some good fortune of his own when it came to planning matters, with Conservative councillors in Westminster approving an extension to one of his London homes, even though officials had objected three times. The Times found that Jenrick had applied twice under his own name to have an extra room added to the house as part of wider renovations. A further application was made by his wife. Each time officials refused, saying it would damage the character of the building, which is in conservation area. But with the third application, made two months after Jenrick was elected as an MP, a Conservative councillor living in the square intervened to request the application be referred to a planning committee, which approved the plans."
2020-06-25T12:23:21Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson backs Robert Jenrick despite planning row,"Boris Johnson has full confidence in the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, Downing Street has insisted, despite fresh revelations about his relationship with the billionaire property developer Richard Desmond, in documents published this week. Pressed about Jenrick’s role in rushing through a decision on the development, allowing Desmond to avoid a £45m payment under the community infrastructure levy, Johnson’s official spokesman signalled that No 10 had no concerns. “Robert Jenrick has set out his account in public and to parliament, including publishing the relevant documentation, and in the light of this account the prime minister considers the matter closed,” he said. Johnson’s spokesman went on to give the same statement, repeatedly, in response to a string of other questions about Jenrick’s role in approving the housing development in east London, and his relationship with Desmond. Asked whether Johnson continued to have full confidence in Jenrick, he said, “yep”. Asked specifically whether Johnson had discussed the row with Jenrick, the spokesman said: “The PM speaks to his cabinet colleagues all the time, and has spoken to the communities secretary in recent days.” The bundle of documents, released to the communities select committee on Wednesday after Labour threatened to force a vote on the issue, revealed that Jenrick gave Desmond his phone number, after the pair sat next to each other at a Tory fundraising dinner in November. Desmond then lobbied the minister, telling him a decision was urgent because “we don’t want to give Marxists loads of doe [sic] for nothing!”
Emails from officials suggest Jenrick did seek to expedite the approval of the scheme, with one message saying “on timing, my understanding is that SoS [the secretary of state: Jenrick] is/was insistent that decision issued this week ie tomorrow – as next week the viability of the scheme is impacted by a change in the London CIL regime”. Clive Betts, the Labour MP who chairs the housing select committee, said the documents left a series of questions unanswered. Betts said Jenrick had given parliament the impression that his contact with the property developer ended after meeting him at a fundraising dinner in November. However, documents released on Wednesday night showed they had “extensive” contact afterwards and raises further questions about the minister’s propriety, Betts said. Betts told the Guardian: “The committee may well ask the minister to come to talk to us again and write and ask him for more information. The thing that surprised me was the continued connection and exchange of texts [with Desmond] after the dinner. The impression that he gave yesterday was he saw him at the dinner, saw a bit of video and that was it. That was clearly not what happened,” he said.
Betts said that he was shocked to see that Jenrick had apparently entertained the possibility of going to visit the site. “The arrangements to go on site would have not been appropriate and he seems to have realised that. There does appear to have been an error of judgment over his involvement,” he said. He said the committee could launch an inquiry into when ministers should withdraw from planning decisions. “We should look at when ministers should withdraw from involvement once they have been lobbied, to ensure that there is not even an appearance of being susceptible to lobbying. In planning matters, appearances are important,” he said. A business minister, Nadhim Zahawi, sought to defend Jenrick on Thursday, insisting there was no “smoking gun”. But he unintentionally fuelled controversy about Jenrick’s behaviour, appearing to suggest it was legitimate for planning issues to be raised at Conservative party events. Pressed on what a hypothetical Tory voter in Doncaster or Ashfield might think about Desmond’s ability to directly lobby the minister making the planning decision, Zahawi said they could consider doing the same thing. “Well, if people go to a fundraiser in their local area, in Doncaster, for the Conservative party, they’ll be sitting next to MPs and other people in their local area, and can interact with different parts of the authority,” he said. “The important thing is the access didn’t buy this billionaire a decision.” Asked about Zahawi’s comments, Betts said: “It ought to be made clear that there is no connection between donation and planning permissions.” The housing secretary has faced accusations of “cash for favours” after it emerged Desmond had personally given the Conservative party £12,000 two weeks after the scheme for 1,500 homes was approved. Jenrick had later to quash his own approval, conceding that the decision was unlawful. Asked whether anyone else in No 10 had met Desmond, or discussed the proposed development, the spokesman said: “No one in No10 discussed the appeal with Mr Desmond or the applicant. No 10 had no involvement with the secretary of state’s appeal decision.”"
2020-06-25T11:31:40Z,politics,Politics,Britain beyond lockdown: can UK become cleaner?,"Like many young people in Aberdeen, Mike Scotland dreamed of a well-paid job on a rig in the North Sea, in the oil and gas field that has made his home town a boom town for most of the past 40 years. In February the 28-year-old landed the position he had wanted with Shell, and he was due to take a helicopter to the Shearwater platform in July once he had completed training. “I don’t think I have ever been as excited about anything in my life,” he recalled. “All I ever wanted was to land a health and safety role on a rig. I really wanted to make a difference.” Then Covid-19 struck, oil prices crashed, new projects were cancelled and Scotland was laid off. He is now working as a team member at the KFC restaurant in the Haudagain retail park, where he earns the minimum wage. “I earn in a week what I would have made in a day on the rig, but I can support my family and that is the main thing,” said Scotland, whose fiancee is expecting their second child in July. “I appreciate I have a job. Many don’t.”
Intergenerational divide Since the start of the crisis, thousands of workers have been laid off in Aberdeen, which is the centre of the oil and gas industry in Europe. The town was already struggling to recover from a sharp fall in crude prices five years ago, as well as increasing social pressure to rein back on fossil fuels that are destabilising the climate. The pandemic looks likely to accelerate the shift towards renewable energy, but while this raises hopes for a greener future, it also throws up huge concerns about intergenerational injustice. Without government intervention, the young look set to take a double hit from the post-lockdown economic downturn and the energy transition.
No age group is immune to the shift, but those closer to retirement are more likely to have a nest egg saved up from the golden era of North Sea oil. Timothy Robinson, 62, a petroleum geologist, has decided to retire early as a result of the coronavirus downturn, which he believes is likely to choke the revival of the oil industry in Aberdeen “I have almost 40 years of experience in energy and it is currently undergoing by far the most fundamental changes I have ever seen. The only growth areas I can see for it in Aberdeen are decommissioning old rigs and offshore wind energy,” he said. “I would advise anyone who [is] entering the industry to focus on developing experience and expertise in areas that are CO2-neutral, because that is the future.”
In terms of the economic fallout from Covid-19, Aberdeen is likely to be among the worst-affected cities in Britain. This is partly because it has so much to lose. The city has grown affluent thanks to its offshore expertise, which is in demand around the world. The population here are highly globalised, and many technicians and consultants fly off for several months of the year to do lucrative contract work on oil fields in Africa, South America or Asia.
But a Guardian callout to readers about the impact of coronavirus revealed a huge number of job losses that some say are barely covered in the media. Nicola Gardiner, an Aberdeen resident whose husband works in the oil and gas industry, explained how her once-prosperous home city had been affected. Chatting on wicker chairs in the spacious garden outside her traditional granite house, she said house prices had slumped, people were stuck in negative equity and there were no jobs. Efforts to diversify the local economy by attracting more tourists have been hit by delays to the £350m harbour development. Restaurants and hotels are empty. “It’s a domino effect here as ‘Aber-dream’ turns to ‘Aber-nightmare’,” she said. “There are bleak times ahead. That’s what happens when an industry is dying and a pandemic arrives.”
A just transition On the seafront, seagulls circle noisily over roads and beaches that are considerably emptier than those along the coastline south of the border. A helicopter buzzes overhead, taking workers out to oil and gas platforms in the North Sea, but the number of such flights is far lower than six months ago. Andrew Duncan (not his real name) used to be a frequent passenger because he specialises in maintenance of drilling equipment. Last week he was laid off after more than five years’ employment at a major oil service company. He believes the Covid-19 crisis is being used by some firms as an excuse to accelerate restructuring plans. “I’m absolutely gutted. They went about it in an underhand, sneaky way,” he said. “I was treated as if I was just another asset, like a piece of equipment.” He asked for his name to be changed because a public complaint could undermine his chances of getting a new job in the close-knit oil town, but he is seething at his experience.
He is worried about how he can provide for his wife and child. “This is just the beginning. The oil industry faces a perfect storm of lockdown, low prices and climate change,” he said. Now he is applying for jobs in the wind turbine industry and oil rig decommissioning. “That is the future,” he said. He is encouraged by the Scottish government’s plans to support workers left adrift in the shift from fossil fuels to renewables. “If they could help me with training as a wind turbine technician, that would give me an extra chance.” The Scottish government has gone further than the rest of the UK in preparing its economy and workforce for a shift to renewables. Rachel McEwen is part of the Just Transition commission, which has been advising the Scottish government on ways to shift from high-carbon to low-carbon industry with minimum social disruption. “The opportunities for injustice are endless. We must think where bad things will happen and get ahead of them,” she said. She is also chief sustainability officer in one of Scotland’s leading companies, SSE, which last month announced a £3bn investment in a new windfarm off the Angus coast, just south of Aberdeen. The 1,075MW facility will be the country’s biggest ever privately funded project. McEwen said the numbers would mean little unless there was a positive social impact. “Companies like us have pinned our whole being on finding profitable solutions to climate change. If that transition is unfair, you delegitimise it. So we have an interest in ensuring it is done in a thoughtful and just way.”
The potential for wind energy is evident at the Balmedie sand dunes, a short drive outside town. Gusts off the North Sea billow through the marram grass, allow kite-surfers to soar above the breakers and spin the giant turbine blades of a windfarm that sits a short distance away from the coastline. Locals joke that these giant structures were built as close as possible to the Trump golf course to infuriate the US president. But they are part of a broader trend. Aberdeenshire is said to be the largest windfarm in Europe in terms of the number of on- and offshore turbines. This is a major reason why wind is now the cheapest form of energy in the UK and has provided a substantial portion of our electricity during lockdown. ‘Expect the worst and hope for the best’ Colette Cohen, the chief executiveof the Oil and Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen, is optimistic there will be more support for energy transition in Scotland. “From industry perspective and from government connections, I would say the only recovery is a green recovery. A lot of people have seen a better world and want a change,” she said. “It’s very exciting. It’s an amazing time to be involved in energy and technology.” Among the likely future developments are more offshore wind in the West Shetlands and the UK’s first hydrogen plant, which is expected within two years. But she warned there was likely to be a dip for between 18 months to three years, as the investment shifted direction. “That is the difficult time. That’s the worry. It is hard to see how we will navigate that effectively.” One element will be managing a generational shift: as boom-era oil workers retire and old rigs are decommissioned, opportunities for the young may be hard to find. Coronavirus has made that challenge even harder because it has shut down the service sector.
This week Scotland’s advisory group of economic recovery recommended that the government provide a two-year job lifeline and training scheme for young people as part of £6bn in stimulus spending. “If we don’t intervene radically to transform our economy, inequalities will drastically widen, with long-term scarring for communities across the country and for our young people in particular,” said the chair of the group, Benny Higgins. It is a sensible step in keeping with Scotland’s more cautious – and successful – approach to dealing with the virus itself. The country, which continues with tighter lockdown restrictions than England, has fewer cases relative to its population and a faster falling rate of infections. This prudent approach of acknowledging risk and alleviating adversity may explain why even the worst-affected workers find reasons for hope. Mike Scotland said he was throwing himself full-hearted into his new job at KFC, as well as continuing work on the mental health and environmental charities he founded. “I get it when people say they are having a bad time, but that is not an excuse to give up. I am looking at this as a life lesson, a step outside my comfort zone,” he said. In the long run, he said, he believed his generation would get more opportunities because they were more familiar with technology and more open to new ideas than those who had come before them. “I think there are a lot of people who want to change and are ready to change. But others who are not ready. I guess Covid could speed it up. People have had more time to be at home and to think,” he said. “We have to expect the worst and hope for the best.”"
2020-06-25T11:10:39Z,politics,Politics,EU parliament leader: Boris Johnson seems unwilling to find compromise in Brexit talks,"Boris Johnson appeared unwilling to compromise in order to secure a trade and security deal with Brussels when he joined EU leaders for a summit last week, one of the three who attended the meeting has told the Guardian. David Sassoli, the president of the European parliament, punctured a recent outbreak of optimism over a potential deal by warning that the EU had been left concerned at the end of a video conference call by the lack of “enthusiasm” to find common ground on the most contentious issues. After the discussions last Monday, the British prime minister insisted he could see no reason why an agreement could not be secured with Brussels by the end of July following intensified talks. In a joint statement, Johnson, Sassoli and the presidents of the European commission and council, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, had said “new momentum was required”. But in an interview with the Guardian, Sassoli warned that he had not been imbued with confidence the prime minister was ready to do what was necessary to secure agreement before the end of the transition period on 31 December. “Together, we are very worried because we don’t see great enthusiasm from the British authorities and we don’t see a strong will to get to an agreement that satisfies all parties,” he said. “Obviously as an agreement, it has to satisfy both parties that it cannot advantage one over the other. And this puts us in a situation in which at the moment we are frankly a little bit worried.” The two sides are stuck on issues of access to British waters for European fishermen and dispute resolution in a future deal, as well as the so-called level playing field provisions, where the EU has been demanding common environmental, labour and social standards. On Wednesday, Barnier reiterated that he was willing to work on “clever compromises” in the new rounds of talks scheduled in July and August, mentioning “regulatory equivalence” as an alternative to the UK incorporating EU state aid law into domestic legislation. Sassoli said Barnier had been given the “maximum margin” of flexibility by the member states to find a compromise, but that it “takes two to tango”. “There cannot be one party that prevails,” Sassoli said. “Basically, the fact that they don’t really want to build upon the political declaration, this really does disturb us greatly, because that has to be the basis for everything for the whole negotiation,” Sassoli said, in reference to the 27-page document agreed last year on the scope of a future deal. “We reached an agreement, and it now must be respected. This really is something which concerns us at the moment.” The UK has taken a minimalist approach to the agreement in the political declaration to incorporate level playing field provisions in a treaty ensuring neither side is able to undercut the other by downgrading their standards. The UK negotiator, David Frost, has rejected any deal that sets up EU law as the common standard to meet. Sassoli said that when the EU leaders emphasised during the meeting the need for a deal that would give the European fishing fleet fair access to UK waters, he was also concerned by the prime minister’s reply. “The response that was given by the prime minister was that fishermen voted for Brexit. We want to respect their point of view, of course, but we also believe that we’re talking here about a very important resource both for the UK and for Europe, and we’re talking about the sea, so we think we can come to a common agreement on this.” The prime minister has said he will not extend the transition period, with the deadline for an agreement on extra time passing next week. Sassoli said he had personally hoped that an extension would be sought given the difficulties in negotiating the terms of the future relationship during the coronavirus pandemic. Both Barnier and Frost have been infected with the virus during the crisis. Sassoli, an Italian MEP since 2009, who was elected the president of the parliament last year, said he feared Downing Street was seeking to rush the EU into decisions by shortening the timeframe for talks. He said: “This [extension] is something that I actually hoped would happen for technical reasons, because we know that covid has cost us a lot of time in negotiation, so it could have been a very good opportunity. If this really is our goal, if we want an agreement and it would have given us a few more weeks … “I do believe that it is a way to put the European Union in a difficult position, an unpleasant position, a position in which no one is is respecting the goodwill which was initially shown to go towards agreement.”"
2020-06-25T09:10:12Z,politics,Politics,Minister suggests voters could raise planning issues at Tory fundraisers,"A business minister has suggested voters could consider attending Conservative fundraising events if they want to raise planning issues with MPs, after the property developer Richard Desmond lobbied a cabinet minister at a Tory party dinner. Nadhim Zahawi said the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, had done nothing wrong as calls grew for Jenrick to resign after the release of documents showing he “insisted” a planning decision for a £1bn development by Desmond should be rushed through to reduce costs by £45m. “There is no smoking gun here. The intention was to get more housing built, quickly, for people who really need it,” Zahawi told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about Jenrick’s decision to approve the Westferry development in east London, overruling earlier planning decisions. Pressure on Jenrick has increased after documents about the case, released by his department, showed he wanted the approval signed off immediately in January, to avoid Desmond’s company having to pay Tower Hamlets council a community infrastructure levy of £45m, which would have been spent on local infrastructure. Text message exchanges in the documents reveal how Desmond, the former Express titles newspaper owner and pornographer, lobbied Jenrick to speed up the decision and thus avoid the payment.
The messages came after Desmond sat next to Jenrick at a Conservative fundraising event in November, at which the developer showed Jenrick a promotional video about the 1,500-apartment, 44-storey development on his phone. Two weeks after Jenrick made the decision in favour of Desmond, the developer donated £12,000 to the Conservative party. Zahawi said Jenrick had subsequently refused Desmond’s offer of a meeting, and had wanted to save Desmond’s company the £45m charge to make the scheme viable. “Viability is incredibly important,” he said. “Getting stuff built is important to Robert Jenrick. That was his motivation, but when there was a perception of bias he pulled back on this, pulled the plug on it, and will allow a different minister to decide the scheme.” Pressed on what a hypothetical Tory voter in Doncaster or Ashfield might think about Desmond’s ability to directly lobby the minister making the planning decision, Zahawi said they could consider doing the same thing. “Well, if people go to a fundraiser in their local area, in Doncaster, for the Conservative party, they’ll be sitting next to MPs and other people in their local area, and can interact with different parts of the authority,” he said. “The important thing is the access didn’t buy this billionaire a decision.” The documents detailing Jenrick’s contacts with Desmond were released on Wednesday after the minister faced a vote to force the issue. One text message shows how Desmond lobbied Jenrick on avoiding having to pay the community infrastructure levy to Labour-run Tower Hamlets council, the poorest borough in London, saying: “We don’t want to give Marxists loads of doe [sic] for nothing!” Speaking before Zahawi on Today, Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said the case raised some troubling issues about access and influence in what Jenrick had done. “I don’t for a moment suggest that he took his decision simply because of a donation to the Conservative party, but the fact is that, for the price of a dinner, the developer was able to present his scheme to the minister, follow up with texts, and seek to influence the decision,” Lord Kerslake said. While Jenrick “got to the right place in the end” by eventually reversing his decision and removing himself from the process, Kerslake added: “None of that process should happen in these circumstances.” He said: “It creates the impression – and appearance here is really important – that the developer has some level of influence in the decisions.” Following the documents’ release the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, responded to an urgent query from Labour by stating: “The prime minister considers that the matter is closed.”"
2020-06-25T08:58:22Z,politics,Politics,Robert Jenrick under pressure to resign after donor-row documents released,"The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, is under pressure to resign after newly released documents indicated that he “insisted” a planning decision for a £1bn property development should be rushed through so a Conservative donor’s company could reduce costs by £45m. In one document, a civil servant in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government wrote that the secretary of state (SoS) wanted the Westferry development in east London to be signed off the following day so that Richard Desmond’s company would avoid the community infrastructure levy (CIL). “On timing, my understanding is that SoS is/was insistent that decision issued this week ie tomorrow – as next week the viability of the scheme is impacted by a change in the London CIL regime,” the official wrote. Text message exchanges reveal how Desmond, the former Express titles newspaper owner and pornographer, lobbied Jenrick to expedite the development to avoid the need to pay an extra £45m to Labour-run Tower Hamlets council, the poorest borough in London, saying: “We don’t want to give Marxists loads of doe [sic] for nothing!” Jenrick subsequently overturned a decision by the council and the government’s planning inspectorate in order to approve a 1,500-apartment, 44-storey development at Westferry Printworks, a former printing plant in east London. The documents were released on Wednesday after Jenrick faced a debate and vote, and was accused by critics of potentially breaking the ministerial code. The code instructs all ministers to “declare and resolve any interests and relationships” and “take decisions impartially, fairly and on merit, using the best evidence and without discrimination or bias”. Following the documents’ release the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, responded to an urgent query from Labour by stating: “The prime minister considers that the matter is closed.” The housing secretary has faced accusations of “cash for favours” after it emerged Desmond had personally given the Conservative party £12,000 two weeks after the scheme for 1,500 homes was approved. Jenrick has since had to quash his own approval, conceding the decision was unlawful. The shadow communities secretary, Steve Reed, has written to Jenrick, posing a series of further questions, including the date he notified officials in his department about meeting Desmond at the Conservative fundraising dinner. Reed said the documents published on Wednesday “raise far more questions about the secretary of state’s relationship with Richard Desmond than they answer,” adding, “whether the prime minister likes it or not, this matter is far from closed.” He called on Jenrick to return to the House of Commons to explain what he called discrepancies, between the minister’s account, and the events laid out in the documents. Labour has now raised a point of order in the Commons, claiming there were discrepancies in his account to the house and those that appear in the documents. Jenrick sat next to Desmond at a Tory fundraising dinner on 18 November. Afterwards he sent the tycoon a text saying it was “good to spend time” with him. Two days later Desmond lobbied Jenrick via text message about the deal and arranged a site visit for him. He wrote: “Your efficient PA … has arranged a meeting for 19th December at 10.30am for meet and site visit … we appreciate the speed as we don’t want to give Marxists loads of doe [sic] for nothing!” The message was signed off: “Thanks again, all my best Richard.” Jenrick, apparently recognising that he was being lobbied, replied: “Richard. As secretary of state it is important not to give any appearance of being influenced by applicants of cases that I may have a role in or to have predetermined them and so I think it is best if we don’t meet until the matter has been decided, one way of [sic] another … I hope that is okay and we can meet to discuss other matters soon, hopefully the 19th. Robert.” Desmond replied: “Absolutely understood Look forward to meeting on 19th to celebrate the big majority. Best Richard.” On the same day, emails appear to show that Jenrick asked officials in his department to prepare a ministerial decision. A housing department official wrote: “SoS has flagged a case in Westferry Docklands (redevelopment of a printworks or something like that?) He understands a ministerial decision on this is likely to be coming up soon and also that there may be some sensitivity with timing on final decision.” Layla Moran, the Lib Dem MP, said Jenrick’s position is “completely untenable”. “These documents are further evidence that he rushed through this planning decision to help a Tory donor avoid paying millions in tax. “This whole grubby saga netted the Tory party only £12,000, but could have helped Richard Desmond save up to £40m. The public will be appalled at what looks like a clear abuse of power. Robert Jenrick should go and the Conservative party should hand back this donation,” she said. Andrew Wood, a Tory councillor in Tower Hamlets who resigned from the party over Jenrick’s handling of Westferry, issued a five-word statement: “I was right to resign.”
The released documents are part of a tranche of 129 pages relating to Westferry Printworks . They come after Jenrick admitted to MPs that he saw promotional images of the development on Desmond’s mobile phone at the fundraiser, as revealed by the Sunday Times. Jenrick told MPs: “I recognise that there are higher standards of transparency expected in the quasi-judicial planning process, which is why I will also release discussions and correspondence which the government would not normally release.” He added: “This was a decision taken with an open mind on the merits of the case after a thorough decision-making process.” During the debate Clive Betts, the chair of the housing, communities and local government committee, questioned why Jenrick had waited until Labour tabled a debate on his role in the development to release the documents. “I think it might have been helpful if we had had it before the debate today,” he said. Steve Reed, the shadow housing secretary, asked about the Conservative party fundraising dinner in November, attended by both Jenrick and Desmond. “I understand Mr Desmond’s lobbyists, a company called Thorncliffe, had been busy selling tickets to the event to people who wanted access to the secretary of state,” he said. “Ministers are not allowed to take planning decisions if they have been lobbied by the applicant and, under the ministerial code, ministers are required not to place themselves under an obligation by, for instance, helping to raise funds from a donor who stands to benefit from the decisions they make because it raises questions about cash for favours – which would be a serious abuse of power.” Sedwill wrote in response to Labour: “The secretary of state has today written to the housing, communities and local government select committee stating that he has set out a full and factual account. I understand that he has also published a number of documents in support of this account. In light of this account, the prime minister considers that the matter is closed.” This article was amended on 25 June 2020 to correct the figure for the number of apartments in the Westferry development."

Thanks for reading and commenting. For the latest developments in the Jenrick story, read my colleague Rajeev Syal’s latest article:
And, for those not fully up to speed, here’s the background:
You can read a summary of the day’s earlier events here."
2020-06-24T19:17:16Z,politics,Politics,The Robert Jenrick planning row explained,"Why is the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, at the centre of controversy over a £1bn building development? Jenrick granted planning permission for a £1bn property scheme two weeks before the developer donated £12,000 to the Conservative party. Jenrick and his housing department initially backed a plan by the billionaire for media tycoon Richard Desmond to construct 1,524 apartments on a site in the Isle of the Dogs, east London. As documents released on Wednesday confirm, Jenrick knew that Desmond had only 24 hours to have the development approved before new council community charges were imposed that would have cost him about £45m. Desmond said the charge would have made the whole scheme unviable and put the accompanying social housing at risk. Jenrick later accepted that his approval of Desmond’s project on the old Westferry Road printworks in January was unlawful. What was the £45m charge that Desmond could have avoided? The proposed property development was to be sited is in London’s poorest borough of London, Tower Hamlets. The £45m charge was part of the local council’s community infrastructure levy (CIL). This is a local “tax” on residential and business property developments in Tower Hamlets that the council reinvests in poorer communities, funding projects such as health clinics and educational facilities. Why did Jenrick reverse his original decision on the development? The housing secretary admitted that any “fair-minded and informed observer” could conclude there was a “real possibility of bias”, but he insisted he had not been biased in favour of Desmond’s project.
He then quashed his original decision and has now handed over the final say on whether the project will go ahead to another minister. The Labour mayor of Tower Hamlets and others, including a former Tory councillor, believe he did so to avoid having to release crucial documents relating to his original decision. Mayor John Biggs remarked that Jenrick’s “reluctance to disclose them speaks volumes”. Why has the Labour party called for an inquiry into the affair? Desmond, the former owner of the Daily and Sunday Express alongside the Star titles, has donated to the Conservatives. Desmond paid £12,000 to attend a Tory Carlton Club fundraising dinner last November at which he and other property developers sat with Jenrick. Jenrick has admitted that he viewed a promotional video of the Isle of Dogs development on Desmond’s mobile phone at the event, but he insists he was “inadvertently” seated next to him. Documents released on Wednesday revealed that Desmond subsequently texted Jenrick repeatedly, underlining the importance of a quick decision, because “we don’t want to give the Marxists loads of doe [sic] for nothing”. In another newly released memo, officials in Jenrick’s department said he was “insistent that decision issued this week ie tomorrow – because next week the viability of the scheme is impacted by a change in the London CIL egime”. Jenrick agreed to publish the documents after Labour threatened to force a vote in the Commons demanding their release, claiming there were “cash-for-favours concerns” that must be investigated. Will there be any lasting damage to the housing secretary or the Conservative party? One long-serving Conservative councillor in Tower Hamlets, Andrew Wood, has resigned from the Tories in protest over the affair and has called on MPs on parliament’s housing select committee to launch an investigation. Downing Street says Boris Johnson has full confidence in Jenrick, and a string of loyal Tory MPs stood up in the Commons to defend him as a champion of housebuilding. The documents, however, raise fresh questions about his role. The controversy has raised suspicions again over the links between big business and the Conservative party, which enjoys the largesse of multimillionaires and billionaires such as Desmond. The Liberal Democrats have raised questions in parliament about whether the housing secretary had broken the ministerial code. The code is a set of rules and guidelines to uphold proper standards of conduct among ministers. It instructs all ministers to “declare and resolve any interests and relationships” and “take decisions impartially, fairly and on merit, using the best evidence and without discrimination or bias”."
2020-06-24T18:39:24Z,politics,Politics,Lady Scotland to stay on as Commonwealth secretary general,"Lady Scotland, the controversial Commonwealth secretary general, will remain in post until next year, despite Downing Street sowing doubts about her future. Following reports that Boris Johnson had used his role as chair of the Commonwealth organisation to prevent Scotland’s reappointment, she has been given a formal written contract to remain in post at least until the next Commonwealth heads of government summit, which is likely to take place in mid-2021 in Rwanda. Scotland has been under fire from Downing Street for alleged profligacy and internal audits which revealed some contracts had been offered outside the normal competitive tendering process. Her first four-year term was due to expire this week, but before a virtual meeting of Commonwealth heads that she had convened for Wednesday, the UK government sent her a letter extending her role until the summit. The secretariat said: “The usual reappointment process for Commonwealth secretary generals occurs when leaders gather for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, therefore the chair in office has proposed that, as is customary, the reappointment process will now take place when CHOGM is able to meet.’’ Scotland’s allies claim the majority of nations want her to be reappointed. Scotland, a Labour peer, had called the virtual meeting to discuss the effects of coronavirus on the Commonwealth, including the impact of escalating debt problems and the need for relief. The UK government had challenged the calling of the three-hour summit, saying it had been convened at short notice and without any clear purpose. Scotland’s allies pointed out that most other comparable multilateral organisations had been convened on an emergency basis to respond to the coronavirus crisis, and the proposed meeting had first been suggested in April. Citing the short notice and lack of consultation, the UK government did not dispatch a minister to the meeting, but instead sent Philip Parham, its Commonwealth envoy. Some sources claimed many other countries did not send senior representatives in a sign of disapproval, but the Commonwealth secretariat said it had “received significant support for such a meeting from a majority of Commonwealth member states”. It said 45 countries, or 80% of Commonwealth states, had sent government representatives. Boris Johnson said earlier this month that there was no consensus within the 54-nation Commonwealth for Scotland to be given a second term, and despite the calls from some nations for her to be reappointed for another four years she remains on a form of probation. The process of countries expressing views about Scotland’s future is not fully transparent. Scotland’s supporters recognise that the Commonwealth operates best through consensus, but argued that if this requirement was pushed to its extreme, a small group of countries could, in effect, operate a veto both over calling meetings and the appointment of the secretary general. UK officials deny that the nucleus of opposition to Scotland is coming from the Anglosphere nations, but it is true that she enjoys strong support from the Caribbean nations and smaller states. Scotland was attorney general under Gordon Brown, and the timing of the UK’s objections are said to be linked to her politics and whether they will stand in the way as the government forges ahead with setting up a new Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. The “global Britain” agenda is likely to give a central role to the Commonwealth, and if Downing Street is determined to oust Scotland, Britain will have to organise support for an alternative candidate before next year’s summit. The UK regards the Commonwealth as an asset. Buckingham Palace will be watching the row with concern. Speaking on Wednesday at the launch of his book The Great Imperial Hangover, Samir Puri, a lecturer at King’s College’s war studies department, said the Commonwealth, with its common legal and parliamentary assumptions, still had a remarkable ability to convene professional networks and leverage power. He said the eventual death of the Queen might act as a seismic shock to the Commonwealth and require a re-examination of the UK’s role."
2020-06-24T17:03:25Z,politics,Politics,Boris the narcissists’ narcissist flails wildly as PMQs exposes cracks | John Crace,"What a difference a day makes. On Tuesday, Boris Johnson had been in his comfort zone. The Mr Bright Side telling the Commons more or less what it wanted to hear and getting little pushback even from opposition MPs. The saviour releasing the country from months of hibernation. Trusting everyone to still observe the essentials of social distancing even while they were getting pissed in newly-opened pubs and bars. Prime minister’s questions, though, exposes Boris’s fallibilities. Not because he is too lazy to properly prepare and isn’t nearly as clever as he imagines himself to be – though both of those things are true – but because the very idea causes his psyche to go into meltdown. Johnson is the narcissists’ narcissist. He believes in his inalienable right to do whatever he pleases. Even the merest hint of a challenge is an insult to his fragile ego. Someone more self-aware might realise that the coronavirus is nowhere near half-done. That mistakes have been made and others may well be in the future. That the pandemic can make fools of anyone and a degree of humility might be in order if he is to keep the country onside in the weeks and months ahead. People can forgive a lot if they feel they aren’t being taken for mugs. But for Boris any admission of failure or liability is a psychological impossibility. Asking Boris to take responsibility for his own actions is pointless. He just can’t do it, because he is the centre of his own universe, locked into his own closed system of thought. What he wants he must have. So it follows that whatever he does must automatically be right. People who disagree with him or are no longer useful to him are easily discarded as inconveniences. The trouble is that Boris can dump wives, mistresses, ministers and friends but he just can’t get rid of Keir Starmer. For the first time in his life, Johnson has come up against an immovable object. And rather than accept the inevitable, Boris has merely allowed himself to regress. Initially he saw the Labour leader as a mild inconvenience – an unwelcome intrusion into his alternative reality – but, after discovering that he couldn’t make him go away with mockery, a few cheap gags and by trying to turn the session into an interrogation of Starmer, his feelings have turned to hatred. Keir has got under his opponent’s skin. Somewhere in Boris’s subconscious he knows that Starmer is both better briefed and a great deal sharper and he can’t bear it. So all he can do is lash out, flailing wildly, tilting at windmills. Part of Starmer’s skill is to keep things simple. His questions have a logic that even a 10-year old can follow. It’s just a shame that Boris is still stuck in the toddler age of development. The Labour leader began by pointing out that easing restrictions was all very well providing that the track-and-trace system was functioning properly. Which at present it wasn’t as it was missing two-thirds of cases. So how did the government propose to get it working properly by 4 July? Boris was outraged. How could the person who had offered him cautious support the day before dare to now challenge him on the detail? That was the kind of disloyalty only he was allowed. The Labour leader just kept plugging away. This wasn’t obstruction, it was constructive criticism, he observed, as he reiterated the point that he was quoting from the government’s own data and wasn’t interested in the one-third of the system that was working. He then moved on to the app that had been downgraded in the past few weeks from critical and world-beating to “additional support” before observing that the prime minister had misled the house on the child poverty figures last week and would he mind correcting himself. Just for the record. All that Boris had to offer was histrionics and lies. Gestures of feigned “What me Guv?” innocence, combined with blatant untruths. Boris still labours under the impression that if you tell a lie often enough then it somehow becomes true. But what might work on the campaign trail on the side of buses just doesn’t cut it when you’re supposed to be the prime minister during the greatest health crisis for a century. We reached full-on meltdown shortly after Johnson claimed he had never said the app would be anything other than “icing on the cake” – since Boris begins each day as a tabula rasa, he must think the rest of us are equally amnesiac – when he went back to the tactic of asking Starmer about schools that had been moderately successful the week before. Only this time it failed dismally as Starmer had long since answered it. The few dozen Tory backbenchers in the chamber kept their heads down. They were as embarrassed as Boris would have been had he the capacity for that level of empathy. It’s slowly dawning on most Tories that Boris just isn’t up to the job as they witness their leader unravel at PMQs week after week. Nor do many have much faith in his ability to make the right calls at the right time with the pandemic. And having used up what little goodwill he might have had – Boris has never bothered to conceal his contempt for most, make that all, of his colleagues – his support is dwindling. Too many more PMQs like this and something will start to give. And as Boris is incapable of change, then it can’t be long before his suitability for the job comes under scrutiny from his own party. It was probably always inevitable that the person who would ultimately destroy Boris was Boris himself. But Starmer is doing a great job of exposing his faults. There is a crack in everything. That’s how the light gets in."
2020-06-24T16:42:39Z,politics,Politics,Anger grows over decision to merge DfID and Foreign Office,"Anger is growing over the government’s decision to merge the overseas aid department with the Foreign Office, with senior Tories and ex-ministers demanding Boris Johnson install a development minister in the cabinet. The Conservative former secretary of state for the Department for International Development (DfID) Andrew Mitchell is among the signatories to a cross-party letter sent to the prime minister that also calls for the retention of the Commons international development committee (IDC) and the scrutiny body, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI). More than 70 parliamentarians have signed the letter led by a former IDC chair, Lord Malcolm Bruce, to say scrutiny on aid following the sudden merger is vital and the UK must show it is “not turning its back on the world’s poorest”. Bruce, a Liberal Democrat peer who chaired the committee for a decade from 2005 to 2015, said: “The new proposals abruptly announced without consultation have caused dismay across all parties, including your own. “Adopting the measures we are proposing would go a considerable way to reassuring those who wish to maintain the UK’s world leadership on development and the soft power benefits it brings. “It would also give a strong signal that the new arrangement will not lead to the UK abandoning its commitments to the poor people of the world living in low income countries.”
The government announced it was merging DfID, which has a budget of around £15bn, with the Foreign Office earlier this month. The new Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office will be set up in the autumn. DfID was set up by Tony Blair and many Conservatives have long called for it to be axed. Last week Johnson disparagingly said it had been “treated as some giant cashpoint in the sky that arrives without any reference to UK interests”. Mitchell established the ICAI while he was secretary of state between 2010 and 2012. It is an independent public body that scrutinises British aid spending. Tory peers who have signed the letter also include former health secretary Lord Lansley and former Welsh minister Lord Bourne. Also joining the call were the current IDC chair, Labour MP Sarah Champion, and the former DfID ministers Lord Triesman, a crossbencher, the Lib Dems Lady Featherstone and Lady Northover and Labour’s Lord Foulkes. Champion said the simplest way to ensure proper oversight of UK aid spend was to expand the committee she chairs. “At the moment, the plan is to expand the foreign affairs committee. But ODA [overseas developments assistance] spend cuts across many different departments. You need a committee that has that reach,” she said. The foreign affairs committee, which is chaired by Tom Tugendhat, is already working on six inquiries. ODA, which is governed by four different acts of parliament, has to alleviate poverty as well as delivering “value for money for the taxpayer” she said, all of which requires independent scrutiny. The committee’s interim report into the effectiveness of aid, published earlier this month, argued strongly that an independent aid-giving department with a cabinet-level minister leading its work was imperative if the UK was to help end extreme poverty."
2020-06-24T16:20:16Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings could face inquiry over special advisers,"Dominic Cummings is facing a possible parliamentary inquiry following claims No 10 is exerting excessive control over ministers’ special advisers, the Guardian has learned. The FDA union, which represents more than a dozen “spads”, has asked the public administration and constitutional affairs committee to investigate why the prime minister’s chief of staff has been given extra powers. It follows concerns that Cummings, on behalf of Boris Johnson, has centralised power in No 10 and is impeding the roles of cabinet ministers and parliament. According to latest government figures, there were 109 special advisers in December, more than half of whom were new to government, costing just under £10m a year. In the past, cabinet ministers typically hired and oversaw their own special advisers, who are political appointees paid from the public purse, though the prime minister approved all appointments. Since September, the Cabinet Office has required advisers to sign new contracts, which say the responsibility for their conduct and discipline will be jointly held between the appointing minister and the PM’s chief of staff. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA, has written to William Wragg, chair of the committee, saying there is mounting evidence that the role of spads has been radically altered to break the link with ministers and put Cummings in charge. “We have a cadre of special advisers with little security of employment and who are being directly managed by No 10 through the PM’s chief of staff. Even without the concern over how this power over employment is being deployed, it is clear that there is a deliberate approach from No 10 to fundamentally change the nature of the role,” he wrote. The committee has agreed to examine the complaint, which could result in Cummings being asked to give evidence to MPs.
The FDA letter claimed that weekly meetings for special advisers, chaired by Cummings, are being used to enforce the idea that spads are now run from Downing Street, not by ministers. “There was a consistent message that special advisers were being directed in their work and essentially centrally run. The conduct of these meetings was also criticised as being overly confrontational,” Penman wrote. Following the election, Penman added, spads were being used as a central resource and moved around different departments by No 10. “This resulted in some special advisers being left without posts, and concern that the process for determining who stayed, moved or left not only lacked transparency, but was being used to exert control and dilute the relationship between minister and adviser,” he wrote. One former permanent secretary told the Guardian there was a belief in Whitehall that Cummings was forcing out independent-minded advisers to create a pool of spads who could keep an eye on departments. “The concept of ‘No 10 narks’, placed in departments to keep a close eye on ministers and civil servants, is gaining ground,” he said. Cummings is facing a sex discrimination claim from Sajid Javid’s former special adviser Sonia Khan, after she was frogmarched out of Downing Street by a police officer last year. Javid resigned as chancellor in February after refusing to fire all five of his advisers. Before Johnson, special advisers were chosen by ministers themselves and worked directly to them, but were ultimately hired by the PM. In a further development, the Conservative party has launched a new process for the hiring of media and digital staff using the website www.spadjobs.uk. In a break from tradition, the strategic advisory firm Hanbury Strategy will do the initial recruitment. Paul Stephenson, a founding partner of the firm, was director of communications for the Vote Leave campaign. Though the initial screening will be done by Hanbury, the new intake of spads will only be appointed if the government’s director of communications, Lee Cain, approves, which is said to be the normal hiring convention. The Conservative party did not respond to a request for a comment. Cummings, the former Vote Leave campaigner who worked closely with Johnson during the general election, has faced intense criticism for driving 260 miles to Durham with his sick wife during the height of the coronavirus pandemic and making a further 52 miles round trip to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight. One of Johnson’s closest allies accused Cummings last week of overseeing a reign of terror in Downing Street. Tim Montgomerie, the creator of the ConservativeHome website and an adviser to Johnson until February, said: “He [Cummings] shouldn’t be in a leadership position, he shouldn’t be in a dominant position. And I’m afraid that is what has happened inside Downing Street.” A spokesperson for the select committee said MPs were considering whether to hold an evidence session or launch a full inquiry in light of a backlog of inquiries because of Covid-19. “It will remain something the committee will be looking at closely but it remains to be seen if it will be [examined by an] individual evidence session or a full inquiry,” he said. No 10 did not respond to a request for a comment."
2020-06-24T16:19:01Z,politics,Politics,"Gazza, Caino and Roxstar: the strange world of Dominic Cummings' 'spads'","In the weeks before coronavirus forced Dominic Cummings to hold No 10’s weekly special adviser meetings by Zoom, the “spads” described an atmosphere of forced jollity akin to the mockumentary The Office. Amid reports of a cabinet reshuffle that would force many of them to lose their jobs, those close to the prime minister’s chief of staff would be referred to by their nicknames – while others waited to be reprimanded for a perceived failure. Cummings, himself a former spad, referred to “Gazza”, the prime minister’s political secretary, Ben Gascoigne; “Caino”, Lee Cain, No 10’s director of communications; and “Roxstar”, the former Vote Leave press officer turned foreign office special adviser, Rob Oxley. “It was awful, macho and silly. And you could see that they were completely unaware – or did not care – about how they were coming across,” said one former adviser. “It was a show of power and obvious who was running the special advisers now.” In a matter of months since Johnson was elected the leader of the Conservative party, Cummings had helped transform the system governing ministers’ closest advisers so that he now had the power to control staff and move them from department to department with Johnson’s say-so – and, crucially, without needing a green light from ministers. Cummings had fulfilled his ambition of combining the Treasury and No 10 media operations, losing Sajid Javid in the process – the chancellor and former home secretary had refused to accept that his five special advisers would be sacked and replaced by Downing Street’s chosen spads. Cummings had also overseen the removal by a police officer of Javid’s former spad, Sonia Khan, from Downing Street for allegedly speaking to another former adviser. She is taking a sex discrimination case against Cummings and the government to an employment tribunal. Advisers who had shown dissent, such as the former defence spad Lynn Davidson, were also eased out. At one weekly meeting in February, she told Cummings he was “out of order” for publicly criticising young special advisers. A month later, she was offered what was considered to be an effective demotion to become an adviser in education or health, although Tory sources denied that Cummings was involved in the dispute. According to one former close confidant of Johnson and Cummings, they want to force spads to stop interdepartmental frictions and instil greater discipline, ensuring that Johnson does not have to spend time rebutting claims put out by the staff of ambitious ministers. “The PM wants to get on with the job and not waste his time dealing with claims that cabinet ministers always try and distance themselves from. It can be a huge waste of resources,” the source said. Senior Conservatives, however, have grown increasingly concerned by the move. In a pointed comment piece for the Observer this week, Sir Bernard Jenkin, the liaison committee chair and former ally of Johnson, wrote: “Frustrations make No 10 advisers hyperactive, ever more directive, controlling, even bullying. The effect is always the same. It leads to cabinet ministers feeling sidelined and hectored and senior officials becoming disengaged, resigned, even resentful.”
Spads are a specific type of adviser, first introduced in 1964 and turned into anti-heroes by The Thick of It, the Armando Iannucci comedy about the dark arts of politics. A kind of temporary civil servant, they can be either policy experts brought in for their specialism in a certain department or media advisers who act as go-betweens with journalists and plan how to communicate with the public. They have traditionally been recruited by ministers although their job is then signed off by the prime minister. The career of a spad is a perilous one, as their fortunes rise and fall along with their ministers, and they frequently lose their post when their political master is sacked.
Spad numbers have risen in the last three decades, with 84 under Tony Blair, 74 under Gordon Brown, and more than 100 in the coalition. As of December 2019, there were 109 special advisers in government.Cummings set out his many criticisms, plus an agenda for greater centralisation of Whitehall, in a talk for the IPPR thinktank in 2014 called “The Hollow Men: what’s wrong with Westminster and Whitehall, and what to do about it.” He railed against the inability to get rid of failing staff during the years when he advised Michael Gove as education secretary under David Cameron. “Almost no one is ever fired,” he said. “Time after time after time, I would be in the [education] department and on a TV screen it would say, ‘Latest Gove disaster, Gove botches X’, and I would look through the glass screen and you would see the official responsible for it at the lift, pottering home at 3.30 in the afternoon, doesn’t care. Why not? Because failure is normal, it is not something to be avoided.” In the days after playing a key role in winning the EU referendum in 2016, Cummings reportedly sent a memo to Johnson and Gove, while they were still potential running mates in a Tory leadership battle, outlining his plans for Whitehall centralisation.
“Change the No 10 and 11 system so it’s essentially one team, not two rival power centres,” he wrote, according to the book All Out War by the Sunday Times’s political editor, Tim Shipman. There would, Cummings concluded, “be huge resistance from officials. One of the crucial jobs is to figure this out before getting in, so you can smash through changes fast”. Insiders say the plan has been to develop a central pool of special advisers on the heels of Cummings’ advert for “misfits and weirdos” to join the policy arm of the civil service – a process that courted significant criticism for hiring Andrew Sabisky, a temporary contractor who was forced to resign over comments about eugenics and race. Instead, the Conservative party has started a new process for the hiring of media and digital staff specifically – kickstarted with the launch of the website www.spadjobs.uk – which states that the government is also considering applicants from a corporate background and that a background in journalism is not needed. Usually, such positions are not openly advertised and are filled by those known to the party, with ministers typically having a large input. In a significant break with past practices, the strategic advisory firm Hanbury Strategy will do the initial recruitment. Paul Stephenson, a founding partner of the firm and an ally of Cummings, was director of communications for the Vote Leave campaign. Interviews of potential Spads were supposed to take place in March. The Conservative party did not respond to a request for a comment. Friends of Cummings have insisted that far from centralising power in Whitehall, he wishes to hand it back to departments, and have indicated that the government will fight claims of discrimination by Khan. In comments reported on Twitter by Paul Goodman, the editor of ConservativeHome, Cummings told a meeting of spads on Monday – thought to be his first since the furore over his travels to and around Durham during lockdown – that he will aim for a smaller centre of government. “Anybody who has read what I’ve said about management over the years will know it’s ludicrous to suggest the solution to Whitehall’s problems is a bigger centre and more centralisation … it’s already far too big, incoherent and adds to the problems with departments,” he reportedly said."
2020-06-24T14:17:09Z,politics,Politics,Nicola Sturgeon: no 'reckless race' with rest of UK on lockdown easing,"Nicola Sturgeon has said she is not prepared to put lives at risk “in some kind of reckless race with other parts of the UK”, as she faced criticism for maintaining the 2-metre rule for businesses despite having announced plans for school pupils to return from August with no distancing in place. Scotland’s first minister set out indicative dates for further easing of the country’s lockdown rules – including lifting the five-mile travel restriction from next Friday and reopening beer gardens from the following Monday – as weekly data from the National Records of Scotland showed a reduction in deaths for the eighth consecutive week. Continuing to urge caution, she told the Scottish parliament: “Our pace is slightly slower than England but it is, in my view, right for our circumstances and, I hope, more likely to be sustainable than if we went faster now.” The Scottish Conservative party leader, Jackson Carlaw, called on Sturgeon to act more quickly on the 2-metre question – which she has asked the Scottish government’s scientific advisory group to report on by 2 July – after a survey by the Scottish Tourism Alliance found a majority of businesses felt the current distancing rules made reopening impossible. Criticising the “go-slow approach”, Carlaw highlighted the practical implications of lifting the five-mile travel limit, noting that from 3 July Scots will be allowed to go on holiday to England but not in their own country, where the tourism sector is not due to reopen until 15 July. Sturgeon responded: “I am not prepared to [put lives at risk] in some kind of reckless race with other parts of the UK.” She added: “Our careful approach has brought us to where we are now.” She said while it was not “fair or justified to criticise other leaders taking very difficult decisions”, she had still not seen the evidence that underpinned Boris Johnson’s announcement on Tuesday of a relaxing of the 2-metre rule for England. “The worst thing I could do right now, and I understand the pressures that businesses are under, is to take decisions that I thought were hasty, not properly based on evidence, that risked a second wave or further outbreaks of this virus,” she said. On Wednesday afternoon the head of Scotland’s largest teaching union said his members were “anxious, frustrated and angry” after the Scottish government announced a sudden policy shift from a blended model of at-home and in-school learning to the full-time return of pupils from August with no distancing. The move followed a significant backlash from concerned parents facing indefinite home-schooling. Larry Flanagan, the general secretary of the EIS, described it as a “political announcement”, saying he was “not convinced that no physical distancing between pupils is safe, and we are absolutely certain that physical distancing between pupils and teachers remains essential”. Accepting that by August the amount of distance required may have been reduced, he said: “There cannot be a social distancing rule for outside of schools and a different one for inside classrooms.” Indicative dates for further Scottish lockdown easing 3 July Five-mile travel limit for leisure lifted; self-catering holiday accommodation can reopen. Sturgeon asked visitors “to be sensitive to rural and island communities”. 6 July Outdoor hospitality such as beer gardens can reopen. 10 July People can meet in extended groups outdoors, and households can meet indoors with up to a maximum of two households, both with physical distancing. 13 July Organised outdoor contact sports can resume for children and young people; non-essential shops inside shopping centres can reopen. 15 July All childcare providers can open subject to individual provider arrangements, along with all holiday accommodation; pubs and restaurants can reopen indoors; hairdressers and barbers can reopen with enhanced hygiene measures; and museums, galleries, cinemas, monuments and libraries can reopen with distancing and other measures."
2020-06-24T09:00:11Z,politics,Politics,Sadiq Khan proposes moving City Hall to east London to cut costs,"The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is planning on leaving the City Hall building in central London in an attempt to save £55m in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. The Norman Foster-designed glass structure near Tower Bridge has been the official home of the Greater London Authority and housed the mayor’s office since 2002, with Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson both former occupants. Khan has said that without government intervention the authority will struggle to meet the significant costs of the recovery from Covid-19 and faces a budget shortfall of up to £493m over the next two years. He has proposed creating a new City Hall at the Crystal building in Royal Docks, east London, which is already owned by the GLA. “My first priority will always be to protect funding for frontline services, including public transport, the Met police and the London fire brigade. That’s why I’m consulting on plans for the GLA to leave the current City Hall building next year and relocate to the Crystal at the Royal Docks in Newham,” Khan said. “Leaving our current home would save £55m over five years, which would help us to protect and invest in the things that matter most to Londoners, as well as supporting the regeneration of the Royal Docks.” The current City Hall building, which sits on the banks of the Thames, costs the GLA £11.1m a year in rent to its private landlord, the Kuwaiti-owned St Martins Property Group. The terms of the lease were originally negotiated by the government in 2001 for a 25-year period. However, they allow for a break in the contract after 20 years, in December 2021, which Khan said was the first and only chance the GLA had to consider leaving. Notice has to be given this year and a decision is needed by September. There is an expectation that the rent will rise to £12.6m per year beyond Christmas 2021. The Crystal building in east London was built by Siemens in 2012 and is now owned by the GLA Land and Property Limited (GLAP), a subsidiary company of the GLA. It is considered to be a far more environmentally friendly building than the current City Hall, and has lower running costs. Khan said: “In normal times it would be standard practice for any mayor to consider utilising the lease ‘break’ clause on the City Hall building that becomes possible this year, and to view it as an opportunity to ensure Londoners were getting the best value for money. In the current financial context, and with the looming black hole in London’s public finances, it would be negligent not to do so.” He said the GLA faced unprecedented losses because of Covid-19 from business rates and council tax income, and he has warned that this could lead to significant cuts in public transport and the emergency services. Last week Khan announced he would be taking a pay cut of 10%, to be reviewed after six months, in solidarity with the economic situation facing frontline workers. He has never taken a pension as mayor. He will now begin a formal six-week consultation on the relocation plan with the London assembly, Unison, the Public and Commercial Services union, the chairs of GLA and Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (Mopac) staff networks, and all GLA and Mopac staff."
2020-06-24T06:01:08Z,politics,Politics,"UK Border Force detained pregnant woman for 24 hours, inspectors find","A pregnant woman was detained at the UK border for more than 24 hours with “little meaningful contact”, a damning report into the agency responsible for controlling entry to the country has revealed. Children are being routinely handcuffed by Border Force when they arrive in the UK before they are detained in its short-term holding facilities, which are often in “very poor” condition, inspectors said. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) visited sites at eight seaports and five airports in March – the first time the inspectors had assessed them on a national basis. Inspectors hit out at Border Force, which is part of the Home Office, for an “alarming” lack of oversight as the organisation was unable to tell them how many short-term detention cells it ran or how long detainees were held for. Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, said: “The fact that Border Force senior managers could not even tell us with certainty which of their ports actually had detention facilities suggests an alarming lack of oversight and accountability.” He added: “There is an urgent need for Border Force managers to undertake a comprehensive national audit of detention, to assure themselves and the public that all sites of detention are identified, properly equipped for holding detainees and subject to consistent management.” Migrants detained at airports generally arrived after short flights, usually from Europe, while those stopped at ferry docks arrived on foot or by car, most after “arduous and often dangerous journeys concealed in lorries and containers”, Clarke said. He said staff tried to provide “respectful detention” but added: “These detainees were subsequently held in often very poor conditions. “Local Border Force staff were themselves commonly embarrassed by the low standard of accommodation and lack of facilities.” According to the report, inspectors became aware last year they had not been notified of some short-term holding facilities being used by Border Force. The organisation subsequently provided a list of 11, nine of which were previously unknown to inspectors. Holly Lynch, the shadow immigration minister, said: “The Border Force has come under real pressure in this pandemic – and this is set to increase as quarantine rules are loosened. Once again we are calling on the government to ensure both compassion and competence underpin the work of Border Force.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We take the criticisms contained in this report seriously and work to make improvements is already under way. “An audit of all Border Force-run short-term holding facilities, which will establish national accommodation standards, was launched last month and new processes for record keeping, to ensure length of detention is kept to a minimum, have been developed.”"
2020-06-23T20:58:08Z,politics,Politics,Rees-Mogg loses vote to let MPs debate bullying claims,"MPs have voted down controversial proposals introduced by the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, that would have allowed them to debate complaints about serious bullying and harassment. In an open letter seen by the Guardian, past and present parliamentary staff, union leaders, MPs and women’s groups had accused Rees-Mogg of undermining a new independent system designed to prevent bullying and sexual harassment in parliament, by allowing MPs to debate serious sanctions made by a new independent expert panel (IEP). But on Tuesday evening, an amendment tabled by Labour MP Chris Bryant, which ruled out debating complaints against MPs in the chamber, passed by five votes – to the delight of parliamentary staffers and campaigners. MPs were given a free vote, but Tory whips told their MPs that the chief whip would be voting against the Bryant amendment and for the motion in the name of the leader of the house. However, the amendment found favour on both sides of the house. New Tory MP and former employment law barrister Laura Farris said: “Any form of process which invites members to speak up for colleagues against a background of party allegiance and personal loyalties is fundamentally problematic.” Former Commons leader Andrea Leadsom argued that allowing a debate, even with constraints, would “result in a complainant feeling re-victimised”. Labour’s Jess Phillips said allowing debates would stop victims from coming forward, while fellow Labour MP Meg Hillier raised concerns about a “bully pulpit” being used in the Commons. MPs voted in favour of supporting the creation of an independent panel of experts to deal with allegations against them. The eight-member panel will have the ability to investigate independently and impose sanctions including the suspension and exclusion of MPs in the most serious cases. The move was hailed as a “game-changer” by Amy Leversidge, assistant general secretary of the FDA civil service union. “All the staff who have lost their careers in the past will tonight feel so proud that they have spoken out and made a real difference,” she said. “People will finally be able to have their complaint determined fairly, and that’s a real win for everyone in parliament.” The introduction of an independent complaints procedure came more than 18 months after an independent inquiry by Dame Laura Cox revealed the scale of sexual harassment, intimidation and bullying in Westminster. Cox said the vast majority of abuse was targeted at women, whose careers had been blighted by a lack of action. Helen Pankhurst of the Centenary Action Group, which organised the letter in opposition to the right to debate sanctions, said that thanks to the establishment of an independent complaints panel and the Bryant amendment, parliament was “a safer place” to work. “Both women and men must be able to exercise their right to take part in politics without fear of bullying, abuse and sexual harassment,” she said. “Today’s vote has taken us a step closer to achieving this right.” Emily Commander, a former Commons clerk who became the first to trigger a formal investigation into an MP’s conduct in 2012, tweeted: “I am so proud of my friends and former colleagues for making such a positive change to the procedures for tackling bullying and harassment in the House of Commons.”"
2020-06-23T19:23:15Z,politics,Politics,"Reopening of pubs, restaurants and hairdressers not risk-free, say top advisers","Boris Johnson hailed the beginning of the end of “our long national hibernation” as he set out a dramatic easing of lockdown rules amid warnings from government scientists that the move was “not risk-free”. From 4 July in England, households will be allowed to mingle indoors; pubs, restaurants, churches, museums and hairdressers can reopen; and the 2-metre distancing rule will be halved, the prime minister announced.
The government also hopes to announce “air bridges” with “core” European holiday destinations in time for next Monday’s review of the 14-day quarantine policy, it is understood. On Monday, millions of vulnerable people were told they can meet in groups from 6 July for the first time since restrictions were imposed in March to curb the spread of Covid-19. The latest – and biggest – lockdown easing for England is one of several announcements that Downing Street hopes will show Johnson reasserting his grip on the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic after a series of missteps in recent weeks that polling suggested has dented the public’s confidence. Amid fears of a catastrophic wave of layoffs over the summer if lockdown rules were left unchanged, Johnson said he wanted to see the return of “bustle” and was looking forward to visiting a pub – but did not want to see “great, writhing scenes in the beer gardens”. The scientists flanking him at what was confirmed to be the final daily Downing Street briefing sounded notes of caution, however. The country is currently experiencing up to 4,300 daily Covid-19 infections, with around 130 deaths a day across the UK. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said the move was “not risk-free” while chief medical adviser Patrick Vallance warned: “Don’t be fooled this means [coronavirus] has gone away.” Asked if he would take the blame if the latest loosening leads to a resurgence in cases, Johnson said: “Yes, of course I take responsibility, the government takes responsibility for these decisions. We are indebted to our scientific colleagues for their advice continually – but it is our responsibility to choose.” Johnson confirmed a “1-metre-plus” approach, requiring face coverings, screens, making sure people face away from each other and providing extra handwashing facilities if people cannot stay 2 metres apart. “Where it is possible to keep 2 metres apart, people should. But where it is not, we will advise people to keep a social distance of 1-metre-plus, meaning they should remain 1 metre apart, while taking mitigations to reduce the risk of transmission,” the prime minister said. With mitigations in place, Johnson said the protection from the virus would be “broadly equivalent” to remaining 2 metres apart. Members of two different households will be able to dine together or stay overnight in each other’s homes as long as they stick to physical distancing guidelines and strict hygiene measures, it was announced. A swath of businesses, from hairdressers to bingo halls, can reopen from 4 July if they follow new sector-by-sector guidelines for reducing the risk of transmission of Covid-19, which has claimed more than 50,000 lives across the UK. Venues will be expected to keep a register of visitors’ contact details in case they are needed for test and tracing in the event of an outbreak, prompting concerns over logistics and privacy. The changes were hailed by Conservative backbenchers and enthusiastically welcomed by the hospitality sector. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UKHospitality, said: “Having confirmation of the reopening date is a real boon and affords businesses some time to make the necessary preparations. “Our sector was one of the first to be seriously affected and we are going to be one of the last to reopen. Getting venues open again, even with social distancing measures in place, is the best way to secures businesses and jobs.” However, the government’s scientific experts, appearing alongside Johnson, struck a sombre tone. Vallance underlined the importance of continuing to comply with the rules, pointing out that latest research suggested just 5.4% of the population has had the virus and has any hope of antibodies providing protection against a second wave.
“We need to be absolutely sure that with the new relaxation, … we [stick] rigorously to the things that need to happen in order to stop the spread contact to contact – to stop the networks of spread developing,” he said. Other members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, expressed concern at so many changes being introduced at once. Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “Relaxing the 2-metre rule at the same time as opening bars and restaurants does run the risk of allowing the epidemic to start to regain a foothold. These changes will have to be very carefully monitored and the NHS track-and-trace system will have to be working properly to help keep us safe.”
Johnson insisted he would be ready to reimpose restrictions, either locally or nationally, if the virus takes hold again. “We wouldn’t hesitate to put the handbrake on,” he said. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, responding to Johnson in the Commons, said: “Overall, I welcome this statement. I believe the government is trying to do the right thing, and in that we support them.” He questioned whether the test-and-trace system was up to the task of tracking new outbreaks, however. With the sector-by-sector guidance promised by Johnson yet to be published, some business groups complained they have little time to prepare for the 4 July date. Gyms, pools, nightclubs and nail bars are among the institutions that must remain closed, Johnson said. Theatres and concert halls will be able to reopen but they cannot host live performances because of concerns including the risk that singing can transmit the virus. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said, “The 10-day build-up period to 4 July will be costly and hard to meet for many businesses and we need to see the details of the guidance and protocols associated with today’s news.” He added that many businesses will have to remain closed. “For many of our members, including nightclubs, casinos and some pubs, restaurants and bars that can’t meet the 1-metre social distancing obligations, the nightmare of enforced closure goes on.” Johnson is expected to make a speech about the economy next week, laying the groundwork for the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to announce stimulus measures aimed at helping to put a floor under consumer demand and prevent unemployment from rocketing."
2020-06-23T19:13:13Z,politics,Politics,"Trust me, I'm Mr Fun: Boris Johnson loosens England's lockdown | John Crace","This was Boris Johnson’s ideal day out in the Commons. For someone whose whole life seems to have been spent trying to explain his way out of awkward situations, the prime minister is notably averse to confrontation and passing on bad news. He is the country’s Mr Fun. The Cheerer-Upper in Chief. The Mr Motivator who lets the good times roll.
So a statement on relaxing many of the country’s lockdown rules was just up his street. After more than three months of more or less solitary confinement, England – Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are following a more cautious approach – was more or less open for business again. Households could meet, shagging could resume. The Boris bonus. Pubs and restaurants would be back in business after a fashion – Boris was a little hazy on the details – as would hairdressers and some campsites and outdoor attractions. Boom times for model villages. “The long national hibernation is over,” he declared, looking rather more priapic – no greater love hath any man than Boris for himself – than he has in recent weeks. And even though he was at pains to urge caution in following his approach, as the virus was an opportunistic bugger – it takes one to know one – he was still unable to contain his optimism and general bonhomie. This was a day of national celebration, not one for the gloomsters and doomsters. In reply, Keir Starmer broadly welcomed the easing of the restrictions, though he did say it would be handy to see all the scientific evidence on which it was based and for the track-and-trace system to be working rather more effectively. Starmer also confirmed that it was safe for some children to go back to school now – something he could have said last week and saved himself some grief – which allowed Boris to break off from acting like the Special One and score a few petty party political points. He also claimed there was no country in the world that had an effective track-and-trace app, something with which several countries would disagree. But then, a liar is going to lie.
This was rather the point of the rest of the debate. Trust me, said Boris. I know I have lied about a lot of things in the past, but I am telling the truth this time. And a surprisingly large number of MPs were prepared to take him at his word. Their constituents were getting fed up with lockdown, businesses were going under and with the infection rate apparently falling then it was time to give people and the economy a break. Always Look on the Bright Side of Life is a catchy number. Not everyone went home happy, though. Liberal Democrat Ed Davey wondered if since we were firmly on the road to recovery, now would be a good time to have a national inquiry into what had gone wrong and why the UK had one of the highest mortality rates in the world. Boris shook his head. Tory Greg Clark wanted to know if cricket could also return. “No,” said Boris, firmly. Because it was played with a ball. Unlike football, which started up a week ago. Even when he’s trying to be serious, Boris can’t help but sound like someone who is making up policy on the hoof. As if to underline the fact that relentless cheerfulness was to be the order of the day, within minutes of ending his statement, Boris declared that from tomorrow there would be no more daily Downing Street press conferences. The virus was now under control and Britain was getting back to normal, so why should he or other members of the cabinet be subjected to tricky questions from the public and the media?
The season’s Downing Street finale ended as the first episode had opened, with Boris flanked by Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance. The prime minister was rather more subdued without a live audience, but his message was essentially the same. Thanks to the resolve of the British public, not to mention the Herculean efforts of the government, only 60,000 people had died and it was now time for the survivors to start concentrating on living again. The chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser were noticeably much more guarded. They have both long since tired of being used as human shields for the government’s incompetence and weren’t going to make that mistake again. All they had done was spell out the risks; it had been the politicians who had taken the decisions. It had been their assessment that if everyone acted entirely as they should and took proper precautions, then the risks of being 1 metre apart would be much the same as at 2 metres. But the chances of everyone behaving responsibly – especially when pissed – were just about zero and so we would definitely be in for an increase in infections. The longer the briefing went on, the more socially distanced Whitty and Vallance became from the prime minister. Had it gone on much longer, there would have been a fair chance they would have reversed their tacit endorsement of the end of lockdown and shouted: “Don’t trust him. He’s not worth it.” The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg asked if the prime minister would accept responsibility if everything went tits up and rates of infections and deaths increased significantly. Of course he would, Boris insisted. There’s a first time for everything, I suppose."
2020-06-23T18:47:10Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Chris Whitty warns of second spike if people ignore new rules in final daily briefing â€“ as it happened,"Boris Johnson has sought to jolt England out of lockdown with an announcement about restrictions being lifted from 4 July that goes beyond expectations and that will allow pubs and restaurants to reopen. He has also said that the 2-metre social distancing rule will be replaced with a 1-metre-plus rule that will allow people to stay just 1 metre apart, provided other mitigating measures are in place. Announcing the rules in parliament, he also said that the new rules would mostly be advisory, rather than having the full force of law as the original lockdown did, and that he would be relying on the common sense of the public to make them work. At his evening press conference â€“ which, in a sign that No 10 is keen to move on from all-encompassing coronavirus crisis management, will be the last of the daily press conferences from No 10 â€“ Johnson was joined by Prof Chris Whitty, the governmentâ€™s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, who both struck a distinctly more cautious note. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, and Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, have both stressed that they are not following Johnsonâ€™s lead and that they are retaining the 2-metre rule (see 1.03pm and 2.10pm respectively). My colleague Kate Proctor has a summary of what the new rules mean here.
Whitty has said that a second spike is inevitable if people ignore the conditions that are supposed to apply to the lockdown being relaxed. Speaking at the No 10 press conference, he said: If people hear a distorted version of whatâ€™s being said, that says â€˜this is all fine now, itâ€™s gone awayâ€™ and start behaving in ways that they normally would have before this virus happened, yes, we will get an uptick for sure. It is absolutely critical people stick to the guidance that has been given, itâ€™s a changed guidance for there are still very significant restrictions socially and there are very significant restrictions on business of different sorts. Whitty also said people should continue to stay two metres away from others where possible and that the new â€œ1-metre plusâ€� rule did not invalidate this original advice. (See 5.35pm.) And he said that he expected coronavirus to continue to pose a significant risk for another year. Asked when life might return to normal, he said: I would be surprised and delighted if we werenâ€™t in this current situation through the winter and into next spring. I think then letâ€™s regroup and work out where we are. I expect there to be a significant amount of coronavirus circulating at least into that time and I think it is going to be quite optimistic that for science to come fully to the rescue over that kind of timeframe. But I have an absolute confidence in the capacity of science to overcome infectious diseases - it has done that repeatedly and it will do that for this virus, whether that is by drugs, vaccines or indeed other things that may come into play. For medium to long term, Iâ€™m optimistic. But for the short to medium term, until this time next year, certainly I think we should be planning for this for what I consider to be the long haul into 2021. Whitty said that, although the governmentâ€™s test and trace scheme could make an important contribution, he was worried about people not complying with it. He said: The biggest thing I worry about, if Iâ€™m honest, is that people donâ€™t report that they have got symptoms - so get a test - and then, if someone is contacted by NHS Test and Trace, that they donâ€™t engage properly with that process. By reporting when people have got symptoms, getting a test and - if itâ€™s positive - isolating, that is a huge service to the rest of society because that is the way that we ensure people who have got the virus or might have the virus get out of circulation temporarily and that reduces the risk to absolutely everybody. The Scottish government has announced that it wants all pupils to return to school in August, abandoning plans for them to return only part time in a â€œblended learningâ€� model that was unpopular with parents. (See 3.50pm.) The easing of multiple lockdown measures in England at once risks Covid-19 gaining a fresh foothold, scientists advising the government have warned.

2020-06-23T14:08:09Z,politics,Politics,Hancock tried to block plan to build 400 homes in Newmarket,"The health secretary, Matt Hancock, repeatedly urged fellow Conservative ministers to block a plan to build 400 homes and a primary school in his constituency, claiming it would damage the horse racing industry. His opposition to the development came as senior figures in horse racing leading the opposition made financial donations to him. Rachel Hood, the then Conservative mayor of Newmarket, and her husband, John Gosden, a prominent horseracing trainer who gave evidence opposing the scheme at the public inquiry, each gave Hancock £10,000 in December 2018 and May last year respectively. Tattersalls, the Newmarket-based racehorse valuers and auctioneers, who were also prominent opponents of the housing development on behalf of the racing industry, have consistently donated money to Hancock’s office, including £15,000 in May 2010 when he was first elected as MP for the West Suffolk constituency, and £10,000 in May last year. The development, proposed by the landowner Lord Derby at Hatchfield farm in Newmarket, includes building 400 homes, 30% of them affordable, a new primary school, and offices or other employment space. Commitments were given to manage any increase in traffic that might affect the movement of thoroughbred racehorses to their training gallops in the town, which is described as “the HQ” of flat racing. In July 2015 the scheme was recommended for approval by a planning inspector who decided after a public inquiry that “the risk to the horse racing industry is very small”.
Two months later, Hancock wrote to the then housing minister, Brandon Lewis, maintaining that the development would damage the industry and should be rejected for its “exceptional negative economic impact on the local economy”. Sajid Javid, the then Conservative communities and local government secretary, blocked the project in August 2016. However, this was overturned by the high court in 2017, in a judgment that described Javid’s decision as “a complete and unexplained volte face” from a previous favourable government assessment of the plans, and noted the inspector’s finding that there was a clear need for more housing in Newmarket. Hancock nevertheless wrote to Javid after that judgment, again urging that the development be halted. He also wrote to the then housing minister James Brokenshire in July 2018, stressing his opposition to the scheme. After another public inquiry last year, in which the inspector again approved the development, Hancock wrote to the current communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, in September, attaching the legal case made by the horse racing industry to oppose the scheme. On 12 March, however, Jenrick accepted the inspector’s recommendation and finally approved the development. Hancock has accepted donations, including some hospitality, from senior figures in the horse racing industry since he was first elected MP, including badges and car passes for Newmarket races in 2010 and 2011 valued at just under £800, and in July 2010, honorary membership of the prestigious Jockey Club Rooms, worth £1,356. In August 2012, Hancock, a keen rider himself, won an amateur race in Newmarket on Dick Doughtywylie, a horse then owned by Hood and trained by Gosden. Hood marshalled the opposition on behalf of the horse racing industry to the Hatchfield farm development via the Save Historic Newmarket group, which she founded. On her register of interests at West Suffolk council, Hood also declares membership of the Racehorse Owners Association, Thoroughbred Breeders Association and Jockey Club Rooms. A spokesman for Hancock said he stood by his interventions in opposition to the development, and pointed out that he also received financial donations from a racehorse owner, Bill Gredley, who supported the scheme. Gredley told the Guardian he supported the scheme in a personal capacity, not representing the horse racing industry, because he felt “the people of Newmarket wanted some houses”. Tattersalls, also described in the high court judgment as having represented the horse racing industry at the planning inquiry, told the Guardian: “We have made donations either directly to our local MP or to the West Suffolk Conservative Association for the past 25 years … Our donations have never been related to any specific local issues, but have always reflected our support for our local MPs who we believe have historically represented the constituency extremely well.” Hood and Gosden did not respond to questions from the Guardian about their donations to Hancock. Claire Unwin, who unsuccessfully opposed Hancock for Labour in December’s general election, said: “The Hatchfield farm plans had very strong support in the local community because there is a great need for more homes, and affordable housing, so that people don’t have to move out of Newmarket. Matt Hancock was acting against the wider interests of the community and solely on the side of the horse racing industry, whose elite have been making financial donations to him.” The spokesman for Hancock, who has pointed out that all his financial donations are properly declared, said: “Matt is grateful for the Guardian highlighting how hard he campaigns for his constituency. He has opposed this development since before he was first elected MP. He is very grateful for all the support he receives from all quarters working hard for his constituency.”"
2020-06-23T13:38:17Z,politics,Politics,Brexit talks hit by row over EU subsidies for farmers,"British and EU negotiators have hit a new obstacle to securing a trade and security deal after clashing over €70bn of subsidies handed to European farmers by Brussels, the Guardian can reveal. The EU’s negotiating team led by Michel Barnier was accused in the latest round of talks of seeking to block the government from defending British farmers from cut-price European imports. The row centres on the EU’s demand for what it is claimed would be an unprecedented commitment not to retaliate through tariffs on European goods even where it could be potentially shown that British farmers are being unfairly undercut. The negotiators are set to return to the issue over the “intensified” summer talks starting next week, joining a long list of thorny areas where common ground is yet to be found. The 27 EU governments will issue a statement welcoming the new talks, scheduled to run into September, but call for businesses to be ready “for all outcomes”, according to a leaked paper. The UK’s farming industry is facing the biggest shake-up in over 40 years with the country’s exit from the single market and the customs union at the end of the year. For the duration of the current parliament, farmers will be paid subsidies at the same rate as the EU – around £3bn a year. The British government is concerned at the potential for heavily subsidised EU farmers to exploit the period of uncertainty, an anxiety brought to a head by clauses contained in the European commission’s draft legal text for a future trade deal. Under World Trade Organization rules there is no cap on payments to farmers that “do not distort trade, or at most cause minimal distortion”. Such unrestricted subsidies, known as “green box payments”, include direct income supports for farmers that are not related to production levels or prices. They also include environmental protection and regional development programmes.
The EU has over time hugely increased the proportion of its subsidies that it regards as being green box payments, often in the face of opposition from rival producers. In 2018, the US Department of Commerce imposed a 17.13% anti-dumping duty on Spanish olives claiming that they were being sold at unfairly low prices as a consequence of green box payments. Two clauses in the EU’s proposed free trade deal with the UK would have both sides agree that such funds are not in effect price distorting and cannot be countered with “anti-subsidy proceedings nor be subjected to price or cost adjustments in anti-dumping investigations”. The UK negotiating team led by David Frost has in response argued that such a clause would limit the government’s ability to protect the British farming industry. The EU has previously sought to have similar provisions, known as a “peace clause” by trade experts, inserted into prospective trade deals with Australia and New Zealand but they do not exist in any current agreements. Maria Wiggerthale, a researcher on trade for Oxfam in Germany who has studied the potential price-distorting impact of the EU’s green box payments, said: “There is no reason why there should be such an external ‘peace clause’ for the EU.
“At the time of the WTO agricultural negotiations there were proposals to develop criteria for green box measures to make them really non-distorting and this has always been rejected by the EU. “Why should the EU be worried if there is no problem with these payments? EU exports to the UK are about 20% and they do fear a kind of dumping. I think it is reasonable for the UK on this. It is such a large amount of money.” The UK government and European commission declined to comment."
2020-06-23T13:20:08Z,politics,Politics,Rees-Mogg accused of trying to wreck parliament harassment body,"Staff at the Palace of Westminster along with MPs, union leaders and women’s groups have accused Jacob Rees-Mogg of undermining a new independent system designed to prevent bullying and sexual harassment in the Houses of Parliament. MPs will on Tuesday debate the implementation of a new independent expert panel (IEP) designed to make the process of dealing with bullying, harassment and sexual harassment independent, which was hailed as the beginning of a “seismic change” in Westminster when it was announced in February. But in an open letter seen by the Guardian, staff members and victims of bullying and sexual harassment highlight that the leader of the house has included the ability for MPs to debate decisions made by the independent panel. Sanctions for less severe misconduct will be implemented directly by the panel, but MPs will be able to debate the most serious cases where the panel has called for an MP to be suspended or expelled from the house. The letter, which had more than 60 signatories, including Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA civil service union, by mid-morning on Tuesday, states: “Intimidation regularly stops women from reporting sexual harassment and the fact that cases could be discussed by MPs would exacerbate this, meaning more women will suffer in silence.” It comes 18 months after an independent inquiry by Dame Laura Cox revealed the scale of sexual harassment, intimidation and bullying in Westminster. Cox said the vast majority of abuse was targeted at women, whose careers had been blighted by a lack of action. The Labour party activist Ava Etemadzadeh, who accused the Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins of inappropriate sexual behaviour – which he has denied – said she was shocked at the move. “Allowing MPs to debate the any sanctions can just revictimise the person involved. It means the system is not completely independent, which is what victims have been calling for all along.” The standing order – the written rules that regulate proceedings in the Commons and the Lords – introduced by Rees-Mogg would create an IEP but in the most serious of cases a debate would still be allowed. MPs would be prohibited from discussing complainants’ names or specific details but, with politicians protected by parliamentary privilege, campaigners argue that, in practice, MPs could say what they like. The Labour MP Chris Bryant has tabled an amendment that would take out the option of debating upheld complaints. Helen Pankhurst of the Centenary Action Group said the move would compromise the independence of the complaints process. “We need a fully independent process, that fact-checks complaints and results in action,” she said. “As soon as you reintroduce the voice of the powerful, where there is a gatekeeping by the powerful, you undermine the trust in that independent system and the validity of the whole process. And the direct result of that is that people will not come forward – and you once again hand power back to the abusers.”"
2020-06-23T10:45:48Z,politics,Politics,"Whitehall not sharing Covid-19 data on local outbreaks, say councils","Local outbreaks of Covid-19 could grow undetected because the government is failing to share crucial testing data, council leaders and scientists have warned. More than a month after being promised full details of who has caught the disease in their areas, local health chiefs are still desperately lobbying the government’s testing chief, Lady Harding, to break the deadlock and share the data. The situation was described by one director of public health as a “shambles”, while a scientist on the government’s own advisory committee said it was “astonishing” that public health teams are unable to access the information. The prime minister said on Friday the country was moving from “a huge one-size-fits-all national lockdown programme to one in which we’re able to do more localised responses”, and ministers have told councils and their public health directors to take the lead. They will be responsible for monitoring the spread of Covid-19 in local areas and deciding when to close schools, offices, care homes and if necessary impose lockdowns on whole towns. As they race to produce outbreak management plans by the end of June, public health directors warn they lack crucial data flowing from Whitehall. “It can’t be stressed enough how important this data is to us,” said Ian Hudspeth, the Conservative leader of Oxfordshire county council, who speaks on health matters for the Local Government Association. “We’ve been pressing for this since the test-and-trace system was announced.” Councils are asking for real-time information about who has tested positive, down to the names and contact details of individuals, and failing that by street, postcode, or catchment area of 1,500 people. However, most are only receiving a daily feed of aggregate community test results for the entire upper tier local authority. This could hinder the ability to spot outbreaks at the earliest opportunity, according to Chris Jewell, an epidemiologist at Lancaster University and a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) subgroup on modelling.
“We have to wait for [outbreaks] to emerge through the noise at a much larger spatial scale,” he said. In practical terms, that means waiting for more people to become infected and, he said, “delays are everything in dealing with outbreaks”. Hudspeth said he had been “lobbying hard” for the information since the beginning of April when the health secretary, Matt Hancock, launched the national coronavirus testing programme. “If someone has gone into a care home we need to contact them as soon as possible before they go into other areas and spread the virus,” he said. “We need to know on the day so that we can clamp down and prevent the spread.” Jewell said he found it “astonishing” that local public health officials are unable to get the postcodes of people who have been infected. “I don’t quite understand what the problem is,” he said. The number of new cases in the UK is falling, but remains just under the 1,000-a-day mark – and health directors are on the alert for local outbreaks of the kind seen in Beijing and in Germany. Last week, three meat-processing plants were shut down in England and Wales after more 100 people tested positive. “We really do need the data shared,” said Sakthi Karunanithi at Lancashire county council. “Without it we don’t know whether we have localised outbreaks, for example in a single care home, or generalised transmission in the community. This will help us intervene early before the virus spreads wider.” Greg Fell, who heads public health in Sheffield, told a parliamentary committee last week: “This is not nice-to-know data, this is necessary for the public health response in an emergency.” Another long-standing director of public health, who asked to be anonymous, said the whole process was a “complete shambles”. The warning about data comes after directors said they also remained unclear about whether local authorities will have the power to instigate local lockdowns or whether these decisions will be taken at a national level. The missing information is largely from tests carried out in the national network of drive-in centres coordinated by management consultants at the accounting firm Deloitte, and from postal tests managed by the Northern Ireland laboratory Randox. The data is held by central government, but has not yet flowed through to councils and GPs. By contrast, GPs automatically get results from tests carried out in hospitals using NHS labs. It is understood civil servants in the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), where the test-and-trace effort is being overseen by the Conservative peer Dido Harding, are concerned that sharing details about individuals with councils may fall foul of data protection laws. “Public Health England have the data but they haven’t got the protocols in place to make sure there is that ability to share,” said Hudspeth. Another source suggested that there had been issues getting de-anonymised data back out of a highly secure IT system intended to protect personal information. The picture has been complicated by the creation of a new government agency, the Joint Biosecurity Centre. Giving evidence to MPs last week, its chief executive, Clare Gardiner, said her team would be responsible for pushing data out to councils. However, she said the agency was not expected to be fully operational until the end of the summer. A DHSC spokesperson said: “Local outbreaks will continue to be managed by a specialist team from the local authority or PHE, and we have provided £300m to local authorities to further develop local outbreak control plans.” “Testing data is being made available through local dashboards and we will continue to expand this to provide more data for local areas. The new test-and-trace service has an important role in limiting the spread of the virus nationally, and already thousands of those who have tested positive have been contacted and their close contacts traced.”"
2020-06-23T07:00:39Z,politics,Politics,Britain beyond lockdown: can we level up?,"Micky Day is an electrical cable installer from Hartlepool, one of the poorest, most avidly pro-Brexit regions in the UK. He is not interested in Westminster politics and has little time for talk of the green recovery, but he knows how to unite a community and care for people who are hurting. And it is this that inspires his thoughts about Britain beyond lockdown. “We can’t have more cuts. There are a lot of people on their knees already,” he says. “There is a lot of industry in this area. If the government puts the money on the table, it could be massive in the north-east. Let’s get people back working and lift the economy off its knees.” Day is known locally as “the most popular man in Hartlepool” because of the amount of time he devotes to community work. He has raised more than £400,000 for cancer, established the mental health charities Miles for Men and Minds for Men, and works with local supermarkets to arrange food donations. During lockdown, he and his friends have been doing karaoke car park tours to lift the spirits of people in isolation, regaling the inhabitants of elderly care homes with Elvis and Oasis numbers.
He says this already close community of 90,000 has become stronger during the pandemic because people have rallied to help each other out. But Day foresees financial and mental health problems ahead unless there is more support. “A lot of people have been going through tough times. After lockdown, it’s going to get worse.” How to lift and heal the country is the biggest political challenge facing the government. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is putting together a recovery budget that could be the defining economic policy of a generation. It must head off the UK’s worst recession in 300 years, address an existential climate crisis, and “level up” incomes in an unequal and divided nation. Politicians in the north-east see an opportunity for a historic transition. There are hopes that decarbonisation can give a future to a region that has often struggled to emerge from the past. Since Margaret Thatcher closed the collieries in the 1980s, the town of Hartlepool has slipped further and further behind other parts of Britain for job prospects, life expectancy, health and economic growth. One in three households are jobless. A third of children are obese when they finish primary school. Although there are only 40,000 families in the town, such is the level of need that there are nine food kitchens. Life expectancy was declining even before coronavirus. The local council is in dire financial straits. Locals joke darkly that even three pound shops have gone bust. ‘Covid is just another crisis’ Because the town was already so poor, the economic impact of Covid-19 has been muted. The third of the population on benefits may even be slightly better off because the government is giving an extra £20 a week in universal credit and £15 for school meal vouchers. In a ranking of which English towns have suffered the worst financial hit from the crisis, Hartlepool came 154th out of 175. Others have suffered a sharper downturn because they have lost tourist and student income. “For us, Covid is just another crisis. We already knew who to support. We’ve been doing it for ages,” says charity coordinator Sacha Bedding. He fears that what happened to Hartlepool after deindustrialisation in the 1980s could be a foretaste of what is to come.
When the Conservative government closed the coal mines and ancilliary operations that had provided most of the jobs in the town, call centres were supposed to be the future – but they all moved to India in the 2000s. The public sector was then the biggest employer, but it was slashed under austerity programmes following the financial crisis. There has been public-private investment in redeveloping the marina, but several of the upmarket new restaurants have gone bust because there are not enough wealthy local customers to fill the tables. “We try to reinvent ourselves, but we always seem to be one step behind because we don’t address deep structural changes,” Bedding says. “If we are not careful, I worry the country will level down rather than level up,” he says over a cup of tea at the end of another day delivering food parcels and medicine to those in need. For most of the last few decades, Bedding – like several others the Guardian spoke to – feels people in the north-east have been ignored, scorned as “scroungers” or derided as racist throwbacks who failed to adjust to a globalised post-industrial world. But he feels the voice of the region has grown stronger in the wake of Brexit and the election of a new post-”red wall” wave of MPs, mayors and councillors who can no longer take their support for granted. Green growth One such politician is Ben Houchen, a Conservative elected in 2017 as Tees Valley mayor. The investments he is trying to attract include some of the biggest decarbonisation projects in Europe. In a phone interview, Houchen comes across as very different from southern Tories like David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. He seems more concerned about jobs, levelling up and the need to decarbonise the economy. “For Teesside, clean growth could be as transformative to our region as steel and iron were 200 year ago … This would be huge in levelling up.” He is under no illusions about the scale of the economic challenge. “It’s absolutely unprecedented – as big as it could be,” he says. “But the rebound will be strong. There is a lot of pent-up energy in the economy … that wasn’t there in 2007.” Many major spending projects have been pre-approved, and Houchen is hopeful for more because interest rates are low, which means the government has less of an incentive to take the path of austerity. Politically, it will also want to capitalise on its recent gains in former Labour territory. “Everyone I have spoken to, including the PM, says we will invest in our economy, not tighten belts and cut spending. I am hoping that if Rishi [Sunak] has some money in the next few weeks, there will be projects in the north,” he said. “Depending on the direction government choses to take, we could accelerate decarbonisation.” The old steelworks on Teesside was recently chosen as the site for one of the world’s biggest industrial-scale carbon capture and storage projects. Houchen said Net Zero Teesside will bring in more than £3bn in investment, create 5,700 jobs and capture CO2 equivalent to the emissions of 6m homes every year. It is due to start by 2025 with the backing of BP, Shell and Equinox. “They see it as the future of their business. They realise they can’t just release the emissions into the air any more,” the mayor said. Other potential job-creating investments by the chancellor include the decarbonisation of heating in the country’s 20m homes by switching boilers from fossil fuel gas to hydrogen. “That will require refitting 2,000 boilers every day until 2050. That’s a huge number of jobs,” the mayor says. The government could also support the domestic manufacturing of turbines for the large offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank, which is 80 miles off the Teesside coastline. Houchen estimates that would create another 5,000-8,000 jobs.
But all this is not enough to hold back the unemployment tsunami that is gathering force. There will also be pressure to generate more carbon-intensive jobs through roadbuilding and expanding airports. Locals say they don’t care whether jobs are green or black, as long as they are not minimum wage, or zero-hours contracts, which barely pay more than benefits. That means employees in the care, health and retail sectors should be valued as the “essential workers” they were designated as during lockdown. A caring economy The town centre is coming back to life. When non-essential shops reopened, locals say there were so many people wanting to return to old consumer habits that streets were blocked with cars, and marshals had to be called in to manage the long lines of eager customers. Some want a more caring economy. Independent retailers Angela Arnold and Trevor Sherwood, co-owners of the cosy LilyAnne’s coffee bar, have used their £10,000 Covid-19 support grant to expand the cafe so they can provide a “gentle space” that will help socially isolated residents to reintegrate. “Covid has heightened anxieties among many people,” said Arnold. “There will be a big mental health impact.”
But with the prime minister urging people to shop for Britain, Arnold and her business partner fear the government will suspend the Sunday trading law to ramp up productivity again. “That would be a disaster for independent retailers like us,” she said. Like many, she would like more focus on togetherness, which helped during Covid-19 and previous crises and is likely to be needed in the tough times that everyone expects to come. “Before Covid, when did you last see your neighbour? Everyone is normally too tired when they come home. But in lockdown, we are getting to know each other again,” she says. “People are cooking for one another and leaving food on the steps, and reconnecting with friends. There is a realisation that there is more to life than money.” At the nearby seaside town of Seaton Carew, the beachfront is as close to bustling as it is possible to get in an era of physical distancing. There are long queues for fish and chips and ice-cream. Families picnic on the sand, play football and fly kites. With pubs and amusement arcades still closed, people pay more attention to each other. The scene could come from a more innocent, bygone age. It seems that the lockdown, which started with fears of dystopia and social breakdown, appears to be ending here with people more closely bonded and appreciative of nature than before. The question now is how long that mood can last once capitalism revs up again."
2020-06-23T05:00:37Z,politics,Politics,What can Rishi Sunak do to boost the economy?,"Rishi Sunak is drawing up plans for temporary tax cuts and spending measures to reboot the British economy after three months of lockdown. Faced with the deepest recession in three centuries triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, the chancellor is expected to unveil the financial support package in early July. With the government preparing to taper its furlough scheme, under which it is covering the wages of more than nine million temporarily laid-off workers, it is searching for ways to bolster an economy that faces a sharp rise in unemployment as well as more business failures. Among the measures the chancellor could announce to boost jobs and growth are: VAT Two former chancellors, Sajid Javid and Alistair Darling, are urging Sunak to use a temporary VAT cut to boost the economy. Javid, his immediate predecessor, has called for the sales tax to be reduced to 17% from the current rate of 20% at a cost of £21bn in lost revenue for the exchequer. When he was Labour chancellor, Darling used a 13-month VAT cut from November 2008 to boost the economy as the financial crisis hit, from 17.5% to 15%. A cut from 20% to 15% today would cost £35bn. Sunak is also thought to be considering targeted VAT cuts for sectors hit hard by Covid-19, such as hospitality and tourism. Cutting VAT would be designed to encourage consumers to raise their spending as non-essential shops begin to reopen. This would help retailers and other firms to recover from the sharpest decline in consumer spending on record, protecting jobs and investment. National insurance Business leaders are urging the chancellor to cut employers’ national insurance contributions (NICs) to prevent spiralling job losses. Unemployment is expected to more than double from the current rate of about 4% to hit 1980 levels as the government scales back its furlough scheme, which covers 80% of employees’ wages and is scheduled to end in October. According to research from the Institute of Employment Studies, NICs are the single largest non-wage labour cost faced by employers. The thinktank said the current system represented a tax of 13.8% on earnings above £8,788 a year, adding about £2,400 to the cost of employing someone on an average wage. Sunak could raise the threshold at which employer NICs are made across the board. An alternative could be to tailor the measures to specific age groups, for instance by exempting those under 30 to boost employment opportunities for young adults. Business rates The chancellor could tweak the system of business rates, which brings in about £30bn for the Treasury each year by levying taxes on firms based on the value of the buildings from which they operate. Industry groups have called for business rates holidays given to retail, leisure and hospitality firms during the coronavirus crisis to be extended to other companies. The system has been repeatedly earmarked for reform before, with calls for it to be replaced with an online sales tax, to account for the fact that e-commerce powerhouses such as Amazon have comparatively low rates bills because they operate from warehouses and not a plethora of high street sites. At the budget in March, Sunak announced a “fundamental review” of business rates, due to be published this autumn. State-backed loans Sunak could announce more flexible terms for the repayment of the government-backed coronavirus business interruption loans (CBILs) and bounce-back loans (BBLs). Firms struggling to stay afloat during the crisis have borrowed more than £38bn between them through the schemes. Business leaders have asked for Sunak to take a student loan-style approach to how companies pay them off, by allowing firms to start repayments once they are making a profit. Meanwhile, George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor, has suggested the debts could be written off entirely to boost the economy. Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “What we have to avoid is a situation where small firms hold fire on investment and hiring at a moment when we need them most. A guarantee that they wouldn’t have to start repayments until they’re turning a profit would allow them to crack on without fear.” Training and skills With unemployment forecast to rise sharply this summer as lockdown measures are only gradually lifted, the chancellor is expected to step up the government’s support for getting people into work or helping them to retrain to find a new job. Sunak told the Yorkshire Post on a visit to his constituency in Northallerton that he would place education, skills and training at the heart of the government’s economic response to Covid-19. He also said he could look at changes to the apprenticeship levy, which is designed to encourage firms to take on apprentices. Infrastructure Sunak has stated his commitment to the government’s “levelling-up” strategy to boost infrastructure spending outside London and the south-east, saying in the early days of the Covid-19 crisis that it remained a priority. At the budget in March the chancellor outlined £640bn of capital investment over five years for roads, railways, internet, schools, hospitals and other projects. However, the government’s national infrastructure strategy, expected to be published this year to allocate the funding, has been delayed. Sunak could use next month’s statement to announce funding for new projects that could be more immediately useful for the public as the country emerges from the crisis, including electric vehicle-charging networks, broadband, and cycling and walking infrastructure."
2020-06-22T23:01:30Z,politics,Politics,"Ministerial role needed to fix unequal education system, say MPs","A new ministerial post should be created to address the “entrenched inequity” in England’s education system, which is holding back pupils from diverse backgrounds, according to a cross-party group of parliamentarians. The role is vital, they say, especially in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement, which has called for greater diversity in the curriculum, and the disproportionate impact that the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to have on the most disadvantaged. A report by the all-party parliamentary group on diversity and inclusion in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) education calls on the government to make it more relevant to the lives of all young people. It highlights the need for a coordinated government approach to tackle the causes of inequity in the education system, with a focus on the role of schools in GCSE choices, which can affect how pupils progress, and their access to good careers education. Labour MP Chi Onwurah, chair of the APPG, said: “The recent global protests on inequality have only further served to highlight that we must continually review the systems we have in place to ensure they are fit for purpose. Nowhere is this clearer than in Stem education. “Our report shows that whatever the socioeconomic background, from the age of three onwards, children are currently suffering from the levels of inequity in Stem education.” The report calls for more resources to strengthen the recruitment and retention of specialist Stem teachers in schools and colleges in disadvantaged areas of the country. “Addressing the current inequity in Stem education now will pay dividends, as the next generation go on to plug the current Stem skills gap, ensuring the UK continues to be a world leader in scientific and technological innovation,” Onwurah said. A separate report from the University of Oxford has warned that school exclusions in England, which have been increasing in recent years, could accelerate following lockdown as pupils who were already struggling with school are affected by heightened anxiety, bereavement, poverty and a disconnection from schooling. Ian Thompson, associate professor of education at Oxford, said: “We know the impact of Covid-19 on schools is substantial for practitioners and students. The social and emotional disruption caused by the pandemic and the subsequent school closures is highly likely to have increased or exacerbated student anxiety and other mental health issues. “There is also a concern with school connectedness for vulnerable students, whose patterns of school attendance have been disrupted. These concerns raise issues around transitions back to school settings.” The government has said it wants all pupils in England back in school full time at the start of the academic year. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, told MPs in the Commons on Monday that he would unveil plans next week for the “full return of every single child” to school. The government already has contingency plans in case of further disruption to education in September. It was announced that the Oak National Academy – a virtual school set up to to help teachers and offer online lessons during lockdown – is to stay open for another academic year, in case of local lockdowns and staff absences due to Covid. Its principal, Matt Hood, said: “As we look ahead to September, we hope all teachers and pupils will be safely back at school. Given the risk of local lockdowns, it’s sensible to have a backup plan available to any school, to make sure children can continue to receive an education. So we’re keeping Oak National Academy open for another year.” A Department for Education spokeswoman said: “Our ambition is to make sure that everyone, regardless of their background, is able to fulfil their potential and gain the knowledge and skills they need to build a successful career. “But we recognise there is more we can do to improve diversity in Stem, which is why we have taken a number of steps to boost inclusivity, such as establishing the Stem ambassadors programme, creating a network of maths hubs, and funding the simulating physics network to attract and hone top talent and improve gender participation in schools.”"
2020-06-22T19:57:46Z,politics,Politics,Nicola Sturgeon to testify in Alex Salmond investigation,"Nicola Sturgeon and her husband are being called to give evidence by a parliamentary investigation into a botched Scottish government inquiry into misconduct claims against Alex Salmond. The cross-party inquiry is due to call Salmond this autumn when it starts oral hearings, which will investigate his allegations that senior figures in the Scottish government and Scottish National party orchestrated claims tat he was guilty of serious sexual offences. The Holyrood committee, by the former culture minister Linda Fabiani, confirmed on Monday tthat it would also call Peter Murrell, Sturgeon’s husband and SNP chief executive, to answer Salmond’s claims that SNP officials helped concoct the charges against him. The committee has sought internal emails and messages sent and received by SNP staff. Salmond was cleared of 14 charges of sexual assault, including one of attempted rape, by a high court jury in March after nine women, including senior civil servants and Scottish National party figures, accused him of assaulting them while he was first minister. The inquiry was set up after the Scottish government admitted in January 2019 it had mishandled an internal inquiry into misconduct claims against Salmond made by two senior female civil servants, after he launched a judicial review of that process. Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary and Scotland’s most senior civil servant, said the internal inquiry had the appearance of bias because it was carried out by an official who had contact with the two complainants before the inquiry began. That raised doubts about its independence. The Scottish government has paid Salmond £512,000 to cover his legal costs for that judicial review. Evans is expected to be the first witness in mid-August, with committee members pressing for all the witnesses to do so under oath and for witness sessions to take place in the parliamentary chamber, to ensure it can happen in public with correct levels of social distancing. Other senior figures being called include Liz Lloyd, Sturgeon’s chief of staff, and the two previous permanent secretaries, Sir John Elvidge and Sir Peter Housden, who were in charge when the incidents of which Salmond has now been cleared allegedly took place. The human resources official who oversaw the internal inquiry, Judith MacKinnon, is also due to be called. Fabiani said on Monday their inquiry would investigate the Scottish government’s policy-making on harassment and its culture; the events leading up to the judicial review; and allegations against Sturgeon that she breached the ministerial code. It is thought the committee will investigate allegations dating back to 2008. Angela Constance, another former minister on the inquiry panel, said: “It’s time to proceed with pace.” Sturgeon will face detailed questions about what she knew about the misconduct and sexual assault allegations against Salmond. She has already admitted meeting Salmond and talking to him three times before she alerted Evans to their contact, but denies any wrongdoing. It emerged during Salmond’s trial that she had a further secret meeting in late March 2018 with Salmond’s former chief of staff and one of the nine complainants in the criminal trial – a meeting Sturgeon had not previously disclosed to parliament."
2020-06-22T19:10:36Z,politics,Politics,"Hancock lifts Covid-19 restrictions in line with economy – sorry, science","How much does Boris Johnson hate Matt Hancock? I’m asking because it’s clear the health secretary is completely burnt out. The smiles and the Tigger-like warmth are all gone. All that’s left is a desiccated shell that could crumble at any minute. A man reduced to muttering platitudes while scowling at the television cameras. A kinder, more sensitive boss – the type that Matt was about to insist were omnipresent and would be falling over themselves to welcome back staff who had been shielding – would have told Hancock to take some time off a while ago. A chance to catch up on lost sleep and reacquaint himself with his family. After all, it’s not exactly as if he would be missed. Instead, Matt found himself sent out on another hospital pass of a Downing Street press conference. After the usual nonsense about “our plan is working”, Hancock got down to the nitty-gritty. He wanted to say a huge thank-you to the 2.2m people who had been shielding for the past three months, but would shortly be writing to them all individually to tell them their time was up. “Dear Shielder, “As of 6 July, we want you to reacquaint yourself with the outside world, so feel free to hang out in groups of up to six people. Have someone to stay overnight if you like. Because from August 1, the fun stops. That’s when the food boxes, the medicine drops and the statutory sick pay will end. Anyone found bunking off from then will be on their own. So prepare to get your compromised immune systems back to work. Lots of love, Matt.” Predictably, most of the questioners were sceptical that not all those who were shielding would be quite so thrilled by the news. Not because they weren’t keen to meet up with friends and families again, but because they didn’t trust the government to relax the guidelines in a sensible way. Matt just glared his disapproval. Though it might have looked as if the government was deciding policy by focus group, it was actually committed to doing everything in line with the science. And to prove his point, he handed over to deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries. “Thank you for guiding us through this crisis, Jenny,” he added. Which was a bit like thanking a wonky satellite that had been transmitting faulty data for the past three months. But Harries was determined to do her best to help. The infection rates had now fallen from 1 in 400 to 1 in 1,700, so you could meet 1,700 people before you were in danger of getting the coronavirus. Even my basic maths could see the logical problem with that. Then Jenny became positively Ayn Rand. “Work is good for you,” she continued, so it was the government’s job to push shielders through the pain barrier. Yes, some people might still think that a 1 in 1,700 chance of catching a disease that could kill you if you had underlying health issues was a risk they were unwilling to take, but once they had re-experienced the joys of stacking shelves at night, they would see the error of their ways. Things really began to fall apart, though, when it was gently pointed out that this was all a bit previous. Announcing the end of the shielding programme the day before the government was about to make wholesale changes to other lockdown guidelines really didn’t make sense. Given that many people were already treating the 2-metre rule as a 1-metre rule, a switch to a 1-metre rule would be the end of any kind of social distancing for some. And with travel restrictions being eased in line with the focus groups and the economy – sorry, the science, there was clearly no way of anyone knowing if the changes would lead to an increase in the rate and number of infections. So the end of shielding could be a death sentence for the shielders. Now Matt’s eyes narrowed. A man on the edge of a nervous breakdown. This was supposed to be a “good news” press conference and he was sick and tired of everyone being so negative. He didn’t care if the director of the World Health Organisation thought some countries were being too cavalier in unlocking too quickly. He was always guided by the science. And where the science disagreed, he was all in favour of following the science that took him places he wanted to go. He was fed up with people laughing at the UK’s mishandling of the coronavirus, so he was willing to take a punt on relaxing the rules to make us more like other countries. And if people started dying, then we could always lock down again. By the end, Matt looked as if he was going to crack completely. Just as well no one asked him about his nonexistent “world-beating” app."
2020-06-22T18:13:15Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: England and Northern Ireland ease shielding rules – as it happened,"Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that the shielding scheme will be eased for people in England from 6 July. He stressed that this decision would be reversed if necessary. He said: “I use the word ‘pause’ very deliberately because the (shielding) list will continue and should the clinical advice be that we need to bring it back in, then that is what we will do.” Hancock said that the incidence of coronavirus had fallen so much that now just one person in 1,700 had the disease, compared with one in 400 a month ago. He also said that the daily number of new cases, at 1,000, was at its lowest level since coronavirus started peaking in March, and that the daily headline UK death rate, at 15, was at its lowest level since mid March. The home secretary spoke in the Commons about events in Reading, in which three people were killed and at least three others were injured, in what was declared a terrorist incident. Priti Patel said that it is “clear that the threat posed by lone actors is growing”. She said: “The United Kingdom has the best security service and police in the world. Since 2017 they have foiled 25 terrorist plots including eight driven by right-wing ideologies. School exams could be delayed next summer to allow more teaching time, MPs were told. The government is considering delaying the 2021 summer exams because of the disruption caused by Covid, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, confirmed in the Commons.He told MPs the government would be consulting with exams watchdog Ofqual to push back the exam dates to later in the summer to maximise teaching time. The UK has recorded a further 15 coronavirus deaths, the lowest daily increase since mid-March. The Department for Health and Social care said: “As of 9am 22 June, there have been 8,029,757 tests, with 139,659 tests on 21 June. 305,289 people have tested positive.” They added: “As of 5pm on 21 June, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 42,647 have sadly died.”"
2020-06-22T17:15:32Z,politics,Politics,Calls for redesign of royal honour over 'offensive' image,"Campaigners are calling for the redesign of one of Britain’s highest honours personally bestowed by the Queen because they say its badge resembles a depiction of a white angel standing on the neck of a chained black man. The Order of St Michael and St George is traditionally awarded to ambassadors and diplomats and senior Foreign Office officials who have served abroad. It has three ranks, the highest of which is Knight Grand Cross (GCMG), followed by Knight Commander (KCMG) and Companion (CMG). The imagery on the award’s badge portrays St Michael trampling on Satan, but campaigners say the image is reminiscent of the killing of George Floyd by white police officers in the US that led to worldwide protests. A petition calling for the medal to be redesigned has attracted more than 2,000 signatures on change.org. The petition, started by Tracy Reeve, says: “This is a highly offensive image, it is also reminiscent of the recent murder of George Floyd by the white policeman in the same manner presented here in this medal. We the undersigned are calling for this medal to completely redesigned in a more appropriate way and for an official apology to be given for the offence it has given.” Bumi Thomas, a Nigerian British singer, activist and specialist in visual communications, said the imagery on the badge was clear. “It is not a demon; it is a black man in chains with a white, blue-eyed figure standing on his neck. It is literally what happened to George Floyd and what has been happening to black people for centuries under the guise of diplomatic missions: active, subliminal messaging that reinforces the conquest, subjugation and dehumanisation of people of colour. “It is a depiction on a supposed honour of the subjugation of the black and brown people of the world and the superiority of the white, a construct born in the 16th century. It is the definition of institutional racism that this image is not only permitted but celebrated on one of the country’s highest honours. Whilst statues are being pulled down and relocated, emblems and symbols of this nature also need to be redesigned to reflect a more progressive, holistic relationship between Britain and the Commonwealth nations.” Sir Simon Woolley, the director and one of the founders of Operation Black Vote, which campaigns for greater representation of ethnic minorities in politics and public life, said he was appalled by the badge. “The original image may have been of St Michael slaying Satan, but the figure has no horns or tail and is clearly a black man. It is a shocking depiction, and it is even more shocking that that image could be presented to ambassadors representing this country abroad,” he said. “This is the past that informs the present, and that’s why it symbolises everything that Black Lives Matter are campaigning for. It provides a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is to acknowledge it and own it, but the opportunity is to put it right. It is easy to get rid of an image, but I would like root-and-branch restructuring, because most of the institutions created by the empire are still there. “For most black and brown people, there is nothing good about the empire. Most people will see this as an image of George Floyd on a global scale and a symbol of white supremacy.” The Order was founded in 1818 under King George III. It was originally created to honour service in the Mediterranean during the Napoleonic wars. The motto that surrounds the image is Auspicium melioris ævi, Latin for “Omen of a better age”. Buckingham Palace has been approached for comment."
2020-06-22T16:59:26Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson wrong on child poverty at PMQs, public body says","The Office of the Children’s Commissioner for England has ruled that Boris Johnson made misleading claims about supposedly falling child poverty levels at prime minister’s questions, but backed claims made by Keir Starmer. Researchers for the commissioner, Anne Longfield, concluded that Johnson was wrong to claim that there were 400,000 fewer families living in poverty now than there were in 2010 and that it was “generally false” for him to say overall poverty levels were falling. In contrast, the fact-checking report by her office found that Starmer, the Labour leader, was correct to say 600,000 more children now lived in relative poverty compared with 2012, and the total number of children in poverty was forecast to rise steeply. The conclusions are something of a humiliation for the prime minister, who had followed a series of underwhelming PMQs performances against Starmer with a more bullish approach last week, which cheered some Conservative MPs. After Starmer had asked Johnson about a report by another government body, the Social Mobility Commission, which found child poverty was rising, the prime minister disputed this, saying there were 400,000 fewer families in poverty than in 2010. The children’s commissioner’s report noted that while there was no source for what Johnson meant by this, government data suggested an extra 800,000 people in families lived in relative poverty in 2018-19 compared with 2010-11. Under government statistics, relative poverty is defined as below 60% of the median net household income in that particular year. Another definition, for absolute poverty, does not vary, and is set as below 60% of the median net household income in 2010-11. The verdict on this claim read: “False. While there is no exact reference for this claim, it is not consistent with the official statistics.”
Johnson also claimed at PMQs that “absolute poverty and relative poverty have both declined under this government”, something the report said risked being “not specific enough to be verified”. However, it concluded the claim was “generally false”, as there were no government statistics showing declines in both measures. There had been a handful of years where one of the gauges fell, but it would be “a very selective reading of the data” if Johnson relied on this for his claim. In contrast, the researchers said official statistics did back up Starmer’s claims that 600,000 more children live in relative poverty compared with 2012, and said it was credible to cite a claim that the total number of children in poverty was projected to rise to 5.2 million by 2022. The latter figure comes from the Social Mobility Commission report, which in turn cites calculations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank. The researcher said: “It remains to be seen whether this forecast will materialise, and the forecast is now out of date because of Covid-19. But this caveat is not sufficient to disprove the claim: if there is reason to believe that Covid-19 will worsen poverty rates – in which case the claim is actually optimistic.” Longfield, whose role it is to stand up for the interests of children, commissioned the research from her staff after she was asked about the PMQs clash by ITV’s Robert Peston on his podcast last week."
2020-06-22T13:22:19Z,politics,Politics,No 10 distances itself from Robert Jenrick over planning row,"A Downing Street spokesman has declined to say whether No 10 knew that Robert Jenrick viewed a promotional video for a £1bn property development before overruling officials to approve it, heaping yet more pressure on the housing secretary. Jenrick has said he did not discuss the 500-apartment project in east London with Richard Desmond, the developer behind it, when they sat together at a Conservative party fundraising dinner two months before he made the decision. But Desmond, the multi-millionaire former owner of the Express newspaper titles, told the Sunday Times he showed Jenrick a video about the Westferry Printworks development at the dinner. “What I did was I showed him the video,” Desmond said, adding that Jenrick had watched it for “three or four minutes”. He said: “It’s quite long, so he got the gist.” Asked whether Jenrick had told Downing Street that he had watched the video, a spokesman would not comment, stressing only that No 10 had no involvement in the decision. “No one in No 10 has discussed the appeal with Mr Desmond, or the applicant, and No 10 had no involvement with the secretary of state’s appeal decision,” Boris Johnson’s spokesman said. He added: “What the communities secretary has said is, he is confident that all the rules were followed in taking the decision, and he has rejected the suggestion that there was any actual bias in the decision.” While the spokesman said Johnson maintained full confidence in Jenrick, any indication that he did not keep No 10 fully informed would increase the pressure on the communities secretary in a crucial week for his political future. Labour will use the opportunity of a three-hour opposition day debate on Wednesday to discuss the controversy. The shadow communities secretary, Steve Reed, is expected to press Jenrick on whether officials asked him to recuse himself from the decision, since viewing the video would appear to constitute lobbying by Desmond, potentially giving rise to a conflict of interest. Jenrick overturned a decision by a local council and the government’s planning inspectorate in order to approve the 44-storey development at a former printing plan. The decision in January came a day before the introduction of a community infrastructure levy (CIL) imposed by Tower Hamlets council, which would have cost Desmond’s company at least £40m, to be used for local education and health projects. After the council challenged his decision, Jenrick accepted it had been unlawful. It later emerged that Jenrick sat on the same table as Desmond at the fundraising event in November, and that two weeks after Jenrick’s planning decision, Desmond donated £12,000 to the Conservative party. While there is no investigation going on into the decision, both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have asked the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, to look into whether there had been a breach of the ministerial code. Sedwill had received letters from MPs about the matter, and Jenrick had supplied him with relevant correspondence, the No 10 spokesman said, adding: “The cabinet secretary will reply to those letters from MPs in due course.” In response to Desmond’s comments about the video, a spokesman for Jenrick said: “Mr Jenrick and the applicants were put on the same table for the dinner, although Mr Jenrick was not aware of this prior to arriving at the venue. The planning application was raised, but Mr Jenrick said it would not be appropriate to discuss the matter or for him to pass comment on it.” Labour MP Steve Reed, shadow communities secretary, said: “The government is now caught up in a cash-for-favours scandal that brings their moral authority into question: the prime minister must tell us whether he knew that Robert Jenrick watched this promotional video and publish all correspondence and documentation to show what really went on.”"
2020-06-22T11:55:15Z,politics,Politics,Theresa Villiers denies being sacked from intelligence committee,"The former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers has denied being sacked from the intelligence and security committee, claiming she was personally appointed by Boris Johnson just days ago. The former environment secretary said she was initially under pressure from party whips over her voting record, having most recently voted to ban the import of chlorinated chicken into the UK in a post-Brexit trade deal. However, she said she was telephoned personally by the prime minister, who invited her on to the committee with no restrictions on how she chooses to vote on trade issues. “As far as I know I’m one of the Conservative MPs nominated to join the intelligence and security committee,” Villiers said. “I very much look forward to playing my part on this important scrutiny body, overseeing the work of the intelligence services.” The committee has not met for six months – the longest since it was formed in 1994 – after government delays in appointing the Conservative members. It is sitting on a report into alleged Russian influence on UK politics, which was completed in October 2019 and can only be released once the group has reconvened. Johnson was criticised for not releasing it before the general election. Villiers has been at the centre of reports about the committee in recent days after suggestions she was ousted for disloyalty to the government. This uncertainty around her position was claimed to be part of the reason the committee had still not reconvened six months on from the general election. It is understood whips warned her that if she rebelled against the government, her position on the committee would not be tenable. She was then asked to vote with the government on future trade matters, which she said she could not promise and so assumed she had been dropped from the body. However, just days ago she received a personal call from Johnson securing her position with no voting restrictions. She believes reports of her being sacked are incorrect. The government has faced sustained criticism for not resolving its nominees for the committee, which oversees the work of MI5. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael, said the delay raised ethical questions, considering the Russia report led by the previous committee chair, Dominic Grieve, was submitted on 17 October 2019 and it usually takes 10 days to sign off. Earlier on Monday the security minister, James Brokenshire, said the committee would be set up in the “near term”. Brokenshire told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “The prime minister is looking at the membership and obviously to bring forward and to see the ISC is constituted and I’m sure that it will come forward in the near term.” He said the government attached great importance to scrutiny. “I’m quite sure the prime minister is considering the membership and considering reconstitution very rigorously to see that back in place.” Villiers said: “I certainly expect to see the committee set up soon. It would make sense to make sure it’s in operation before the summer recess.” The former transport minister Chris Grayling and the ex-ministers John Hayes and Mike Penning are the other Tory nominees for the committee."
2020-06-21T23:01:28Z,politics,Politics,Former chancellor Alistair Darling calls for emergency VAT cut,"The former chancellor Alistair Darling has urged the government to consider an emergency cut in VAT amid growing speculation that the Treasury will make a tax cut on consumer spending the centre of a plan to boost Britain’s post-Covid-19 recovery. Rishi Sunak will announce a package of measures in early July intended to help those sectors of the economy, such as retailing, recover from the impact of a three-month lockdown. Options being considered by the chancellor include a repeat of Darling’s decision in November 2008 to reduce the standard rate of VAT, which then stood at 17.5% and is now 20%. Darling, who was responsible for the economy during the global financial crisis of 2008, said in the foreword to a report from the centre-right thinktank Policy Exchange that a tax cut to stimulate consumer spending made sense. “After the Covid-19 crisis subsides, we will enter a new period of recovery. Increasing taxes will not be the answer here, even as the budget deficit and government debt rises. If anything, emergency tax cuts – slashing VAT to 15% for instance, as I did in November 2008 – should be considered to boost consumer spending.” A five-point cut in the standard rate of VAT would cost £35bn in lost revenue, and Sunak’s immediate predecessor, Sajid Javid, said the Treasury should be thinking about a three-point cut to 17%, which would cost £21bn. Official figures released last week showed a 12% increase in retail sales from the trough hit during April but Sunak is anxious to support spending as the Treasury’s furloughing scheme is tapered. Other ideas being considered include cutting employers’ national insurance contributions to encourage businesses to hold on to workers as the wage subsidies come to an end. Plans for a summer package of measures have been under discussion for weeks but the government has been waiting to see if lockdown restrictions would be further eased before going ahead. With an announcement imminent that social distancing will be reduced from 2 metres to one, Sunak will outline his plan in early July. The Treasury said the statement would not amount to a mini-budget or include fresh economic forecasts, but would contain some eye-catching measures. The Policy Exchange report, co-authored by Gerard Lyons, Boris Johnson’s chief economic adviser when he was mayor of London, said higher public spending on infrastructure projects was needed to secure economic recovery and deliver on the government’s “levelling up” pledge. Amid evidence that seats in older industrial towns – many won for the first time by the Conservatives in the last general election – have been hardest hit by Covid-19, Policy Exchange said there should be no repeat of the cuts in capital spending imposed by David Cameron’s coalition government in 2010. Lyons, a senior Policy Exchange fellow, said: “The economy is experiencing a paradigm shift and increased capital spending is the way forward.” Policy Exchange’s paper says after Covid-19, the government should prioritise: Electric vehicle-charging infrastructure investment, a rare example of a “shovel-ready” project. Gigabit-capable broadband, due to probable changing patterns of working in future. Investment in energy R&D, notably hydrogen, to help the UK decarbonise. Health-related infrastructure such as green walking and cycling routes. Transport upgrades, including support for local authorities, national parks and landowners such as the National Trust to encourage walking and cycling. Improving (and where possible adding to) public parks, sport, leisure and swimming facilities. The report said infrastructure projects costing less than £500m should be devolved to metro and local authorities. The priority should be smaller projects that were shovel-ready, it added."
2020-06-21T13:18:37Z,politics,Politics,Jenrick under growing pressure after fresh Desmond revelation,"Labour will step up the pressure this week on the embattled communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, after it emerged that he viewed a promotional video for a £1bn property development before overruling officials to approve it. According to a report in the Sunday Times, the property developer Richard Desmond showed Jenrick the video on his phone when the pair sat next to each other at a Conservative party fundraising dinner. “What I did was I showed him the video,” Desmond told the Sunday Times, adding that Jenrick had watched it for “three or four minutes”, and adding: “It’s quite long, so he got the gist.” Jenrick subsequently overturned a decision by a local council and the government’s planning inspectorate in order to approve a 500-apartment, 44-storey development at Westferry Printworks, a former printing plan in east London. Labour will use the opportunity of a three-hour opposition day debate on Wednesday to discuss the controversy. The shadow communities secretary, Steve Reed, is expected to press Jenrick on whether officials asked him to recuse himself from the decision, since viewing the video would appear to constitute lobbying by Desmond, potentially giving rise to a conflict of interest.
It was the prospect of an opposition day debate last week, and the accompanying vote, that helped force Boris Johnson to extend free school meals vouchers over the school summer holidays, after a campaign from the footballer Marcus Rashford. Jenrick’s move to approve the Westferry development in January came a day before the introduction of the community infrastructure levy, to be used for local education and health projects, which would have cost Desmond’s company at least £40m. It later emerged the property developer had made a £12,000 donation to the Tory party, two weeks after the planning decision in his favour was made. When the local council, Tower Hamlets, sought a judicial review of Jenrick’s decision, he conceded the case, admitting he had acted unlawfully – and reversed the decision. Asked about his contact with Desmond at the fundraising event, Jenrick told MPs last Monday: “The department was fully informed of my attendance at the event. I discussed with my officials that the applicant had raised the matter. I advised the applicant that I was not able to discuss it.” He said he was “inadvertently” seated next to Desmond. The cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, is examining details of the case provided by Jenrick, but No 10 has denied this amounts to a formal investigation. Downing Street has been pressed on whether the prime minister or any of his team had met Desmond. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, defended his cabinet colleague on Sunday, telling the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “Mr Jenrick answered questions for an hour in the House of Commons this week; he’s put out a statement about this which is perfectly reasonable.” Jenrick declined to answer an urgent question tabled by Reed, sending a junior minister, Paul Scully, in his place: but MPs took the opportunity to quiz him about the issue when he appeared for regular departmental questions last Monday. A spokesperson for the communities secretary said: “Mr Jenrick and the applicants were put on the same table for the dinner, although Mr Jenrick was not aware of this prior to arriving at the venue. The planning application was raised, but Mr Jenrick said it would not be appropriate to discuss the matter or for him to pass comment on it.”"
2020-06-21T10:47:17Z,politics,Politics,DfID staff 'devastated and demoralised' by Foreign Office merger,"Downing Street is facing growing anger from staff at the Department for International Development (DfID), some of whom accuse it of exploiting the Covid-19 pandemic by pushing through a merger with the Foreign Office (FCO). Plans had long been mooted to combine the two Whitehall departments but insiders were shocked by the timing and manner of the announcement – which came without union consultation, with many staff finding out via an apparent leak to the media. DfID employees criticised the merger, with one saying staff were “devastated, demoralised, angry, anxious” and claiming Boris Johnson had seized on the pandemic to “achieve a long-term goal” in axing the department as a standalone entity. Another said it was a politicised, opportunistic move that had “pulled the rug away” from under staffers’ feet, with many worried about job security. Unions representing DfID civil servants, who have written to the FCO demanding formal consultation over the plans, said their members were “shocked and angered” and that the staff testimony obtained by the Guardian was a “damning indictment”. Sarah Champion, the chair of the Commons’ international development select committee – which released an interim report earlier this month arguing for the retention of DfID as a standalone government department – said the timing and way in which the merger was announced was “callous”. She added that the government’s treatment of staff was “outrageous”. Johnson announced the merger on Tuesday in the Commons, pledging to maintain DfID’s £15bn budget and the UK’s commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on aid. Many DfID employees discovered the news hours earlier from a tweet by the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. DfID, formed in 1997 – although incarnations have existed under previous governments – employs about 3,600 staff working in offices in London and East Kilbride, as well as around the world. Plans for the new department, to be called the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and due to be set up by September, have been criticised by three former prime ministers. One DfID employee, whose identity the Guardian is protecting, said: “I feel like the majority of staff have a mix of emotions on the merger – devastated, demoralised, angry, anxious. You could just pick a negative emotion and I’ve felt it at some point since we heard the news. “It’s been a long-held goal for the Conservative party, and Boris Johnson in particular, to merge the departments, so it wasn’t a complete bolt from the blue. But nobody expected it would come so quickly. As civil servants, we felt we should have been told first, but we found out through leaks to the media before the prime minister’s statement to the House of Commons. It just shows the contempt they have for DfID. “This is about the prime minister using the pandemic to achieve a long-term goal and making a snap announcement about it and not even giving staff the opportunity to react.” Another DfID employee said: “Like most people at DfID, I’m really passionate about my job and I’m still reeling at the news of the merger. There’s been murmurings about it, the signs were there, but no one thought it would happen now as we’re in the midst of the pandemic. We’re all sitting at home struggling with dealing with the ramifications of this. It’s pulled the rug away from everyone’s feet. “There’s a tide of confusion, disbelief and uncertainty among staff. Are their jobs safe? How is this going to work? How long is it going to take? They’re saying it’ll be done by September but that’s 11 weeks away, and the government doesn’t move quick. Then there’s the question of whether this is a merger or a Foreign Office takeover. Are we being subsumed? We’re angry and upset. There have been a lot of tears. “I think the government has been opportunistic with its timing on the merger announcement. They seem to be using the crisis so that this goes under the radar. It’s a politicised move, and about cuts as well.” Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), said: “The testimony people in DfID have given is a damning indictment of the decision to merge the department with FCO … Boris Johnson’s slash-and-burn approach to international aid not only threatens the livelihoods of our members in DfID and FCO but will significantly damage our relations with other countries at a time when we need all the friends we can muster.” Allan Sampson, the national officer at FDA – which represents senior civil servants – said: “Members in DfID were shocked and angered by the announcement, made worse by the fact they initially found out about it through the media. Their immediate fear is for the number of jobs available within the new department, but concern also exists regarding the nature of the new work.” Champion said: “DfID staff do the job because they believe in the work, it’s more than a job for them – it’s a moral drive to try and alleviate poverty. To have the government use the department as a pawn in this way and staff treated with so little respect or compassion, is outrageous. It shows a level of a callousness that I would never expect of a UK government. I’m not fundamentally against a merger, I just haven’t seen any evidence that shows it’s the right way forward.” A government spokesman said DfID staff “can take pride” in their work, saying their “ambition, vision and expertise will be at the heart of the new department”, which will “bring together our international effort and maximise the influence and impact of our world-leading development and foreign policy experts”. They added: “The merger will mean adjustments in how teams are structured in the new department, and some roles and responsibilities across both DfID and FCO will change. But there will be no compulsory redundancies, and we will work closely with staff throughout the process of implementing the merger – including through the unions.”"
2020-06-21T08:14:10Z,politics,Politics,Blundering Boris: how U-turns and broken promises have split the Tories,"After another terrible week for the government that saw two more screeching U-turns and warnings from Tory backbenchers of mounting discontent in the ranks, a former cabinet minister from Theresa May’s time as prime minister had this to say. “If we were in normal times you would be hearing talk by now about removing the prime minister. It is that bad. But you don’t get rid of leaders in a crisis like this.” The same Tory MP said that a batch of cabinet ministers including education secretary Gavin Williamson also deserved to be sacked and that the No 10 operation was “totally dysfunctional”. There were so many decisions of crucial importance in the fight against Covid-19 that had to be referred up the chain of command to Downing Street that its hugely inexperienced staff – many of whom were more used to running campaigns than the country - were simply unable to cope. Three months into the lockdown such views are now widely shared on the Conservative benches as the list of U-turns and broken promises over Covid-19 grows. The latest – a decision by health secretary Matt Hancock to ditch the tracing app hailed by Boris Johnson only weeks ago as “world beating” – prompted the Daily Mail to splash a despairing headline across its front page on Friday asking: “How many more Corona fiascos?” Only two days earlier Marcus Rashford, the Manchester United and England striker, had forced Johnson to do an about turn over free schools meals for the poorest pupils in the latest humiliation for the prime minister. Tory anger, already raised to dangerous levels by the recent scrapping of plans to re-open all primary schools before the summer holidays, was heightened still further by endless taunts about Rashford hitting the target, while Johnson and his Tory government had missed it yet again.
And all this as the UK’s death toll from Covid-19 climbed towards 50,000, the worst performance of any European country, and as it heads into an economic downturn, which the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expects to be more serious than those heading the way of any of our neighbour nations. The last three months have not only transformed profoundly the daily lives of every UK citizen but have also changed utterly the political mood in Westminster and the country. When Johnson announced the lockdown on 23 March, Jeremy Corbyn was still the Labour party’s leader, limping towards the end his tenure, while Johnson soared in the polls.
Johnson even enjoyed a post-lockdown surge in ratings as his honeymoon with the electorate survived the closure of pubs, restaurants and shops. There was a rallying round the flag that seemed to play perfectly, for a time at least, for the Tory leader who modelled himself on Winston Churchill. In the last Opinium poll for The Observer in late March, the week after the lockdown began, the Tories had a massive 26-point lead over Labour (54% to 28%). Johnson’s personal approval rating was at +29%. This weekend’s poll, by contrast, has Labour under Keir Starmer neck and neck with the Conservatives, with Johnson’s approval ratings and those of his government having gone through the floor. Immediately after Starmer won Labour’s leadership contest on 4 April, many at Westminster thought he might struggle to make his mark with the pandemic raging. The seriousness of the nation’s plight meant he had little option but to offer to abandon normal political hostilities and pledge instead to work together in the national interest where possible with Johnson’s government.
But soon it became apparent that Johnson and his administration, together with the Whitehall machine, had not planned adequately for the pandemic. Evidence came to light showing that the prime minister, while revelling in having delivered Brexit, had been asleep at the wheel in early to mid March as the virus spread to the West. It became clear that crucial days and weeks in which hard decisions should have been taken had been missed and that the lockdown had been ordered too late. Chaos ensued as NHS and care staff complained of a lack of personal protective equipment and the contact tracing system which had controlled the spread of the virus in countries like South Korea, was suddenly and mysteriously abandoned here. Subsequently ministers and health experts would admit that there simply had not been the capacity to carry out enough tests precisely when they were needed. As the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths soared and hospitals emptied their oldest patients who carried the virus into care homes, worsening the spread, trust in Johnson’s government began to drain away. Starmer, not wanting to be associated with the increasingly obvious failings gradually turned up the criticism and picked holes in Johnson’s defences at successive prime minister’s questions. Then last month the Guardian and Daily Mirror broke the story of how Johnson’s closest adviser Dominic Cummings had appeared to breach rules by driving with his wife and child to Durham – something for which he refused to resign or apologise – and trust in Johnson’s regime hit the floor. On Monday evening, Tory concerns at the way the government was handling the crisis were aired at a meeting of the executive of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers. Senior MPs were furious that No 10 was blundering on while refusing to listen to advice offered by them on how to avoid more disasters. Since then concerns have been expressed privately by many of the new Tory MPs from seats in the north of England who went on local radio and television stations to speak out against free school meals only to see the government pull the rug from under them and do its U-turn days later. Another former cabinet minister said: “They feel very bruised. They went out in public to take the government line, when the more cynical of us could see a U-turn coming and made ourselves unavailable to the media for a couple of days.”
There is still more than four years for Johnson and his government to recover its poise and sense of direction, and for the memories of Covid-19 crisis to fade. It is true also that Starmer, while having proved effective in criticising the Tories for their failings so far, has yet to offer much of his own agenda for the future. But the transformed mood among the new generation of Tory MPs who came to Westminster expecting so much in December is telling. They arrived so optimistic about Johnson’s government and their party, only to see it flounder. An ex-minister added: “A lot of them were elected unexpectedly and so from December 12 to the end of January they were having the world’s most-extended Christmas because everything they had ever dreamed of had landed in their laps. “Since then, though, the plague has arrived and their entire life has been turned upside down and they don’t know what has hit them.”"
2020-06-21T06:24:08Z,politics,Politics,Home Office 'uses racial bias' when detaining immigrants,"Black people are detained significantly longer than white people inside the UK’s immigration detention system, prompting fresh claims of “institutional racism”. Although the Home Office does not record ethnicity data for detainees, analysis of nationalities of those recently held within the immigration detention estate found that citizens from countries with predominantly black and brown populations are held for substantially longer periods than those from predominantly white countries. New data, released by pressure group Detention Action, found that during 2019 90% of Australian nationals were released before spending 28 days in detention compared with 40% of Jamaican nationals and 60% of Nigerian nationals. Bella Sankey, director of the group, said that the disparity indicated a racial bias in the approach of the Home Office. “Our immigration detention and deportation systems are institutionally racist,” she said. “Indefinite detention was invented as part of an explicit government effort to reduce black and brown migration to the UK.”
Sankey added: “In 2020 black people are detained in wildly disproportionate numbers and for longer periods than white people. We urgently need a universal time limit on detention to end this endemic dehumanisation.” The UK is the only European country that does not impose a time limit, with some held for years before being released. A parliamentary committee is one of many groups demanding that ministers introduce a 28-day time limit on immigration detention. The new analysis found that of 44 Canadians detained, 40 were released from immigration detention within seven days compared with 17 of 100 Zimbabweans. The Home Office uses detention centres to hold people before they are deported for immigration offences or released into the community. Although they are meant to be used sparingly, around 24,000 people were held in detention centres last year. In a report issued last Wednesday, auditors also pointed out that the Home Office has not changed its estimated size of the illegal population for 15 years, and that nearly two-thirds of immigration enforcement detainees are released from detention without removal. Around a third – approximately a 1,000 – being held in immigration detention centres were freed at the height of the coronavirus pandemic to try and stop the spread of the virus. They are now waiting to learn what will happen to them once the lockdown is further eased. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Decisions on the appropriateness of an individual’s detention are made on the evidence in their case, subject to regular reviews and have nothing to do with their race.”"
2020-06-21T06:13:08Z,politics,Politics,September reshuffle expected in effort to stem faltering Tory poll ratings,"Ministers are expecting a wide-ranging government reshuffle in September in which Boris Johnson will sack key figures who are judged to have underperformed in the Covid-19 crisis. Cabinet sources said the move was now seen as inevitable. They believe sweeping changes will be made in an attempt to defuse mounting discontent on the Tory backbenches following a stream of U-turns and a fall in the party’s poll ratings. Among those seen as vulnerable are education secretary Gavin Williamson, communities secretary Robert Jenrick and work and pensions secretary Thérèse Coffey. Senior backbenchers and former ministers have become increasingly frustrated after a week in which Johnson’s government performed two further U-turns over free school meals for children from poorer families, and the much vaunted Covid-19 tracing app. There is also growing anger among Tory MPs at the way Downing Street is centralising control and refusing to listen to ministers or backbenchers. On Saturday night, Whitehall sources said government was ready to perform yet another U-turn by shelving much-trailed plans to extend Sunday trading hours. Instead ministers want to prioritise legislation necessary to loosen the lockdown by allowing more “al fresco” dining and drinking, which will be unveiled in the Commons this week.
Writing on the Observer’s website, Sir Bernard Jenkin, chair of the House of Commons liaison committee, warns against centralisation by No 10. In what will be seen as criticism of the prime minister’s closest adviser, Dominic Cummings, Jenkin writes: “The government has looked on the defensive recently, mainly because of the nature of the crisis and what it inherited, but centralisation of power is not the answer. Great leaders listen and engage those around them, welcoming challenge. They treat all truths, however bad, as good news and as an opportunity to learn.” The mood is also increasingly rancorous among activists who are alarmed at the party’s slide in the polls. The former MP Paul Goodman, who now edits grassroots Tory website ConservativeHome, suggested a change of personnel at the top would help. “The government has the same operational problem as Theresa May did before the 2017 election – namely, a decision-making bottleneck. “It isn’t terminal, but it’s problematic. What would help would be bigger, braver cabinet ministers and a more relaxed, collegiate central operation. No one seriously thinks that this cabinet is the Conservative first 11.”
Johnson is coming under pressure from some MPs to beef up his Cabinet team with more experience. Names being tipped for returns to the top table include Jeremy Hunt and Liam Fox. Downing Street sources said there were “no imminent plans” for a cabinet reshuffle. Johnson is expected on Tuesday to announce plans to relax the two-metre social distancing rule when the Covid-19 infection rate has fallen further. Legislation will also be introduced to allow pubs and restaurants more latitude to serve drinks and food outside. Ministers are also hoping to bring forward plans for travel corridors to be set up between the UK and up to eight other countries to allow more holidays. The arts sector is confident that ministers will soon bring forward plans to prevent the collapse of the West End and major entertainment venues. This follows interventions from West End producer Cameron Mackintosh, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber and the director Sam Mendes."
2020-06-20T19:00:55Z,politics,Politics,"Merging DfID with Foreign Office is an act of vandalism, says Andrew Mitchell","The merger of the Department for International Development with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is a “quite extraordinary self-inflicted wound” that will do “huge damage” to Britain’s influence in the world, according to a former Dfid secretary of state. Andrew Mitchell spoke out against Boris Johnson’s decision as opposition to the merger grows. “I’ve had messages from all over the world. People shaking their heads in disbelief at this utterly self-inflicted act of vandalism,” said Mitchell, who ran Dfid between 2010 and 2012. “Senior figures will be poached – Geneva and New York’s gain will be Britain’s loss. We are destroying at a stroke a key aspect of global Britain.” Several petitions against the merger, including one organised by the online campaign group 38 Degrees and Bono’s development charity, One, have so far attracted more than 100,000 signatures. The creation of the new super-department, which will be called the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, has been a key aim of Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings. Johnson said the “long overdue reform” would ensure “maximum value” for taxpayers. But many politicians fear it will weaken Britain’s influence. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has said he would re-establish Dfid if elected prime minister. Three former prime ministers – David Cameron, Gordon Brown and Tony Blair – have also attacked the move. Johnson said that for too long Britain’s aid spending had “been treated as some giant cashpoint in the sky that arrives without any reference to UK interests”. The Bishop of Leeds, Nick Baines, said: “The UK aid budget must be to meet need, not form part of a national interest agenda.”
Sir Desmond Swayne, a former Dfid minister, told parliament last week that Dfid has “an international reputation for transparency. Everything it spends is arrayed for view and scrutiny on its website.” An Opinium poll for the Observer reveals that how the aid budget is spent has become a key issue for voters. More than half, or 53%, of the public believe aid should be focused on reducing poverty around the globe. Only 25% say it should primarily be used to protect the national interest. Johnson has pledged that Dfid’s £15bn budget will be maintained, with the UK committed to continuing to spend 0.7% of national income on aid projects. But Mitchell sounded caution. “You will now start to hear the argument: ‘Oh the 0.7 rules aren’t quite right for us in Britain. Just like with the European Court of Justice, we need to make our own rules for how our aid money is spent’. “You will hear the case being put for abandoning the international consensus, pulling out of the OECD development assistance committee which makes these rules and which we signed up to after the war. Not even Donald Trump has done that.”"
2020-06-20T13:53:33Z,politics,Politics,Russia report: UK MPs condemn 'utterly reprehensible' delay,"The government’s apparent refusal to release a report into Russian infiltration in the UK and to delay establishing a key scrutiny committee has been condemned as unprecedented and “utterly reprehensible”. The Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) has not met since before the general election in December – its longest break since it was established in 1994 – and critics say the government has sat on the committee’s report into Russian interference for nine months. The former chair of the committee Dominic Grieve said the report had been sent to Downing Street on 17 October and was ready for publication once it had been signed off, a process that usually takes up to 10 days. The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael, said: “Given the prime minister has for nine months sat on the intelligence committee report into Russian interference of our democracy, his decision to delay nominations to the committee raises serious ethical questions. “This unprecedented underhand behaviour is utterly reprehensible. It leaves the public in little doubt that Boris Johnson is avoiding the truth about the Tory party’s funding connections to Russian oligarchs.”
Thirty cross-party MPs wrote to the prime minister earlier this week urging for the reconstitution of the committee, saying the refusal to publish the report raised serious questions about the “transparency and integrity” of the democratic process. It said: “The publication last month of the latest donations to the Conservative party has highlighted once again the party’s deep connections to Russian oligarchs, raising further questions as to why you are so reluctant to reconstitute the ISC. “According to the Hansard Society, ‘at nearly six months, the time taken to appoint the ISC on this occasion has now exceeded that taken to appoint the committee after every previous general election since the committee was established in 1994’. “It is untenable for you to continue to block the publication of the Russia report. The situation is an affront to democracy.” The ISC is one of the most important committees in parliament, overseeing seven agencies and departments involved in UK intelligence. Conor McGinn, the shadow Home Office minister, tweeted: “It is deeply worrying that the government is preventing the Intelligence and Security Committee from doing its vital work. It must be allowed to publish the delayed Russia report and get on with its important role overseeing UK intelligence.” The Scottish National party’s Ian Blackford, a former member of the committee, has accused the government of “repeatedly and intentionally failing to establish parliament’s intelligence and security committee to escape scrutiny on important security matters”.
Ministers were told earlier this year they can no longer say there have been “no successful examples” of Russian disinformation affecting UK elections, after the apparent hacking of an NHS dossier seized on by Labour during the last campaign. Ahead of the election in December, fresh evidence emerged of attempts by a senior Russian diplomat, Sergey Nalobin – who once described the future prime minister as “our good friend” – to cultivate leading Tories during his five years in London . A Downing Street spokesperson said: “Work to establish the committee is ongoing and as quickly as current circumstances allow, and further announcements will be made in due course. “The Investigatory Powers Act allows the UK to maintain one of the most stringent scrutiny regimes in the world through the investigatory powers commissioner, the investigatory powers tribunal and both executive and judicial oversight.” According to the Times, the holdup to the formation of the intelligence watchdog can partially be explained by the removal of a provisional member, Tory MP Theresa Villiers, by No 10 for disloyalty. She defied the party whip on an amendment that would have banned the import of chlorinated chicken in any US trade deal. Former security minister John Hayes and former transport secretary Chris Grayling have been chosen by Johnson to be on the committee, the latter as chair, the paper said."
2020-06-20T13:00:47Z,politics,Politics,Rented e-scooters ride to the rescue of English commuters as Covid lockdown eases,"Rented motorised scooters could soon be ubiquitous in many English cities as councils prepare pilot projects aimed at relieving pressure on public transport caused by the coronavirus. The Department for Transport is expected to publish its framework for e-scooters next week, which will give details of how the system of rented scooters will work. Privately owned scooters will still be banned. The framework was originally due to be published tomorrow but has been delayed while issues around who will be eligible to ride the scooters is resolved. The UK is years behind many other European countries in an initiative that is credited with cutting the number of car journeys. In Finland, 41% of respondents to a survey said they had replaced taxi rides or private cars with e-scooters and almost one in five Finns said they had used them for business trips. However, other European cities have suffered from allowing too many scooter rental companies to compete with as many as 10 being given licences, leading to banks of scooters strewn across pavements blocking pedestrians. Many cities in the US have experienced “scooter rage” with residents throwing the machines into rivers because there are so many of them weaving along pavements. It is thought that only a handful of companies will be allowed to compete against one other in each of the pilot cities. About 30 city councils, including Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester, Cambridge, Bath and London have said they are interested in participating in the pilot tests, which are expected to run for 12 months. The framework will confirm that e-scooters are allowed to use public roads, cycle lanes and tracks and are exempt from vehicle registration and licensing. However, they will require insurance and will be limited to a 12.5mph speed restriction. There will be no legal requirement for riders to wear a helmet.
Analysis suggests that around 60% of all car journeys in the UK are for distances of between one and five kilometres, which suggests that e-scooters could help reduce congestion and pollution from cars. One e-scooter rental company, Voi, which has made its name in Scandinavia, estimates it could provide 100,000 daily rides across London, with each scooter being used between seven and 11 times a day. “Cities need to give people more transport options to help them get around without resorting to cars,” said Fredrik Hjelm, chief executive of Voi. “We believe that as we have demonstrated in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Germany, we can help replace short car journeys of one to three miles with e-scooter trips.” Supporters of e-scooters believe that the Covid-19 crisis could give the companies behind them an unexpected boost. “During the crisis we have seen lots of people realising that they don’t need a car to make short trips and the decision to accelerate e-scooter trials will provide another non-polluting way for people to travel safely and take the pressure off public transport,” said Hamish Stewart, organiser of London Car Free Day. Richard Dilks, chief executive of CoMoUK, the shared transport organisation, said: “E-scooter trials will help us to pivot further to more sustainable transport, which we urgently need given transport’s record on greenhouse gas emissions. Operators and authorities need to come together to prioritise safety, data, parking, viability and user experience as well as making e-scooters low risk from Covid-19.” There are some 774,000 e-scooters operating around the world at the moment, but this is predicted to rise to 4.6m by 2024, according to Berg Insight. The global e-scooter market was recently valued at $20bn but will be worth an estimated $42bn by 2030, according to analysts at Grand View Research."
2020-06-20T08:00:42Z,politics,Politics,Angela Rayner: 'Boris Johnson needs to get up off his backside and lead',"There are few more delicate subjects to raise with a new boss than the question of replacing him. So it’s lucky for Angela Rayner that Keir Starmer broached it first. Back in April, when they were crowned deputy leader and leader of the Labour party respectively, Rayner was still recovering from suspected Covid-19. (She didn’t get tested, but says she was “very poorly”, with all the symptoms.) Days later, Boris Johnson fell ill. What, they wondered, if Starmer were next? “One of the first conversations we had was, if something happened to Keir, we’ve got to put the mechanisms in place for me to lead the party – and what happens if Boris doesn’t make it through the next 48 hours? Not what I expected to be discussing,” she recalls. But as she points out, it says something about the way Starmer treats people around him. “I didn’t have to ask him or say: ‘Can I just clarify…?’ He volunteered that. And that’s a different approach, it’s an approach of mutual respect.” The new shadow cabinet has met throughout lockdown by Zoom call, which Rayner says feels “strange” but has its diversions. “We can all mooch round each other’s houses, get a good nosy.” Not for her the cliched backdrop of carefully curated bookshelves, though; when our Zoom call connects she’s in the lounge at home, TV flickering in the background, the family’s golden retriever Luna trying to scramble into her lap. When I ask if Starmer’s meetings are more orderly than Jeremy Corbyn’s, she says wryly that it helps “when you’ve got a mute button, and everyone has to take their turn”. When we speak for the first time, in late May, Rayner is fresh from a conference call with Johnson on easing lockdown. Given his patchy recent performance under interrogation from the Commons liaison committee, does she think he’s firing on all cylinders? “If he is, his piston’s misfiring,” she snorts. “He’s like those cars that look great, but you look under the bonnet and the engine’s not got any power at all. He hasn’t really got the detail.” Still, she swears she takes no pleasure in the government’s problems, echoing Starmer’s strategy of constructive opposition in a crisis. “Johnson really hasn’t stepped up, and I wanted him to, because I need my constituents to feel safe and be protected. I wanted him to do well.” It is sentiments like this that make some on the left suspicious of the 40-year-old MP for Ashton-under-Lyne. Her politics are hard to pigeonhole, mixing staunch support for socialist policies such as nationalising utility companies, with praise for war veterans and police officers’ willingness to put themselves in harm’s way during lockdown, a stance that owes more to the old Labour right. But that’s not the only paradox. Running for deputy after only five years in parliament takes guts and ambition, especially at this critical point in Labour’s fortunes. (The Labour MP Jess Phillips, elected alongside her in 2015, once summarised Rayner’s strengths as “heart, a sense of purpose and a sturdy understanding of what she is here to do”.) Yet even now she says she occasionally holds back in meetings for lack of confidence; she’s open and friendly, but deep down there’s something more guarded. When I ask if she trusts people easily, she answers unhesitatingly: “No.” *** Angela Rayner was born in Stockport, Greater Manchester, in 1980. As a small child, she would often go to her nana’s on Sundays for a bath. They didn’t have hot water at home, she explains, because heating was expensive. But her grandmother had an immersion heater and washing machine. “She’d do all our washing, and she’d iron it. My mum never ironed anything, so you can imagine – when my nana washed and ironed our stuff it would look new; when my mum did it, it was all wrinkly and grey.” Looking clean, she explains, reduced the chances of being picked on. “It’s those poverty problems, where you get battered at school…”
What’s striking is that she tells this story not with anger or self-pity but a smile, as if to reassure you it’s all fine now. Neither of Rayner’s parents worked, and their volatile marriage ended in her teens; at around 10, she became the main carer for a mother struggling with mental illness, who was occasionally suicidal. “I’d always looked after myself,” she says. “My mum had bipolar, so I’d always been the mum in our relationship.” Her mother had a difficult childhood of her own, never learning to read or write, which helps explain Rayner’s worries about the impact of school shutdowns on vulnerable children. “If it was me now – my mum couldn’t read to me. I worry about the kids that are from the background I was from.” She went hungry sometimes, wheedling tea at friends’ houses. By her early teens she was sneaking into Manchester nightclubs, seeking affection from older men. “As a young person, I just thought my mum didn’t love us and she was a bad mum. But actually I realise that my mum wasn’t loved, she didn’t know how to love. She didn’t have an opportunity to go back into education,” she says. “It’s about recognising that bad things happen to good people and it’s not something that they’re always in control of, and trying to help. I never want people to feel like my mum did.” They have a good relationship now and, while Rayner credits training as a Samaritan, aged 18, with helping her understand her mother’s problems, politics gave her a language to articulate them. In January, she launched her deputy leadership campaign on the Bridgehall council estate, where she grew up. When she had her son Ryan at 16, Rayner worried about reinforcing stereotypes about “people from my estate” getting pregnant and going on benefits, when that was never her aim. “I don’t think that’s how most working-class people feel, actually. I wanted to be there for my son, I wanted to prove to him that I could be a good mum, so I wanted to work.” Her nana, holding down three low-paid jobs herself, stepped in again by minding the baby while Rayner worked nights as a home help. “My nana was hardcore. She’s my inspiration.” That job was “the first time a person in a position of authority needed me as an equal”, she says. Suddenly retired professors and police officers were relying on her. “It was implied from the minute I went to school and was behind my peers: know your place. Even on the council estate, I had a place.” Yet now she saw that place might occasionally be transcended. Initially Rayner worked for a private agency, and it was only when she got a job with Stockport council that she finally got training, sick pay and longer slots with needy clients. So when the council threatened to outsource their service, she protested. “The girls I worked alongside said, ‘You should be our union rep.’ And I was like, ‘What’s a union?’” She found out by joining Unison, ending up on a national board to negotiate equal pay for council workers while only in her 20s. *** In Tory hands, this could become a tale of hauling herself up by her bootstraps, but Rayner stresses the transformative power of the state and the solidarity of unions instead. What saved her, she says, is that “I found a family. I found the trade union movement. I was dysfunctional before that. I didn’t care about myself… Suddenly I had a home, and felt that I was accepted for who I was. It nurtured me.” A decade ago she married her husband Mark, a Unison official with whom she has two other sons, Charlie, 12, and Jimmy, 11. Three years ago, Ryan became a father himself aged 20, making Rayner a 37-year-old grandmother.
Her leadership style now, she says, revolves around empowering others. She doesn’t stand on ceremony, despite confessing that she’d love to join the privy council, the body of senior MPs appointed to advise the Queen, “so that Tories who’d look down on people like me have to call me the Right Hon. Pregnant mum at 16, no qualifications: I’m the Right Hon and so are all other women in those circumstances, thank you.” Some days after our first conversation, I watch Rayner host a Zoom meeting with care workers, assembled by Unison and the GMB to discuss issues ranging from a shortage of protective masks to pay. When one woman suggests helping care workers progress into higher-paid jobs, Rayner says that this was happening under New Labour: “It breaks my heart that, in the over 10 years I’ve been out of the sector, that has really been decimated by the privatisation and the austerity agenda.” She nods sympathetically as another woman describes her daughter working more than 60 hours a week to make ends meet, while she herself does 70, juggling the children between them. She’s careful to make no promises on pay, although she later tells me that care workers are underpaid and care homes underfunded; Labour is in listening mode for now.
She considered returning to care work during the pandemic but found her skills out of date, so has instead volunteered with the homeless and a telephone befriending service, while fretting that lockdown stops her seeing Ryan (furloughed from his job) and her toddler granddaughter. “I’ve not seen her for months – I just get little video clips,” she sighs. “I want to go to help them and I just can’t.” In spare moments, she’s training Luna as an assistance dog for her son Charlie, who is visually impaired. Many MPs are using lockdown for voluntary work, but something about Rayner’s workload suggests she enjoys being needed. “It’s how I feel good about myself,” she admits. “It’s not like I’m Florence Nightingale: I get something from it.”
In some ways, her childhood has made Rayner resilient. She shrugs off the social media abuse that wears many female politicians down, having learned young to bring down the shutters. “I have a barrier when it comes to being accessible to people, because of what happened with my mother. Some people think that I’m just a really solid person, like ‘You’re well hard.’ But part of that is my old mechanism. I have an inner circle and I don’t go beyond that, and that protects me from people who don’t know me,” she says. But she still feels a burning need to prove herself. For a long time, she felt unlovable. “Being a ginger kid on a council estate – Muriel’s Wedding, that was me,” she says, citing the Australian film about a woman who thinks she’s ugly and worthless. “No boys fancied me or anything – well they did, but they never said it – and I was bullied, so I had to find that inner peace about who I am.” *** Barely a year after getting elected, Rayner was unexpectedly leapfrogged into the shadow cabinet, following an attempted coup against Corbyn and mass frontbench resignations in protest at his handling of the Brexit referendum campaign. Handed the shadow education secretary’s portfolio, she remembers panicking at the thought of meeting university chancellors when she’d never got her GCSEs, and swotting up furiously on policy detail. But she soon realised that people liked her not sounding too formal or overrehearsed. “I’ll talk about the attainment gap, life chances and what that means, and being school-ready – but that’s a lingo term, that’s not what people from my background say. I can put it into that emotional connection.” She first did it to eye-catching effect in what became the standout platform speech of the 2016 Labour party conference, using her own life story to dramatise pledges on childcare and further education. She might not speak with a “plum in her mouth” or have a degree, she told delegates, but “I have a master’s in real life.”
Before long, she was being tipped as a future leader. Yet ultimately it was her friend Rebecca Long-Bailey who was groomed as the preferred successor, while she trod water in the same portfolio for four years. Excruciatingly for both women, someone leaked the contents of a Labour-commissioned focus group comparing them, in which Rayner was described as “charity shop-looking” and her friend “very smart”. Within Corbynite circles, Long-Bailey was seen as the more serious policymaker, Rayner as more unpredictable. Yet when she ran for deputy and Long-Bailey for leader, many MPs thought that the wrong way round. Didn’t she want the top job? “No, because I don’t like being the main dish,” she says. “Helping the leader achieve and helping our party achieve are things that make me mentally well.” Besides, she says, the tabloids would have had a field day: “I was clubbing instead of going to school! Even Jeremy had an allotment, for God’s sake. He could cook. I get takeaways for my kids three times a week!” She cackles: “They want working class, but they can’t handle working class.” It’s a joke, but a bittersweet one. When I ask if it’s true that the two women’s version of the Granita pact – Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s infamous 1994 summit over who should run for Labour leader – was a chat on a camping trip to the Lake District last summer, she hoots “No!” But there were clearly conversations about their futures. She and Long-Bailey barely knew each other before the 2015 election, but agreed to flatshare in London as new northern MPs, both with young children. It was the political storms weathered in the Corbyn years that really brought them together: “Within months this coup had happened, then we ended up in the shadow cabinet, doing all this mad crazy stuff we never thought we were going to do. ” “There were conversations, joking, about what happens if we both end up the last people standing, like Designated Survivor.” (In the US TV drama, a politician played by Kiefer Sutherland is catapulted to power after a terrorist attack wipes out most of the government.) She even remembers a “daft” conversation about who would play them in a film: “I said the ginger one off Ab Fab.”
Still, it must have been awkward when she notched up a comfortable victory over MP and hospital doctor Rosena Allin-Khan in the deputy leadership contest, while Long-Bailey lost to Starmer? For once I sense Rayner choosing her words carefully, perhaps wary of how they might be interpreted. “We’ve been in lockdown so that’s a bit weird, to be honest. Nobody’s really seen anyone. So it’s a bit hard to say.” Her focus now is on turning the body blow of December’s general election defeat into a catalyst for renewal. “It was more than just a defeat, it went to the core,” she says of the night Boris Johnson won an 80-seat majority. “We felt we’d disconnected from the people we were there to represent, and it was a real kick in the teeth.” The Tories made gains even in her own relatively safe seat of Ashton-under-Lyne, a former mill town on the edge of Manchester. As part of a Corbyn shadow cabinet, she went “over and over” what they could have done differently. We’re speaking ahead of the publication of the Labour Together report on what went wrong at the election, which identified Jeremy Corbyn’s unpopularity, tensions over Brexit and a “toxic” culture of infighting in the party as key drivers, but it seems she has reached similar conclusions. She insists Corbyn wasn’t the only problem but surely he was one of them? “He was one of the issues that people would raise… But I think there were some real faultlines, especially around Brexit which was a really divisive one,” says Rayner, who backed remain but whose constituency voted 61% to leave. “We had a number of catastrophic issues that were coming together all at once. Our voters had been pretty despondent and angry with us for some time.” The leader may have “antagonised” some voters in Labour’s former heartlands, but many had felt Labour was losing touch with them for a long time before, she says: “If people see it as, ‘Oh well, Jeremy’s gone, great, now we’re all right, then that’s a wrong conclusion to make. There’s a lot that we have to do as a party to regain that trust.” Labour’s internal divisions were, she says “catastrophic for us”, as they meant voters saw the party as focused on each other, not the country. But she thinks defeat has changed the mood: “It did give us that jolt, regardless of what your view is as to why we were in that situation - people suddenly realised how significant it was. We don’t have a right to exist,” she adds. “My job as part of the leadership of the Labour party now is to show that we are not bickering. When Keir speaks, he speaks for me and him, and when I speak, I speak for him and myself.” Some fear Labour betraying its young, diverse, big city supporters to win back mainly white, working-class, leave-supporting towns, but Rayner insists it can embrace both. “I grew up on an estate which was predominantly white working-class at the time. I know the vast majority of people who I grew up with, the vast majority of my constituents and people in this country would be absolutely appalled at the idea that they had to choose between standing up for everyone’s rights and standing up against racism,” she says. “This idea that, in order to be working class, you have to somehow pander to the rhetoric on immigration, I find it quite ignorant and offensive.” *** We speak again in June, following an emotional weekend of Black Lives Matter protests across Britain sparked by the death in US police custody of George Floyd. Rayner is clear that “people shouldn’t rip down statues and take criminal actions” in protest. But she thinks Johnson only inflamed tensions by failing either to condemn President Trump’s response to the Floyd case, or to meet protesters’ deep-rooted fear and anger with detailed proposals for tackling discrimination in Britain. “I think the prime minister and some of his cabinet have misjudged that mood. I do accept and sympathise that people think violent protest is not the way, and that people are worried about social distancing. But that’s got to be put in the context of racism kills, racism is a virus in our community as well.”
What action should they have taken? “Dust down David Lammy’s report that he did four years ago – the solutions are there,” she cries, citing a review of discrimination in the criminal justice system that David Cameron commissioned from her frontbench colleague. “People don’t want to be out on our streets, protesting and pulling down statues – they want you to do something about it.” The new Labour regime has, she says, tried to be a constructive opponent but can only go so far: Johnson “needs to get up off his backside and lead on this”. Before the protests erupted, Rayner had introduced unconscious bias training throughout the Labour party and recruited the BAME MPs Marsha de Cordova and Tulip Siddiq as advisers on inclusion and party development. She treads a fine line, too, on antisemitism within the party, with insisting that Corbyn “did want to deal with this” while backing her new boss’s promise to do whatever is necessary to root it out. Despite swerving every chance so far to elect one, she thinks the Labour party is capable of choosing a female leader. “Keir Starmer can’t change his gender, but what he wants to do is deliver a party that delivers the next female leader – whether that’s me, whether that’s somebody else.” So it could still be her? “I think never say never on anything. I’m really happy being the deputy leader – I stood because that’s where I think my skill set is.” Some leaders might find such ambition threatening, I say. “Keir’s not like that!” she protests. “Since I’ve been deputy leader, Keir’s treated me with the utmost respect.” That means, she explains, being treated as any man would be in her position: “a person with intelligence, with a remit to do stuff.’” On paper, the two politicians are chalk and cheese – the self-proclaimed “gobby northern lass”, and the more formal London lawyer – yet each reaches parts that the other can’t. Behind closed doors, Starmer is, she says, “very professional. But he’s actually a really kind-hearted, lovely family man who cares deeply about people. You get this real sense of wanting to do right and do good. You can work with that, even if you don’t agree with the decision that somebody makes.” Asked about speculation that Labour’s new general secretary, David Evans, who served under Blair, represents a shift to the right she says firmly: “What he is a flick to is winning. That’s the thing Keir wants: he wants to win.” Does she have any Tory friends? “Me and Nicholas Soames get on all right,” she says of the former Tory MP, whose grandfather Winston Churchill was MP for nearby Oldham. But she has little time for the current regime. When it emerged that the Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings had breached lockdown to seek childcare, Rayner tweeted that both her younger boys have respiratory problems; she’d been petrified of giving them Covid-19 when she was ill, yet stayed at home. “The whole way in which Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings got into No 10 was on the basis of ‘They’re in touch with ordinary people.’ They’re letting people down massively. As someone who is from a working-class background in the north, I get that feeling of alienation.”
If Johnson now fails to deliver his promised Brexit deal by December, she fears a backlash against the whole political process. “If they’re not able to deliver, I just think they’re going to leave my constituents feeling ever more disillusioned with politicians,” she says. “They made it sound like the only reason you’re not getting Brexit is that these bureaucrats don’t want you to have it, and that was wrong.” She worries, too, about a Covid recession damaging communities like hers, calling for a “resilient recovery, not just going back to how we make the quickest buck”. She wishes ministers would make Open University courses free for the furloughed – “give people hope and opportunity” – and end rough sleeping for good. “It’s about the political will to do something about it, instead of looking at cost.” When she talks like this, it’s easy to see how Rayner prospered under Corbyn. But it’s her ability to bridge Labour’s winning past, present and still uncertain future that will serve her now. Rooted in the party’s working-class history but with a 2020 take on identity politics, she is as comfortable defending trans rights as reminiscing about colliery clubs and factory works outings; traditional values, as John Prescott might say, in a modern setting. “People understand that life isn’t going to be as it was,” she says, of post-pandemic politics. “But we have a choice: to change it for the better based on our British values of looking after each other, or go back to consumerism and this neoliberal capitalist, ‘I’m doing all right, I can’t see the damage that’s being done so it doesn’t matter’ attitude.” When we turn off our Zoom cameras, the last thing I see is her waving madly with both hands, giving it everything she’s got. • This article was amended on 29 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to Rosena Allin-Khan MP as a “former doctor”. In fact she continues to work some hospital shifts."
2020-06-20T07:00:41Z,politics,Politics,Britain beyond lockdown: could the country be healthier?,"In a near-deserted plaza near Birmingham’s Bull Ring shopping centre, local artist Diane Wiltshire considers the imminent return of traffic and pollution after lockdown with a feeling close to dread. Wiltshire suffers chemical sensitivity – severe intolerance to pollutants, which give her breathing problems, affect her eyesight and disrupt her digestion. Doctors and immunologists are divided about the causes of her condition, but that makes little difference to the trauma felt by the 42-year-old as the old economy starts to rev up again. “There is no way I want to go back to what was normal before,” she says. “I was very ill, but the lockdown has given me a break. I want those health improvements to stay.” Wiltshire’s hypersensitivity is extreme, but it highlights the challenge facing the country as it emerges from an acute illness, Covid-19, that can kill in weeks, to return to a chronic illness, pollution, that erodes our health over years but on a far more destructive scale.
Amid the misery of the UK having the worst death toll from the coronavirus in Europe and growing fears about the economic impacts of the lockdown, people have also felt positive changes. In a nationwide YouGov-Cambridge Centre survey exclusively commissioned by the Guardian at the peak of the lockdown, 66% of respondents said air quality had improved, while 20% said there was no difference, and only 3% believed pollution had grown worse. In the Midlands - where local NHS trusts have recorded some of the worst Covid-19 death tolls - there is both relief that the crisis may be easing but also nostalgia for the calm that some people got to experience by living and working at home, while the stress of capitalism was muted and there was a greater focus on collective wellbeing and community. As elsewhere across the country, this has revitalised debate on whether to continue the trade-off between health and wealth, or whether to push for a green recovery that addresses both problems at the same time along with tackling the climate crisis. Pollution hotspot
In this region, more than anywhere else in the UK, that means rethinking the road and air traffic industries that have long been a mainstay of the economy but are also a rising source of health concerns. Until the lockdown, this West Midlands region registered several of the UK’s worst hotspots for pollution, most of which came from the exhaust pipes of the lorries and cars that zip by along the M5, M6 and M42 or crawl through the streets of Wolverhampton, Coventry and Birmingham. The street outside the Birmingham children’s hospital is among 10 areas in the city with levels of nitrogen dioxide that have risen above health guidelines in the past five years. These fumes - along with the small particles from diesel engines - worsen asthma and other respiratory diseases, particularly in children, the elderly and among BAME and low-income communities who often live in more densely populated urban areas. They are also a contributory factor in heart disease and cancer. Some studies suggest polluted air reduces the lifespans of children born in Birmingham by up to seven months and may be a factor in the West Midland’s unwanted record as the worst place in the UK for infant mortality. Researchers are now examining whether poor air quality might also increase vulnerability to coronavirus.
Drive along those motorways and through city underpasses today and it is clear traffic is creeping back. At the height of the lockdown in March, the number of cars on the roads dropped to 1950s levels. Now it is probably closer to the 1990s and rushing forward. People have more reason to travel. The talk of Birmingham this week was the reopening of Primark. Wiltshire has experienced a partial relapse but Birmingham, she says, could change for the better without cars. “You don’t need them here. This is the best city to cycle in. We have more trees than Paris and more miles of canals than Venice. If you cycle alongside, you feel safe, the air is cleaner and you might even see a kingfisher.” As in many cities around the world, councils are creating more cycle paths and pedestrian areas, but these are often temporary and not everyone is mobile enough to use them. The best short-term hope for sustained air-quality improvements would be for as many people as possible to continue to work from home. William Bloss, a professor of atmospheric science at Birmingham University, said the public had been given a demonstration that local-level action could make a big difference. “I think it has increased our appetite for change and society’s willingness to do things differently,” he said. Birmingham was already planning to introduce a clean air zone in January. The West Midlands is also pioneering a project to install 5G air quality and traffic sensors on 1,000 road junctions. The city’s cultural hub, Birmingham Open Media, wants to use this data with an augmented reality phone app, #SelfAir, so that young people can visualise concentrations of particulate matter around them in fun, creative ways. The director, Karen Newman, aims to team up with schools across the region in a citizen science project that would allow children to monitor their neighbourhood’s pollution levels. “We want them to collectively pitch back to authorities what they want them to do,” she said. Academics and campaigners say ambitious, urgent action is needed at a city and national level or traffic could return to higher levels than before. The half empty buses driving around Birmingham’s Chinatown highlight how public transport use has been subdued by physical-distancing rules and contagion concerns. This is pushing people back into cars, which suddenly seem like sanctuaries. The YouGov survey showed 28% of people planned to drive more than before lockdown, 16% less, while 52% expected no change. There is also anecdotal evidence in the city that people who did not previously have a car are now buying cheap second-hand bangers to commute to work. Meanwhile, big local employers Jaguar and Range Rover have seen such a fall in sales that they are struggling to survive, rather than rushing to invest in a low-carbon future.
But Bloss said the opposite was needed. “Encouraging a change in our vehicle fleets towards cleaner and electric vehicles could align with clean growth, air quality and public health, and reduced carbon emissions. It could also help levelling up efforts,” he said. ‘We know we’re going to be inundated’ The desperate need for an economic stimulus was evident in Bushbury, a former car manufacturing town in the Black Country. Even before the pandemic, this community, which has a high level of ethnic diversity, had some of the lowest income and highest debt levels in the UK. Now it is also one of the worst-affected areas for Covid-19 deaths in the country and is bracing for the financial impact on family budgets. Many people here were on zero-hours contracts in the care, security and retail sectors, which meant they were the first to be laid off. At the community centre, charity worker Kim Payne works with volunteers to prepare more than 100 food parcels that are now distributed weekly to residents.
Over the past three months, the number of people seeking help at the community drop-in centre has tripled. This cosy hall, with its cafe and garden, was previously used for mental health counselling for teenagers and “feed your family on a fiver” cooking classes, but it has had to move activities online and start providing 300 food parcels a week plus 60 cooked meals for the elderly. Last week, for the first time, it launched an appeal for sanitary products after some local women said they could no longer afford period protection. “We know we’re going to be inundated,” Payne said. “All those extra people who have got in touch online over the past few months will continue to need support for months.” Clean air is little consolation for people here who have a week-to-week struggle to make ends meet. What is needed is employment and social security. Green growth could help. The Local Government Association estimates 194,000 new clean jobs will be created in the Midlands - mostly in low-emission vehicle manufacturing - as the UK moves towards its goal of being carbon neutral by 2050.
Leadership at a national level will be essential. Much is likely to depend on the economic recovery plan that Boris Johnson is expected to announce next month. The prime minister has indicated that green transport technology will be a key element. “The West Midlands was the home of the original automotive revolution, that’s where it all began, the internal combustion engine, and already in the West Midlands you’re seeing an incredible profusion of low carbon technology, low carbon vehicles,” he said earlier this month. The government has already put £108m into the the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre which is due to open in Coventry later this year but such sums are trifling compared to the mega investments that Chinese and US firms have poured into battery “gigafactories”. Brexit has not helped. Nor has the UK’s tardy 2040 target date to halt sales of diesel and petrol cars. There is also a lack of strong targets on electric vehicles in the environmental bill that has been held up in parliament as a result of the pandemic. And for those who have tried to imagine an alternative, technological fixes and investments will not work without addressing deeper causes within our political, social and economic systems.
Roy Harrison, an air pollution expert at Birmingham University, said the opportunity could slip away. “If the public saw this as a real option, as a win win for improving the environment and stimulating the economy, we’d be a little healthier and leading the world in the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.” But he was sceptical that the lockdown would provide enough political impetus for action. “I’ve heard it so many times in the past. Once everything turns to normal, they won’t care an iota,” he said."
2020-06-19T17:15:24Z,politics,Politics,Corbyn loyalists dispute findings of Labour election postmortem,"Labour MPs loyal to Jeremy Corbyn have pushed back against a report into the party’s election defeat that blamed poor tactics and internal dysfunction, highlighting instead longer-term trends and the influence of remain-minded voices such as Keir Starmer. However, some of those who lost Labour-held seats in the December disaster said the narrative in the 150-page report – of voters put off by Brexit, Corbyn’s unpopularity and a manifesto seen as unrealistic – chimed with their experiences on the doorstep. The report by the Labour Together group used polling, analysis and interviews with activists to paint a gloomy picture of the party’s prospects, saying it has “a mountain to climb” to return to power. It detailed both barriers Labour faced specifically in 2019, such as Corbyn and Brexit, but also stressed the much longer term fracturing of the party’s political base, particularly in towns in the north of England and the Midlands. Labour Together was set up to unite MPs and activists from different traditions, a number of whom have been given prominent roles in the shadow cabinet of Corbyn’s successor, Starmer. In a jointly written riposte to the report, two of Corbyn’s most loyal allies, ex-party chair Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett, formerly a shadow minister, blamed the erosion of support in such seats on Labour’s decision to promise a second referendum, a policy championed by Starmer, who was the shadow Brexit secretary. “Many felt that powerful sections in our party were not interested in, and indeed scornful of, the views of those communities which we had represented for a century,” they wrote in an article for the left-leaning magazine Tribune. “We argued that those colleagues who used their senior position in the shadow cabinet then to publicly advocate a second referendum with remain as Labour’s favoured option in order to appease their own heavily-remain urban electorates were damaging our national standing.” Richard Burgon, who was shadow justice secretary under Corbyn, said examining party failings was important, “because clearly it was a disastrous election result”. He said: “What I do think is good is that the report doesn’t see 2019 in isolation, but looks at the long-term problems the Labour party has faced. “People will draw what they want from this report, but I think it would be a mistake to draw from it that we should never have a manifesto of what could be characterised as left, socialist, redistributive policies of public ownership. I think that in the era we’re going into, those kinds of policies will be more relevant than ever.” But Gareth Snell, who lost his Stoke-on-Trent Central seat to the Conservatives by 670 votes, said the report’s findings matched a lot of what he experienced in facing disaffected former Labour voters on the campaign trail. “I was getting more or less 50-50 Corbyn and Brexit,” he said. “But I think Corbyn was shorthand for a lot of other things people were unhappy about.” To an extent the long-term decline of Labour support in seats such as his had been masked by the 2017 election, where a Corbyn-led Labour denied Theresa May a majority in parliament, Snell argued. “We were saying, ‘OK, we got the biggest increase in vote share since Attlee, but actually in places like Stoke we’ve still gone back.’ And if you look at the sorts of seats we lost in 2019, the majorities had been getting smaller. There was this idea that everybody was being lifted by the Corbyn tide of 2017, and that simply wasn’t the case.” Another Corbyn-sceptic, Neil Coyle, who remains the MP for Southwark and Old Bermondsey, was notably more blunt, tweeting: “Why Labour lost in 2019 will surprise no one who campaigned and spoke to enough voters: Corbyn’s toxicity at the top. Incompetence running Labour; stupidly backing an early election; and cronies squandering Labour resources also all helped Johnson.” Officials who worked on the Labour campaign said they recognised the report’s description of a party machine riven by factionalism, infighting and a lack of strategy, but said the study offered little in the way of solutions. “When I read the report found it quite triggering, to be honest – it brought a lot of fairly traumatic things back,” one person who worked on the 2019 campaign said. “It’s fair to say that everyone’s particular gripe is in there. It more or less says, ‘Everything was shit.’ But the one thing is doesn’t go into is why. There’s an argument that if you got too deeply into that you could start a new civil war. But it means the report is still only half the answer.”"
2020-06-19T15:33:26Z,politics,Politics,Chaos and a car crash: Tories begin to fear Boris Johnson has lost his vim,"At prime minister’s questions this week, Boris Johnson appeared to be fired up. He scored a point against Keir Starmer, needling the Labour leader about whether he would say schools were safe to return to, and claiming Starmer had been silenced by the teaching unions. Several MPs on his own side remarked how pleased they were to see him back to what Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, of the 1922 executive committee, called “such robust form”. But it was a rare and fleeting victory in a troubled fortnight, marked by U-turns and missteps. And when he met members of the 1922 executive immediately after PMQs, they delivered a stark warning about the risks of walling himself off from the rest of his party. Such are the rising concerns, not only over the chaos of U-turns but also the prime minister’s health, that some senior Tories are going so far as to wonder openly whether Johnson will stay the course until 2024. “There are doubts about Boris’s health, his competence and his judgment,” said one former minister. “He might not be the statesman that some had hoped he could become. Throw Cummings into the mix and you start getting MPs openly talking about the fact that he will have to go before the next general election.” In the nearer term, restive Tory MPs – even those who are normally sympathetic – are warning that their leader could be forced into more embarrassing U-turns in the weeks and months ahead if he fails to listen to his own party. It comes after a chaotic week for Downing Street which included, aptly, a real-life car crash when the PM’s vehicle was shunted outside parliament. On Tuesday, the prime minister abruptly changed his position on free school meals after a high-profile campaign by the footballer Marcus Rashford. Up to 30 Tory MPs had been threatening to vote with Labour on a motion calling for the £15-a-week voucher scheme to be extended over the summer.
Then, on Thursday, Matt Hancock announced he was ditching plans for a standalone NHS track and trace app, instead incorporating the Google-Apple technology other countries had turned to weeks ago, while claiming he had “backed both horses” from the start. And, while MPs welcomed Friday’s announcement of £1bn to help schoolchildren catch up with lost lessons, it came against the backdrop of mounting frustration that education had not been a higher priority throughout the crisis. Robert Halfon, the Harlow MP who chairs the education select committee, has been lobbying the government relentlessly about the issue for weeks, including challenging Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, in parliament. He is one of a number of former ministers, including Jeremy Hunt and Greg Clark, who are using their chairmanships of select committees as a platform to press Johnson and his team publicly about their handling of the crisis. Clark hauled the health minister Edward Argar to the Commons on Monday to ask why the government had not yet published the findings of an investigation into the 2 metre distancing review Johnson had promised him three weeks earlier, instead setting up a new review in No 10. Hunt, who was beaten to the Tory leadership by Johnson, has pressed Hancock, the health secretary, politely but relentlessly on multiple issues, in particular the testing, tracing and isolation of Covid-19 sufferers. There have been worries, too, about whether Johnson has recovered his “vim” after being admitted to intensive care with Covid-19. “I definitely think Boris’s absence set things back: it was different before he fell ill,” said one concerned MP.
Many of these critics feel their voices are barely heard, let alone heeded, inside Downing Street. Johnson’s No 10 team of staunch loyalists, many veterans of the Vote Leave campaign, pay scrupulous attention to focus groups and opinion polls, but MPs say they are rarely consulted, and in many cases, neither are ministers. Hancock conceded this week, for example, that the decision to roll the Department for International Development (DfID) back into the Foreign Office after two decades, portending a major shake-up of foreign policy priorities, had not been discussed by cabinet. That decision brought down the wrath of three former prime ministers, but was also greeted with dismay by some of Johnson’s supporters. Andrew Mitchell, the former development secretary who had backed Johnson for the leadership, said the prime minister had “sat in my office and looked me in the eye and told me DfID would be safe”. Critics say sceptical voices rarely make their way to the ear of Johnson, who prefers not to hear from what he calls “the doomsters, the gloomsters”.
Meanwhile, cabinet critics have been relegated to the backbenches, and unsympathetic special advisers edged out by Dominic Cummings, chief adviser, and Johnson’s director of communications, Lee Cain, who has the final say on new advisers’ appointments. One veteran former cabinet minister commented: “The last time No 10 was this centralised was under Tony Blair: Cummings has massively centralised everything.” He added that the single-mindedness that helped win the Brexit referendum and then power Johnson to his 80-strong majority might not be the right skillset for shuffling the scores of complex and shifting issues inside No 10. “What is the characteristic of a campaign team? It is that it focuses on one thing at a time,” he said. Cummings also takes a notoriously scathing view of MPs. In a blogpost last year, he addressed what he called “the narcissist-delusional subset” of the Brexit-backing European Research Group, telling them they should be “treated like a metastasising tumour and excised from the UK body politic”. Johnson’s parliamentary private secretaries, Trudy Harrison and Alex Burghart, whose job it is to liaise with MPs, are well-liked by colleagues, but many feel it is Cummings’ judgment that prevails. Johnson’s parliamentary party has a very different makeup to the one he inherited from Theresa May. The Europhile liberals who left or were expelled during the Brexit crisis – David Gauke, Rory Stewart, Philip Hammond – are no longer in Westminster, while the party has been refreshed by an influx of new “blue wall” Conservatives, with different seats. “These MPs have very, very different views about things like free school meals – they’re not these free-market libertarians,” said one Conservative MP who has watched his party evolve around him in the past 12 months. He highlighted other issues, including nurses’ pay, and the continuation of free school meals vouchers over the Christmas holidays, where the new MPs were likely to try to make their constituents’ voices heard. Summing up the view of several MPs, he said: “The government need to get on the front foot.”"
2020-06-19T13:43:19Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson repaint may ruin plane for military use, says ex-pilot","Boris Johnson’s plan to repaint the prime minister’s VIP RAF plane red, white and blue risks turning the aircraft into a “brightly coloured lollipop” when it is used for the military purposes for which it was originally made, a former pilot has warned. Ordered because the prime minister believes the Voyager’s camouflage grey colour is boring, the £900,000 makeover is expected to transform the outside of the aircraft, which is also used for mid-air refuelling. Defence sources say it will have a white body with a blue stripe and a union jack-inspired design on the tail fin. Some designs circulating suggest it will have “United Kingdom” written in large gold letters along the side. Andy Netherwood, a former military transport pilot and defence analyst, said that a “shiny red, white and blue livery means the RAF will be reluctant to use it outside the most benign airspace”, adding: “No one wants to go to war in a jet painted like a brightly coloured lollipop.” In its military incarnation, the most likely foes the plane will encounter are Russian jets flying near UK airspace; insiders say the aircraft is used to refuel RAF Typhoons tracking planes ordered by Moscow to test Britain’s air defences. In an emergency, the Voyager would be required to transport troops to war and provide support to combat operations in the Middle East or elsewhere. When he was foreign secretary, Johnson said it was almost impossible to book the Voyager for ministerial use and complained: “Why does it have to be grey?” Pilots say the colour makes the plane hard to spot, and white planes are clearly visible because they reflect sunlight. The RAF Voyager was commissioned as a military air transport and refuelling plane when it was acquired as part of a £10.5bn, 27-year Air Tanker private finance initiative (PFI) contract in 2008 – and was not intended for VIP use.
Experts argue that by gradually repurposing the jet as a British flagship, Johnson and the prime ministers immediately before him are in effect gaining control of what is a $240m modified Airbus A330M on the cheap, with the true costs paid by the Ministry of Defence via the PFI deal. “No 10 should make that argument and be upfront about the cost. Instead this looks like they’re trying to get it through the back door with a dubious claim that this aircraft is still primarily a tanker,” Netherwood said. Five years ago, UK prime ministers did not have their own version of the US president’s Air Force One for long-haul trips. They had to make do with chartering aircraft after Gordon Brown ditched Tony’s Blair’s plan to obtain one. But David Cameron was eager to boost his position on the world stage, a decision confirmed in the 2015 defence review, and civil servants found a way to obtain a VIP plane without significant upfront costs. They found that one of the RAF Voyagers could be refitted with a first-class suite – known as cabin A – and business-class seats at a cost of £10m. The plane would still be shared with the military, so as a compromise the grey colour remained. A baby-changing table was put in first class to be used by the growing family of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, as the aircraft was also available for the royal family, plus senior ministers, predominantly for travelling outside Europe. There are a handful of seats in cabin A but apart from a table near the prime minister’s seat for meetings, there are few other luxuries, and no wifi or TV screens for inflight entertainment. “I gather it was going to cost £2m more and we couldn’t be bothered,” one former Downing Street staffer said. So interested was Cameron in the project that those involved had to report progress directly to No 10, but by the time it was ready for its maiden VIP flight to Warsaw in July 2016, the then prime minister had quit following the Brexit referendum. On official trips, the business-class section is filled with a commercial delegation plus the small number of media prepared to pay extra, typically the commercial broadcasters ITV and Sky, and the Daily Mail. The rest of the media sit in a half-full standard-class cabin shared with military police. Prime ministers are expected to hold at least one informal press conference with the reporters. Theresa May, Cameron’s successor, was not keen on flying and usually chose to get her interrogation over with shortly after take-off. May’s most memorable foreign trip was her first to visit Donald Trump in the White House. When asked during the flight what she might have in common with the brash president, she suggested that “sometimes opposites attract”. When he became prime minister in 2019, Johnson struck a less formal tone. On his first trip to a G7 summit in Biarritz, France the leader visited the back of the Voyager to take selfies with the crew and talk to reporters while they were having lunch. “You could tell things were going to be different with him in charge, when he gave Robert Peston this manly two-arm grab while they enthusiastically greeted each other,” said one reporter on the flight."
2020-06-19T13:22:26Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's education catch-up plans do not reflect reality,"Boris Johnson promised a “massive catch-up operation” to help children in England make up for their lost time in the classroom since March, and little over a week later we have it: £1bn, all to be spent in nine months starting from September. Most of the planning appears to have been led by No 10, with Department for Education officials virtually zooming back and forth with dismayed faces after having their input appraised in unflattering terms. But the end result is a headline-grabbing figure, a promise that schools will be given latitude over how they use the money – and a dawning scepticism that the government’s plans may be more ambitious than the reality.
Of the £1bn, only £650m will go directly to state secondary and primary schools, which amounts to about £90 per pupil. The remaining £350m will be used to subsidise individual and small group tuition through an as yet non-existent national tutoring programme (NTP). Those funds will subsidise 75% of the cost of tuition from an approved roster of external providers, with schools having to meet the remaining 25% from their portion of the £650m. Assuming the tuition works out at about £50 an hour – a figure stated by the Education Endowment Foundation, which will help administer the NTP – and that is used in full, then £467m of the £1bn, or nearly half, will be spent on private tuition. Private tuition is also subject to VAT, which shrinks the amount available, although it would of course go back to the Treasury. Most private tuition in the UK is provided by for-profit companies. Charities also work with disadvantaged pupils, but they tend to rely on unpaid volunteers. One headteacher was quick to praise the additional funding, saying that schools sorely needed it. He was, however, also quick to question how the tuition funding would work and where all the extra tutors would come from.
Another head wondered aloud how much time he would need to spend vetting external tutors and “coaches”, supervising their work, persuading parents that their children should miss football or music clubs to come in after school or at weekends, and coordinating with teachers over exactly what catching up was needed for each individual pupil. His conclusion was that he would rather use the funding for his own catch-up plans, but the DfE’s guidance states: “Whilst headteachers will decide how the money is spent, the government expects this to be spent on small group tuition for whoever needs it.”
Even if the tuition is only for the most disadvantaged pupils, there are about 1 million receiving free school meals, and providing all of them with an hour or two a week would require the recruitment of an army of external tutors. To put that in perspective, one of the largest national firms to offer one-to-one tuition reaches only 40,000 children a year. Johnson’s plan also requires schools to spend the catch-up funds only on children from reception to year 11, from age five to 16. It excludes pupils in years 12 and 13, which seems particularly unfair given the latter will have only seven months in school until they finish their A-level or BTec courses. A child in year 1 has 12 years left in the school system, yet they will be eligible. Another school leader said that while she welcomed the funding, she worried that a government that has scrapped its promised “world-beating” contact-tracing app may also prove unable to deliver an effective national tutoring programme for 1 million children by September."
2020-06-19T10:23:14Z,politics,Politics,"Labour: dysfunctional 'toxic culture' led to defeat, major report finds","Labour has a “mountain to climb” if it is to get back into power, according to a major review of the 2019 general election defeat, which paints a picture of dysfunctionality, toxicity and drift inside the party’s election-fighting machine. Negative perceptions of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, doubts about the manifesto and the party’s ambivalent Brexit stance reinforced each other in a “snowballing” effect to deliver December’s catastrophic result, the 150-page report by the party group Labour Together argues. However, it was also the product of two decades of demographic and political change that hit the party’s traditional base, and could endanger more Labour seats in 2024. “Labour’s electoral coalition had been fracturing for a long time and was broken in 2019. We were rejected by many of the communities we were founded to represent,” says the report, seen by the Guardian. “We lost all types of voters everywhere compared with 2017, except in London.” Using interviews with senior party figures, as well as previously unpublished polling and new analysis, the report identifies significant shortcomings in the election campaign, which followed 18 months of debilitating parliamentary wrangles over Brexit. Key findings include: • Labour “went into the 2019 election without a clear strategy of which voters we needed to persuade or how”, and failed to settle on a coherent message with the power of 2017’s “For the many, not the few”. • “It was unclear who was in charge” of the election campaign, and relationships were soured by years of infighting which had created a “toxic culture” and “significant strategic and operational dysfunction”. • Labour was outgunned by the Tories in the digital war, with messages poorly coordinated and most of them failing to reach beyond the party’s base. • Helped by their clear “Get Brexit done” message, the Conservatives succeeded in turning out 2 million previous non-voters, accounting for two thirds of the increase in their vote share. • Labour’s seat targeting was “unrealistic” and “not evidence-based”, and many candidates felt they did not receive enough support from the national party. Labour Together was set up to unite MPs and activists from different traditions, a number of whom – including the former leader Ed Miliband, Steve Reed, Lisa Nandy and Jim McMahon – have been given prominent roles in the shadow cabinet of Corbyn’s successor, Keir Starmer.
The 2019 Election Review was prepared by a 15-strong panel of commissioners, including Miliband, the Manchester Central MP, Lucy Powell, James Meadway, who advised the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, and the Birmingham Ladywood MP, Shabana Mahmood. They find that Corbyn’s leadership was a “significant factor” in the 2019 result. His public approval ratings collapsed at around the time a group of Labour MPs including Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna left to found the Independent Group, citing antisemitism within Labour and its Brexit policy. The report says: “‘Stop Jeremy Corbyn’ was a major driver of the Conservatives’ success across all their key groups including previous non-voters, and among all the swing voters Labour lost to the Tories.” Had Corbyn been as popular in December as he was two years earlier, Labour’s vote share could have been 6 percentage points higher, the analysis finds. When it came to Labour’s radical manifesto, launched at an upbeat rally in Birmingham, the analysis found that individual policies were popular, but doubts about the leadership stoked a perception that the package as a whole was not deliverable. A Datapraxis analysis of YouGov data found that “many came to the conclusion that the manifesto as a whole was unrealistic, risky and unlikely to be delivered. This undermined the positive response to individual policies, making them seem less credible.” It shows that 2017’s better-than-expected performance masked the fact that Labour’s vote share had continued to decline in a string of heartland seats – many of which the party went on to lose to the Conservatives two years later. And it points out that another 58 seats could be lost, with a further swing of 6% to Boris Johnson’s party. “Despite now representing fewer constituencies than at any time since 1935, Labour cannot afford to be complacent about the seats it currently holds,” the report says. In order to win the 124 additional seats it needs to form a majority government in 2024, Labour would have to increase the number of MPs it has by 60% - something it has not done since 1945. And if Labour fails to “reverse its fortunes in Scotland in a significant way” it will have to win a swath of English seats, right up to Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg’s in North East Somerset, to secure a majority. Starmer, who became Labour leader in April, has so far announced few new policies, instead focusing on strongly criticising aspects of the government’s coronavirus pandemic response. The forward-looking section of the Labour Together review is based partly on a “coalition-building” workshop, bringing together “urban remainers” from London and Manchester, and leavers from towns in Lancashire and Yorkshire. Carried out by the consultancy firm Britain Thinks, the exercise identified common ground, including a “strong and unifying desire for economic transformation of their lives”. “This was particularly notable in relation to issues which affect their personal security and lives; issues ranging from social housing and rent controls, to decent pay and living standards, as well as significant investment in their local infrastructure and amenities, like high streets, town centres and decent employers,” the report says. It recommends that Labour focus on trying to build a coalition around the idea of transformational economic change rooted in voters’ own lives and problems, and combine this with rebuilding “trust and credibility” in the party. “We believe there is a way ahead for Labour to win the next election, but the road is hard and the journey will not be easy,” it concludes. Starmer and Labour’s new general secretary, David Evans, are expected to pay close attention to the report. Allies of Corbyn insist Brexit – not his leadership – was the overriding factor behind the election result, and lay some of the blame at Starmer’s door for pushing the party towards a pro-referendum position. They are irked that the report’s authors did not interview several key figures, including party directors Karie Murphy and Seumas Milne, the former general secretary Jenny Formby, and Corbyn himself. Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery, the two most outspoken proponents of Brexit in Corbyn’s deeply divided top team, said: “Let’s be clear, people lost trust in Labour after failing to deliver change after 13 years in government. This was brought to a head when the party ignored the democratic vote for Brexit; it was the excuse that allowed loyal Labour voters to finally break with a party they felt had been ignoring them for far too long. “Time and time again we warned the shadow cabinet that yielding to the pressures for the party to become more pro-remain and supportive of a second referendum would inflict damage on Labour’s election chances.” A Labour spokesperson said: “We thank everyone who contributed to this independent report. Its attempt to understand the challenges and opportunities facing the Labour party is welcome and we will read it carefully. By harnessing our collective skills and energy we will build a party and a movement that wins again.” • This article was amended on 9 July 2020. Based on the Labour Together report, an earlier version said that no party has ever increased the number of MPs it has by 60% to form a majority Government, but in fact this has been achieved at a number of elections, including in 1945."
2020-06-19T09:25:21Z,politics,Politics,Catch-up funding for English schools 'won't start until September',"An extra £650m funding to help pupils catch up on teaching missed during the coronavirus lockdown will only start to be distributed to schools in September, the education minister Nick Gibb has said. The funding is part of a £1bn “massive catch-up operation” for schools due to be announced by the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, later on Friday. Of the £1bn, £350m will subsidise a nationwide tutoring programme to help pupils most at need. Gibb, the minister for school standards, said on Friday the £650m could be used at the discretion of headteachers with advice from the Department for Education and the Education Endowment Foundation. He said the funding would start to be paid in the academic year starting in September, meaning schools will in the meantime have to use their own resources to provide catch-up classes over the summer holidays.
Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Gibb said: “Schools will know it’s coming and they will be able to budget on that basis if they want to do things before September. But the money will start being distributed to schools, we’ll have more to say about that shortly, from the next academic year, September.” The funding announcement follows criticism that Boris Johnson’s government has failed to reopen schools quickly enough to avoid damaging the education of hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged pupils. Pressed on why the government could not follow the lead of Northern Ireland and guarantee that schools in England would reopen fully in September with 1-metre physical distancing, Gibb said: “Our clear intention is that we’ll come back in September [and] of course we’re always led by the advice of scientists, Sage [the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] advice.” He added: “We have over a million children now in our school system; we’re doing so in a phased, careful approach because the safety of the teachers and pupils lies at the heart of all our decision-making.” The health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the daily Downing Street briefing on Thursday there would not be a return to full-time education in England until the virus was “under control”. There was disappointment for the early years sector after the government initially announced it would benefit from the £650m pot, as well as colleges. Following a clarification late on Thursday night that the money was going to state primary and secondary schools only, the Early Years Alliance said it “beggars belief” that the sector had been excluded.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Gibb said early years was “absolutely key” and that the government was working with experts on how best to support the under-fives and those aged 16 to 18 and “we’ll have more to say on that soon”. Gibb confirmed that just under half of the 230,000 laptops promised to vulnerable pupils had been delivered to local authorities – a figure disclosed earlier this week – but insisted the programme had been delivered on time. He added: “This is a fast-moving, very challenging set of circumstances that the government is facing – all governments around the world are facing. But we are delivering, we are doing the things that we need to do. “Obviously there are some things we can always do better but this is a government that’s working tirelessly to make sure that children’s education, while we’re during this crisis, continues as best we can.”"
2020-06-18T19:57:07Z,politics,Politics,Key points from review of 2019 Labour election defeat,"A much-anticipated review of Labour’s 2019 election defeat, by a group of MPs, union leaders, officials and activists called Labour Together, has produced a 154-page report of findings and recommendations. These are the main points. 1. The defeat was huge – and winning again is a vast challenge It was, the authors concluded, “a terrible defeat for Labour”, one which “poses profound questions about the future prospects of our party”. As well as losing 59 seats, the second-highest loss by any opposition for a century, the report notes that the party shed votes in every part of the country, with the most significant swings being in north-east England, the West Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside and the east Midlands.
To be the biggest party in the Commons at the next election, due in 2024, Labour would need to make 82 net gains from the Conservatives, with a national swing of 7.9% – almost as much as the 8.8% seen in the 1997 landslide for Tony Blair.
2. The result came from long-term issues, masked by 2017’s result The authors point to a long-term decline in voter loyalty to Labour, connected to weaker community links, such as through trade unions. It says Labour’s vote share declined between 2001 and 2010, then recovered slightly in 2015 and significantly in 2017 – but the fundamental issues remained. The 2017 result in particular, where Jeremy Corbyn defied expectations by denying Theresa May a majority, “contributed to a failure to reflect honestly on the reasons for the increase, or analyse the continuing underlying weaknesses in Labour’s voter coalition”.
In fact, the report says, 2017 heralded much of the heartland vote collapse seen two years later. It cites analysis showing that in 18 English and Welsh seats lost for the first time in the post-war period in 2019, the Conservatives had increased their vote share by an average of 14% in 2017. Some seats such as Bolsover, Sedgefield and Walsall North had seen a cumulative swing from Labour to the Conservatives of more than 25 percentage points since 2005. 3. Jeremy Corbyn was deeply unpopular The report is unflinching in its analysis of how the leader’s appeal to voters plummeted between 2017 and 2019. Had his popularity stayed at its peak level, it says, Labour’s vote share in 2019 would have been 6 percentage points higher. By September 2019, it finds, 67% of voters disliked Corbyn, most strongly, and only 12% liked him. It links this to issues including Corbyn’s handling of complaints of antisemitism in the party, Labour’s Brexit position, and a perception of disunity due to events such as the defection of MPs to the short-lived Independent Group.
The report says research suggests an “intense” dislike of Corbyn was a key factor among voters who switched from Labour to the Tories; they raised issues such as antisemitism, perceived support for terrorism, and unaffordable policies. The views of one 52-year-old woman who voted Labour in 2017 are summarised in the report as: “Frightened at the possibility of a Marxist government. Disgusted at Corbyn being a terrorist sympathiser. Most disturbed about plan to nationalise BT as I fear it would allow a Labour government to spy on internet users.” 4. A confused Brexit policy In a poll of Labour members carried out for the report, 57% named the Brexit policy of promising a second referendum on any departure deal as the single most unpopular and challenging idea to sell to voters, citing views such as “dithering”, “dire”, and “reflecting division”. This, the report finds, repelled both leave and remain voters. Of those who voted Labour in 2017, the party lost 1.9 million remain voters and 1.8 million leave voters in 2019. Given the generally pro-remain views of Labour voters, this represented a much higher proportion of leavers.
For many of those who changed their choice between 2017 and 2019, voting for another party in the European elections in May provided “a conveyor belt” away from Labour, the authors say. Even those who stayed with Labour seemed to do so despite the party’s Brexit policy rather than because of it, with majorities of remain and leave backers saying they preferred to either stop Brexit entirely, or “get Brexit done”, respectively. 5. A manifesto seen as unrealistic The report finds a paradox: individually, most of Labour’s policies were popular, but as a package they were seen as unrealistic, with voters not trusting the party to deliver them. In open-ended questions, Labour’s policies were cited as a positive reason to vote for the party, with policies like free broadband attracting majority support. But, the authors say: “The resistance came mostly as people evaluated the overall package of proposals.” Some cited affordability as a worry; others expressed scepticism about whether the manifesto could be delivered. The worries were shared within Labour, the report found, with some activists saying the seemingly endless flow of new policies had “an advent calendar feel to it, with each new day opening a door promising more stuff”. Labour also faced problems with policies that had merely been discussed at its autumn conference, but not implemented. Members polled for the study said Labour’s apparent plans to abolish private education were raised negatively on the doorstep, even though this never became a policy. 6. A perfect storm of obstacles The cumulative effect of Corbyn’s unpopularity, the Brexit position and the manifesto was bigger than the sum of their parts, the report argues, making the party seem unelectable by too many voters. The authors write: “To go into an election with any one of these vulnerabilities – an unpopular leader, a problematic position on the key issue of the day, or serious questions about the deliverability of key policies – would be a challenge, one that might be offset by strengths on the other two fronts. But to be in a weak position on all three at once arguably had a ‘snowballing’ effect that was fatal to Labour’s chances of securing sufficient support to win.” 7. A disorganised national campaign Noting that the structure of the party is “far from transparent”, the authors commissioned a chart to show how it works, which uncovered at least five “executive directors”, at least 13 “directors”, and at least 15 “heads of”. This confusion and lack of coherence was, they say, “a central problem afflicting Labour’s ability to develop an election strategy and prepare to implement it”. This caused policy delays, for example, over Brexit, with the authors saying earlier clarity on the issue might have mitigated the party’s difficulties over the policy. The report also criticises the central policy on messaging, saying there was an overly rigid media strategy. The party’s online campaigning, much-praised in 2017, was not as good in 2019, while the Conservatives’ efforts in this area had greatly improved. 8. A poor campaign on the ground Much of the blame for this ground campaign is directed at central policies, such as delayed readiness due to the long process of reselecting sitting MPs. The report also cites poor choices in where to allocate campaigning resources, with 80% reportedly going on seats Labour hoped to win rather than focusing on defending seats, dozens of which were lost to the Tories. This happened, the report says, “in the face of clear evidence available from the start that a far larger number of Labour seats were at risk”. It says that of 27 Labour-held seats lost narrowly to the Conservatives, 21 were not on an initial list of seats to be defended. The Tories won all of these by fewer than 700 votes, including Bury North and Bury South, Bolton North East, Stoke-on-Trent Central and Blyth Valley. 9. Loss of older, socially conservative voters In parallel to the divisions over Brexit, the report finds Labour faced a gradual loss of voters more likely to be associated with the leave side – older, less educated and socially conservative. This was another ongoing process, the report notes, which had been masked by the relative success of the 2017 election, with much of it happening before 2019 and even before the Brexit referendum. Of those who voted Labour in 2010 but voted to leave in 2016, four in 10 had already stopped voting for the party by the time of the 2015 election.
On age group, the split was stark. Labour won the backing of 62% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 51% of 25- to 34-year-olds. But among those aged 55 to 64, the party was 21 percentage points behind the Tories, rising to 47 percentage points among those aged 65-plus. And while the party led over the Conservatives among graduates, for those with no qualifications it lagged by 33 points. 10. Becoming a party of city-dwellers As Labour’s vote share evaporated in its heartland towns, more or less the only place it saw a rise in support was in or around large cities characterised by both high deprivation levels and many professional workers, and with high proportions of black, Asian and minority ethnic voters or students, such as London, Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham.
This in part appeared to mean that any benefit to Labour from an influx of new voters was mainly felt in places where the party was already going to win. While the number of newly registered voters was higher in 2019 than in 2017 – 3.2 million against 2.3 million – and two-thirds were under 35, overall turnout fell slightly. While higher turnout was mainly seen in cities, it often fell in towns where Labour lost, such as Newcastle-under-Lyme. • This article was amended on 26 June 2020 to remove a reference to Stoke-on-Trent being a town where Labour had lost; it is a city, not a town."
2020-06-18T19:23:47Z,politics,Politics,Ministers show how world beating they are all over again | John Crace,"For months now the government has been prefacing all its coronavirus briefings as world-beating when the only thing in which we appeared to be global leaders was our mortality rates. But now I’m beginning to think Boris Johnson and his cabinet may have been on to something after all. Because it’s beginning to look more and more as if we are genuine world beaters: if only in total incompetence. Check out the evidence. In Johnson we have a prime minister who lumbers from one screw-up to the next, blinded to his own failures by a narcissism that borders on the sociopathic. On Thursday, he was meeting President Macron to celebrate the 80th anniversary of De Gaulle’s speech to the French resistance: let’s hope he didn’t give Macron a copy of his book on why Churchill was exactly like Boris, in which he basically wrote off De Gaulle as completely useless. Then we have Dominic Raab. A foreign secretary who knows so little about foreign affairs and Black Lives Matters that he thought taking the knee was something out of Game of Thrones. At this rate it would come as no surprise to find that Gavin Williamson had been labouring under the impression that the free school meals campaign had been inspired by Grange Hill. What did we do to deserve politicians quite so dim as this? But all the recent U-turns and moronic posturing are as nothing compared to the ongoing humiliation of Matt Hancock. Poor Matt. He started out with so many good intentions of being a better health secretary than his two predecessors, Andrew Lansley and Jeremy Hunt, but now just finds himself a worthy addition to the confederacy of dunces. His ambition easily outstripped his natural abilities and he merely lurches from crisis to crisis. You can see it in his eyes. His enthusiasm has been replaced by deep suspicion of everyone around him. He also looks dead on his feet. Mattbeth doth murder sleep. It was sod’s law of course that Matt was sent out to take the Downing Street press conference on the day both the latest fairly rubbish human test and trace figures were published and the “world-beating” app that had been promised for 1 June was finally consigned to the dustbin. Yet Hancock accepted his role and grudgingly took centre stage with Dido Harding, the chief executive of test and trace. There is no indignity that Boris could inflict that Matt wouldn’t willingly suck up just to be allowed to keep his job for a few days or weeks longer because he doesn’t have the self-worth to face Johnson down. Matt took a few deep breaths and tried to start off on an optimistic note. Although there was as yet no vaccine for the coronavirus, he had bought up massive supplies of all the ones that were being trialled just on the off chance that one of them happened to work. It was as good as an open invitation for any snake-oil salesman to come hammering at the Department of Health’s door. Then Matt moved on to the figures for the human test and trace, which even he couldn’t spin in a positive light as it appeared that the system was missing well over half the people with the coronavirus. Then he steadied himself and tackled the unhappy app situation head on. He had discovered months ago that the “world-beating” UK app was actually useless as it couldn’t connect with Apple phones, so he had secretly set up a second programme with Apple and Google to see if they could make their systems more effective. The Germans and Koreans might be happy with the distance at which the Apple system operated, but he wasn’t. Here we came to the real genius of Hancock’s cunning plan. Because faced with the choice of testing a system on the Isle of Wight that everyone knew didn’t work or one that could possibly be improved, Matt had opted to waste several months testing the one that was a complete non-starter. Brilliant. This was “world-beating” science at its absolute best. Testing the useless one was spearheading the international effort to show other countries precisely what not to do. It was an act of supreme “world-beating” self sacrifice for the UK to take one for the global team. The 60,000 Brits who have died of Covid-19 could rest assured they hadn’t done so in vain. Inevitably, Matt found himself struggling with the questions from journalists. All he could do was try to pretend that the “world-beating” app had never been that important – “the cherry on Dido’s cake” – and that people shouldn’t be too worried if it wasn’t working properly until some time in the late autumn at the earliest. This after both Boris and Matt had been insistent that the app was key to relaxing lockdown restrictions, which was already taking place. It was beginning to sound as if the prime minister and health secretary were actively trying to kill people. Mattbeth doth murder more than sleep. In desperation, Matt handed over to Harding. Unfortunately, Dido is an equally unreliable narrator having not had tremendous success with data breaches at Talk Talk and giving the go-ahead to the Cheltenham festival a week after many scientists had been pleading for a lockdown. The baroness is one of that elite club of chief executives who consistently manages to fail upwards. So her insistence that though the test and trace figures were basically crap they were still better than nothing wasn’t as reassuring as it might have been. The briefing ended in an uneasy truce, with Matt struggling to contain his tetchiness. There’s only so much embarrassment even he can take. What he needed was a “world-beating” hero on his side. If only he had a number for Daniel Rashford."
2020-06-18T18:30:56Z,politics,Politics,Radical proposals in Lib Dem policy review suggest shift to the left,"The Liberal Democrats could make a decisive shift to the centre left, shedding the final legacies from the party’s period in coalition, under a review of policy ideas overseen by the leadership hopeful Layla Moran. A new booklet, Build Back Better, edited by the MP, is billed as a modern equivalent to the Orange Book, a 2004 collection of essays from Lib Dem figures – including the former leaders Nick Clegg and Vince Cable, and former cabinet minister David Laws – which pushed the party towards a centre-right, markets-based stance. In contrast, Build Back Better, with contributions from more than 40 Lib Dem MPs, members and supporters, includes essays advocating ideas such as a universal basic income, free broadband, and commandeering private health resources to clear a backlog of NHS operations caused by coronavirus. Many of the contributors to the Orange Book went on to serve in the 2010-15 coalition with the Conservatives, a period followed by three generally disastrous elections for the Lib Dems. Moran, the Oxford West MP and education spokeswoman, is seen as the joint favourite to win the party leadership battle, alongside Ed Davey, the interim leader. Davey contributed to the Orange Book and took part in the coalition, and while he has unveiled radical plans of his own, such as a £150bn investment in the green economy, Moran is keen to place herself as the choice of the party’s centre-left. The third confirmed contender is the Bath MP Wera Hobhouse, who is seen as an outsider. Work on the book – which does not form part of Moran’s leadership bid – began two months ago, when the leadership race was postponed because of the coronavirus crisis. The competition has since resumed, with a new leader due to be announced in August. Many of the contributors, who include Cable, are remaining neutral on who they support. Moran said the book was devised to define the party’s “liberal response to coronavirus, so I didn’t really think in terms of positioning”. However, she added, a common theme emerged: “What it shows is we are a party of the centre left – that is where our beating heart lies.” This amounted to a move away from the ideas of the coalition, Moran said, lamenting what she called an overly slow evolution of ideas in the following period. “I think we need to send a signal to both other parties and to the electorate that we are moving on from not just coalition but the last five years,” she said. “It’s very clear that at the next election the positioning is going to have to be to take seats off the Tories. That’s the obvious thing.” She said the Orange Book was seen as a concerted shift to the centre-right. “When people read this, they’ll see it’s a shift to the centre-left. It didn’t set out that way, but it seems to have been the natural response of party members who are writing.” Several essays are about a green recovery from the impact of coronavirus, with Cable arguing for a new and more ambitious green investment bank. Others tackle the rise of technology and the idea of a digital bill of rights. One essay, by a former councillor, Paul Noblet, calls for not just a universal basic income, but universal free services, such as broadband, water and energy. Moran stressed that while the ideas were some way from becoming party policy, she hoped the review would bring a boost to the process of rethinking what the party stands for. “To put it bluntly, since coalition there has been a bit of a dearth of that in the party,” she said. “Of our membership, 50% are new since the coalition. I don’t think we’ve really harnessed the power of their ideas yet.”"
2020-06-18T17:50:58Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Hancock says 'we backed both horses' as he defends contact tracing app - as it happened,"In another major U-turn by Boris Johnsonâ€™s government, the NHS Covid-19 contact-tracing app was abandoned. Instead, focus will turn to technology from Apple and Google, after the trial on the Isle of Wight revealed the app was highly inaccurate when used on iPhones. The latest test and trace figures suggested a significant reduction in social distancing in early June. The DHSC figures revealed 4,366 infected people passed on details of 44,895 contacts, suggesting that between 4 June and 10 June infected people were each in contact with 10.28 other people on average, up from 5.88 for the week prior. The first minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster announced an easing of lockdown restrictions, including abandoning the 2 metre rule for schools. Schools there are set to reopen on 24 August with a 1 metre social distancing measure in place. The move increases pressure on Boris Johnson as many of his MPs have been urging him to do the same for England for some time now. Dominic Raab was criticised for â€œinsultingâ€� the Black Lives Matter movement when he said taking the knee felt like â€œa symbol of subjugation or subordinationâ€� and that he thought the idea came from Game of Thrones. In case you missed it, hereâ€™s the video. Face coverings will be compulsory on public transport in Scotland from Monday. Nicola Sturgeon announced further lockdown-easing measures including shops, churches and dental surgeries to reopen over the next two weeks, and an â€˜extended householdâ€™ scheme for single adult households.

2020-06-18T17:38:51Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Raab criticised for comments on BLM protesters taking the knee,"Dominic Raab has prompted criticism and scorn after saying he views the symbolic Black Lives Matter action of taking the knee as “a symbol of subjugation and subordination”, and that it originated from the TV show Game of Thrones. In a sometimes eyebrow-raising exchange during a radio interview, the foreign secretary appeared not to know that the stance was popularised by US athletes, notably the American football player Colin Kaepernick, as a protest against racism and police brutality. Raab said he understood why some people took the knee, but said he would only do so “for the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me”. The pose, used in the past by Martin Luther King for prayer, was adopted as a secular protest against racism in 2016 and has spread widely since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month as a way of showing support for BLM and respect for those killed. Speaking on talkRadio on Thursday, Raab was asked whether he would adopt the pose. He replied: “Do you know what? I understand this sense of frustration, of restlessness, which is driving the Black Lives Matter movement. “I’ve got say, on this take the knee thing – which, I don’t know, maybe it’s got a broader history but it seems to be taken from the Game of Thrones – feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination, rather than one of liberation and emancipation. But I understand people feel differently about it, so it’s a matter of personal choice.” The comment brought criticism from other MPs. David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, tweeted: “This is not just insulting to the Black Lives Matter movement, it is deeply embarrassing for Dominic Raab. He is supposed to be the foreign secretary of the United Kingdom.” Diane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary, said: “‘Taking the knee began in 2016 with American athletes refusing to stand for US national anthem. They were protesting police brutality and racism. But Dominic Raab thinks it comes from Game of Thrones!!!” Ed Davey, the acting Liberal Democrats leader, told the BBC that Raab should offer “a fulsome apology”, adding that the comments “show the foreign secretary doesn’t really have a grasp of a key global movement”. Anne Soubry, the former Conservative MP, tweeted that Raab was “an embarrassment to our country and the party I used to be proud to be a member of”. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is among those in the UK who have adopted the pose. Some police officers have also done so at protests, and Premier League footballers and officials took the knee on Wednesday before the first games since the pause in the season caused by coronavirus. The use of taking a knee began in 2016 when Kaepernick, then a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, opted to sit on the team bench rather than stand for the pre-NFL game rendition of the US national anthem, in protest against racism and police brutality.
Kaepernick, who was joined by other players, later decided to pose on one knee, saying this made the same point while showing more respect to military veterans. Among those he took advice from was Nate Boyer, a former Green Beret who also played in the NFL. Kaepernick’s actions led him to be frozen out of professional sport, and he was criticised by Donald Trump among others. Following the recent BLM protests, he could now return to the NFL, with even Trump saying this would not be a problem for him. Raab, when asked whether he would take the knee to show solidarity with BLM, said: “I’d take the knee for two people: the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me.” On the subject of his wife he added: “By the way, she disputes that. I had this conversation with her last night. I’m sure I did, but we’d obviously had too much champagne at the time. But I’m certain I did.” Responding later on Twitter, Raab said: “To be clear: I have full respect for the Black Lives Matter movement and the issues driving them. If people wish to take a knee, that’s their choice and I respect it. We all need to come together to tackle any discrimination and social injustice.” Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the prime minister had no comment on the issue. “The foreign secretary was very clear he was expressing a personal opinion, and he has tweeted about it,” he said. Raab’s Game of Thrones theory is not the first time he has expressed unusual views. In 2018, as Brexit secretary, he prompted criticism and some mockery for saying he had only recently appreciated the importance of the Dover-Calais crossing for UK trade."
2020-06-18T17:33:04Z,politics,Politics,Raab is wrong about taking the knee,"If Dominic Raab has “taken the knee” to HM the Queen he must have received the accolade of knighthood (Dominic Raab: taking the knee ‘feels like symbol of subjugation’, 18 June). And since we haven’t heard about it, it must have been in secret. Being sworn of the privy council requires briefly kneeling on two knees to signify loyalty to the country and sovereign, not deference or “subjugation”. “Taking the knee” signifies racial and social solidarity. Sentient kneelers tend to comprehend the distinction. Either the foreign (maybe the clue is in the word these days, as in “foreign body”) secretary doesn’t recognise the nobility and necessity of solidarity, or his ignorance comes from the same abyss as his surprise that Dover is important to trade movements. Perhaps an FA course in “awareness” could help?

2020-06-18T11:57:20Z,politics,Politics,More than 3.3m EU and EEA citizens granted right to remain in UK,"More than 3.3 million EU and European Economic Area citizens have been granted the right to remain in the UK after Brexit, the Home Office has said. In its latest update on the EU settled status scheme, it said 57% of those had been granted “settled status”, the term for those who have been able to demonstrate they have been in the country for five years or more. No accurate data on the number of EU citizens living in the country exists but previous estimates have suggested a range of between 3 million and 3.8 million. The figures released on Thursday show a high take-up rate, reflecting the desire of many to remain in the country despite Brexit and despite anxieties often expressed about their futures in the country.
The figures also come just days after Michael Gove expressed concern in the House of Commons over reciprocal arrangements in Europe. It is believed that 13 of the 27 member states plan similar systems, including France, which is due to launch a similar system for Britons next month. Those of Polish heritage represented the largest nationality cohort remaining in the UK with 697,000, followed by Romanians, Italians, Portuguese and Spanish. Around 41% of applicants had been granted pre-settled status designed for those who have been in the country for fewer than five years. Of the remaining applications, 28,900 received a withdrawn or void outcome, 14,100 were invalid and 900 were refused. Of the total refusals, 99% were refused on eligibility grounds and 1% (9) were refused on suitability grounds, the Home Office said in a statement. Suitability grounds including those with serious or persistent criminality. EU citizens currently living in the UK have the automatic right to remain in the country after Brexit and have until July next year to apply for status. During the transition period EU citizens continue to have the right to settle in Britain in the same way that UK citizens still retain the right to move and settle to another EU member state. These freedom of movement rights flow from the UK’s continued membership of the single market. Future borders and immigration minister, Kevin Foster, said: “There is still plenty of time to apply before the 30 June 2021 deadline and I encourage all those who haven’t already applied to do so now. Support is available online and over the telephone for those with questions or who need help applying.” He said he was pleased that so many had already applied. Overall the total number of applications up to 31 May 2020 was 3,612,400, the government said."
2020-06-17T18:03:53Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus UK live: Dowden hints at bailout for theatres - as it happened,"A fresh government bailout for theatres could be on the cards. Given they are likely to remain unable to open for some time due to social distancing requirements, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said â€œother supportâ€� was being discussed. It comes as the West End producer Cameron Mackintosh announced he was delaying the return of shows including Hamilton and Les Mis to the West End and had started the redundancy process in the absence of any support, and 98 leading creatives signed a letter urging the government to issue emergency support for the creative sector, stressing it was â€œon the brink of ruinâ€�. A Union Jack makeover for the prime ministerâ€™s RAF Voyager will cost the taxpayer at least Â£900,000. The project was ridiculed and condemned by opposition parties as a waste of public money in the midst of an unprecedented national crisis. Meanwhile, Boris Johnsonâ€™s official spokesman insisted the red, white and blue paint job provided â€œvalue for moneyâ€� and that the rebranding would help promote the UKâ€™s standing abroad. No 10 was unable to say when the NHS Covid-19 contact-tracing app would be ready for roll-out. The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, had initially said it would be ready this month, but the PMâ€™s official spokesman today said he had no update on when the app would be made available to the public. The UK death toll surpassed 42,000 as another 184 fatalities were recorded. It brings the official total across all settings as tallied by the Department of Health and Social Care to 42,153. And the long-awaited return of the Premier League kicked off this evening. Aston Villa v Sheffield United got off to a powerful start, with a minuteâ€™s silence for all victims of the coronavirus pandemic and all 22 players and the referee taking the knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement immediately after the whistle blew.

2020-06-17T17:18:21Z,politics,Politics,Labour quizzes PM on planning decision that saved Tory donor Â£40m,"Boris Johnson is facing pressure to disclose any meetings he had with Richard Desmond before a minister overruled planners, saving the former Express newspapers owner about £40m on a London property development. After Johnson was quizzed about the issue at prime minister’s questions, Labour formally asked for details of any contact with Desmond since he had entered No 10, and with other Conservative party donors. It follows scrutiny of links between Desmond and Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, who overturned a decision by a local council and the government’s planning inspectorate in order to approve a 500-apartment, 44-storey development in east London, Westferry Printworks, on a former printing plant.
Jenrick’s move in January came a day before the introduction of the community infrastructure levy, to be used for local education and health projects, which would have cost Desmond’s company at least £40m. It later emerged that Jenrick had sat next to Desmond at a Conservative fundraising dinner in November, and that Desmond donated £12,000 to the party two weeks after the planning decision in his favour. After the local council, Tower Hamlets, sought a judicial review of Jenrick’s decision, he conceded the case, admitting he had acted unlawfully. The cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, is examining details of the case provided by Jenrick, but No 10 has denied this amounts to a formal investigation. At PMQs, the Labour MP Chris Matheson asked whether any of Johnson’s officials or advisers had discussed the planning decision with Jenrick, and whether he would publish all relevant correspondence.
Johnson said he “certainly had no correspondence about this matter myself and nor, as far as I’m aware, did any of my officials”, adding that Jenrick would write to Matheson on the issue. Labour subsequently asked for information on how many times Johnson had met Desmond or other party donors since becoming prime minister. Steve Reed, the shadow communities secretary, said: “He must now come clean about when he and his advisers met Desmond since taking office, and must ask the cabinet secretary to launch a formal investigation into any breaches of the ministerial code to show the Conservatives have not been accepting cash for favours.” A Downing Street source said: “No one in No 10 has discussed this application with Mr Desmond, and No 10 has had no involvement with the secretary of state’s appeal decision.” Jenrick has denied any wrongdoing in his decision over the application for Westferry Printworks, which is live once again."
2020-06-17T17:01:44Z,politics,Politics,Fears over DfID and Foreign Office merger to be raised in Commons,"Fears that hundreds of jobs at the Department for International Development (DfID) are at risk as part of the merger with the Foreign Office will be raised in the Commons on Thursday. A campaign was also launched among aid groups to try to persuade the government to rethink the surprise decision announced by the prime minister on Tuesday. The Speaker has granted an urgent question to Wendy Chamberlain, the Liberal Democrat MP for North East Fife, only 48 hours after the prime minister had come to the Commons to announce the merger. It is unusual for the Speaker to grant a statement so quickly and reflects the lack of staff consultation prior to the merger. Nearly 600 staff work at the DfID headquarters in East Kilbride. Staff were given less than an hour’s notice of the long rumoured merger.
Their union, the FDA, wrote to the government on Wednesday to seek details of how the merger is to take place and what salary alignment is planned with the relatively less well paid Foreign Office. Allan Sampson, FDA national officer, demanded formal consultation over the plans along with the PCS union in the letter to the Foreign Office. “We believe that no current DfID staff member should suffer any detriment to their pay, terms or conditions as a consequence of the merger, and we agree the department should implement urgent wellbeing support for staff who may be struggling emotionally at this difficult time. We also take the view it will be important to embed key DfID values and aims into the new department.” Commitments have been given that there will be no compulsory redundancies, but it is clear the Foreign Office will now be in control of merged budgets and a degree of salary alignment between departments is now expected. The degree of secrecy surrounding the decision was underlined when Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said the decision had never been referred to cabinet. Chamberlain said: “Dissolving the department could also have serious repercussions at home. Hundreds of employees and their families in the East Kilbride area will be left worried about the security or location of their jobs. “These jobs must stay put. We cannot afford to lose specialist expertise or put people’s jobs in jeopardy in the midst of a pandemic.”
Insiders said there was anger when Johnson said DfID staff handed out aid to authoritarian leaders willing to execute their political opponents, undermining the work of diplomats trying to stop human rights abuses. One DfID member said: “I think the records will show that it was the Foreign Office that advocated selling arms to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen, not DfID.” Johnson also angered DfID staff by saying its budget had been treated as a “great cashpoint in a sky”, implying it is DfID staff’s view that cash can be dispensed at random. One DfID member said: “Staff are shocked and upset, even though this has been a possibility for a long time … The government’s messaging totally undermines their expertise and achievements.” James Cowan, chief executive of the Halo Trust, one of the few aid charities supporting the merger, said: “What is interesting and what the prime minister is really trying to drive at is there is a sub-culture within DfID which is different from the rest of Whitehall, a sense that they are not crown servants, a sense that they are not necessarily there to serve the national interest. I think he wants to address that.” He added an integrated approach between defence, aid and foreign is needed, saying: “It is very siloed, tribalised and needs to be broken down”. David Miliband, who as Tony Blair’s chief policy adviser in 1997 first proposed separating the diplomatic and overseas aid wings of government, said he feared that if the merger was handled badly lives would be lost. He said: “The danger is that Britain spends the next six months re-arranging its institutional furniture when we are in the middle of the biggest humanitarian pandemic for 100 years, and British aid policy could be a genuine leader. My plea to Dominic Raab is to make sure there is not a six-month hiatus. If there is people will literally pay with their lives. British aid money and influence needs to be out there getting money to the frontline in this Covid crisis.” Former foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind said: “However much leftwingers might complain, the decision to fold DfID into the Foreign Office is perfectly sensible. Having two departments covering UK foreign policy has long been a recipe for incoherence and confusion. Nor should we be shy about focussing our aid spending on countries with whom we have the strongest connection.”"
2020-06-17T16:52:50Z,politics,Politics,"Dispute mechanism is key sticking point in Brexit talks, says Von der Leyen","Ursula von der Leyen has highlighted the UK’s rejection of an all-encompassing punishment mechanism to keep it true to any Brexit deal with the EU as the emerging threat to an agreement, as a leaked document revealed Germany wants to draw up plans for “no deal 2.0”. Despite the most recent mood music around the negotiations being positive, the European commission president sought to draw attention to one of the less well-known areas where the two sides are at loggerheads. “Governance may sound like an issue for bureaucrats,” Von der Leyen told the European parliament. “It’s not. It is central for our businesses and our private citizens both in the UK and in the European Union. It is crucial to ensure that what has been agreed is actually done.” The EU wants a blockbuster deal with a cross-cutting dispute mechanism covering everything from trade to transport and judicial cooperation to fisheries. A clear breach of the deal could allow either side to retaliate by suspending a part of the relationship. Downing Street has opposed the governance proposal, insisting there should be a series of separate sectoral agreements. It is understood that EU officials fear that this seemingly arcane issue could prove to be the most difficult on which to find a compromise in the short time left before the transition period ends. In a sign of EU doubts over Boris Johnson’s claim on Monday that a deal could be secured in six weeks, a leaked document obtained by Reuters revealed that the German government was instead earmarking September as the key month. The government document, dated 15 June, reads: “From September, the negotiations enter a hot phase. Britain is already escalating threats in Brussels, wants to settle as much as possible in the shortest possible time and hopes to achieve last-minute success in the negotiations. “It is therefore important to preserve the unity of the 27, to continue to insist on parallel progress in all areas (overall package) and to make it clear that there will be no agreement at any price. Therefore, both national and European contingency planning would now have to start in order to be prepared for a no deal 2.0.” EU officials believe the real deadline is 31 October, after which any deal would need to be ratified by the European parliament. Von der Leyen told MEPs on Wednesday: “We are now halfway through these negotiations. But we’re definitely not halfway through the work to reach an agreement. With little time ahead of us we’ll do all in our power to reach an agreement.” Alongside dispute resolution, Von der Leyen mentioned agreement on “level playing field” conditions to ensure fair competition between British and EU businesses, access to UK fishing waters and police cooperation as the main areas of contention. There is also continued consternation in Brussels about the UK’s refusal to engage in talks on future security and defence cooperation. Echoing comments from the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, this month when he complained that he did not understand the British position, the bloc’s ambassador to the UK, João Vale de Almeida, told Bloomberg that member states remained open on the issue if Downing Street reconsidered. “We put forward a proposal for the negotiating table, as we call them, on security and defence [and] foreign policy issues at large,” he said. “The UK has chosen not to open that table of discussion.” Von der Leyen hinted, however, at an EU compromise on fisheries by merely seeking “guarantees and predictability” for European fleet rather than the status quo. Following a videoconference meeting on Monday between Johnson and EU institution leaders including Von der Leyen, both sides committed to “intensify” talks in July and if possible reach “an early understanding on the principles underlying any agreement”. EU officials are as keen as Downing Street to secure early agreement, and the European council president, Charles Michel, will present the latest on the negotiations to leaders by video conference on Friday."
2020-06-17T16:49:20Z,politics,Politics,Furlough effect leaves Rishi Sunak with 'triple lock' pensions dilemma,"Rishi Sunak is being forced to consider ways of getting round the “triple lock” on pensions next year amid signs that the bounce back in wages for furloughed workers could put state pensioners in line for an 18% increase. While the Treasury said it had no plans to ditch the arrangement – by which pensions rise by the rate of inflation, average earnings or 2.5%, whichever is greater – the chancellor has accepted a problem is looming in 2021 as the economy recovers from the coronavirus lockdown. Officials will spend the next few months seeking a solution that “does not screw pensioners” but outside experts said a temporary suspension of the triple lock was inevitable unless the government is prepared to pay a massive bill next year. Sunak’s dilemma has been caused by forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility showing a drop of more than 7% in earnings this year as a result of millions of furloughed workers receiving 80% of their wages, which will be followed by an 18% increase next year as they return to full pay. Under the triple lock – which Boris Johnson pledged to keep in the Tory’s 2019 election manifesto – pensioners will receive a minimum increase of 2.5% in this year’s uprating but will be in line to receive 18% the following year.
Sunak is aware of the statistical problem caused by the furlough but denied reports that a decision to scrap the triple lock had already been made. Any plan to break the manifesto commitment would need the approval of the prime minister, who promised to retain it only last month. One possible solution would be a temporary one-year suspension of the triple lock, which was brought in by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government after the 2010 election. Even before the current crisis, the Treasury had been campaigning to ditch the triple lock on the grounds that an ageing population would make it increasingly unaffordable. But Downing Street said both the prime minister and the chancellor remained committed to supporting pensioners and the Treasury said it had yet to do a full analysis of the options. The problem caused by the furlough was highlighted by Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, in evidence to the Treasury select committee last week. Bell told MPs: “We’re not going to increase the state pension by 18% next year. So the triple lock is going in its current form at least temporarily next year, unless [some MPs] are considering giving very generous increases to pensioners next year. However, I expect we will not be increasing it by nearly a fifth.” The former pensions minister Ros Altmann said: “As Treasury considers public spending measures, triple lock is likely to require review. Given the potential distortions of earnings and inflation figures due to the exceptional crisis measures, it seems that review of the triple lock would be advisable. We do have the lowest state pension in the developed world, so pensioners clearly need protection, but in light of the current emergency, it seems to me the time has come to recognise that the triple lock has outlived its usefulness – and indeed its operation has become increasingly unjust.”
Over the past decade, inflation has been low and wage growth has been weak, so the 2.5% minimum guaranteed by the triple lock has resulted in pensions rising faster than earnings. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “The triple lock is vital for increasing our state pension, which is one of the lowest in the developed world. “Boris Johnson promised to honour his manifesto pledge to keep the triple lock just last month. Pensioners should be protected from the impact of any fall in wages or inflation this year.”"
2020-06-17T16:40:09Z,politics,Politics,"Paint job on Boris Johnson's plane will cost taxpayer £900,000","Boris Johnson’s red, white and blue paint job on the prime ministerial plane is costing the UK taxpayer £900,000, his official spokesman has said. The spokesman confirmed that the RAF Voyager, previously coloured grey, is in Cambridgeshire for a makeover. “The RAF Voyager used by the royal family and the PM is currently in Cambridgeshire for pre-planned repainting. This will mean that the plane can better represent the UK around the world with national branding, which will be in line with many other leaders’ planes,” he said. He added that it would continue to perform its other job, refuelling military jets. The project was condemned as a waste of public money by opposition parties. Labour frontbencher Louise Haigh said: “When families across the country are worried about their jobs, health and the education of their children, they will rightly question the government’s priorities when they are spending almost £1m redecorating a plane.” SNP MP Stewart McDonald said: “This is an utterly unacceptable use of public funds whilst members of the armed forces are spending their own money on uniforms and kit, and the equipment plan deficit is well into the billions for several years running.” The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, claimed the expenditure was justified because the repainted plane would help to promote the country globally. “We have always spent money on promoting the UK around the world. I see this with creative industries, and we really are a creative industries superpower, and we should be promoting that. I think the work on the Voyager is part of that promotion,” he told Wednesday’s daily No 10 press briefing. Johnson’s spokesman said that the price tag included the cost of creating a design that will “promote the UK around the world without compromising the plane’s vital military role” – and stressed that British businesses would do the work. Asked whether the rebranding had been Johnson’s idea, the spokesman said: “The PM approved the decision.” On a trip to South America as foreign secretary two years ago, Johnson said the Voyager, then Theresa May’s plane, was not available to him often enough – and complained about its dull colour scheme. “What I will say about the Voyager, I think it’s great, but it seems to be very difficult to get hold of.” He added: “And also, why does it have to be grey?” One reason for the grey colour scheme is that the plane’s dual use means it needs to be camouflaged. However, in an attempt at compromise, one source said that the body of the plane would now be painted white with a blue stripe – while the tail fin would be painted in a union flag design. This would make it look similar to a British Airways plane, but will present something of a headache for air force commanders who know that the Voyager would be more visible to enemy air forces as well as being identifiable as the UK’s principal VIP plane. As well as the prime minister, the plane is used by the royal family and is staffed by the RAF. It is unclear when Johnson will first travel on the Voyager with its new livery. Johnson’s plans for the plane emerged on Tuesday, as he was announcing a major shake-up in the UK’s approach to foreign policy, merging the Department for International Development into the Foreign Office. He made clear the shift would lead to trade and security considerations playing a greater role in determining the UK’s relationship with low-income countries – with the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, making the final decision about which countries will receive official assistance. Defence sources confirmed on Tuesday the plane was being repainted at a specialist secure hangar run by Marshall Aerospace near Cambridge. If Johnson wants to increase the government’s access to the plane by buying more flying hours from the Ministry of Defence, it could increase the knock-on costs to the taxpayer because the military will be forced to charter aircraft for its own needs. Andy Netherwood, a defence analyst, said: “The paint scheme gives away the fact that No 10 is re-purposing an aircraft acquired to provide defence. If Johnson wants a VIP jet fine, but make the argument and pay for it.” The Voyager is one of a fleet of transport planes leased to the Ministry of Defence by a consortium of aerospace firms called Air Tanker, and was refitted with a VIP section when David Cameron was prime minister at a cost of £10m."
2020-06-17T16:33:59Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson repeatedly yells 'schools' to evade scrutiny in dismal PMQs | John Crace,"Here’s a thought. Would it actually matter if Boris Johnson were to answer a direct question? After all, the prime minister’s relationship with the truth is so tenuous at the best of times – he can’t even confirm how many children he actually has – that almost everything he says needs to be independently fact-checked. Lying isn’t just second nature to Boris, it’s first nature. It’s what he does. It’s how he navigates his way through the world. He has no moral universe to cause him fits of conscience. On the whole – give or take a few failed relationships and the odd sacking – it’s a coping mechanism that has served him well. With a bit of bluster, backed up by a shed load of untruths, he’s managed to fulfil his ambition of becoming PM. Yet there’s a world of difference between realising a dream and living with its consequences. Because the cold truth is that Boris never actually wanted to do the hard yards of being prime minister. He was always only the glossy, reality TV show winner: never the man for long hours of countless meetings, reading reports and taking decisions for which he would be held accountable. All of which has left Boris with something of a headache. Because the British public expect rather more of their leader than a few glib one-liners and a crumpled haircut, even if that’s what – in their heart of hearts – they know they had voted for. It’s unfair I know, but no one can say that Johnson wasn’t warned. Voters can be a fickle bunch. They can happily elect someone whom they know to be a charlatan, but having done so they want him to behave with integrity. And that’s just one of many qualities that Boris does not have on offer. Something the previous exchanges at prime minister’s questions with Keir Starmer had brutally exposed. And, at first, it seemed that this week’s PMQs was going to be a reprise of all the others. The Labour leader got in an early dig about Boris’s latest U-turn on free school meals – his third within the last month – and then asked about the new social mobility report that found that there were 600,000 more children living in poverty since 2012. How did he explain the increase? Predictably he couldn’t. Indeed it was clear he had no idea the report had even been published and managed to confuse the predictions of even higher levels of poverty as a result of coronavirus with the increase that had already been accounted for. Though not by Boris. At this point, it was as if Johnson suddenly chose to revert to type. There was no point in him standing at the dispatch box, trying to act like the statesman he was never going to be, and having his arse served up to him on a plate by Starmer. So he just abandoned any pretence of trying to answer any questions and chose to go on the attack himself. So from now on he would be the one who was asking all the questions. Did the Labour leader think it was safe for all children to go back to school or was he just being bullied by the teaching unions? “Your witness,” Boris exclaimed excitedly, sounding every bit like a coked-up debater at the Oxford Union who mistakenly believes he has just landed a killer line. Starmer blinked, did a double take, pretended he hadn’t heard and pressed Johnson on comments made by Tory-run councils that they didn’t have enough money to run basic services. Yeah, but what about the schools? Boris yelled again. How come you haven’t answered my question? Starmer politely observed – not for the first time – that the session was questions for the prime minister but if Johnson wanted to make way he would be happy to take his place. By now though, Boris was rushing on his run and whatever he’d had beforehand appeared to be working overtime. He continued to put his fingers in his ears whenever Starmer tried to get a word in edgeways and just kept shouting: ‘Schools, schools, schools.’
It would probably have been better had Starmer bothered to reply to Boris. Just to shut him up. After all, the reason that not all pupils have gone back has far more to do with the government’s own guidelines on physical distancing than because the unions have been difficult. But the Labour leader has principles, was determined not to get drawn off track and eventually pinned down the prime minister on to yet another promise on the immigration health surcharge he had so far failed to keep. The handful of Tory MPs in the chamber were ecstatic though. Both C-listers Geoffrey Clifton-Brown and Bob Stewart observed how good it was to see the prime minister back on fighting form. They had come expecting to see their leader humiliated yet again – the last week has seen the government’s competency and approval ratings take a real hammering – but somehow Boris had managed to escape relatively unscathed merely by avoiding answering any questions. Going low when his opponents aim high has often paid off for Johnson. In reality, though, PMQs had been a dismal affair. Primetime scrutiny reduced to a charade. We’d all have been better informed watching Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? There is no area of public life that Boris cannot somehow corrode and toxify and Starmer is going to have to rethink his approach if he really wants to get under Boris and the Tories’ skins. PMQs as playground politics suits them just fine right now. But the rest of us deserve so much better than second-rate theatre at a time of national crisis and insecurity. Moments after Boris bounced out the Commons, Matt Hancock took centre stage to declare British science to be the best in the world. Given that the UK has the highest death rate in the world, some might also be choosing to think how ironic it is that we also have some of the worst politicians."
2020-06-17T15:10:55Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's car hit by security vehicle outside parliament,"Boris Johnson has escaped unhurt after a security vehicle collided with the back of the car he was travelling in as he left parliament after prime minister’s questions. Video of the incident, on Wednesday, showed the grey Jaguar carrying Johnson pull out of the main gates of parliament as part of a convoy, including police motorcycles. As it left, a man believed to be part of a protest by Kurdish activists ran towards the prime minister’s car. Even though the man was pulled back by a police officer on foot, the car stopped suddenly, and a black Range Rover that was next in the convoy failed to stop in time.
Pictures showed the Jaguar with a dent in the rear. The convoy immediately set off again. No 10 confirmed Johnson had been in the damaged car. A spokesman said: “Yes, that was the PM’s car. I think the video speaks for itself as to what happened. No reports of anybody being injured.” A Metropolitan police statement said: “At approximately 14:30 hrs today, 17 June, two police vehicles were involved in a collision in Parliament Square. The police vehicles were part of a security movement. A pedestrian is reported to have stepped on to the road, causing the vehicles to suddenly stop, which has led to two of the vehicles in the convoy being involved in a damage-only collision. “No injuries have been reported. A man, no further details at this time, was arrested at the scene for offences under Section 5 of the Public Order Act and for obstructing the highway.” Will Geddes, the managing director of close protection specialists ICP Group, said that Johnson’s security team had been forced to make “a split-second assessment” of the risk to the prime minister during the incident. “There clearly wasn’t a strong enough cordon when the prime minister was coming out but people do get through. If it had been a suicide bomber then the police cyclist and the driver of the PM’s Jag would have to have decided to have driven through. “But it’s a better outcome that there’s a dent in the PM’s car rather than a protester ending up nose down in the street because they’ve been knocked over.” Johnson’s car is an armoured Jaguar XJ Sentinel, which is popular with wealthy Russians because of its discreet design. It has bomb-proof doors, bullet-proof glass and armour plating in the floor to protect from blasts underneath. Close protection officers would probably have been in the black Range Rover that crashed into the prime minister’s car. “Normally it is a cardinal sin to crash into another car in this kind of situation, but I think there are mitigating circumstances this time,” Geddes added."
2020-06-17T10:02:27Z,politics,Politics,Sadiq Khan demands emergency help for London services,"Sadiq Khan has warned of deep cuts to major London services including the police and the fire service unless Boris Johnson’s government intervenes after a sharp fall in revenue during the coronavirus lockdown. The mayor of London has reduced his own pay by 10% and demanded that ministers plug a £493m black hole or see the budgets of the Metropolitan police, London fire brigade, Transport for London and the Greater London Authority slashed. He said a failure to help could undermine the government’s pledge to recruit 20,000 new police officers across the UK and efforts to transform the fire services after the Grenfell Tower fire.
In recognition of the cuts that local government employees may face, Khan has committed to take an immediate £15,273 pay cut, and to freeze the salaries of his 15 direct appointments. Khan said: “Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on London’s public finances. TfL’s fares income has dropped by more than 90% and local business rates and council tax income has fallen off a cliff. “This is the worst possible time for a return to austerity – just when we need to invest in London’s recovery. Unless ministers act, the current number of police officers will need to be reduced and it will be impossible to tackle youth violence or make the changes to the London fire brigade that are desperately needed after the awful Grenfell Tower tragedy. “I didn’t enter politics to administer government austerity, and I will do everything in my power to persuade ministers not to force another era of austerity on local and regional government. “Whatever happens I will protect the frontline services that Londoners depend on as much as possible – and it’s only right that I should volunteer an immediate pay cut in these extremely difficult circumstances and continue not to take any pension contributions. In addition, I have taken the decision to freeze the salaries of my political appointments at City Hall.”
The GLA Group faced a £493m budget shortfall over the next two years as a result of an unprecedented loss of business rates and council tax income, caused by Covid-19, he said. This is in addition to significant emergency costs already incurred by the GLA Group through schemes to support Londoners during the pandemic. He has also warned that cuts could hamper the recovery effort to boost the economy, support jobs, invest in skills and help Londoners get back on track. Khan was one of several Labour mayors who last week warned that local authorities were at risk of going bust unless central government intervened. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, has previously said councils will get the funding they need and Boris Johnson has said there will be no return to austerity as the country grapples with the pandemic. But the government has so far refused to commit to providing sufficient support to local and regional authorities responding to the pandemic. A government spokesperson said: “We have given London an unprecedented package of support to ensure they have the resources they need to provide services for their communities during the pandemic. “The GLA has received an extra £18.5m of emergency funding and an additional £1.6bn for Transport for London. This is on top of an increase in core spending power of over £88m to over £2.27bn while the Metropolitan police is receiving £2.9 bn in funding this financial year, the most substantial police funding increase since 2010.”"
2020-06-17T05:00:45Z,politics,Politics,Brexit revives unionist and nationalist divide in Northern Ireland,"Brexit has squeezed the political middle ground in Northern Ireland and pushed more people into their unionist and nationalist trenches. A post-Brexit opinion poll has found that those in the region deeming themselves neither unionist or nationalist has fallen to 39%. The Northern Ireland Life and Times (NILT) survey revealed that this figure was the lowest in 15 years. As late as 2017, 50% surveyed said they were neither. The poll of 1,200 people taken from September 2019 to February this year also reveals that more Catholics now describe themselves as nationalist since Brexit. Just under 60% of Catholics in Northern Ireland now categorise themselves as nationalist compared with 50% two years ago.
At the same time, the researchers from Queen’s University Belfast’s Ark project found 67% of Protestants now classified themselves as unionist compared with 55% in 2018. The Brexit effect however has not created any real sense of existential threat to the union among unionists, according to the NILT. Among unionists, 62% think a united Ireland is unlikely within the next 20 years. Significantly, 37% of nationalists also think there will not be Irish unity within the next two decades. The report concludes: “we are seeing a retrenchment of identity positions” in relation to traditional political allegiances. Brexit has not dramatically affected unionists’ thinking, even among those who were pro-EU in the 2016 referendum. While there was a slight increase of 7% among unionists who said “don’t know”’ to the prospect of a united Ireland, Brexit made no difference to the overwhelming majority of those in favour of remaining British. Yet all three political categories – unionist, nationalist and neither – appear to continue to support the devolved institutions at Stormont. Just under 70% of the population still support the Good Friday agreement and power-sharing government. The poll showed that 35% were happy with the agreement and did not want it changed; 33% were positive about the peace accord but wanted minor changes. The authors of the report found this robust backing for devolution surprising given that for three years the local assembly was deadlocked with the main parties, Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionists, unable to form a government. Despite widespread cross-community anger over the three years of deadlock at Stormont, only 10% of those surveyed said they would like to see the UK parliament in London make all the decisions for Northern Ireland. Among the overall population, only 30% said a united Ireland was likely within the next 20 years, while 46% said Irish unity was unlikely in the same time frame. Dr Paula Devine, the co-director of Ark from the school of social sciences, education and social work at Queen’s, said: “From this data, we can see that support for the Good Friday/Belfast agreement and the devolved institutions has been maintained among people of all backgrounds. “However, it is striking that 2019 also saw a strengthening of unionist and nationalist identities and growing pressure on the so-called middle ground.” The Ark NILT survey has been running since 1998 and provides an important source of data on how opinions in Northern Ireland have changed over the past 21 years."
2020-06-16T19:42:30Z,politics,Politics,Johnson's global Britain fantasies offer little distraction from school meals own goal | John Crace,"Things fall apart. So what would you do? The Office for National Statistics has just announced a rise in unemployment of 600,000, with many more expected to be out of work in the coming months. The economy has tanked by 20%. The UK has turned into a world leader in coronavirus deaths per head of population. The Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has just skipped past the defence of Grant Shapps and Thérèse Coffey to set up the prime minister with a tap-in own goal on free school meals. You’re also worried that Harry Kane will now enter the Brexit talks and nutmeg you with an extension to the transition period. Ordinarily you would expect Boris Johnson to do nothing. Partly because he’s naturally lazy and the idea of leaving Downing Street to sort out the chaos brings him out in a cold sweat. But partly also because Boris is at his best when he says nothing at all. He’s yet to find a situation that he can’t make worse by opening his mouth. On this occasion, the prime minister chose to deal with the ongoing shitshow by going to the Commons to make an entirely unnecessary statement on his proposals to merge the Department for International Development with the Foreign Office. Just imagine. You’re in the middle of the worst global health pandemic for 100 years, the economy is falling apart all around you, children are going hungry and the most important item on your agenda is an entirely pointless departmental merger that no one except a few Tory ultras was calling for. Boris did his best to talk up the futility of the exercise by calling it Global Britain, but the longer he spoke the more it became clear the Britain he had in mind was Little Britain. Only without the jokes but keeping the casual racism. It was something of a surprise he didn’t reprise “picaninnies with watermelon smiles”. He was fed up with the poorest countries treating us like “a giant cashpoint in the sky” or taking the money and then chopping people’s heads off. That kind of largesse was very late-1990s. Now was the time for the lazy scroungers to give us back something in return. If they wanted the dosh then they had better start doing as they were told. Opposition MPs were predictably outraged, denouncing the merger both as a diversionary tactic and a chance not just to cut the foreign aid budget but also to redirect it to richer countries of more strategic influence. Tory MPs were rather more indulgent. For some this was a welcome end to a department they had never seen the point of, while others sought reassurances that this wasn’t just an opportunity to be less generous to the poorest countries. “Absolutely not,” Boris replied. Just trust me. The rearrangement of the deckchairs was purely an administrative convenience. The faces of Anne-Marie Trevelyan and Dominic Raab seated further along the frontbench rather gave the lie to this. The DfID secretary looked inconsolable while the foreign secretary appeared ecstatic at his land grab. But trust him the Tory MPs did. Though why was another matter, given that his word is now officially meaningless. Only the day before he’d insisted there would be no U-turn on free school meals and he’d happily allowed cabinet ministers to die on that hill defending it in public. Not that he gave a toss about people like Shapps or Coffey. They were merely expendable extras orbiting Planet Boris: they had it coming. It wasn’t just ambition that had made anyone accept a cabinet job. It was also their total absence of self-worth. Boris had spent his whole life lying to his family, his friends and latterly the country so why should he suddenly start telling the truth now? If he had a therapist, he’d probably lie to her too. Not just for the hell of it, but because he might genuinely fall apart if he told the truth. The shame would be just too much. Sensing that he might be fighting something of a losing battle on the distractions – when even David Cameron thinks you’ve screwed up then you really are having a bad day – Boris popped up again at the Downing Street press conference as a further diversionary tactic. He hasn’t yet learned the value of quitting when you’re no further behind. But if he was hoping that, by standing next to the scientist who had completed the first successful trial – one part-funded by DfID, the very department he had just axed: some things you just can’t make up – of a steroid that reduced coronavirus mortality rates for those in hospital, some of the glory would rub off on him, then he was in for a disappointment. The first few questions were all on his embarrassment at being shamed into the free school meal U-turn by a 22-year-old footballer who’d shown more integrity over the course of a couple of days than Boris had managed in a lifetime. Johnson’s pretence that he had only heard about Rashford sometime that morning fooled no one. As for the departmental merger, Boris was adamant that he was doing it at a time when he could maximise Britain’s influence abroad. As in at the very time when the prime minister was giving an object lesson in how not to govern a country. But maybe it was all just a cunning plan. Rather than handing out cash to countries, such as Tanzania, soon they would be feeling sorry for us and giving us overseas aid instead. It was the dialectics of international development. To Make Britain Great Again you first had to ensure the country was a global laughing stock. • This article was amended on 17 June 2020 to remove quote marks from the phrase “taking the money and then chopping people’s heads off”, attributed to Boris Johnson, which was a paraphrase and not a direct quotation."
2020-06-16T18:40:51Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Johnson hails 'breakthrough' of cheap steroid that helps prevent Covid-19 deaths — as it happened,"Here are the main points from Boris Johnsonâ€™s press conference. Johnson welcomed what he described as â€œthe biggest breakthrough yetâ€� in the search to find an effective treatment for coronavirus. Referring to the results of a trial of dexamethasone, Johnson said he was very proud of the British team involved who had â€œled the first robust clinical trial anywhere in the world to find a coronavirus treatment proven to reduce the risk of deathâ€�. Prof Peter Horby from Oxford University, who led the trial, said the results of the trial were remarkable. He explained: In ventilated patients with Covid-19, the drug dexamethosone - so 10 days of treatment with that, which is a tablet or injection - reduces the risk of death by about 35%. In patients on the ward who require oxygen and have covid, it reduces the risk of death by about 20% - that covers about 75% of patients in hospital who will see a mortality benefit from using this drug. Sir Patrick Vallance, the governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser, also welcomed the findings although he said that the drug, which only helps patients who are already severely ill, did not mean that other measures to reduce the spread of the disease were not needed. Johnson claimed he had only today become aware of Marcus Rashfordâ€™s campaign for school meal vouchers to be supplied in England over the summer. Asked about his U-turn on this, Johnson said: I talked to Marcus Rashford today to congratulate him on his campaigning, which to be honest I only became aware of very recently â€“ today. I thank him for what he has done. I think he is right to draw attention to this issue, and basically weâ€™ve got large numbers of kids who havenâ€™t been able to get back into school. This answer surprised journalists because Rashfordâ€™s open letter to MPs on school vouchers was running as a big story yesterday and Johnsonâ€™s spokesman told the lobby at lunchtime on Monday that the PM would be responding to it. Perhaps Johnson was not telling the truth at the press conference; that has certainly happened before. But it is also possible that he was genuinely unaware of this media story, despite what his spokesman said yesterday. Prime ministers are often less aware of the news than journalists assume. In an interview at the Tory conference in 2019 Johnson said he had never heard of BBC presenter Naga Munchetty, even though the row about her comment about Donald Trump had been in the headlines for days. Johnson said that as the number of coronavirus infections fell, there would be a â€œstrong caseâ€� for relaxing the 2-metre rule. He very much hoped to do that, he said. In response to a question from a member of the public asking for it to be replaced with a 1-metre rule, he said: Weâ€™re getting there ... I know people are very, very patient about this, weâ€™re making as much progress on that as we can. Watch this space, because we absolutely hear you. Johnson claimed the UK had turned the tide in the fight against coronavirus. Asked about his comment 12 weeks ago that after 12 weeks the UK would have turned the tide, Johnson said: We are now starting to see â€“ with drugs like dexamethasone and the idea that perhaps you could combine that with other things â€“ we are seeing the first chink of light, which I was perhaps a bit dubious about. We are seeing the first chink of light and the hope that there will be preparations, treatments â€“ there already are â€“ that could make a big difference to mortality rates, and we are making big investments in vaccines. None of that negates the importance of us continuing to follow the rules, control the virus and save lives â€“ we have turned the tide on it, we havenâ€™t yet, finally, defeated it. He also repeated an image he used as the pandemic was just taking hold, describing the need to flatten the curve of the disease as squashing the sombrero. My colleague Heather Stewart questions whether his tone was appropriate.
Johnson said the case for merging DfID with the FCO was so strong he was surprised it had not happened already. He said: This is a fantastic opportunity for this country to make the most of our enormous influence abroad and maximise the UKâ€™s projection by merging DfId and the FCO. Frankly, I think it is extraordinary we havenâ€™t done it earlier â€“ we have 28 out of 29 OECD countries doing it this way. It is far more coherent, it means that the sums that we spend on aid are used, not just to tackle poverty, deprivation around the world, but they are far better in line with UK government policy and the priorities of the British people. Iâ€™m absolutely certain it is the right thing for our country right now. Chris Deerin, a former comment editor at the Daily Telegraph who now runs the Reform Scotland thinktank, says this move may be only the start of Johnsonâ€™s reform of Whitehall institutions.
Johnson urged parents in England to send their children back to school if they were able to do so. It was safe, he said. He said his baby, Wilfred, and his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, were doing well. Johnson has said almost nothing in public about his baby. Other prime ministers have been happy to talk about their children but Johnson, whose private life is more complicated than most of his predecessorsâ€™, says as little as possible about them. Asked how the baby was doing, he said: I never normally comment about these sorts of things but itâ€™s all fine so far ... All doing well."
2020-06-16T18:35:47Z,politics,Politics,Three ex-PMs attack plan to merge DfID with Foreign Office,"The prime minister has been accused of jeopardising Britain’s standing in the world after he announced the Department for International Development (DfID) is to be folded back into the Foreign Office after more than 20 years of independent existence. Boris Johnson said he would create a new “super-department” called the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, provoking a storm of criticism from anti-poverty campaigners and three former prime ministers. Announcing the departmental move in the House of Commons, Johnson said the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, would in future make the final decision about which countries should receive help. “For too long, frankly, UK overseas aid has been treated like a giant cashpoint in the sky, that arrives without any reference to UK interests,” the prime minister said. David Cameron, Gordon Brown and Tony Blair all condemned the shake-up, with Cameron saying it would mean “less respect for the UK overseas”. The government is to maintain its statutory commitment to spending 0.7% of gross national income on overseas aid, but the blending of the two departments will inevitably require greater linkage between the UK’s aid, security and commercial interests. Johnson justified the decision, saying: “DfID outspends the Foreign Office more than four times over and yet no single decision-maker in either department is able to unite our efforts or take a comprehensive overview.” He added: “We give as much aid to Zambia as we do to Ukraine, though the latter is vital for European security. We give 10 times as much aid to Tanzania as we do to the six countries of the western Balkans, who are acutely vulnerable to Russian meddling.” Oxfam GB’s chief executive, Danny Sriskandarajah, called that comparison a “brazen challenge to the aid sector”. pointing out that more than half of Zambians live on less than $1.90 a day, while extreme poverty in Ukraine is near zero. “Effectively what he’s saying is, we’re going to use our aid budget to pursue security and diplomatic aims. Those are noble aims, but that’s not what aid is for,” he said. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, responding to Johnson’s statement, described the move as “the tactics of pure distraction” from the country’s soaring unemployment and one of the highest Covid-19 death rates in the world. “Abolishing DfID diminishes Britain’s place in the world,” he said. “There is no rationale for making this statement today. The prime minister should stop these distractions, and get on with the job of tackling the health and economic crisis we currently face.” Gordon Brown, who championed debt relief and increased aid spending as prime minister, described the decision as sad, while Tony Blair said he was “utterly dismayed”. DfID’s £15.2bn budget dwarfs that of the Foreign Office, and diplomats have jealously eyed the scale of the guaranteed DfID spending ever since the two departments were split by the Labour government in 1997. The new department is expected to be formed in the autumn, before the government has completed its integrated foreign and defence security review, which is being carried out by the academic and Downing Street adviser John Bew. DfID was already braced for a sharp cut in its budget with the economy hit hard by the coronavirus crisis. Research carried out by the House of Commons library for the Liberal Democrat leadership contender Layla Moran shows that if the economy shrinks by 13%, as predicted by the Independent Office for Budget Responsibility, the government could cut the aid budget by £2.5bn and still fulfil its legal duty to spend 0.7% of GNP. It is unclear if Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the international development secretary, will retain a cabinet post after the autumn. Patrick Watt, Christian Aid’s director of policy, public affairs and campaigns, called the decision “an act of political vandalism”, saying it “threatens a double whammy to people in poverty, and to our standing in the world”. The timing of the merger, long favoured by Johnson and his key aide, Dominic Cummings, was justified by the government on the grounds that the UK needed to be “match fit” for major international events starting this autumn, including the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, and Britain’s hosting next year of the UN climate change conference. Officials said the new department would be more joined up, focused and coherent.But that rationale was questioned by development experts. Kevin Watkins, the chief executive of Save the Children UK, said: “A prime minister can require that government departments talk to each other. A prime minister can set up coordinating mechanisms to ensure that that happens. What this is about is a shift in priorities. “Merging DfID, the world’s leading aid agency, into the Foreign Office in the midst of a pandemic that threatens to reverse hard-won gains in child survival, nutrition and poverty is reckless, irresponsible and a dereliction of UK leadership.” In practice, the Foreign Office has been slowly taking control of the aid budget, either by directly spending more of its cash, or in-country diplomats being put in charge of the budget. In 2019, for example, the Foreign Office spent £680m of the overseas aid budget – more than double the £300m it spent in 2013 and equivalent to 40% of the FCO’s core departmental allocation of £1.7bn in 2018–19. As part of the last reshuffle, the Foreign Office and aid department ministers were required to work in both departments. The new department will have only one permanent secretary, and no redundancies are expected."
2020-06-16T18:08:43Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel linked with monument protection campaign organiser,"A charity chief executive linked to the home secretary, Priti Patel, is one of the organisers of a campaign mobilising counter-protests across the UK under the banner of protecting monuments during Black Lives Matter protests. Philip Smith, a former Conservative local election candidate and a senior youth-wing official who runs a charity developing links with Britain’s overseas territories, is one of a team of administrators for the UK Cenotaph and Military Memorial Volunteers group. It has attracted more than 40,000 members on Facebook since 4 June, and despite being set up with the stated aim of protecting monuments, explicitly racist language has gone unchecked on the Facebook page and some of the other administrators have expressed support for Ukip and anti-Islam web pages. Smith said the moderation team had been “overwhelmed” by the number of posts. Posts on the Facebook page included one stating: “There is no black in the union jack”, and another claiming a race war was imminent. Some posts, including discussing destroying mosques, had been deleted by either a group or a Facebook administrator but the users had been allowed to remain as active members. The group promoted a gathering at the Cenotaph in London at the weekend despite the authorities urging people not to come to the city to protest. Until approached by the Guardian, members of the Facebook group included Boris Johnson’s Downing Street videographer, Robert Midgley, who initially said he was unaware of it until shown a screenshot.
He then checked his Facebook account and said he had left the group, adding: “I was led to believe this group was a moderate group for looking after the Cenotaph. I have now left the group to avoid any confusion over controversial associations.” Smith has stood for the Conservatives in a number elections, and in 2013 founded the Friends of the British Overseas Territories (Fotbot), a charity whose work has been endorsed by Patel. She has been pictured alongside Smith and Fotbot’s “parliamentary adviser”, the Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell.
Smith told the Guardian: “I should make clear that we are not associated with any other group and are completely apolitical. We are a group of moderate members of the public who are concerned about public property and care for our memorials. “The team has been overwhelmed with thousands of posts every day and we are working hard to keep posting within the rules of the group (these are clearly stated in our ‘about’ section),” he said, adding that he became involved with the group several days after it was founded. He said users who had posted racist messages flagged by the Guardian had been removed and asked that any other members posting inappropriate content be reported. “We deplore the comments you highlighted and are continuing to work to remove such vile posts from a small minority that most likely joined before the group became professionally managed.” However, Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate and member of the commission for countering extremism’s pilot taskforce steering committee, said: “This Facebook group is being used by some users to preach grossly offensive hateful extremism. Regardless of the intentions of the organisers, if they are promoting real world protests and have attracted elements who are spewing racial hated then it’s a threat to public order.” A Home Office Spokesperson said: “Ministers have no power to initiate a ban on marches or a static demonstration – this is an operational matter for the police. “The home secretary has, along with other government ministers, made repeatedly clear in interviews, in parliament, on social media and directly to the police that these protests are illegal and put public health at risk. “She continues to urge the public in the strongest terms not to attend protests or gatherings.” • This article was amended on 8 July 2020 to emphasise further that Philip Smith was one of a team of administrators for the Facebook page."
2020-06-16T17:40:12Z,politics,Politics,"Failure of Brexit talks could lead to terrorism intelligence delays, say Lords","The UK risks losing its real-time access to a watchlist of suspected terrorists if it does not strike a comprehensive Brexit deal on justice and security, peers have been told. The concerns of the policing consequences of a collapse in Brexit talks were raised by members of the Lords EU security and justice sub-committee during questioning of the Home Office minister James Brokenshire. Fears were also raised over the future of the European arrest warrant (EAW) system and the prospect of the UK becoming a haven for foreign criminals trying to evade justice from EU member states. The Labour peer Lord Rowlands described the situation prior to the EAW system as “hopeless” as it allowed fugitives to roam freely in countries without extradition treaties. “I hope we will agree that we want to avoid going back to the old system, because it did allow criminal havens; [with] those characters who lived on the Spanish Costa del Sol immune from any formal proceedings. I’m hoping you are not suggesting that we might have to go back to that, are you?” said Rowlands. His concerns came as an ally of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the MEP Nathalie Loiseau, warned that a crash out from the EU without a deal would mean weaker ties on security.
Brokenshire said he was optimistic the intensified programme of negotiations scheduled for July and August would deliver a result for both sides. He was confident sense would prevail as there would be “a mutual loss of capability” in tackling crime and security if negotiations collapsed. Deal or no deal, the UK “will continue to be a global leader of security and one of the safest countries in the world” with access to Interpol and bilateral intelligence channels, he said. Peers shared his hopes about security but questioned how the UK would fare if it lost its access to real-time information from EU databases. Lord Anderson pointed out police in Dover could currently use handheld devices to get real-time information on passengers from the Schengen Information System (SIS II) database allowing suspects to be “questioned before they could simply melt away”. “It rather sounds as though the legalistic approach that’s being taken to SIS II [in Brexit talks] means that we’re not going to have real-time access to data,” said Anderson, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation in the UK between 2011 and 2017. Brokenshire rejected those concerns, pointing out that the UK had only joined SIS II in 2015 and Ireland was not a member of SIS II, suggesting it was possible to run counter-terror operations without access to the Schengen databases. “I remain optimistic as to what the negotiations in the coming weeks may bring because of, I think, that sense of shared endeavour,” Brokenshire said, adding that the published approach of the UK supported the “national interest and equally supports those broader interests for the EU security too”. British police and border guards were the third heaviest users of the database, accessing it 603m time a year, the committee heard. Lord Ricketts, a former diplomat and the chair of the committee, questioned the “coherence” of the UK’s Brexit approach. It was looking for a Canada-style agreement in trade but a specially close arrangement in security and justice, “an equivalent position to that which perhaps Schengen countries have, or EEA countries have like Norway, Iceland but no other country”, he said."
2020-06-16T17:25:06Z,politics,Politics,Air Force One for Boris? RAF plane for VIPs gets a union flag makeover,"The RAF VIP plane used by Boris Johnson and senior members of the government to travel around the world is to have its grey livery repainted red white and blue in a makeover estimated to cost more than six figures. The union flag-inspired paint job for the Voyager aircraft comes two years after the prime minister complained about the dullness of its former colour. When foreign secretary, Johnson said: “What I will say about the Voyager, I think it’s great, but it seems to be very difficult to get hold of,” before adding: “And also, why does it have to be grey?” Downing Street confirmed that a Johnson-inspired makeover was under way, while defence sources added that the plane is being repainted at a specialist secure hangar run by Marshall Aerospace near Cambridge. David Cameron commissioned a £10m refit of the rented aircraft – dubbed “Cam Force One” – when he was prime minister but to reduce costs and deflect public criticism the plane was intended to have a dual civilian and military use. But repainting it in the colours of the national flag suggests that it will be increasingly used for globe trotting by Johnson during the rest of his time as prime minister. Andy Netherwood, a former RAF pilot and defence commentator, said: “The issue is project creep. If it really is an all-over shiny paint scheme then it’s starting to look – operationally and politically – much more like Air Force One for Boris.” Currently the Voyager also provides air-to-air refuelling for other RAF planes when it is not being used by the prime minister, other senior ministers or members of the royal family, particularly for trips outside Europe. It is based on an Airbus A330 with a first class cabin for the prime minister or leading VIP on the flight, with club class seating for business delegates and conventional economy class seating at the rear, used typically by press. Tony Blair had planned to buy a plane towards the end of his time as prime minister, but the plans were scrapped by Gordon Brown in 2008 to save money. Ministers took scheduled flights or chartered planes if they wanted to take along a large delegation. The scheme was revived by Cameron, although by the time he was first able to use the plane in July 2016, the prime minister was on his way out of a job as a couple of weeks before he had been defeated in the Brexit referendum and resigned. A spokesman for the Royal Air Force said: “An RAF Voyager is currently in Cambridgeshire for pre-planned works.” • This article was amended on 17 June 2020 to change a reference from “Union Jack” to union flag, and clarify that the £10m spent on the aircraft under David Cameron’s administration was for a refit, not the cost of the plane itself."
2020-06-16T16:51:14Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson handing the Foreign Office control of the aid budget signals a change of priorities,"Tony Blair used to have a line in his speeches to the effect “every Labour government has created a department for international development, and every Tory government has got rid of it”. It has taken a while for this Conservative government to fulfil this historic mission. David Cameron saw the preservation of the department, and the commitment to spend on 0.7% on aid as central to giving the Conservatives a modernising message. He often cowered in front of the Daily Mail, but not on the issue of aid, and its contribution to Britain’s reputation. On Tuesday he took the unusual step of branding the merger as a mistake. Theresa May preferred to nibble away at the aid budget, handing tranches to other Whitehall departments. By 2019, the Foreign Office spent £680m on aid, more than double the £300m it spent in 2013 and equivalent to 40% of core departmental allocation of £1.7bn. Priti Patel, the international development secretary until her defenestration in 2017 for running her own Middle East policy, also probed her room for manoeuvre through changing the OECD’s definition of aid. But Boris Johnson, as a former foreign secretary, has always resented the independent aid budget. He wanted to bite the bullet, and was helped in his aim by the Foreign Office minister, Rory Stewart, who felt the DfiD mindset was opposed to seeing the UK foreign policy stance as a whole, and instead focused exclusively on poverty reduction in the world’s poorest countries. Stewart recalled as a joint minister in both departments the battles he faced in the Foreign Office to get a £200,000 cheque cleared while in international development he could add a couple of digits, and few objected. At first it looked as if Johnson as prime minister would follow May and merge the departments through stealth, or at least wait to wrap up the change as the centrepiece of the defence and security review due initially to be completed in the autumn. Instead he plumped for joint FCO and DfID ministers – meaning the two departments had one joint ministerial team, but two very different-sized budgets. They also had two permanent secretaries, leading the head of the diplomatic service, Sir Simon McDonald, to say euphemistically: “They were working through the consequences of closer alignment.” But Johnson, backed by the Great Disruptor Dominic Cummings, chose the coronavirus outbreak as a surprising moment to strike, and Cummings kept the plan unbriefed and unknown to all but a few. At one level the timing was propitious. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the new secretary of state for international development carried little clout across Whitehall. Johnson also came to the view that Downing Street was held back by unnecessary duplication in the Whitehall machinery. His aides said he decided what he wanted to do and delay served no purpose. The complaints of the well-organised aid lobby – also disliked by Cummings – would be submerged in the coronavirus crisis.
The counter-argument is twofold. Coronavirus is creating an international humanitarian emergency, and civil servants could do without a four-month bureaucratic reorganisation. Equally, there seems little point holding a foreign and defence review when the likely main conclusion has now been reached. Johnson has tried to reassure anti-poverty campaigners that the commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP in aid remains in law. But within that budget – bound to collapse in real terms due to the fall in GDP – Johnson has a great deal of room for manoeuvre. If the future budget decision maker is not a development project specialist, different programmes will find favour. “The ghost of the Pergau Dam disaster still hangs over UK aid,” said one aid specialist, referring to Margaret Thatcher’s decision to grant Malaysia £234m aid in return for an arms deal. It took until 1994 for the contract to be declared unlawful by the high court. UK state aid can quite rapidly become the gift that opens the door for UK plc to gain lucrative contracts with foreign leaders. The blurring of the two will be made easier as Johnson has decided the UK’s trade representatives will leave the Department for Business and work in the Foreign Office. Some say this is a fantasy and the Department for International Development will carry on largely as before within the Foreign Office. Mergers are common abroad. But there is no need to look into the crystal ball when you can read the book. The Foreign Office already has a slice of the aid budget, and spends it less transparently and less efficiently, all independent analysis commissioned by the government shows. Only this week the international development select committee reported UK aid not administered by the Department for International Development “has a very different geographical profile, with around three quarters going to middle-income countries, including China, India and South Africa, pursuing priorities such as reducing carbon emissions, tackling insecurity, building research partnerships and promoting trade and investment ties with the UK”. Many Conservatives predict disaster, notably Andrew Mitchell, the former secretary of state for international development. “If you fold it into the Foreign Office, all the brilliant people who have given DfID its reputation around the world as the prime example of global Britain, in terms of British influence and effectiveness, will leave. They’ll all go and work in the international system. “We will at a stroke have collapsed the pre-eminent and most respected engine of international development in the world.”"
2020-06-15T20:35:14Z,politics,Politics,Robert Jenrick: why are there calls for inquiry into minister?,"Why is the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, at the centre of controversy over a building development in London? Jenrick knew that billionaire former media tycoon Richard Desmond had only 24 hours to have an east London property development approved before council community charges were imposed that would have cost him more than £40m. He and his government department initially backed Desmond’s plan to construct 1,524 apartments on the site. The minister later accepted that his approval in January of Desmond’s project on the old Westferry Road printworks on the Isle of Dogs was unlawful.
What was the £40m charge that Desmond could have avoided for? The council area where the proposed property development was to be sited is in the poorest borough of London – Tower Hamlets. The £40m charge is part of the local council’s community infrastructure levy (CIL). This is a local “tax” on residential and business property developments in Tower Hamlets that the council then uses to reinvest in poorer communities in areas such as health clinics and educational facilities. Why did Jenrick reverse his original decision on Desmond’s Isle of Dogs development? The housing secretary admitted that any “fair-minded and informed observer” could conclude there was a “real possibility of bias”, although he insisted he was not actually biased in favour of Desmond’s project. He then quashed his original decision and has now handed over the final say on whether the project will go ahead to another minister. However, the Labour mayor of Tower Hamlets and others including an ex-Tory councillor believe he did this to avoid having to release crucial documents relating to his original decision. Mayor John Biggs remarked that Jenrick’s “reluctance to disclose them speaks volumes”. Why has the Labour party called for an inquiry into the affair? Richard Desmond, the former owner of the Daily and Sunday Express alongside the Star titles, has donated thousands of pounds to the Conservative party. Desmond paid £12,000 to attend a Tory Carlton Club fundraising dinner last November at which he and other property developers sat with Jenrick. There are also allegations that Jenrick gave a “behind closed doors” briefing on government plans for the property sector at an event hosted by a PR firm that had acted for Desmond on the controversial Isle of Dogs site. Given his financial support for the Tories, Labour says there are “cash-for-favours concerns” that must be investigated.
Will there be any lasting damage to the housing secretary or the Conservative party? One long-serving Conservative councillor in Tower Hamlets, Andrew Wood, has already resigned from the Tories in protest over the affair and has called on MPs in parliament’s housing select committee to launch an investigation. Downing Street says Boris Johnson has “full confidence” in Jenrick. A Tory party spokesperson insisted this weekend that “government policy is in no way influenced by party donations – they are entirely separate”. However, the controversy has raised suspicions once again over the links between big business and the party, which enjoys the largesse of multi-millionaires and billionaires such as Desmond. Nor is the affair likely to fade away in the foreseeable future. The Liberal Democrats have raised questions in parliament about whether the housing secretary has broken the ministerial code. The code is a set of rules and guidelines to uphold proper standards of conduct amongst ministers. The code instructs all ministers to “declare and resolve any interests and relationships” and “take decisions impartially, fairly and on merit, using the best evidence and without discrimination or bias”."
2020-06-15T20:12:36Z,politics,Politics,Priti looks vacant as Tories take a stand for the statues «,"You could feel Boris Johnson’s pain. There was a time when he could make a quick £5,000 for knocking out barely considered articles for the Daily Telegraph. But now he’s prime minister he’s rather obliged to bash them out for free. The only good news for him is that his pieces are kept behind a paywall, so the vast majority of the country can easily manage to avoid them and don’t get to find out just how incoherent they are. While rightwing extremists were making Nazi salutes and causing aggro with the police, and a man was caught pissing next to a memorial to terrorism victim PC Keith Palmer, Boris was more interested in fighting last week’s battle over statues. Count on me, he promised. He wasn’t going to allow anyone to take down a statue of Winston Churchill. Not least because almost no one had called on him to do so. Nor was he going to allow anyone to Photoshop British history. Quite apart from a staggering inability to understand the difference between eradicating the difficult and complicated nature of the country’s past and actively memorialising and celebrating it, this was quite some cheek. Because few politicians have done more to Photoshop their own past than Boris. The lies, the deceit and the lack of morality that have been the bedrock of both his personal and professional life are all expected to be forgotten on a daily basis. After all, if he can find it so easy to forgive himself why shouldn’t everyone else? So it was left to Priti Patel to comment on last weekend’s violent protests in London in a ministerial statement to the Commons. And to begin with she didn’t do too badly. The home secretary is clearly a lot more comfortable in condemning violence from leftwing and Black Lives Matter activists, but she somehow managed to get through her opening remarks without saying that the rightwing racists were due a little leeway to let off steam after being provoked by the demonstrations of the previous weekend, which had seen some violence against police and statues being torn down and defaced. The desire to make the link was clearly there but somehow she managed to restrain herself. Credit where credit is due. Labour’s Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, initially appeared to endorse Patel’s comments. He deplored the actions of the demonstrators, praised the police and more or less backed her demands for 10-year jail sentences for anyone defacing public monuments. Only in the UK could you expect to get banged up longer for public disorder offences than rape. But then just as it looked as if he was going to try to outcompete the Tories in the “lock ’em up” stakes, Thomas-Symonds started to twist the knife. The BLM demonstrations had been of a different category to Saturday’s racist protests. While violence on both sides could not be condoned, there had been a moral purpose to BLM. Longstanding injustices and inequalities that had been consistently ignored. So how was it that in the prime minister’s 1,000-word defence of the statue of Winston Churchill, he had only managed to squeeze in a couple of sentences as an afterthought about his plans to establish a new Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, while saying it was about time black people stopped playing the victim card? Besides, hadn’t there already been enough reports into racial inequality and wouldn’t the government be a lot better off implementing some of their recommendations instead? Patel was genuinely outraged. At times like this, her innate hopelessness is her saving grace as she doesn’t have to go through the bother of even feigning stupidity. Black lives mattered so much that it would be entirely wrong for the prime minister to implement the recommendations of previous reports without wasting time on setting up an entirely pointless new commission that was almost certain to come to exactly the same conclusions as before. If you read the Macpherson, Lammy and Williams reports carefully, you would know that their overarching subtext was that what black and minority ethnic people wanted more than anything was for nothing to change until the government had checked whether the recommendations could be recommended. Equality was far too important a subject for change to be introduced at anything but glacial pace. A few Tories tried to bring the debate back to what they believed to be the key topics. The desecration of statues and the racist abuse that they had received for daring to criticise the violence against the police at the BLM demonstrations. Patel was suitably grateful for the breather. But there was no respite from opposition MPs. Yes, they could all agree violence was bad but could we move back to the real issues of inequality? Priti just looked Priti Vacant. She seemed genuinely surprised to learn that there were so many Windrush cases still unresolved and no one had told her there were recommendations about the effect of the coronavirus on BAME communities that had yet to be published. There again, she hadn’t asked. After all, she was only the home secretary."
2020-06-15T19:07:20Z,politics,Politics,Permanent secretaries 'not aware of any economic planning for a pandemic',"Two of the government’s most powerful civil servants have said they were not aware of any attempt to make economic preparations for a possible global pandemic in the years leading up to the coronavirus outbreak. Sir Tom Scholar and Alex Chisholm, the permanent secretaries in the Treasury and the Cabinet Office respectively, confirmed that although the government simulated an international flu outbreak in 2016, Whitehall did not devise a plan for dealing with the consequences for the economy. Instead, Scholar told MPs, civil servants devised schemes to help businesses “as they went along”. The disclosure, made before the public accounts committee, prompted its chair, Labour’s Meg Hillier, to say she was “dumbstruck”.
Scholar and Chisholm appeared before the committee on Monday to answer questions about the government’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak. The Conservative MP James Wild asked them whether they were aware of an economic plan equivalent to Exercise Cygnus, the 2016 simulation that involved 950 emergency planning officials. Scholar, who joined the Treasury in 1992, replied: “We developed our economic response in the weeks leading up to the budget. I don’t know to what extent the Treasury was involved in that exercise.” Referring to the schemes devised to help businesses during the pandemic, Scholar added: “We didn’t have these schemes ready and designed and ready to go. We have been designing them as we have gone along.” Wild then asked why a blueprint was not drawn up for business grants. The MP said: “We had the original interrupted loan scheme and then the bounceback loans … Wouldn’t we have been better served if we had prepared in 2016? We had a big exercise in 2016 on a possible global pandemic and health crisis, but there was no work done off the back of that to prepare our economic response? Is that the case?”
Chisholm, who was the permanent secretary to the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy four years ago, replied: “I think, like Tom, I am not aware of any direct action that was taken on the economic side.” Hillier replied: “That is extraordinary – I am quite dumbstruck by that.” The Cygnus simulation took place over three days in October 2016 and asked participants to imagine that they were fighting a fictitious “worst-case scenario” flu pandemic affecting up to 50% of the population and causing up to 400,000 excess deaths. For the three days of the exercise, officials from across government were told to imagine they were managing the seventh week of the pandemic, facing a peak in demand for hospital and social care. Whitehall sources said that the scenario did involve some Treasury officials, but the economic fallout was not “war-gamed” to the same extent. The government has mounted one of the most aggressive economic responses to the Covid-19 pandemic in the world. One of the first programmes announced was the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS). Under the scheme, the government agreed to stand behind 80% of loans made to small and medium-sized businesses by banks. Companies can borrow up to £5m.
Ministers later launched the coronavirus large business interruption loan scheme (CLBILS), under which companies with a turnover of more than £45m can borrow up to £200m. The most popular loan programme so far has been the bounceback scheme, which was launched last month. At the end of the meeting, Hillier asked Chisholm to write to the committee explaining why the government had not drawn up plans in keeping with other Whitehall departments. “Could you do us a follow-up note on the lack of economic planning for the pandemic?” she said. Chisholm confirmed that he would."
2020-06-15T17:54:01Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Dominic Raab drops fresh hint 2-metre rule could be relaxed – as it happened,"There have been a further 38 deaths from coronavirus in the UK, according to the latest figures from the Department of Health and Social Care, taking the total to 41,736. Senior Tory MPs have publicly urged Boris Johnson to cut the 2 metre distancing rule in England with immediate effect, in interventions underling the scale of discontent about the issue in his party. Pubs, restaurants and hairdressers across the country have been slated to reopen on 4 July, but they do not yet know whether they will have to abide by the 2 metre rule at all times â€“ something many say would mean they will not be viable businesses. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab told the daily Downing Street press conference that there was nothing â€œmagicâ€� about the two-metre rule, in comments likely to be seen as hint that the regulation could be relaxed soon. The shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, has condemned Boris Johnsonâ€™s plan for a government commission to examine racial inequalities as â€œwritten on the back of a fag packetâ€� and intended as a distraction from the governmentâ€™s lack of action over the issue. Lammy accused the prime minister of primarily seeking a culture war by announcing the plan in a comment piece for the Daily Telegraph, which was devoted mainly to reiterating his opposition to removing statues of historical figures. Boris Johnson has received a boost to plans to secure a trade deal with the European Union by the end of the summer after EU leaders agreed to strive to find early common ground on trade and security to avoid unnecessary economic chaos next year. But there were immediate signs of tensions on the horizon with the president of the EU council, Charles Michel, warning in tweets that the EU would not accept a â€œpig in the pokeâ€� and it would â€œnever accept an agreement that goes against interests of the unionâ€�. Long queues of shoppers formed outside some stores around England on the first day that non-essential shops were allowed to reopen for business since the coronavirus lockdown was imposed. Figures showed that between 8am and midday footfall on Englandâ€™s high streets was up by 51.7% on last Monday, while across all retail destinations there were 41.7% more shoppers as shopping centres saw a smaller rise. Thatâ€™s it from us for today. Thanks for reading."
2020-06-15T17:29:01Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson: no reason why Brexit deal cannot be sealed in July,"Boris Johnson has said there is no reason why the outline of a Brexit deal cannot be sealed by the end of July, after he asked EU leaders at a video summit to â€œput a tiger in the tankâ€� of stalled talks. In a boost for the prime ministerâ€™s plans to secure a deal by the end of the summer, the EU leaders agreed to strive to find early common ground on trade and security to avoid unnecessary economic chaos next year. However, there were immediate signs of tensions on the horizon, with the president of the EU council, Charles Michel, tweeting afterwards that he would accept a â€œtiger in the tankâ€�, but that the EU would not agree to a â€œpig in the pokeâ€� and never accept an agreement that went against the interests of the union.
As well as Michel, the EU was represented at the hour-long video summit by Ursula von der Leyen and David Sassoli, presidents of the European commission and parliament respectively. Johnson was joined by the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, his chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, and the ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow. The prime minister later told reporters he was optimistic despite talks having stalled last week. â€œIt is very clear what we need to achieve. I donâ€™t think weâ€™re that far apart, but what we need is a bit of oomph in the negotiations, and I was pleased that Ursula von der Leyen [and other EU officials] all agree â€¦ There is no reason why we shouldnâ€™t get this done in July.â€� It is understood that the prime minister told the three EU leaders he was committed to the political declaration, after weeks of criticism from Brussels that he had turned away from the document that he signed last October.
While Johnson is looking for firm progress within weeks, the EU is more relaxed about striking a deal in the autumn. The EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said 31 October is the final deadline, and EU officials have said they will work to the last possible moment to reach a deal. After the video meeting, the mood among EU officials was upbeat, although serious differences remain between the two sides, especially over the â€œlevel playing fieldâ€� conditions attached to a free trade agreement, fisheries, police cooperation and governance of the future agreement. In a joint statement after the meeting, both sides acknowledged that talks had stalled after four rounds. But they added that they must move forward for the sakes of citizens on both sides. â€œThe parties agreed nevertheless that new momentum was required. They supported the plans agreed by chief negotiators to intensify the talks in July and to create the most conducive conditions for concluding and ratifying a deal before the end of 2020. This should include, if possible, finding an early understanding on the principles underlying any agreement,â€� they said. In the meeting, they also â€œunderlined their intention to work hard to deliver a relationship that would work in the interests of the citizens of the union and of the United Kingdomâ€�, an indication that both were still aiming for a comprehensive and ambitious deal. Johnson said the UK would continue to insist there was no role for the European court of justice, underlining assessments on both sides that finding a mutually agreeable international arbitration system remains one of the most difficult issues to resolve. After the meeting, Von der Leyen acknowledged that Gove had formally notified the EU at the joint committee meeting that the UK would not be seeking to extend the transition period. â€œWe noted the UKâ€™s decision not to extend the transition period and agreed to deliver the best deal for our citizens,â€� she tweeted.
After briefing the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, on the talks, Michel said the EU would hold firm on its interests. Johnson has an appointment with the French president on Thursday following Emmanuel Macronâ€™s meeting with Prince Charles to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Gen Charles de Gaulleâ€™s â€œappelâ€�, when the then leader of the free French forces took to the BBC to urge the French population to resist the German occupation. However, sources say Brexit will not be on the agenda. After the last round, the EUâ€™s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, accused the UK of trying to row back on all areas of the political declaration agreed in January while Britain accused him of acting as â€œthe refereeâ€� and â€œnot the playerâ€�. The UK claimed there was no hope of a deal unless the EUâ€™s political leaders gave fresh instructions to Barnier that would allow for compromise on key areas including fishing, governance, state aid, and level playing field issues. On Friday they agreed to intensify talks, with new negotiations scheduled for July, August and September. Five rounds of face-to-face meetings between officials alternating between London and Brussels have been pencilled in, with the last meeting on 17 August. EU sources pointed to the last-minute efforts that secured the withdrawal agreement and its ratification as evidence that there was time to find common ground on the most difficult subjects."
2020-06-15T17:23:54Z,politics,Politics,Labour demands Robert Jenrick disclose all contacts on Westferry,"Labour has demanded that the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, disclose all contacts he had with other ministers and officials before he overruled a planning decision, saving a property developer millions of pounds. Answering departmental questions in the Commons, Jenrick insisted he had behaved properly when he approved the construction of a residential development in east London by Richard Desmond, former owner of Express newspapers. Jenrick’s decision in January, which overruled the local council and the government’s planning inspectorate, came a day before the introduction of a community infrastructure levy (CIL), which would have cost Desmond’s company at least £40m, to be used for local education and health projects.
It later emerged that Jenrick had sat next to Desmond at a Conservative fundraising dinner in November, and that Desmond donated £12,000 to the party two weeks after the planning decision in his favour. Jenrick told MPs he was limited in what information he could disclose publicly, as the application for Westferry Printworks, a 1,500-apartment, 44-storey complex on a former printing plant, is live once again. After the local council, Tower Hamlets, sought a judicial review of Jenrick’s decision, he conceded the case, admitting that he had acted unlawfully. Quizzing Jenrick in the Commons, the shadow communities secretary, Steve Reed, castigated Jenrick for sending his deputy to answer an urgent question on the matter last week. He asked: “Given the gravity of the allegations surrounding his unlawful decision on the Westferry development, will he agree to make a full statement to the house, publish all correspondence, and disclose all conversations with other government ministers and officials relating to this case, to reassure the public that the integrity of the planning process cannot be auctioned off at Conservative party fundraising dinners?” Jenrick replied: “The application to which he refers was a highly contentious one – all the applications that come before the secretary of state are highly contentious. This one had been contested for many years. “I took that decision in good faith, with an open mind, and I’m confident that all the rules were followed in doing so.” On handing over information and details of contacts with other ministers, Jenrick said “all of the relevant information” on the matter had been handed to Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, and that he would ask his department’s most senior civil servant what else could be published. He added: “We want to ensure that the correct processes of the planning system are followed, so that means publishing documents while bearing in mind the legitimate interests of the parties to this case, which remains a live planning application.” Pressed further on the matter by Labour MP Liz Twist, Jenrick defended the fact that he took the decision on Desmond’s development even after sitting next to him at the fundraising dinner. “My department knew about my attendance at the event before I went to it,” he said. “They knew about the fact I had inadvertently sat next to the applicant – I didn’t know who I was going to be seated by until I sat at the table – and I discussed and took advice from my officials within the department at all times.” Desmond has not responded to previous requests for comment."
2020-06-15T16:53:01Z,politics,Politics,UK agrees to share suspects' DNA with EU crime-fighting system,"The UK government has dropped its opposition to sharing criminal suspects’ DNA data with EU law enforcement bodies, in a potential olive branch ahead of further talks on post-Brexit security. The U-turn was announced by the Home Office minister James Brokenshire in a statement to parliament on Monday, the day of an EU deadline for the government to reveal whether it intended to comply with European law. The decision is separate from negotiations on a future relationship with the EU, but could improve the mood of tense talks as the UK seeks a security deal that includes permanent exchange of DNA, fingerprint and other data. Under the former home secretary Theresa May, the UK opted into an EU crime-fighting system in 2015, in which member states exchange biometric data. In June 2019 the government began sharing DNA data of convicted criminals, but refused to share criminal suspects’ DNA. That exception has now been reversed. “It is the government’s intention to begin exchanging suspects’ data held in England, Wales and Northern Ireland with connected EU member states through Prüm,” Brokenshire said, a reference to the 2005 agreement named after the small German town where EU countries first agreed to exchange fingerprints, DNA and car number plates of criminals and suspects. Brokenshire said consultation would continue with the Scottish government, as policing is a devolved issue. The DNA exchange system enables British police to check the genetic code of EU criminals and suspects in 15 minutes, compared with 143 days through the Interpol process, the Home Office said in 2016. Interpol said its DNA database now has an automatic response time of 15 minutes. Civil liberties campaigners and some MPs had been concerned that safeguards on criminal suspects’ data were insufficient. Brokenshire said the government was satisfied with EU processes as extra safeguards had been put in place since 2015, including an independent oversight board and extra checks when minors were involved. “Ensuring continued adherence to the UK’s scientific standards means there is a one in a billion chance that a UK DNA sample would be falsely matched with an overseas criminal investigation,” he told parliament. The UK’s current participation in EU police data sharing ends on 31 December when the Brexit transition period expires. The EU has previously warned that opposition to sharing criminal suspects’ DNA would be an obstacle to a future deal. The government has said that since joining the DNA exchange system last July, about 12,000 “hits” related to UK investigations had come from EU member states, citing progress into an unsolved sexual assault case in Glasgow in 2012. A hit is an anonymised yes/no result of a DNA match. If there is a positive result, police forces can request personal information, such as name and date of birth. The UK has provided EU law enforcement officials with 41,000 hits."
2020-06-15T13:35:58Z,politics,Politics,"Johnson's racism inquiry plan 'written on back of fag packet', says Lammy","The shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, has condemned Boris Johnson’s plan for a government commission to examine racial inequalities as “written on the back of a fag packet” and intended as a distraction from the government’s lack of action over the issue. Lammy accused the prime minister of primarily seeking a culture war by announcing the plan in a comment piece for the Daily Telegraph, which was devoted mainly to reiterating his opposition to removing statues of historical figures. Johnson said he was “extremely dubious about the growing campaign to edit or Photoshop the entire cultural landscape”, writing that he would “resist with every breath in my body” any moves to remove Churchill’s statue from Parliament Square, an idea that has not been proposed.
In separate comments to broadcasters on Sunday, Johnson said the “cross-governmental commission” would look into discrimination against black, Asian and minority ethnic people in education, health and the criminal justice system. No 10 said later that commission members would be announced “in due course”, as would its remit. The report and recommendations will be submitted to Johnson by end of the year. Its scope will also cover issues beyond race, Johnson’s spokesman said: “It will look at wider inequalities, including issues faced by working-class white boys in schools, for example.” Lammy, who led a 2017 report on racial disparities in the criminal justice system, commissioned by David Cameron, said the announcement left him feeling “slightly weary”. “Black people aren’t playing victim, as Boris indicates, they’re protesting precisely because the time for review is over and the time for action is now,” Lammy told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I don’t know why he’s announced a commission behind a paywall in the Telegraph, buried in yet another article about Churchill. If he was serious, why are there no details about how it will be staffed, its remit, its terms of reference, its timetable? “That’s the question. It’s because this was written on the back of a fag packet yesterday, to assuage the Black Lives Matter protests. Get on with the action. Legislate. Move. You’re in government – do something.” He added: “I made 35 specific limit recommendations in the Lammy review. Implement them. There are 110 recommendations in the Angiolini review into deaths into police custody. Implement them. There are 30 recommendations in the Home Office review into the Windrush scandal. Implement them. There are 26 in Baroness McGregor-Smith’s review into workplace discrimination. Implement them. That’s what Boris has to do. And then the Black Lives Matter protests can stop and we can get on with dealing with coronavirus.” Lammy said he was baffled by the reference to Churchill’s statue, which was defaced by a handful of Black Lives Matters protesters. “The Labour party isn’t talking about statues. The Lib Dems aren’t calling for Winston Churchill’s statue to be removed, neither are the Greens. The only person that wants to focus on Winston Churchill’s statue is the Conservative party, and frankly it’s bizarre. They want a culture war because they want to distract from the central issue.”
The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said it hoped the initiative would deliver change, but said it was sceptical at the need for yet another inquiry. David Isaac, the EHRC chair, said: “We know the scale of the problems we face to tackle the entrenched racial inequality in our country. It is not new. There have been countless reports and the data exists exposing all the issues. Now is the time for urgent action.” Johnson’s spokesman rejected the charge that nothing had been done about previous reports, saying the Ministry of Justice had recently released an update on the Lammy review, detailing areas where its recommendations were being implemented, including a deferred prosecution system.
Johnson’s article for the Telegraph mentions the idea for the commission only in passing, in two paragraphs. The bulk of the piece is devoted to the prime minister’s views on statues and monuments, in the wake of the toppling of a statue of the slaver Edward Colston by protesters in Bristol, and the boarding up of Churchill’s before protests last Saturday. Johnson wrote that it was “the height of lunacy” to accuse Churchill of racism, adding: “He was a hero, and I expect I am not alone in saying that I will resist with every breath in my body any attempt to remove that statue from Parliament Square, and the sooner his protective shielding comes off the better.”"
2020-06-15T09:26:37Z,politics,Politics,"Coronavirus: more than a million left out of income support, say MPs","The Treasury should act to help more than a million people who have fallen through the cracks in the government’s Covid-19 income support schemes, according to a report by an influential group of MPs. The all-party Treasury select committee said large numbers of people are enduring financial hardship and are unable to benefit from the chancellor’s schemes for salaried employees and the self-employed. The committee said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, needed to make good on his promise to “do whatever it takes” to protect individuals and businesses from the impact of the pandemic. The MPs called on Sunak to address the gaps in his coronavirus job retention scheme (CJRS) and self-employment income support scheme (SEISS). Employers across Britain face a deadline this week to make job cuts, as the furlough scheme is gradually wound down from August. The MPs said they recognised that Sunak’s costly financial support packages had been welcome to many of those unable to work due to the lockdown of the economy, but found that “rolling out financial support at pace and scale has inevitably resulted in some hard edges in policy design and some critical gaps in provision”. The job retention scheme is designed to give employed workers 80% of their salaries up to a cap of £2,500-a-month if they are furloughed, while help for the self-employed is designed to pay 80% of their average monthly trading profits over the last three years. About 8.9m jobs have been furloughed at a cost of £19.6bn, and 2.6m claims costing £7.5bn had been made under the SEISS. The committee said five specific groups were being harshly treated: Those newly in employment. The MPs said hundreds of thousands of people were suffering financial hardship through no fault of their own, often due to unfortunate timing in starting a new job or their employer’s choice of timing in submitting paperwork to HMRC. They said the government should find a way to extend eligibility criteria to all new starters. Those newly self-employed. Many people who have started a business in the last year don’t qualify for support from the SEISS as they cannot fulfil the eligibility criteria. Self-employed people with annual trading profits in excess of £50,000. The committee said hundreds of thousands of people were potentially suffering hardship because of the arbitrary £50,000 cut-off for the SEISS. It said the government should remove the cap and allow those with profits just over this cap access to some financial support, up to £2,500 a month. Directors of limited companies who take a large part of their income in dividends. The committee said the government had failed to take action to help the hundreds of thousands of limited company directors missing out on support because they pay themselves in dividends, often on the advice of their accountants. The MPs said HMRC should request additional information about the proportion of dividends that had come from company profits and from other sources. Freelancers or those on short-term contracts. The committee said that in industries such as TV and theatre, where short-term PAYE contracts were the norm, many workers are not entitled to support under the CJRS or SEISS. Mel Stride, the chair of the treasury committee, said that overall Sunak had “acted at impressive scale and pace. However, the committee has identified well over a million people who – through no fault of their own – have lost livelihoods while being locked down and locked out of the main support programmes. “If it is to be fair and completely fulfil its promise of doing whatever it takes, the government should urgently enact our recommendations to help those who have fallen through the gaps.” The MPs said it was unfair that in one household, a self-employed single-parent earning just above the £50,000 cap received nothing while next door, a couple who were either both self-employed and earning profits below the cap, or salaried employees with full entitlement to CJRS, received up to £5,000 a month. The Treasury said: “Our wide-ranging support package is one of the most comprehensive in the world – with generous income support schemes, billions paid in loans and grants, tax deferrals and more than £6.5bn injected into the welfare safety net.
“All our support is targeted to make sure we use public funds responsibly, helping those who need it most as quickly as possible, while minimising fraud risk.” The committee’s report comes at a key moment for the furlough scheme as the Treasury prepares to scale back the support it provides from 80% to 60% of workers’ wages from the start of August. Firms will be expected to contribute 20% to continue furloughing their staff. Employers across the country face a crunch decision this week to either accept making contributions or to cut jobs if they are unable to do so. Firms looking to make more than 100 job cuts must run a 45-day consultation period, giving them a deadline of mid-June if they will be unable to top-up furloughed workers’ wages come August. A survey of 1,200 firms by banking industry body UK Finance found that seven in 10 UK businesses have been negatively impacted by the coronavirus crisis, and that one in five have less than one month worth of cash reserves left. Around 18% of firms warned they could cease trading altogether and may not survive the fallout from the pandemic. October is expected to mark the first big wave of company failures. That is when business loan repayment holidays – granted for up to six months – will come to an end, just as government support for employee wages through the coronavirus job retention scheme is expected to wind down."
2020-06-14T18:00:52Z,politics,Politics,Nazir Afzal joins legal fight for new inquiry into Dominic Cummings,"Nazir Afzal, a former regional chief prosecutor, has joined a legal campaign for a new investigation into Dominic Cummings over alleged breaches of the coronavirus lockdown rules. Afzal has urged his former employers at the Crown Prosecution Service, and the police, to pursue a case against the prime minister’s chief aide over his trips to Durham and Barnard Castle during the peak of the outbreak. Afzal warned that if they did not investigate he would consider launching a private prosecution on “behalf of every citizen whose goodwill and generosity led them to make painful sacrifices in order to comply with the law and protect their fellow citizens”. He has volunteered to become the figurehead of a group of “concerned citizens” who are raising funds for a legal campaign launched last week by lawyers with the backing of health workers and some families of coronavirus victims. Afzal’s older brother Umar died of coronavirus on 8 April while self-isolating at his home in Birmingham. At that time Cummings was recovering from a suspected case of the virus while staying at a family property in Durham. Cummings and his immediate family left their London home on 27 March just after his wife began displaying symptoms.
Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England, said: “There have to be consequences for [alleged] law-breaking otherwise the public lose confidence in those meant to enforce the law and lose trust in the law itself.” Explaining his decision to join the legal campaign, Afzal said he was troubled by the way Boris Johnson tried to defend the behaviour of his influential aide, after the Guardian and the Mirror revealed Cummings’ movements in the north-east. A three-day investigation by Durham police into Cummings’ travels found he probably breached health protection regulations when he took a 52-mile round trip to the town of Barnard Castle, County Durham, with his wife and son on her birthday. But the force decided to take no further action and made no finding in relation to “stay at home” government guidance over Cummings’ initial decision to leave London for Durham. Afzal said he had instructed Hodge Jones & Allen and the barrister Matthew Ryder, the lawyers behind the campaign to “get to the bottom of what happened and why”. He said he wanted to “better understand what the police in Durham and London knew and what drove the decision-making”. He said the Cummings affair exposed a power gap in society. “The big divide was never between leave and remain, nor black and white, nor men and women, nor north and south. It’s between those with power and those without. “So when I witnessed the prime minister and others wrapping a shield around Cummings I was horrified. I watched him get the privilege of a press conference in the garden at 10 Downing Street when any other civil servant … would be denied even the ability to issue a press release on pain of discipline or worse. “I read how he and his wife wrote about their experience of Covid-19 (one experienced by thousand of others including my late brother) without telling us that he had breached the regulations that were in place to protect every one of us, by taking the disease to Durham, at a time when London was drowning in Covid whilst the north-east wasn’t. Worse, he helped draft the regulations.” Mike Schwarz, a partner at Hodge Jones & Allen, said: “The Metropolitan police do not appear to have investigated properly, promptly or at all, serious allegations about Dominic Cummings’ behaviour in London and elsewhere. “The public’s continued sense of injustice, frustration and anger can only begin to be addressed if there is openness and rigour on the part of the police. Otherwise the perception remains and mounts that there is one rule for ordinary citizens and another for those in government.” Last week in a separate legal campaign, the director of public prosecutions, Max Hill, was threatened with a potential judicial review over the failure to investigate Cumming. Ryder is a member of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media Group."
2020-06-14T17:07:58Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: official death toll rises by 36 in lowest increase since lockdown began – as it happened,"Weâ€™re going to be closing down this live blog now. Thank you to all those whoâ€™ve read along or sent in tips and pointers, itâ€™s much appreciated. I hope youâ€™re all able to stay safe and well, wherever youâ€™re reading from. If youâ€™d like to continue with our live coronavirus coverage, you can head over to the global blog which will carry on bringing you breaking news on the pandemic from the UK, and around the world.
Before I go, hereâ€™s a quick summary of the key developments in the UK today: The UKâ€™s daily death toll is at its lowest since lockdown began, with 36 recorded deaths recorded yesterday. However, it is important to note that Sunday figures are often lower due to delays in reporting over the weekend. Chancellor Rishi Sunak suggested the government was keen to lower the 2m social distancing rules, and said it was a decision for ministers rather than scientists. Boris Johnson said that the lowering number of coronavirus cases gave a â€œmargin for manoeuvreâ€� on the regulations, and said the government was constantly reassessing the 2m regulations. However, after Sunakâ€™s interview made the headlines, he slightly changed the emphasis, insisting that any changes would be based on science, and saying he saw the â€œbenefitsâ€� of keeping the 2m rule in place. PM Boris Johnson and Labour leader Keir Starmer joined people across the UK marking the third anniversary of the Grenfell Tower Fire, in which 72 people died when the cladding on their building caught fire. Landmarks across London have been lit up in commemoration, and Johnson released a video message saying he was committed to discovering the cause of the fire and preventing it from happening again. Scuffles have broken out in Glasgow after demonstrators calling for the statue of Robert Peel, founder of the Metropolitan police, to remain in place, became violent with police. The protest came after plans were laid for a demonstration calling for the removal of the statue, but this was cancelled. However, skirmishes also broke out between the pro-Peel statue protesters and an unknown group, thought to oppose the statue. Schools in Scotland are likely to continue with a â€˜blended learningâ€™ approach from August until the end of the next academic year, with a mixture of at-home and in-school learning, the Scottish education secretary has said. 23 police officers were injured and 113 protesters arrested at a violent far-right gathering in London yesterday, Metropolitan police have said. The force also said they have arrested a man in connection to the photograph appearing to depict someone urinating on or next to the memorial to PC Keith Palmer, who was killed during a terrorist attack at Westminster. More than 6,000 people attended two illegal raves in Greater Manchester last night, in what the deputy mayor described as a â€œflagrant breach of the coronavirus legislationâ€�."
2020-06-14T07:37:39Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson has not hosted a Cobra emergency committee for over a month,"Downing Street has been warned against sidelining dissent in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, after complaints that Boris Johnson has not hosted a key planning meeting for more than a month. There has not been a gathering of the UK government’s emergency Cobra committee, including the leaders of the devolved nations and the London mayor Sadiq Khan, since 10 May. The last such meeting was held on the day Johnson controversially decided to change his government’s main coronavirus message to “stay alert”. It has led to concerns that No 10 has sidelined Cobra meetings after encountering resistance from his counterparts over the UK-wide response to the pandemic. In an interview with the Observer, the Welsh first minister, said that any attempt to sidestep difficult conversations about the handling of the pandemic would be short-sighted. “I don’t think there is anything wrong with challenging conversations, provided it is done in a constructive spirit,” he said.
“The decisions in some ways get trickier as they go along. Lifting lockdown is complex. The case for talking together regularly is actually greater as we all face these challenging decisions.” The concerns come amid accusations that Downing Street stopped England’s chief nurse from attending a daily Downing Street briefing on the coronavirus for refusing to back the lockdown actions of Dominic Cummings. The last Cobra meeting took place on 10 May, when the prime minister laid out his roadmap for dealing with the virus. He announced he was changing the overall advice from “stay at home” to “stay alert” – a move not followed by Scotland and Wales. Previous Cobra meetings have also seen leaders at odds over issues such as face coverings. The devolved nations have since taken slightly different approaches to easing lockdown measures.
Drakeford said that the Cobra system had become “ad hoc” and that an invitation to a meeting to review the progress of the pandemic had never materialised. He also warned that the lack of a regular meeting meant there was no “scaffolding you need to make a success of the United Kingdom”. “Up until the last decision point, we were all on a common, three-week decision-making cycle,” he said. “The pattern had been that each three-week cycle had culminated in a Cobra meeting where we understand one another’s decisions. I had simply assumed there would be one at the end of the last cycle, but it just never happened. There was no explanation. “It’s not that if Cobra doesn’t happen, nothing happens. But Cobra had become in this crisis the culminating point.”
Khan warned that sidelining the gatherings was a mistake. “Covid-19 is the biggest health and economic crisis we have faced since the second world war – so it is clearly a mistake for the government to exclude regional and devolved leaders from crucial decision-making meetings,” he said. “London, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have a combined population of close to 20 million people as well as control over vital services that need to be coordinated to tackle the virus. It is vital that we have a seat at the table where crucial matters are discussed.” A government spokesperson said the Cobra meeting was not the only forum for UK-wide discussions. “As we begin to roll out test and trace and implement a more targeted local approach to tackling coronavirus, it is crucial that we continue to work closely with the devolved administrations and local authorities,” they said. “The chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster has regular calls with the first ministers and the prime minister spoke to them at the end of last month. The prime minister also recently held a call with the M9 group of mayors. We continue to implement the roadmap laid out by the prime minister last month, when he held a Cobra attended by the devolved administrations.”"
2020-06-14T07:35:39Z,politics,Politics,"Riddle of Tory minister Jenrick, the media mogul and a £1bn housing development","Housing secretary Robert Jenrick gave a “behind closed doors” briefing on government plans to reform the property sector at an event hosted by the public affairs firm which acted for Richard Desmond on his controversial £1bn east London housing development. The revelation piles further pressure on the Conservative party over its links to the former media tycoon whose application to build more than 1,500 homes at the site of the former Westferry print works on the Isle of Dogs was approved by Jenrick. After Tower Hamlets launched legal action Jenrick consented to the court quashing the planning decision. The public affairs firm, Thorncliffe, which acted for Desmond’s Westferry Developments Limited, helping promote the project to local people and other interested parties, hosted the Jenrick briefing in early February – a month before the government published its planning white paper. According to a report in Property Week, Jenrick, at the “closed-door meeting”, discussed the government’s intentions to overhaul the property sector and provided examples such as making first-time buyers eligible “for around 30% market sale discounts”. A spokesman for Jenrick said the meeting was an official “stakeholder” event, and he had been accompanied by a private secretary, a senior civil servant.
Steve Reed, the shadow communities and local government secretary, called on Jenrick to explain his links with Thorncliffe. “These latest revelations demand urgent answers from the secretary of state and from No 10: we need to know how many times they met Thorncliffe, why Robert Jenrick gave them a behind-closed-doors briefing about the future of the planning system, and the full nature of their role in the Westferry Printworks proposal.” Thorncliffe, which describes itself as “political and community consultation experts”, hosted an event at the Carlton Club in May 2016 where Sir Eddie Lister, deputy mayor of London under Boris Johnson, and the man who approved Desmond’s original Westferry application, was the star draw. On its website, the firm describes Lister as “a great friend of Thorncliffe” who is “a great influence on Boris”. Last week the Times reported that Johnson had three meetings with Desmond in the months before Lister approved the original scheme. Westferry subsequently applied to double the number of apartments on the site from 722 to 1,524. This new application was publicly approved by Jenrick on 14 January, the day before a levy was introduced that would have resulted in Westferry paying an additional £40m to Tower Hamlets, London’s poorest borough. Last week, it emerged Desmond paid £12,000 to attend the Tory party’s Carlton Club fundraising dinner last November, at which he and others involved in the development sat on a table with Jenrick. A spokesman for the minister confirmed that the developers raised the application, but insisted that Jenrick refused to discuss it.
The spokesman told the Observer: “The secretary of state – like other cabinet ministers present – attended the dinner at the invitation of the Conservative party. There is therefore nothing to declare.” The ministerial code of conduct states: “If a minister meets an external organisation or individual and finds themselves discussing official business without an official present – for example at a social occasion – any significant content should be passed back to the department as soon as possible after the event.” The spokesman said: “I can confirm that the department was informed of the dinner. To suggest otherwise is factually incorrect.” However, a source close to the department claimed no record of Jenrick’s dinner with Desmond had been recorded in official documents relating to the Westferry application. Andrew Wood, a councillor in Tower Hamlets, who resigned from the Tory party over Jenrick’s decision, has called for the Cabinet Office and MPs on the housing select committee to launch investigations. He asked why Jenrick accepted Westferry’s proposal to reduce affordable housing on the site from 35% to 21%, and to ignore two planning experts who questioned the merits of the scheme which will now have to be redetermined. Richard Patient, managing director of Thorncliffe, declined to say how many times the secretary of state had met with the firm, and added that it had never undertaken political lobbying on behalf of Westferry Developments. Media representatives for Westferry did not respond to requests for a comment. • This article was amended on 19 June 2020. An earlier version said that Jenrick withdrew approval [in relation to Desmond’s planning application] after Tower Hamlets council launched legal action against the decision. To clarify: Jenrick consented to the court quashing the decision"
2020-06-14T07:09:38Z,politics,Politics,"After Covid, is it time for the UK to invest in its industry again?","Approaching the Jaguar Land Rover assembly works in Castle Bromwich, the eye is drawn to a 16 metre-high sculpture commemorating the wartime production of Spitfires. In the summer of 1940, this was the industrial site where the fighter planes which won the Battle of Britain were built. A couple of hundred yards down from “Spitfire Island”, a source of 21st-century manufacturing pride is on display. In the “electrification showroom”, a white, gleaming exemplar of Jaguar’s I-Pace series is accompanied by a piece of purple publicity prose: “Bold, brave and undeniably beautiful, the Jaguar I-Pace takes electric vehicle design into a new dimension.” There are no admiring visitors. JLR’s Castle Bromwich plant, like the rest of British industry, shut down at the end of March. Nearly three months later, the showroom is still closed; beyond it, the vast battleship-grey production blocks, which operate at the cutting edge of Britain’s green technology revolution, are silent. Of the company’s 38,000-strong British workforce, based primarily in the Midlands but also in Merseyside, 20,000 employees have been furloughed. Some plants have reopened with social distancing restrictions, but last week it was confirmed that Castle Bromwich will stay shuttered until at least 10 August. No one knows if and when production will properly resume, or when demand, which has fallen through the floor, will pick up. Other Midlands manufacturers, including Rolls-Royce in Derby, have already shed thousands of jobs. Meanwhile, JLR is accumulating debt at such a rate that it is seeking state aid worth at least £1bn from the Treasury. That might seem a great deal of money for the British government to hand a company which is a subsidiary of the Indian giant Tata Motors. On the other hand, as Des Quinn, a Midlands-based manufacturing specialist for the Unite union, points out: “It’s going to cost companies like this billions to invest in green and other future technologies. That’s going to be impossible in the context of Covid. Government is going to need to subsidise. Either it helps to finance business to get ahead in the green race … or it ends up paying people to be unemployed.” Jaguar Land Rover’s future will be just one high-profile test case as Boris Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, attempt to navigate their way through the economic wreckage left by the Covid-19 pandemic. The notion that the state should get its hands dirty in pursuing a proactive industrial policy – “picking winners” as it is sometimes disparagingly described – has been deeply unfashionable in Britain since Margaret Thatcher was in her pomp. But these are extraordinary times; Whitehall assumptions which have dominated policy for 40 years are beginning to look threadbare and dated.
On Monday, businesses in England will take some tentative steps towards post-lockdown recovery, as high street shops begin to reopen and attempt to bounce back amid the challenges of physical distancing. They do so in the shadow of the most intimidating set of economic numbers since the war. On Friday, the Office for National Statistics reported that the economy slumped by 20.4% in the lockdown month of April – the biggest drop since such figures were kept. The grim revelation followed a warning from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which predicted that by the end of the year the UK economy is likely to have contracted by 11.5% – a steeper plunge than any of its European neighbours. Unemployment in Britain, the OECD forecast, could be running at close to 12%, as the world endures “the most severe economic recession in a century”.
As private sector plans, projections and presumptions are ripped up and thrown in the bin, the strategic response by government in countries such as France and Germany has been swift. From both Paris and Berlin, the order has come to close ranks around sectors judged vital to the national interest. Along with a €130bn stimulus package announced last week, Angela Merkel has backed a €9bn bailout of Lufthansa. The state will take a 20% stake in the airline until at least 2023, as well as the power to block any hostile takeover attempt in a period of acute vulnerability. More money is available for similar deals in other sectors. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has authorised an €8bn aid package for the car industry, including Renault, in which the government already owns a 15% share. As economic wagons are circled, Macron’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has told employers that the state will stand by them, but on condition that vehicle production is gradually “repatriated” to French shores. Amid post-pandemic concerns over mountains of debt, economic security, the fragility of extended supply-chains and the geopolitical rise of China, the global economy appears to be entering a more cautious era. As societies accord a new priority to resilience against future shocks, the interventionist state, planning on their behalf, is making a comeback. In post-lockdown Britain, the political battle over what that might mean is just about to begin. The chancellor has already authorised the biggest programme of government subsidies seen in peacetime. On one estimate, almost £90bn worth of taxpayer money has been handed to businesses and employees through the job-retention scheme and various loan packages. Public borrowing, as a result, is at a record high. But eye-wateringly expensive as they were, these measures were conceived as a way of merely keeping businesses afloat during lockdown. The real test, as businesses reopen in a landscape transformed beyond recognition, is yet to come. Reacting to the latest cascade of dire statistics, the prime minister referred to the heavy cost of lockdown on an economy that has long been dominated by services. But in unprecedented times, can Britain continue to neglect what’s left of a manufacturing base that still plays a vital role in regions such as the Midlands?
Last month, details emerged of a Treasury plan to provide sustained state support for strategically key companies hit by the pandemic, whose collapse would “disproportionately harm the economy”. “Project Birch” could see the government extending long-term loans or taking equity in some of the biggest names in British business. As well as JLR, there has also been speculation that Virgin Atlantic, Rolls-Royce and Tata Steel may become beneficiaries of state intervention. For a Tory chancellor, such a move would certainly be bold. But according to Will Tanner, a former adviser to Theresa May and director of the centre-right Onward thinktank: “This government is more willing to consider taking a strategic role in industry than has been the case for many years.” Tanner points to the unsuccessful attempt to prop up Flybe, the regional airline that eventually collapsed at the beginning of March. “The action to support Flybe was overwhelmed by coronavirus,” he says. “But at the time it was significant. It showed a recognition of the value of the company in terms of regional connectivity. The truth is that a government will always be picking winners. It will always be deciding, according to some kind of method. You can’t avoid the political dimension. Taking decisions according to some notion of pure economic value was one reason for the levels of regional disparity that have emerged in our economy.” Nevertheless, Tanner does not believe that a Sunak-led programme of part-nationalisation is coming any time soon. “The first preference would be for a loan rather than taking equity in businesses. Government has not actually got a good track record at managing large shareholders and representing the interests of taxpayers.” Unsurprisingly, in Labour ranks, there is a desire for more ambition and daring. One of Sunak’s predecessors, Alistair Darling, recently told the Financial Times: “Taking equity might be a good thing for the taxpayer to do. If you’re lending money, say to an airline, it’s only right the taxpayer gets its fair share of the success at the end.” The shadow business secretary and former Labour leader, Ed Miliband, believes Project Birch could provide a crucial opportunity to act on lessons already learned during the Covid-19 crisis. “Government must do everything it can to help rescue companies in distress, but the idea that it should just be a kind of ambulance service and then get out of the way is very short-sighted. “Only in this country are we so blind to the advantages of a strategic industrial policy, in which the public and private sector collaborate together for the greater good. This crisis has shown us the mutual dependency of the public and the private. Industry agreed to shut down to protect public health. The state guaranteed to support industry while it did so. As we emerge, that relationship should continue to be fundamental to the recovery.” Going back to a hands-off approach would, Miliband says, be to return to a discredited way of doing economics. As in so many other dimensions, the coronavirus crisis has brutally exposed faultlines and weaknesses which were already there. “We know that we had big economic problems when it came to productivity levels, inequality and job insecurity. We know that the manufacturing sector suffered from a financial system that didn’t properly support it and that the economy was unbalanced, in favour of London and the south-east. Returning to the status quo isn’t what’s needed. We will only build the new economy we need with the state playing an active strategic role.” In Britain’s battered car industry, the need for strategic vision and a steady nerve has never been more pressing. The diesel crisis, Brexit and now the Covid shutdown have left an industry on its knees. “It’s been a perfect storm,” says David Bailey, professor of business economics at the Birmingham Business School. “Covid is probably the biggest challenge the car industry has ever had. Covid plus a no-deal Brexit – and the tariffs that would bring – would be a catastrophe. And in the next 10-15 years, as a result of green targets and automation, there are probably going to be more dramatic changes in the industry than happened over the past 100.” Bailey would be in favour of the state taking a stake in Jaguar Land Rover: “It would be good to have the government in there as a shareholder, providing finance, helping set long-term directions and keeping business in the UK. And it would lead to better communication and understanding about what the industry needs. For example, Britain has fallen badly behind in the battery manufacturing capacity that we need to compete with Germany and France in the electric-vehicle market.” What is required, he suggests, is a change of cultural mindset and a belated abandonment of prejudices going back to the 1970s and 1980s. “There is a future for manufacturing in western economies but here in Britain we developed a cultural problem over it. At the high point of globalisation the assumption became that it would just go elsewhere. It’s worth noting that the French government is more active in Renault and Peugeot than our government is. Or look at Lower Saxony in Germany, which has a stake in Volkswagen.”
There are good reasons why this government in particular may be receptive to such arguments. Boris Johnson’s majority following December’s election was built on gains in Labour heartlands, where many voters still depend on what remains of Britain’s industrial base. In May, a comparative study from the Centre for Economic and Business Research found that the east and West Midlands were suffering most from lockdown. From Coventry to Birmingham to Derby, more than 600,000 employees work in the region’s manufacturing sector, which in turn is heavily dependent on the car industry. The shutdown led to a drop in output of 40%, compared to 28% in London, where a far higher concentration of financial and professional services allowed more employees to work from home. Last month, local Conservative politicians, including Birmingham’s mayor, Andy Street, wrote to the business secretary, Alok Sharma. Their message was stark: post-Covid economic recovery in the region depended on “bold and decisive” support for key businesses such as JLR. “If the Conservatives are serious about holding on to the red wall seats they won,” says Bailey, “having a decent industrial policy would be one way to go about it.” In the British political imagination, the phrase “picking winners” still conjures up sepia images of the beleaguered 1970s governments of Edward Heath and Harold Wilson, sunk by the oil crisis and undone by unruly unions. Over past decades, this folk memory has been offered as a cautionary tale to politicians tempted to dabble in matters best left to the market. But the legend never told the full story of a turbulent period. If British Leyland, which then included Jaguar and Land Rover among its brands, had not been nationalised in 1975, it is doubtful whether a car industry would have survived in the United Kingdom. As the consequences of the oil shock buffeted western societies, the government acted as a necessary bulwark in dangerous times. Almost half a century later, in the context of a pandemic, economic chaos and an ongoing climate emergency, it may be time for the state to go back to the future. Europe’s rescue bids Germany The German government recently announced a €130bn stimulus package that includes a 3% VAT cut for all goods from 1 July until the end of the year and a payment of €300 to parents for every child. Direct spending and payments to households spread over the next two years amount to more than 3% of German GDP. Angela Merkel’s government has also taken a stake in Lufthansa and set up a €500bn rescue fund for stricken businesses. France French finance minister Bruno Le Maire has pledged to invest a total of €521bn into a post-Covid economic recovery programme, raising the national debt to 121% of GDP. President Emmanuel Macron has offered a state-backed credit facility of €5bn to Renault, in which the government holds a 15% stake. Car owners who scrap older vehicles in favour of more efficient models are entitled to a €5,000 rebate. A €1bn fund is being created to boost the car industry and accelerate the transition to electric and hybrid vehicles. Britain Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pushed back an emergency budget to the autumn, but is expected to give an economic update in July which could include interim measures to try to kickstart the economy. It is expected that the government will announce tax cuts, new spending on infrastructure and new investment green technology. Under the Project Birch scheme, the government will offer state support to key firms whose failure would have a “disproportionate” impact on the economy."
2020-06-14T06:07:37Z,politics,Politics,Poll: UK government losing public approval over handling of virus,"Less than a third of the public now approve of the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. The poll found that approval of the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis is down four points to a new low. Only three in 10 people approve, giving the government an overall approval rating of -18 for its handling of the pandemic.
However, the pollsters found that disapproval of the way Boris Johnson is acting as prime minister appears to have levelled off, with no significant increases in either approval or disapproval over the past three weeks. He has a net approval score of -6 points. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer’s approval ratings remain very high on +24, but have dropped four points since last week. Johnson still only has a one-point lead when voters are asked who makes the best prime minister – a historic low for him. After seeing their poll lead shrink 23 points in the previous eight weeks, the Conservatives saw a slight increase over Labour this week. Their share of the vote went up 43% to 44%, while Labour suffered its first dip since the second week of April, down one point to 39%.
There are also signs that Brexit is re-emerging as an issue occupying the minds of voters. While dropping from the most important issue because of the coronavirus crisis, Opinium found it is “slowly but surely making a comeback” and is now just five points away from being level with the economy in terms of importance to voters. Meanwhile, support is high for the government’s handling over the forcible removal of the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, with over half of UK adults saying they disapprove of the protestors who pulled it down. Approval for the protestors is highest in London, at 42%. Whilst 39% would have supported the removal of the statue of Colston by the local authority, 31% actively would have actively opposed this. Opinium polled 2,001 people online between 11 and 12 June."
2020-06-14T06:00:37Z,politics,Politics,The Lancet’s editor: ‘The UK's response to coronavirus is the greatest science policy failure for a generation’,"There is a school of thought that says now is not the time to criticise the government and its scientific advisers about the way they have handled the Covid-19 pandemic. Wait until all the facts are known and the crisis has subsided, goes this thinking, and then we can analyse the performance of those involved. It’s safe to say that Richard Horton, the editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet, is not part of this school. An outspoken critic of what he sees as the medical science establishment’s acquiescence to government, he has written a book that he calls a “reckoning” for the “missed opportunities and appalling misjudgments” here and abroad that have led to “the avoidable deaths of tens of thousands of citizens”. The Covid-19 Catastrophe: What’s Gone Wrong and How to Stop It Happening Again is a short polemical book, building on a series of excoriating columns Horton has written in the Lancet over the past few months. He lambasts the management of the virus as “the greatest science policy failure for a generation”, attacks the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) for becoming “the public relations wing of a government that had failed its people”, calls out the medical Royal Colleges, the Academy of Medical Sciences, the British Medical Association (BMA) and Public Health England (PHE) for not reinforcing the World Health Organization’s public health emergency warning back in February, and damns the UK’s response as “slow, complacent and flat-footed”, revealing a “glaringly unprepared” government and a “broken system of obsequious politico-scientific complicity”. On the page, Horton can sound strident, even arrogant, but that’s not his manner in person at all, at least not in our long Zoom conversation. He’s charming, open, self-critical and full of easy laughter. I suggest that, as bad as things look at the moment, surely people like the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific officer, Patrick Vallance, have been doing their best. “Individually, they’re great people,” he says. “I’m not criticising individuals, but the system was a catastrophic failure.” As editor of the Lancet, he’s particularly aggrieved that the series of five academic papers the journal published in late January first describing the novel coronavirus in disturbing detail went unheeded. “In several of the papers they talked about the importance of personal protective equipment,” he reminds me. “And the importance of testing, the importance of avoiding mass gatherings, the importance of considering school closure, the importance of lockdowns. All of the things that have happened in the last three months here, they’re all in those five papers.” He still can’t understand why the government’s scientific advisers didn’t consult their counterparts in China. The world of medicine is a small one, he says, and everyone knows the people responsible for coordinating the Chinese government’s response. “These are people they could have literally sent an email to, or picked the phone up to, and said, ‘Hey, we read your paper in the Lancet, can it really be as bad as that? What is going on in Wuhan?’ And if they’d done that they would have found out that this was indeed as bad as described.” He doesn’t know if such conversations took place, but he can’t see why, if they did, the response was so sluggish that the UK is second in the world, trailing only the much larger nation of the US, in the league of Covid-19 deaths. What he does know, from the published reports of Sage meetings, is that scientists were “trying to be as sensitive to economic issues as they were to health issues”. That, he says, “is a dangerous place to be” because it compromises the ability of the advisory group to protect health. While the arena of public health is no stranger to heated disputes, it’s common for the antagonists to maintain a diplomatic front in public. Horton, who appeared on Question Time back in March and declared the government’s delay in locking down a “national scandal”, has never been shy about speaking out, but even by his own forthright standards, he seems to have abandoned all instincts for restraint. One reason for his lack of caution may be that he has stage 4 melanoma cancer. Though a trained doctor himself, he didn’t take much notice of a growth on his temple until his daughter insisted he got it looked at. He has twice had the growth removed and is currently on a course of immunotherapy. His friend David Nabarro, who is a special envoy for the WHO looking at the Covid-19 pandemic, says that Horton has always been concerned with the social and economic structures that shape health outcomes, but that his illness has made him even more determined to voice his opinions.
Whereas others working in global health have to take future access into account, “in Richard’s case,” says Nabarro, “he knows there’s a fairly high chance he won’t be around to be invited back. He’s got fewer opportunities to try to bring about change. He’s got to be much more precise, much more focused, and at times more ruthless. So I suppose that means what we’re seeing now is the real essence of Richard Horton.” In our conversation Horton makes a single oblique reference to his “rather unpleasant illness” and only then to make the point that, in being shielded, he has learned the true significance of the phrase “key worker”. The experience has made him regard anew not just the hospital staff who have been treating him at the Royal Free in north London – a hospital where he worked as a doctor in the liver unit in the late 1980s – but also, amid a large cast of previously undervalued workers, the couriers who brought him vital medicine when he ran out. “These people,” he says, his voice full of emotion, “they’re the ones who are making our society work.” Horton believes this pandemic is a watershed moment in history, an event that is much larger than simply a crisis in health. “Covid-19 has held a mirror up to our society,” he says, “and forced us to look at who really is vulnerable, who really does make society work, who has to literally put their lives on the line while the rest of us are secluded in our houses. We’ve discovered something about ourselves that we may have been conveniently able to hide before but we can’t hide any more. And so the question is what do we do with that knowledge now?” While he doesn’t have an answer to that question, he does believe that the “moral provocation” of Covid-19 is not one that we can afford to ignore. For Nabarro, Horton’s concern for social justice is a product of his childhood. “He was adopted at three months,” he explains. Horton’s birth father was a Norwegian who returned home not knowing that his brief affair had produced a child. It wasn’t until more than 40 years later that Horton tracked him down, struck up a relationship, and discovered five half-siblings.
“I’m absolutely certain that that’s what’s made him somebody who’s capable of looking at situations a bit outside himself,” says Nabarro. Despite his ill-health, Horton is a boyish-looking 58 who, incredibly, has been editor of the Lancet for a quarter of a century. In that time he’s turned the journal into a major international success, frequently setting the agenda for global health. Last year he received the $100,000 Roux prize for lifetime achievement in population health, being cited as one of the field’s most “committed, articulate, and influential advocates”. Despite the success and recognition Horton has enjoyed, Dame Sally Davies, the former chief medical officer, believes he is still motivated by a haunting chapter in his past. “I think with Covid,” she says, “he’s repaying his debts.”
The debts refer to Horton’s role in publishing Andrew Wakefield’s discredited paper claiming a link between the MMR vaccination and autism. The panic that ensued led to a significant drop in vaccinations across the world, growth of the anti-vaccination movement, and lethal outbreaks of measles. Although the science was questioned from the beginning, Horton strongly defended Wakefield, whom he knew from their time working together at the Royal Free. It took 12 years before Horton finally retracted the paper, after a General Medical Council inquiry found Wakefield to have been guilty of dishonesty and deception. Many people in medical science have never forgiven Horton for awarding Wakefield such a prestigious platform as the Lancet, nor for the delay in retracting the paper. One eminent figure told me: “On his headstone it ought to say, ‘I published Wakefield on MMR and autism’.” Fiona Godlee, editor of the rival British Medical Journal (BMJ), says that MMR is to Horton “what Iraq is to Tony Blair”. As David Salisbury, who was director of immunisation at the department of health at the time of the MMR crisis, put it: Horton “made a catastrophic mistake in publishing that article, and that had enormous consequences both in the UK and globally”. According to Dame Sally, it still rankles her CMO predecessor Sir Liam Donaldson that Horton did not properly apologise. A big supporter of Horton, she describes him as “a great person doing a good job”, but she wishes he’d given a “more fulsome apology”, if only to placate the naysayers. Horton says that he has made many public apologies but not, perhaps, to the particular people involved, like Salisbury. In hindsight, he says, he would have loved to have retracted the paper sooner but he believed, and still does, that Wakefield deserved his day in court. The whole subject, says Godlee, was one about which Horton used to be very defensive. She says the pair fell out after she ran a series of pieces in the BMJ which were highly critical of Horton. Thereafter, she says, he avoided her, refusing to go to any events at which she was present. But they are now on a more friendly footing.
“He has changed in the process of being ill,” she says. “He and I have met and have had a hug and he invited me to his Roux prize thing.” As for his doing penance, Horton thinks that Dame Sally has a psychological point, just not in terms of Covid-19. “The MMR issue was so profoundly damaging that for me the payback that I needed to give was very much a commitment to children’s health. Not just vaccination but a whole range of different issues: newborn health, child health, adolescent health, women’s health as it pertains to child health. I would say that yes, I think there is a debt that I was trying to repay for that.” TheLancet’s publisher, Elsevier, the Dutch analytics company, has stood by Horton, not just through the MMR saga but also a number of other controversies. These include his support for Sir Roy Meadow, the paediatrician who was sanctioned for giving misleading evidence in the case of Sally Clark, the mother wrongly convicted of killing her children; a controversial analysis of civilian deaths in the Iraq war; and only two weeks ago a paper that raised concerns about the efficacy and side effects of the drug hydroxychloroquine was retracted, following widespread protests from leading figures in the field. Speaking before the paper is withdrawn, he says: “It’s because of Trump being such an ardent supporter of [hydroxychloroquine] that it’s got much more politicised than it normally would do. It’s all gone a bit crazy.” The swiftness with which he went on to respond to the furore, says Godlee, “is a sign that he’s learned a great deal”. Nevertheless Horton maintains that it’s vital that “people are allowed to make mistakes because making mistakes should be what science is about”. Despite the apparent security of his position throughout these various wrangles, he says that there was one occasion when he did think he was heading for the sack. It was after he published an “extremely negative” editorial about AstraZeneca for “spinning the most appallingly exaggerated story” about a particular drug.
By coincidence the editorial came out on the same day as the drug company’s annual investor’s meeting, causing the share price to drop. The furious AstraZeneca CEO phoned Elsevier’s chief executive and expressed his fury in uncompromising terms. The chief executive in turn called Horton and demanded to know “what the hell” he was doing.
Godlee says that the Lancet usually has a cosy relationship with big pharma, often publishing major drug trials. It’s a “pact with the devil”, she believes, that has enabled the journal to become a global powerhouse. Whatever the Lancet’s economic model, Horton has studiously built an internationally recognised position of authority that has enabled him to speak out on issues that matter to him. Very few individuals manage to be as plain-speaking as Horton, says David Heymann, the former chair of Public Health England, and still retain respect in the global health community. He speaks of one occasion when he witnessed Horton inform the notoriously sensitive Chinese delegation at a seminar in Hong Kong that China needed to be more open and participatory in global health. “There was a vice-minister of health and many top level ministers present,” says Heymann, “and I think that it may have had the benefit of encouraging them to become better development partners. He’s very good in a tough situation.” For all that, it’s far from certain that his current campaign and book will have the same effect on the British government and its senior scientific advisers. Horton believes that in order to restore their damaged reputation they need to acknowledge their mistakes. “I think that’s going to have to start with Sage, the chief scientific officer and the chief medical officer being very clear that the signals were missed from January. And there needs to be an acknowledgment that there was a collusion that took place between scientific and medical advisers and politicians which was in the end damaging to public health.” Although at least one member of Sage has admitted that an earlier lockdown would have saved lives, it seems unlikely that Whitty will issue any kind of general mea culpa just now. He is in the middle of viral storm, trying to plot a course out. It’s debatable whether he’d increase public confidence in his advice by acknowledging that he got it wrong. That’s if he even thinks he was wrong, which he probably doesn’t. Horton acknowledges that from the last conversation he had with him, Whitty “thinks that I don’t understand what he’s trying to achieve”. Yet there remains a case to answer about why we took so long to lock down, and why, despite all the warnings first from China and then from Italy, that we seemed to be caught unawares by the speed and lethality of the virus. “How long did the UK wait before it took it seriously?” asks Nabarro. “I’m not going to say, but Richard will tell you.” He has indeed told us. On that, at least, we can all agree. • The Covid-19 Catastrophe: What’s Gone Wrong and How to Stop it Happening Again by Richard Horton is published by Polity Press on 18 June (£12.99).

2020-06-13T21:05:47Z,politics,Politics,"At Trafalgar Square protest, the atmosphere was ugly, the air heavy with threat from the far right","In Hyde Park the talk was all of the end game – the eradication of racism. In Trafalgar Square it was more like a war game. Beneath Nelson’s column – erected in honour of a national hero and, of course, defender of slavery – a hundred or so people, largely black and dressed in black, listened to a speaker dressed in white, who led them, fists raised, in a chant of “black power”. Then, seemingly from nowhere, but probably coming from Whitehall, there was a group of about 30 white men, trying to get through a line of riot police. These were the people who’d appointed themselves protectors of the statues, and widely dismissed, not least by the Black Lives Matters supporters, as football hooligans. In Hyde Park Sasha Johnson, holding a Black Lives Matter placard, complained: “We’re painted as thugs when the real thugs are disguised as protecting those memorials. And when they’re drunk, they piss on those memorials.”
The irony is that no one was supposed to be out protesting in central London. Not just because, in theory at least, meetings of groups of larger than six people are banned, but also because Black Lives Matter called on its supporters to avoid central London and protest in their own neighbourhoods. That directive was given after a call was issued by the erstwhile English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson to defend war memorials. The so-called Democratic Football Lads Alliance – a title which sounds like the product of randomly selected words – urged members to join the protest, though requested that they not “engage with any agitators”. No sooner had he stirred things up, Robinson withdrew. “Black Lives Matter were wrong to issue that recommendation,” said Johnson, who ignored it because she wanted to “stand up to intimidation”. “What’s going to end this?” asked Doug “the Fresh”, hidden by behind a mask and sunglasses. “What’s going to make us go home? Nobody really knows. I think we need more causes than just pulling down statues. The cause needs to be reparations for black people so we can become the same standard as you lot.” In Trafalgar Square, a large, heavily tattooed man in a T-shirt emblazoned with the “Parachute Regiment” led the democratic football statue alliance, or whoever they were, away from the police. For a moment it looked as if the confrontation had been averted. But a few minutes later a much larger crowd shouting “In-ger-land” ran around the north side of the square, by the National Gallery, letting off a series of loud bangs that startled the crowd of onlookers. As many people fled the square, a section of the Black Lives Matter protesters broke off and, resisting calls to “hold your fire”, rushed to meet the white group at the top of the stairs. Suddenly the joint multiracial protests of recent weeks had become bi-racial and avowedly antagonistic.
The atmosphere was ugly, and heavy with the threat of violence. The statue protectors didn’t seem very interested in statuary, instead beckoning those below in macho gestures familiar from football grounds – an elaborate choreography of the phrase “Come on if you think you’re hard enough”. Just in time a phalanx of police arrived to separate the two groups as bottles were thrown by the white crowd. After a chaotic few minutes the “lads”, some of whom were in their 50s and 60s, managed to break through and there were several fist fights. A nasty spectacle was given a surreal edge by the fact that a number of protesters on both sides were wearing masks, intent on not spreading Covid-19, as they laid into each other. Eventually the police regained order by kettling the attackers.
Once peace had been restored, the police cut off Trafalgar Square, but small groups of the statue protectors, beer cans in hand, began to emerge from the backstreets, as conspicuous as a group of football hooligans in a Pall Mall’s clubland – which is where they were heading. Now it was they who were outnumbered, and subject to taunts and threats as they moved – some proudly strolling, most at a swift getaway pace – out of the area. A handful of the crowd who’d earlier been under assault sought to confront them, and now with the police busy holding their line, they were dangerously exposed. But a well-built black man, who’d been photographing the demonstration, intervened on at least four occasions to prevent anyone fighting. His name was Clem – no surname, he explained, because he was a “public servant”. “We marched peacefully last week and we came out as elders today to protect our kids,” he said, gesturing to his friend – both men were in their forties. They may well have protected their kids, but into the bargain were a number of the people who’d not long earlier launched an unprovoked assault on the BLM protest. It took a lot of courage and self-discipline to prevent the kind of violence the football lads had been only too happy to mete out, and Clem lacked neither quality.
As we spoke, another group of middle-aged white men in shorts and football shirts came out of a side street and Clem engaged them in conversation. “It’s not about race,” the ageing football democrat said. “We don’t have problems with you. It’s about our history.” Why anyone thought their history was so in jeopardy that they had to attack peaceful protesters was not explained. They claimed they had nothing to do with Tommy Robinson. Apparently “it wasn’t about that” either. There were many opinions expressed in Hyde Park and Trafalgar Square to which one might take exception. For example, I was told Covid-19 was over. Doug “the Fresh” maintained there was an £80,000 salary gap between black and white people. And one woman seemed convinced that “the establishment” funded the BNP so as to maintain racial tensions between the workers. But that’s the beauty of free speech. You can disagree without any need for thuggishness."
2020-06-13T14:58:28Z,politics,Politics,UK government seems to rule out removal of controversial statues,"The government has signalled that it will not remove any statues or monuments from its property, as tensions mount over the UK’s memorials to controversial figures. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said he had written to MPs, peers and councillors to outline the government’s position, after a week in which tens of thousands of people protested against statues of historical figures linked to slavery and racism. In a three-page letter, Dowden said heritage should be used to educate people about all aspects of Britain’s morally complex past, “rather than airbrushing history”. The debate over the future of hundreds of statues and monuments in the UK has raged since last weekend, and a growing number of petitions have been set up both for and against their removal. A statue of the 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston was toppled in Bristol last weekend, and Poole council announced plans to remove a statue of Robert Baden-Powell, the Scout movement founder, over concerns anti-racism activists would target it. The plans were thwarted, however, dozens of local people, some in Scout uniforms, surrounded the statue. Dowden tweeted: “As Culture Sec I would like us to use heritage to educate people about all aspects of Britain’s complex past, good and bad, rather than airbrushing history.” Dowden said in the letter that many of the monuments were listed and could not be removed without planning permission via a quasi-judicial process. Street names could also not be changed without the formal consent of two-thirds of residents who live on the street. “In our democracy, if one wishes to change the urban landscape, this should be done through the democratic process,” he wrote. Historic England gave the government its full backing, and said it was against the removal of “contested heritage”. It also said it had temporarily boarded up some monuments to protect them. Nicholas Soames, a former Conservative minister and Sir Winston Churchill’s grandson, said he was deeply upset after the former prime minister’s statue was defaced. It was later among the statues boarded up before planned anti-racism protests in London. Soames told the Daily Telegraph the incident, in which the word “racist” was scrawled on the monument, suggested British society had “lost its compass”. The home secretary, Priti Patel, called for the statue in Parliament Square to be uncovered immediately and criticised the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, for boarding it up. Soames, however, said Khan was right to heed police advice and board up the statue and the nearby Cenotaph. “I find it extraordinary that millions and millions of people all over the world who look up to Britain will be astonished that a statue of Churchill and the Cenotaph, our national war memorial, could have been defaced in this disgusting way,” he said. “These people who are marching did not set out to do this, but a very, very small, extremely explosive group of people who have made a practice of hijacking entirely responsible demonstrations are behaving in an unspeakable and cowardly manner. “It feels like a society that has lost its compass.” His sister Emma Soames said she had been shocked to see the statue boarded up, but that she understood why it had been necessary. She acknowledged some of her grandfather’s views would be considered unacceptable today, but said millions of British people rightly saw him as a hero. “He was a powerful, complex man with infinitely more good than bad in the ledger of his life,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Until now he was regarded as the saviour of this country and one of this country’s greatest democrats and parliamentarians. That is why the statue is there. People weren’t looking at the entire record of people when they put up statues to them. If they did, we would be living in a country of empty plinths, I think.”"
2020-06-12T17:58:27Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Grant Shapps denies chief nurse dropped from No 10 briefing ‘after refusing to back Dominic Cummings’ — as it happened,"The UKâ€™s GDP posted a record fall of 20.4% in April as the economy suffered a total lockdown loss of 25%, ONS figures revealed. The staggering figures showed just how badly the pandemic paralysed the economy. The figures marked the biggest monthly decline since 1997 when records began. Poorer areas in England and Wales have bit hit hardest by Covid-19, ONS figures showed. The data revealed that people living in the most deprived areas died of coronavirus at double the rate of those living in the most wealthy areas. The London borough of Brent recorded the worst overall age-standardised rate with 210.9 deaths per 100,000 population. The UK â€˜formally confirmedâ€™ the Brexit transition period would not be extended. Michael Gove said the moment for extension had passed and Michel Barnier said the EU â€œtook noteâ€� of the UKâ€™s decision adding talks would be intensified: â€œWe must now make progress on substanceâ€�. Full border controls on goods entering the UK wonâ€™t apply until July next year, the government announced. Its plan involves a phased implementation of controls in January, April and July next year. The R number may be above 1 in parts of England, figures released by Sage revealed. The R for all regions remains close to 1 with the South West of England recording the highest, at between 0.8 and 1.1. The UK death toll reached 41,481. Another 202 deaths were recorded across all settings. Thatâ€™s it from me today on the UK side.

2020-06-12T17:56:41Z,politics,Politics,Chief nurse dropped from No 10 briefing 'for not backing Cummings',"England’s chief nurse was dropped from a daily Downing Street briefing on the coronavirus for refusing to back Dominic Cummings, the Guardian understands. In a trial run for the 1 June briefing, Ruth May was asked about Cummings driving his family from London to Durham while his wife had suspected Covid-19. When she failed to back the prime minister’s chief adviser, she is understood to have been dropped from the press conference taking place later that day – though this has been denied by a government minister. May’s removal was first reported by the Independent, citing senior NHS sources, and has been confirmed separately by the Guardian. The scientific and medical experts who appear at the briefing alongside a politician were initially reluctant to get involved in the row surrounding Cummings, who, while in Durham, also made a 60-mile round-trip to a beauty spot, which he said was to test his eyesight ahead of a longer journey back to London. On 28 May, Boris Johnson tried to prevent the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, from answering questions on the subject, before Whitty said that neither he nor Vallance wished to comment on politics. However, on 30 May, England’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, caused embarrassment for the government by saying, in response to a question about the alleged lockdown breach: “In my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear,” he said. “In my opinion they are for the benefit of all. In my opinion they apply to all.”
A day later, another deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, replied “Absolutely” when asked whether she agreed with Van-Tam. She added: “I thought his exposure of what he felt was exactly right,” she said. “We usually say exactly the same things because we think in public health terms, and I think that’s right. From my own perspective, I can assure you that on a matter of personal and professional integrity, I will always try to follow the rules, as I know he does.” The timing of May’s removal suggests that the government was wary of a senior medical adviser to the government implicitly criticising Cummings for a third day in a row as it desperately tried to move the news agenda away from his actions. Van-Tam has not appeared at a press conference since his comments on 30 May. The government’s advisers have generally been on-message at press conferences and supportive of Downing Street, although there have been divergences. Whitty and the UK’s other medical officers vetoed the government’s attempt to lower the coronavirus alert level from four to three. On Wednesday, Johnson said that it was premature to make judgements about what the government could have done better in its response to the coronavirus pandemic. However, Whitty said: “I think there is a long list, actually, of things that we need to look at very seriously. If I was to choose one, it would probably be looking at how we could ... speed up testing very early on in the epidemic. Many of the problems that we have had came because we were unable to actually work out exactly where we were.” An NHS spokesperson suggested the Guardian contact the government, saying: “If someone doesn’t appear, it’s up to Downing Street.” They added that May was “out there saving lives”. On Friday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, played down reports, saying: “I don’t think it is true … I am absolutely sure she has been a regular contributor before and I am sure she will be back here again.” Downing Street has been approached for comment."
2020-06-12T14:46:31Z,politics,Politics,'We cannot edit our past': Boris Johnson's statue tweets explained,"Boris Johnson has used a series of tweets to speak out against the removal of statues and to urge Black Lives Matter activists not to protest this weekend. Here is some context to his comments. The statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square is a permanent reminder of his achievement in saving this country – and the whole of Europe – from a fascist and racist tyranny. It is absurd and shameful that this national monument should today be at risk of attack by violent protesters. Yes, he sometimes expressed opinions that were and are unacceptable to us today, but he was a hero, and he fully deserves his memorial. While the idea of Churchill as a lone political figure standing up against prewar appeasement has become somewhat mythologised – not least by Churchill himself in his own books – there is no doubt he played a central role in Britain’s wartime destiny, and remains a hero to many Britons, regularly topping polls of most revered prime ministers. Johnson has himself written a biography of Churchill that sold well, if the critical reaction was sometimes mixed, and so has a very obvious personal stake in the argument – particularly as many reviews felt that Johnson was trying to liken his own career to that of his hero. Nonetheless, there were episodes in Churchill’s life that remain hugely controversial; for example his role in the 1943 Bengal famine, which killed up to 3 million people and has been blamed on policy failures rather than drought. Churchill also undoubtedly expressed racist views, for example justifying colonial exploits as “a higher-grade race” subjugating natives. He also expressed eugenicist opinions, supporting the idea that the “feeble-minded” should be sterilised. Defenders of Churchill say that he was not unique in his era in expressing such views. However, nor were they ubiquitous at the time. We cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations. They had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come. This appears to be a vehement argument against removing any statues, by whatever means, whether by spontaneous group action, as with the toppling of the statue honouring slave-trader Edward Colston in Bristol, or by official means; for example, the decision to remove a statue of Robert Milligan, another slave-owner, from London’s Docklands. It is not, however, completely clear whether this is what the prime minister meant. Asked whether he did intend this, Johnson’s spokesman said his tweets “speak for themselves” but pointed reporters to this section. However, the spokesman also noted that Johnson had talked previously about people “using democratic processes for this sort of thing” as the way forwards. The slightly confused message feeds into a febrile national atmosphere in which the removal of Colston’s statue has seen a wave of demands for other monuments to be taken down, including those honouring the imperialist merchant Cecil Rhodes, as well as Sir Francis Drake, William Gladstone and Thomas Guy, the founder of Guy’s hospital in London. This has prompted anguish from Conservative MPs and others, who have said statues must be seen in their historical context. As for the planned demonstrations, we all understand the legitimate feelings of outrage at what happened in Minnesota and the legitimate desire to protest against discrimination. Whatever progress this country has made in fighting racism - and it has been huge - we all recognise that there is much more work to do. This is a repeat of sentiments Johnson has expressed several times in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis. The prime minister has expressed in the broadest terms his concern at Floyd’s death, after a police officer now charged with murder knelt on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. However, Johnson has avoided criticising President Donald Trump for his divisive and militaristic response to US protests in the wake of Floyd’s death. He has also not followed the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, in posing on one knee as a sign of support for the Black Lives Matter protests. It is also notable the PM has not - as yet – suggested any practical means by which more could be done to tackle racism in the UK. Asked following the tweets if Johnson had any plans in this regard, his spokesman talked only of general aims. “The PM has been clear in his views, and his central plan to level up across the country and to ensure equality for everyone still remains.” Asked how this might happen, the spokesman repeated the answer. But it is clear that the protests have been sadly hijacked by extremists intent on violence. The attacks on the police and indiscriminate acts of violence which we have witnessed over the last week are intolerable and they are abhorrent. The only responsible course of action is to stay away from these protests. A number of ministers have condemned violent incidents at last weekend’s Black Lives Matter demonstrations, in which 35 police were injured, and protesters were were charged with horses and “kettled” – penned into a small space. The government has repeatedly urged people to stay away from all protests, primarily to avoid the spread of the coronavirus among people packed together. Under Covid-19 regulations, even outdoors, gatherings of more than six people are not permitted. Ministers are reportedly planning to introduce a “fast-track” approach to offences at such protests, in which people could be convicted within 24 hours. Black Lives Matter have cancelled their planned London demonstrations for the weekend, urging supporters to stay away. This is primarily for their own safety, given that a series of far-right groups, including ones associated with the anti-Islam activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, who calls himself Tommy Robinson, have pledged to stage their own protest in Westminster. While Johnson does not address the planned far-right actions in his tweets, his spokesman said that the call to stay away from protests also applied to this group. • This article was amended on 15 June 2020. An earlier version incorrectly referred to Thomas Guy as “Sir Thomas Guy”."
2020-06-12T14:31:43Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: full controls on goods entering UK will not apply until July 2021,"Full border controls on goods entering the UK will not apply until July next year the government has announced, as it formally notified the EU it does not want an extension to the transition period. The announcement of a three-phased plan for Brexit border checks was welcomed by industry leaders but represents the most dramatic change to international trading since 1993 when the single market was introduced. It comes as the chancellor for the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, told the vice-president of the European Commission, Maroš Šefčovič, of the UK’s plans to press ahead with exiting the customs union and the single market on 31 December.
“We have informed the EU today that we will not extend the transition period. The moment for extension has now passed. At the end of this year we will control our own laws and borders which is why we are able to take the sovereign decision to introduce arrangements in a way that gives businesses impacted by coronavirus time to adjust. “Today’s announcement is an important step towards getting the country ready for the end of the transition period,” said Gove. The border delays have been instigated as a “temporary and pragmatic” response to accommodate the current strains on businesses as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. Further delays of full controls could be put in place if there is a second wave of coronavirus, sources have indicated. The Freight Transport Association, which had lobbied for the delays, said it was “extremely grateful” the government had listened to its concerns. The Road Haulage Association, a vocal critic of the government’s hardline approach to Brexit in the past, also welcomed the announcement. The government plan involves a phased implementation of controls in January, April and July next year. In the first stage, full customs checks and tariffs will be imposed on “controlled” goods such as alcohol and tobacco. But importers of “standard” goods ranging from clothes to electronics will have up to six months to complete customs declarations and to pay tariffs, if any apply. However, they will need to keep sufficient records of imports and make preparations for VAT payments. There will also be checks on live animals and high-risk plants. In April, the health checks will be extended to all products of animal origin including, meat, pet food, honey, milk or egg products with pre-notification of imports required by the authorities. From July all goods will be subjected to customs declarations at the point of importation and relevant tariffs, which will be determined by the outcome of the current Brexit talks on the free-trade agreement. Business leaders have long warned that new checks will mean major disruption to the supply chain and those who trade in fresh and chilled food still face checks on the EU side in key ports including Calais, Rotterdam, Zeebrugge and Dublin. Brussels officials have said the EU has no intention of relaxing checks on UK goods entering the bloc. “The UK has stated on several occasions it wants to take back the control and I would say that it is up to the UK how they do it,” Šefčovič told reporters after his meeting with Gove. The new trading regime will involve fresh infrastructure at ports and airports with a £50m support package to get an estimated 50,000 customs agents, freight forwards and other experts in place for 2021. Border inspection posts will also have to be built, something neighbouring countries including France and Ireland put in place last year in preparation for no-deal planning. Five further rounds of accelerated face to face meetings have now been scheduled for July and August with the hope of securing an outline deal by September in further talks. Special arrangements for checks on goods travelling between Britain and Northern Ireland remain a major issue for the EU. They kick in whether or not there is a trade deal and the EU is concerned the UK will try to wriggle out of some of its obligations on custom controls. Šefčovič welcomed the UK government’s recent command paper on the the issue, but said it did not provide “sufficient operational details and we need to move from aspiration to operation and fast”. The two sides also remain at odds over whether the EU can open a Belfast office to oversee the Irish Sea border. While the Brexit treaty allows EU officials to be present during checks at Northern Irish ports and airports, the UK is refusing to allow Brussels a permanent base in Belfast. “We have to be very pragmatic about what we see as a technical presence of EU officials to make sure that all checks and controls are done properly in full accordance with EU law,” Šefčovič said. Businesses in Northern Ireland recently called for a similar six-month delay to the checks that will apply on goods traded across the Irish Sea and expressed disappointment the UK had no plans for similar approach in the region. A delay on the protocol would require EU approval but sources say there is no sign of any political will either in London or Brussels to make it easy for already strained businesses in the region. Sources say there has been little to no engagement with HMRC reaching out for information after an “eight-month silence”. They had their first meeting with London officials last week and said it “fell flat as a pancake”. “Northern Ireland is different but it looks it’s fallen off the radar as usual. The only way things work is if there is political will and this meeting was just a tick-box exercise”. The two sides are preparing for an intense summer of talks on the future relationship, with six weeks of negotiating rounds scheduled over July and August. On Monday, Boris Johnson meets a trio of EU leaders, the heads of the European commission, council and parliament, although expectations of a political reset emerging are low."
2020-06-12T11:28:18Z,politics,Politics,Could the Colston statue be recast as social reformer Frederick Douglass? | John Crace,"Monday On Saturday, my wife and I went to join a short vigil for George Floyd on Tooting Bec common. It was a very orderly, socially distanced affair – so much so that standing near the back I couldn’t hear any of the speeches as there was no PA system. All I could do was take my lead from what others were doing. So I clapped when other people clapped and got down on one knee when everyone else did. This was something of a problem as I have a metal knee and I was in a lot of discomfort throughout – kneeling down is still painful even years after the operation – and my wife had to help me to get upright again. Other Black Lives Matter events weren’t quite so peaceful. Violence broke out in London, while in Bristol, the statue of Edward Colston was pulled off its plinth and rolled into the river. The statement on the protests in the Commons was a classic piece of parliamentary hypocrisy. Because while MPs on all sides were keen to condemn the civil disorder, everyone seemed secretly relieved that the statue had been removed. Certainly no one called for it to be reinstated. Bristol council has now decided that the statue’s final resting place should be in the local museum which feels like the right decision.
However I was quite taken with a more creative solution suggested to me by Aidan Quinn who runs the Beaux Arts gallery in Bath. He wanted to melt down the statue of Colston and invite a local artist to recast it as the American social reformer and abolitionist Frederick Douglass who visited Bristol in 1844. There is no reason why all statues have to exist in situ in perpetuity and for some to be time limited seems to be an important acknowledgment that history is as much a study of the present as it is of the past. Tuesday It’s sod’s law. There were we wondering if we were ever going to get a holiday this year – we’ve long since given up any hope of going to America to see our daughter – when my wife, along with two other couples, took a punt that Airbnb holidays might be a goer later this summer and put down a deposit on a week’s stay in a Norfolk house for the first week in September. Now it turns out that parliament has plans to curtail its own holidays and come back a week earlier than planned which would be the same week we were in Norfolk.
The official reason for the government’s change of heart is that it has a lot of business it needs to get through. After the events of the past week, please excuse my hollow laughter, as parliament has gone out of its way to waste its own time, not to mention money, and that of the entire country. First we had Jacob Rees-Mogg’s absurd change to procedures which resulted in MPs queueing for 90 minutes to vote on preventing some other MPs who were either carers, shielding, socially isolating or who had to travel long distances from taking part in debates or voting. Since then the government has had to make so many concessions that parliament is basically back to operating how it was before Rees-Mogg took matters into his own hands. We’ve also had to endure the spectacle of the government doing a U-turn on all children going back to school. So, if on the vague off-chance that Airbnb holidays with other couples are allowed and we aren’t in a second major lockdown, then I’m planning on taking my holiday regardless. I can’t plan my entire life around the government’s incompetence. Wednesday Speaking on the phone to my daughter, it seems that Minneapolis is gradually returning to some kind of normality. The protests have thinned out and the national guard is less visible. Also, having shut down a lot later than us – I remember conversations we had in early March in which she said that the coronavirus just wasn’t on the US radar – Minneapolis has now eased almost all of its lockdown regulations. It’s not immediately clear if this has been done on a scientific basis or because the city authorities are keen to ease some of the tensions that sparked the protests, but restaurants and gyms are now open and everyone is now free to meet pretty much anyone they want, subject to physical-distancing guidelines. It’s made me realise just how easily institutionalised I am. When I came out of hospital after a longish stay some years back, I found being at home totally disorientating and quite scary. But that was nothing to how I feel about the possibility of the government lifting lockdown measures here. At least with the hospital, I trusted that the doctors were making the right clinical decision to discharge me. But with this government, I have no faith that Boris Johnson will make the right decisions for the right reasons at the right time. I chose to put myself in isolation a week before it became official government policy and I will maintain a similarly cautious approach for a few weeks after lockdown is eased. Even though my 96-year-old mother has seen off Covid-19, I’m not willing to take any chances myself. I have always been a creature of habits, and right now my habit is staying indoors.
Thursday Ordinarily, the end of the latest round of Brexit negotiations would have been a big deal with Michael Gove, the de facto Brexit secretary, making a ministerial statement to a packed chamber. Now the only way we can get any parliamentary scrutiny is for Labour to table an urgent question, and even then Gove couldn’t be bothered to turn up in person. Instead he let a junior minister, Penny Mordaunt, take the flak. Also missing in action this week was the accident-prone Robert Jenrick. Having caused controversy by travelling from London to visit his parents in Shropshire during lockdown, the housing minister has got himself into trouble by overruling Tower Hamlets council to allow the Tory donor Richard Desmond planning permission for the Westferry development the day before he would have been liable for a £40m tax surcharge. To add to the intrigue, Jenrick was not only on the same table as Desmond at a Tory fundraiser in January, at which the development was raised, he also later admitted that his granting of permission was unlawful. A few weeks later, Desmond paid £12,000 to the Tory party. Understandably, the opposition parties suspect that the ministerial code may have been somewhat stretched, and today managed to secure an urgent question so that Jenrick could explain how his actions had been totally above board. Only Jenrick pleaded the fifth amendment and sent along the junior minister Chris Pincher to face the music instead. As Pincher had clearly only been briefed on how not to give direct answers, MPs left the chamber none the wiser than they had been at the beginning. At any other time, this would have been a major scandal. But in the new coronavirus normal, it was just a minor inconvenience to be shrugged off. The crisis is good news for some. Friday It’s less than a week until the Premier League restarts and I still find myself totally underwhelmed by the prospect. This isn’t at all how I imagined I would feel back in March – I thought that I’d be ecstatic – and I’m not entirely sure why. Part of it must be partisan: at the start of the lockdown, Spurs were playing like a bunch of strangers and had nothing to look forward to apart from the outside possibility of qualifying for the Europa League – a competition many clubs try to avoid – so the final nine matches always felt as if they were going to be an ordeal to be endured. Then there’s the thought of the rest of the season being played out behind closed doors. I like my football live, preferably with me in the crowd, and the idea of empty stadiums in which three DJs – one for a remix of home team chants, one for the away fans and a neutral one for background noise of fans talking to each other about how everything is basically a bit pointless – competing over the PA system to provide atmosphere, feels soulless. I go to football as much to escape from myself for 90 minutes – to lose myself in something over which I have no control – as for the game itself. Not that I intend to boycott the games – I’ll be sat in front of the TV for all Spurs’ remaining fixtures along with a whole lot of matches in which the main attraction is wanting the team I hate more to lose – but I do wonder how much lockdown has affected me. This time next year, will the coronavirus just feel like a distant, bad memory with life having gone back to normal, or will it have changed my relationship with the world in a more permanent way? Not least with my sense of risk. I know I will go back to live sport, just as I will go back to opera, theatre and concerts, because life without them is a life half-lived. But I think it will be some years before I can do so without having a niggling worry there is someone in the crowd or audience who could unwittingly kill me. Digested week, digested: A 20.4% drop in GDP.

2020-06-12T11:13:28Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson says removing statues is 'to lie about our history',"Boris Johnson has said removing statues of controversial figures is “to lie about our history”, as he argued that national protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd in the US had been taken over by extremists. In a lengthy Twitter thread in response to to the boarding up of the Cenotaph in Whitehall and Winston Churchill’s statue in Parliament Square, the prime minister expressed anger at the targeting of monuments. Scaffolding was erected around the Churchill statue, the Cenotaph, and statues of George Washington and King James II on Trafalgar Square late on Thursday evening on the order of the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, amid concerns they could be targeted by protesters and become a focal point for unrest. Black Lives Matters organisers have called off a planned protest in Hyde Park on Saturday, warning that “many hate groups” from the far right were threatening the safety of those planning to attend. Johnson claimed the Black Lives Matters protests “have been sadly hijacked by extremists intent on violence”, and he called attacks on police last weekend “intolerable” and “abhorrent”.
He said: “We all understand the legitimate feelings of outrage at what happened in Minnesota and the legitimate desire to protest against discrimination. Whatever progress this country has made in fighting racism – and it has been huge – we all recognise that there is much more work to do.” But on the campaigns to remove statues and other monuments honouring slave-owners and imperialist figures following the toppling of a statue of Edward Colston in Bristol on Sunday, Johnson made it clear he opposed such moves. “We cannot now try to edit or censor our past,” he said. “We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations. They had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come.” Johnson said it was “absurd and shameful” that Churchill’s statue had to be protected, calling it “a permanent reminder of his achievement in saving this country – and the whole of Europe – from a fascist and racist tyranny.” The prime minister, who has written a biography of Churchill, added: “Yes, he sometimes expressed opinions that were and are unacceptable to us today, but he was a hero, and he fully deserves his memorial.” Questioned about Johnson’s comments, his spokesman was ambiguous as to whether he believed no statues should be removed under any circumstances. Asked if this was the case, the spokesman said: “I think the PM’s tweets speak for themselves,” and referred the media to the tweet saying removing statues would be to “lie about history”. But then asked whether statues could be removed by local consent, the spokesman said: “As he said earlier this week, there are democratic processes for this sort of thing, and that’s what should be followed.” The spokesman also made plain that while Johnson had referred to Churchill’s “unacceptable” opinions, the PM had no plans to apologise for his own previous racially charged comments, such as describing veiled Muslim women as “letterboxes” and “bankrobbers”, and writing about African people’s “watermelon smiles”. Asked if Johnson would apologise, the spokesman said: “These issues were all addressed during the election campaign last year.” Asked if the prime minister still believed it was correct to “speak frankly” in such ways, the spokesman said: “Yes”.
Far-right groups, with the support of extremists such as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, who calls himself Tommy Robinson, are planning to hold a “defend our memorials” event at Churchill’s statue on Parliament Square this weekend. At last weekend’s protest, a demonstrator wrote the words “is a racist” on the Churchill statue. While BLM has cancelled its Hyde Park event, other protests, including one called “Antifascists support Black Lives Matter”, appear to be going ahead. In Poole, Dorset, a statue of the Scout movement’s founder, Robert Baden-Powell, was also being boarded up after local people opposed moves to take it down. After the statue was featured on the Topple the Racists website, which accused Baden-Powell of being “a Nazi/fascist sympathiser”, plans to temporarily remove it were thwarted when it was surrounded by dozens of people refusing to allow it. The statue will now be boarded up temporarily while security guards will remain at the scene.
Mark Howell, the deputy leader of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council, said on Friday: “We were advised by council officers that the easiest way of protecting the statue was to take it away temporarily and put it in a safe place. But there was a public backlash against that and clearly a lot of people feared we wouldn’t put it back again. We have decided to board it up temporarily.” Len Banister, a former scout leader who has been among those guarding the statue, said: “Of course it’s good news that it will stay here, but it is still a shame to see the statue boarded up. I just can’t understand the mentality of a person who would want to damage it. We will not let that happen.” In Brecon in mid-Wales, a plaque to the slave ship captain Thomas Phillips has been ripped down. Brecon town council said the memorial was “under review” but had been stolen before it could make a decision on it. A spokeswoman for Brecon town council said: “The town council, in consultation with the local community and interested parties will take time to consider what, if anything, should take its place.”"
2020-06-12T05:00:13Z,politics,Politics,Bereaved relatives call for immediate inquiry into Covid-19 crisis,"Lawyers representing 450 bereaved people whose relatives have died due to Covid-19 have called on Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock to hold an immediate public inquiry into the government’s handling of the crisis to help prevent many more deaths. The formal petition to the government from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group argues there is “a compelling need to set up the inquiry immediately”, to consider the best measures necessary to “minimise the ongoing effects of the virus”. The inquiry should ultimately examine the key government decisions and state of preparedness, which the families argue contributed to their relatives dying, the petition states. It adds: “There is a widely held public belief that the government is making wrong decisions in this crisis and that the government errors have cost and will continue to cost lives.” Matt Fowler, a co-founder and spokesperson for the families’ group, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, a retired design engineer for Jaguar Land Rover, died on 13 April, said: “It has become tragically clear that fatal mistakes have been made by the government in its handling of the pandemic. As the staggering statistics continue to roll in, so too do the stories of personal tragedy, heartache and loss. The crucial fact is that every one of those statistics was a living breathing person, taken before their time and leaving an empty void in the lives of their families and friends. “For many, the wounds caused by their loss will never truly heal. For those left behind there is pain, confusion and a sense of having been failed by the system that should be protecting them.” Members of the group include Ken Sazuze, the husband of Elsie Sazuze, a nurse at a care home who died aged 44 ; the daughter of a London bus driver, Ranjith Chandrapala, who died aged 64; Fiona Kirton, whose father, Bernard, was transferred from a hospital to a care home without first being tested for the virus; and Jo Goodman, whose father Stuart believed he became infected after having to attend a hospital in person for an appointment on 18 March.
Goodman said the families believed the need for a public inquiry had become even more compelling in light of comments this week from Prof Neil Ferguson, who was a senior member of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) until he stepped down on 5 May. He told MPs on the Commons science committee that introducing lockdown measures just a week earlier would have reduced the number of people dying by at least half . The latest information from the Office for National Statistics this week showed there have been more than 63,000 excess deaths due to the virus. “My family and other members of the group heard that and obviously we now feel, as we have done throughout, that our loved ones did not need to die, and may have been saved if the government had responded more promptly to the spread of the virus, as other countries were doing,” Goodman said. The families’ petition to Johnson and Hancock states: “There is criticism of the government’s handling of the crisis from all quarters.” It says when a full public inquiry is held, it must consider: The timing of the UK lockdown on 23 March, which was later than almost all European countries. The state of the government stockpile of personal protective equipment and testing capacity. The response to warnings in the 2017 Exercise Cygnus report that the UK was not adequately prepared for a pandemic. The disproportionately high number of black and minority ethnic people who have died from Covid-19. The transfer of patients from hospitals to care homes and several other key issues that have been subject to intense criticism.
The group’s lawyers, led by Pete Weatherby QC and Elkan Abrahamson of Broudie Jackson Canter, who represented 22 bereaved families at the 2014-16 new inquests into the Hillsborough disaster, argue that the government is under a legal duty to hold a public inquiry. The chief coroner, Mark Lucraft QC, issued guidance in March that in most cases deaths from Covid-19 should not be investigated at inquests, and that where there were inquests they were not “the right forum” for addressing concerns about government policy. Johnson and other ministers have so far rejected calls for an immediate public inquiry, including from 27 medical and public health experts who wrote to the Guardian on 5 June . Johnson has acknowledged there will be a time to learn lessons, but said he was “very proud” of his government’s response."
2020-06-11T20:32:28Z,politics,Politics,More than a third of employees furloughed in some UK towns,"More than a third of employees in some towns in Britain have been furloughed due to coronavirus, according to figures that also reveal the government’s job retention scheme has now cost almost £20bn. Crawley in Sussex, which sits next to Gatwick airport, had 33.7% of employees furloughed last month while in contrast Cambridge had just under half that proportion at 17.4%.
Burnley, Slough, Sunderland and Birmingham were also in the top five towns and cities with the largest percentage of employees sent home after their employers found there was no work for them to do during the coronavirus lockdown. Cambridge headed a list of university towns that boasted the least number of furloughed staff, including Oxford, Exeter and Cardiff. According to analysis by the thinktank Centre for Cities of the first regional breakdown of furlough data published by the government, the scheme is estimated to cost £19.6bn. London was the worst affected region, with Tottenham the capital’s worst affected constituency. The Treasury launched the coronavirus jobs retention scheme (CJRS) in March, allowing companies to send workers home, with the Treasury paying 80% of their usual wage, up to a maximum of £2,500 a month. The government published figures up to 31 May say the scheme has supported more than 6.4 million staff in England, in addition to more than 628,000 jobs in Scotland, 316,500 in Wales and nearly 212,000 furloughed staff in Northern Ireland. The self-employment income support scheme (SEISS), which paid up to £2,500 to self employed workers unable to earn a living, boosted the incomes of 146,000 people in Scotland at a cost of £425m. In Wales, 102,000 claims were made for £273m, while 69,000 self employed workers in Northern Ireland and 2m in England made claims for £198m and nearly £6bn respectively. The chancellor Rishi Sunak said that across the whole of the UK, 70% of those eligible for support through the self-employment scheme made a claim, with the average value of claims amounting to £2,900 from a maximum £7,500 to cover three months."
2020-06-11T19:02:54Z,politics,Politics,Mattbeth's vaulting ambition leads him out to damn'd TV spot | John Crace,"You could tell the news wasn’t going to be that great when we got the cast list. If the new track and trace system had been an overwhelming success, there would have been every chance that Boris Johnson would have rolled out of bed to take the credit. Instead, we got Matt Hancock, everybody’s favourite punchbag, still wearing his favourite pink tie that has so far brought him nothing but bad luck. It’s hard not to feel just a little sorry for Matt. His vaulting ambition that led him to ignore all his gut instincts about having nothing to do with a Boris Johnson government has brought him nothing but hubris. He knew Boris was a wrong ‘un from the off. He even said as much during his short-lived campaign to be Tory party leader last summer. But when faced with a choice of acting on principle or grasping whatever cabinet post was going begging, Mattbeth chose the latter. His eyes are now dead, his shoulders slumped. The enjoyment of being on TV at the Downing Street press conference – The lights! The greasepaint! – has long since worn off. Because he knows he only ever gets the crap gigs. The ones that no one else wants to do. And even Westminster’s very own Mr Tigger, a man who could once achieve orgasm just by polishing his enamel NHS badge, can’t even muster a veneer of enthusiasm. The briefing is just a chore to be rushed through while giving away as little information as possible. Matt began with the usual white noise. Although the number of cases was actually up from a day earlier, the figures continued to fall. Er, hello? It was clear that neither Matt nor the person who had written this crap had bothered to make sure if it made any sense. He had a plan and it was working. It would just have been nice to know that the government had been hell-bent on killing more than 50,000 people – and counting – right from the start of the pandemic. Having dispensed with the daily platitudes, Hancock moved on to the results of the first week’s track and trace programme. It had gone brilliantly because it had managed to miss 75% of the contacts, though if you counted the few thousand people it had managed to contact then you could fiddle the statistics to make it look as if 85% of contacts had been traced. “It is your civic duty to participate,” Matt said sternly. Though obviously not if you happened to be Dominic Cummings. Then you could take the system or leave it. “The system will be world class,” he added hopefully. This sounded like more of an aspiration for some time in the future and certainly a significant downgrade on “world beating”. Nor was there any attempt to explain why it was taking so long to implement the system. Most other countries had seen test, track and trace as an essential weapon in fighting coronavirus back in February; we had only really got round to thinking about it seriously a month or so ago. Matt ended with a final plea. He understood people’s anger about Black Lives Matter but could people please stick to the rules and keep to small, socially distanced groups of six. Not for the first time during this public health crisis, satire had to take a back seat. Because the person the health secretary was about to hand over to was Dido Harding, the new chief executive of track and trace, who in a previous job on the board of the jockey club had let the Cheltenham festival go ahead when many other health experts were suggesting it should be cancelled. So it’s going to take Typhoid Dido quite a while until the number of people she’s prevented from getting the coronavirus outweighs the number she’s helped to infect. Which might help to explain why at least one third of the people who had been tracked down refused to give any details of their contacts. But on the plus side, they had managed to pick up about 32,000 contacts which meant that the 25,000 track and tracers had managed to make just over one successful call each over the past week. Making Britain Great Again. Come the questions, Door Matt got noticeably tetchier as journalist after journalist expressed their disappointment in the new system. Wouldn’t it have been better to wait until track and trace was working properly before easing lockdown measures? “No,” said Hancock. Because when it was world class it would be world class. There was no arguing with that. Nor could he give any further updates on his world beating app which only a month ago he had insisted would give the UK the edge in beating coronavirus. Matt just pretended he had never said the app was going to be any great shakes and that it would be ready when it was ready. As in never. Typhoid Dido did briefly try to come to the rescue. She was sure things would improve and that the track and tracers would soon be able to get hold of at least two people a week once they had learned to stop sending contacts texts at 3am. Teething problems and all that. She also said she had had one call from someone who had been delighted to be contacted as that had got him out of a barbecue. That must have been from someone on the Isle of Wight who had been due to go for drinks at the deputy editor of the Spectator’s house, where the guest list had included Tory MP, Bob Seely, Brexit chairman Richard Tice and journalist Isabel Oakeshott. Being told you had to self-isolate for 14 days would be a small price to pay to avoid that particular nightmare."
2020-06-11T18:15:32Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Matt Hancock not ruling out compulsory cooperation with test and trace system â€“ as it happened,"However, Hancockâ€™s claim that 85% of contacts had been traced is â€œdeeply misleadingâ€�, according to the Independent Sage group. The health secretary Matt Hancock said that 85% of contacts given were self-isolating had still â€˜beaten his expectationsâ€™. But analysis showed that between 28 May and 3 June, 8,117 individuals tested positive and were referred for contact tracing. Of those, 5,407 (67%) were reached and asked for contacts. However, ONS surveillance data suggests there were at least 23,000 new symptomatic cases in that period, meaning that 75% of cases were not found. Jeremy Hunt, who chairs the health select committee, expressed concern that the system wonâ€™t be able to do its job if less than a fifth of new infections are being picked up. Matt Hancock did not rule out making cooperation with test and trace compulsory. Priti Patel was accused of using using her own experiences of prejudice to â€œgaslightâ€� the â€œvery real racismâ€� faced by black people in the UK. A group of 33 BAME Labour MPs wrote to the home secretary, accusing her of trying to â€œsilenceâ€� Florence Eshalomi when she told the Commons of her experiences of racism and said she would â€œnot take lecturesâ€� on prejudice. Things then took an odd turn when Matt Hancock accused those MPs of treating Patel as â€œthe wrong type of BAMEâ€�. Urgent cancer referrals in England fell by 60% in the first month of lockdown. NHS England figures revealed fewer urgent cancer referrals made by GPs in April (60% down from last year) and urgent referrals for breast cancer fell by 78%. The UK death toll rose by 151 to 41,279. Thatâ€™s it from us today on the UK side. If you would like to continue to follow the Guardianâ€™s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture."
2020-06-11T18:15:16Z,politics,Politics,BAME MPs accuse Priti Patel of gaslighting in racism debate,"Senior Conservatives have hit back after more than 30 Labour MPs from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds accused Priti Patel of trying to silence debate by “using” her own experience of racism. The 32 MPs, including Diane Abbott and Clive Lewis, expressed their “dismay” after the home secretary said in a Commons debate that she would “not take lectures from the other side of the house” because she had been racially abused as a child. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, accused them of “divisive identity politics”. In the strongly worded letter, the MPs told the home secretary they were disappointed “at the way you used your heritage and experiences of racism to gaslight the very real racism faced by black people and communities across the UK”. They added: “We all have our personal stories of the racism that we have faced, whether it has been being defined by the colour of our skin or the faith we choose to believe in. “Our shared experiences allow us to feel the pain that communities feel when they face racism, they allow us to show solidarity towards a common cause; they do not allow us to define, silence or impede on the feelings that other minority groups may face.” Patel herself responded strongly to the letter on Twitter, saying: “I will not be silenced by @UKLabour MPs who continue to dismiss the contributions of those who don’t conform to their view of how ethnic minorities should behave.” Asked about the letter at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Hancock said, “of course Priti Patel was not wrong to talk of her personal experiences of racism. I have seen this letter, and I abhor this divisive identity politics that’s being levelled at Priti Patel. I’m incredibly proud to be part of the most diverse government in history.” Former chancellor Sajid Javid called the letter “utterly misguided and irresponsible”. “Imagine listening to an ethnic-minority woman’s history of suffering racist abuse - and then deciding that you’d rather condemn the victim than her abusers,” he tweeted. The letter was coordinated by the shadow community cohesion minister, Naz Shah, and was also signed by other senior Labour MPs including Tulip Siddiq, Kate Osamor, Chi Onwurah, Seema Malhotra, Dawn Butler and Rosena Allin-Khan. In a Commons debate on Monday, the Labour MP Florence Eshalomi suggested the government did not understand the anger felt by people and the desire to tackle structural racism.
Patel told the Commons she was “really, really saddened” by Eshalomi’s criticism and added: “It must have been a very different home secretary who as a child was frequently called a Paki in the playground, a very different home secretary who was racially abused in the streets or even advised to drop her surname and use her husband’s in order to advance her career. “A different home secretary recently characterised … in the Guardian newspaper as a fat cow with a ring through its nose, something that was not only racist but offensive, both culturally and religiously. [Patel was referring to a Steve Bell cartoon.] So when it comes to racism, sexism, tolerance or social justice, I will not take lectures from the other side of the house.” In the letter, the Labour MPs tell Patel that “being a person of colour does not automatically make you an authority on all forms of racism” and that experiences should not be used to “silence” others. They write: “In conclusion, we ask you to reflect on your words and to consider the impact it had towards black communities in the UK trying to highlight their voices against racism. “Rest assured that Asian and ethnic minority colleagues on this side of the house will not use their experiences to silence our black colleagues, but will use our shared experiences to stand behind them and support their voices to lead us on standing up against the distinct form of racism black communities in the UK and across the globe face.” Patel said on Monday that “thugs and criminals” would be brought to justice for pockets of violence at the largely peaceful anti-racism demonstrations in London at the weekend."
2020-06-11T16:17:48Z,politics,Politics,Robert Jenrick ducks Commons question on planning intervention,"Robert Jenrick is facing increased political pressure to explain his intervention in a planning decision to save a property developer millions of pounds, after ducking a parliamentary question on the subject and sending his deputy instead. Labour have demanded the communities secretary release the correspondence showing his contacts with the former Express newspapers owner Richard Desmond ahead of the decision over a residential development in east London. Separately, the Liberal Democrats have written to Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, to ask whether Jenrick potentially breached the ministerial code. Ed Davey, the party’s interim leader, wrote that there appeared to be “an increasingly expanding web of links between Mr Jenrick and Mr Desmond”. Labour has also demanded the Conservatives hand back a £12,000 donation from Desmond, received two weeks after Jenrick overruled the local council and the government’s planning inspectorate to approve the 1,500-apartment, 44-storey complex in London. The decision came a day before the introduction of a community infrastructure levy (CIL) imposed by Tower Hamlets council, which would have cost Desmond’s company at least £40m, to be used for local education and health projects. After the council challenged his decision, Jenrick accepted it had been unlawful. It has since emerged that Jenrick sat on the same table as Desmond at a Conservative fundraising event in November. Following days of pressure over the issue, Labour secured an emergency question in the Commons on Thursday. But rather than respond himself, Jenrick sent Chris Pincher, a junior minister in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, to field the questions. Steve Reed, the shadow communities secretary, asked why Jenrick did not personally answer the urgent question, even though he was apparently at parliament.
“This sequence of events raises grave concerns about cash for favours,” Reed told Pincher in the Commons. “If he wants to restore trust, the secretary of state must immediately publish all documents and all correspondence relating to this decision. The public needs reassurance that the integrity of the planning process cannot be auctioned off at Conservative party fundraising dinners.” Reed said Labour wanted full transparency over Jenrick’s decision in January. He said the minister’s “extraordinary step of admitting his decision was unlawful because of apparent bias” in the court case launched by the council meant he avoided having to hand over correspondence detailing his actions. Reed added: “Can the minister tell us what that apparent bias was?” Pincher argued it was not uncommon for ministers to decide against planning authorities, and dismissed any impropriety. Jenrick, Pincher said, had informed his department of all conversations he had with Desmond, including at the November event, and “has no relationship with the applicant”. He said Jenrick admitted fault at the court case because both he and the council wanted to end the matter swiftly. “The way to achieve that, technically in law, is to accept the action that was brought by the local authority to the court. That is why he made the decision that he did,” said Pincher. He said Jenrick had never discussed the issue of the CIL payments with Desmond, and knew nothing of the billionaire’s donation to the party, which Pincher said was payment for a ticket to an event. In a statement released after the question, Reed called for the Conservatives to repay Desmond’s donation. He said: “Instead of answering questions about his behaviour, Robert Jenrick sent in a junior minister to speak on his behalf while he apparently laid low in the tea room. This attempt to avoid scrutiny shows contempt for the public who are concerned about the integrity of the planning process.” Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the prime minister continued to have confidence in Jenrick. Asked why Jenrick had sent Pincher to answer Labour’s questions, instead of facing them himself, he said: “It’s appropriate for the housing minister to respond to questions in the house on housing and planning matters. This is a housing and planning matter.”"
2020-06-11T14:55:24Z,politics,Politics,Nigel Farage to leave radio station LBC 'with immediate effect',"Nigel Farage is to leave the radio station LBC “with immediate effect”, the company has announced. The Brexit party leader will no longer present his weekday evening show on the talk radio station, which has previously been investigated by the media regulator Ofcom. “Nigel Farage’s contract with LBC is up very shortly and following discussions with him, Nigel is stepping down from LBC with immediate effect,” said the station’s managing director, Tom Cheal, in a message to staff. “We thank Nigel for the enormous contribution he has made to LBC and wish him well.” Farage has yet to comment on his departure but his LBC producer tweeted to say he had learned the news via social media. The LBC presenter James O’Brien tweeted: “We got our station back.”
Farage has been a vocal critic of the recent Black Lives Matter protests and sources at the station pointed to internal fury over his comments earlier this week comparing protesters who destroyed the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol to the “Taliban”. His programme regularly hit the headlines but struggled to establish itself as a US-style rightwing radio show, partly due to the limitations of the British broadcasting code. Its most notable moment was when Farage secured an exclusive interview with the US president, Donald Trump. Employees at Global Media, which owns LBC and other stations including Capital Radio and Heart, had raised concerns in recent days about the difference between the company’s rhetoric on race and its actions. Messages passed to the Guardian show Yinka Bokinni and Shayna Marie Birch-Campbell, the hosts of the CapitalXtra breakfast show, expressing their exasperation with the company’s response: “As black women in the public eye and forward-facing representatives of this company who are actively speaking out against white privilege and fighting for change, we currently don’t feel like we have the backing of the place we call home.” There has also been substantial attention on the make-up of the Global Media board of directors and calls for its founder, Ashley Tabor-King, to do more to live up to his internal comments."
2020-06-11T13:05:14Z,politics,Politics,"No-deal Brexit would be 'major block' to UK's recovery, warns CBI","Business leaders have pleaded with the government not to walk away from Brexit talks without a deal after Michael Gove claimed the Confederation of British Industry supported no extension to the transition period. The CBI’s director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, said to crash out without a deal would be a “major block to recovery”. “Walking away,” she said “would worsen inequalities” and end up “damaging regional and national growth”. Her comments come after Gove told the House of Commons that the CBI was now backing the government position not to seek an extension to the transition period at the end of the year. “I know that businesses … want uncertainty to be removed. That’s why we’re clear that we will end the transition period on the 31 December, and it is a position that I also understand now the CBI is in favour of,” said Gove, who is charged with implementing the Brexit withdrawal agreement reached in January. Fairbairn, whose relations with the government were severely tested over Brexit last year, declined to respond to Gove directly. But she made it plain that British firms were too busy struggling for their survival and the prospect of going into January next year with a new trading environment with possible tariffs and customs paperwork to export and import to and from the EU was the last thing on their minds. “Walking away with no deal would be a major block to recovery,” she told the BBC in an interview. “Many businesses are not – and cannot – prepare for the impact of a no deal on top of what is happening. “The government has ruled out an extension – business have no choice but to plan on that basis.”
In a separate statement she added: “Many businesses are fighting to survive as the impact of Covid-19 unfolds. A recovery plan that reaches all parts of the UK is essential. Every opportunity for growth must be seized, particularly to support young people and kickstart demand. A good deal with the EU would be a foundation stone of renewal.” The end of the transition period in December will complete Britain’s exit from the EU, bringing with it a departure from the customs union and the single market. That could mean dramatic changes for businesses, with customs declarations and, potentially, tariffs and other barriers such as border health checks on animals and food. It will also bring an end to the the freedom of British citizens to automatically reside and work in EU member states."
2020-06-11T12:57:48Z,politics,Politics,Chris Grayling's failings: a catalogue of the former minister's errors,"Part-privatisation of probation contracts As justice secretary, Chris Grayling rushed through significant changes to the probation service, which is responsible for the management of offenders in the community. The 2014 shake-up separated the probation sector into the National Probation Service (NPS), a public sector organisation managing high-risk criminals, and made 21 private firms known as community rehabilitation companies (CRCs) responsible for the supervision of 150,000 low- to medium-risk offenders. After years of damning criticism from MPs, inspectorates and former probation officers, one of Grayling’s successors as justice secretary, David Gauke, decided to bring all offender management under the NPS by spring 2021, approximately 80% of probation work. On Thursday the current justice secretary, Robert Buckland, effectively restored all probation work to public ownership. Grayling ignored significant warnings from within his department to push through his changes in 2014. MPs on the public accounts committee said they were rushed through at breakneck speed, taking “unacceptable risks” with taxpayers’ money. The justice committee described the overhaul as a “mess” and warned it might never work. Comments on B&Bs and gay couples In 2010, when shadow home secretary, Grayling was forced to apologise after a recording obtained by the Observer captured him saying that people who ran bed and breakfasts in their homes should have the right to turn away gay couples on the basis that “we need to allow people to have their own consciences”. The remarks prompted a furious response from gay groups and other parties, and David Cameron came under pressure to sack Grayling to prove the Conservatives did not tolerate prejudice. Banning books for prisoners As justice secretary, Grayling notoriously introduced a ban on prisoners receiving books from friends or relatives, and limited the number of books each prisoner was able to have in a cell. It was introduced as part of a crackdown on what ministers described as prisoners’ “perks and privileges”. High-profile opponents included the Howard League for Penal Reform, which gained support from leading authors, including the then poet laureate, Carol Ann Duffy, David Hare, Salman Rushdie and Jeffrey Archer. A high court ruling in December 2015 found the measure was unlawful and it was subsequently scrapped. Seaborne Freight While transport secretary, Grayling was widely mocked after it emerged he had awarded Seaborne Freight a no-deal Brexit ferry contract despite the company not owning any ships and having never previously operated a ferry service. The Department for Transport (DfT) cancelled the contract after it said an Irish shipping firm, Arklow Shipping, that had been backing the deal pulled out. To add to the confusion Arklow Shipping later denied it ever had a stake in the venture. The government has agreed a new £33m contract with Eurotunnel in order to settle legal action. Rail timetable chaos Also during Grayling’s tenure as transport secretary, a change to rail timetables caused chaos, leading to the cancellation of thousands of services. More than one in 10 Northern and Thameslink trains were cancelled after the introduction of the new timetable in 2018. In an interim report on the debacle, the Office of Rail and Road singled out the train operators Govia Thameslink Railway and Northern, Network Rail and the DfT for criticism, saying their mistakes had led to the collapse of services. The rail regulator criticised the DfT for failing to question the industry’s assurances about the risk of disruption. Legal aid cuts
As justice secretary, Grayling oversaw significant changes to legal aid that meant victims seeking legal representation in disputed family court hearings, where they could be forced to confront their abuser, had to demonstrate that they had been targeted within the past five years. Legal Aid Agency regulations also specified that a narrow range of official documents provided proof, such as medical reports, injunctions and social services records. In 2017, two years after Grayling ceased to be justice secretary, the Ministry of Justice announced the removal of the five-year limit and the admission of fresh categories of evidence."
2020-06-11T11:47:18Z,politics,Politics,Support bubbles: what is new policy in England and how does it work?,"The government has said it wants to alleviate the loneliness and isolation of people most affected by social restrictions. It emphasises that this is a “targeted intervention” directed at those who have been cut off from family and friends during lockdown. So what does the new law mean? What’s happening? In England, from 13 June, if you live by yourself or are a single parent with dependent children – in other words, if there is only one adult in your home – you can expand your household to include one other household of any size. These are being called support bubbles. So can grandparents now visit their grandchildren and have them to stay in their own homes? Yes and no. One grandparent who lives on their own can form a bubble with one of their grown-up children. But families with two lone grandparents need to choose which grandparent they link up with. Can my partner stay the night with me? Yes, as long as one of you lives alone and you’re in an exclusive bubble. What about parents who have separated but who have children under 18? You’re already allowed to operate as though you’re in a bubble. Adults who live alone, or with dependent children only, can now form a bubble with another household. I live alone but I’m shielding. Can I form a bubble? Afraid not. But the government will be setting out further advice next week targeting this group. Can I be in a bubble if I’m clinically vulnerable or have a higher risk of catching coronavirus? If you are at a higher risk of exposure (for example, if someone in your house is a healthcare worker), you should take particular care when deciding whether to form a bubble and with whom. What can I do in a bubble? You can behave as though you live under the same roof with the other people in your bubble: you’re one big family. You can also share things such as sport or garden equipment. Are bubbles safe? The risk of infection rises with the number of people in a bubble and the number of interactions you have with people you do not live with. Good hygiene remains important even for those in the same bubble: keep washing your hands and sneezing into a tissue. How can I get to those in my bubble? There is no limit on how far you can travel but the government recommends that you form a bubble with someone who lives locally, so that you can continue to avoid using public transport and can cycle or walk if possible. I’ve chosen my bubble. Is there anything I can’t do? You can’t change your mind. You can’t swap bubbles or expand them to include more than one household. What happens if someone in my support bubble develops coronavirus symptoms or we come into contact with someone else who does? You all have to stay at home. If you or a member of your bubble is contacted as part of the test and trace programme, the individual contacted must stay at home. If the individual becomes symptomatic, everyone in the bubble must then isolate. I’ve just returned to the UK from abroad. Can I form a bubble or immediately rejoin my previous bubble? No. You need to self-isolate in one place for 14 days first. I’m not eligible to form a bubble. Can I still see my friends and family? This is a targeted intervention for those who really need it. The safest thing is for us all to continue limiting our contact with others by staying at home. You can continue meeting outdoors in a group of up to six people including those you do not live with, as long as you keep at least 2 metres apart. What happens if I break the new rules? The relevant authorities, including the police, have the powers to enforce them through fines and dispersing gatherings. • This article was amended on 19 June 2020. Parents who have separated, and live with dependent children only, can form a bubble with another household - which does not have to contain only a single adult as a previous version said."

2020-06-10T18:54:06Z,politics,Politics,"MPs demand review of national curriculum, led by black leaders","MPs are demanding the government holds a review of the national curriculum led by black and ethnic minority leaders and historians to better reflect black history. The cross-party group of more than 30 politicians has written jointly to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to ask for a re-evaluation of the history syllabus in light of the global Black Lives Matter protests over the killing of George Floyd. Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson and a former teacher, said: “We all have a duty to make sure the next generation, at least, has a better understanding of the historical injustices contributing to institutional racism that persists in the UK and elsewhere today. “As a former teacher, I know first-hand the value of education as a tool to empower young people to make change happen. That’s why we need to include a more diverse range of historical perspectives in our curriculum and examinations.” The letter, signed by the Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley, Labour’s former shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler and former frontbencher Clive Lewis, members of the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Green party’s Caroline Lucas, said there should be a more balanced reading of Britain’s colonial and imperial past, and its legacy of abuse and exploitation. More recent history, such as the treatment of the Windrush generation should also be included, they suggested, as well as the positive contribution black people and people of all ethnicities have made to Britain. The British empire and its slave trade is not a statutory part of the curriculum, although many schools choose to teach it. Black History Month takes place in the UK in October with resources available for schools. The MPs’ call for a curriculum review follows campaigning by Labour under Jeremy Corbyn to create an emancipation educational trust that would deliver school programmes and focus on African civilisation before colonisation. The civil rights campaigner Paul Stephenson, who who led the Bristol bus boycott in 1963, was suggested as someone all pupils could study. The organisation The Black Curriculum is also collecting signatures for an open letter to be sent to Williamson on making black history compulsory in primary and secondary schools and requesting a face-to-face meeting with him. It would like a response from the minister before Windrush Day on 22 June, which was observed for the first time in 2018. The letter, led by Moran in parliament, comes as Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the curriculum must be improved to break down barriers to defeating racism. She said: “We must improve the curriculum so that students learn about how Britain was founded on global histories. Students should learn about the achievements and roles of black Britons in every field of human endeavour. And they should learn about the campaigns by black workers for equal treatment and the stand against injustice.” Bousted also called for a review of teacher training to equip all trainees with anti-racist strategies, and a new recruitment strategy to make the teaching profession more diverse “This term, the NEU will launch an anti-racist framework to respond to the experiences of black children and black staff and to help education staff develop anti-racist approaches,” she said. “We support the initiatives from NGOs such as the Runnymede Trust and youth movements such as The Black Curriculum to highlight the importance of challenging the education system to be more inclusive and making the curriculum representative and relevant.” There have been concerns that because academies, which are not controlled by local authorities, have greater flexibility in what they teach and are not required to follow the national curriculum some children may miss out on opportunities to study black history. The current curriculum suggests that within key stage 3 history pupils could look at the British transatlantic slave trade and its effects and abolition. This comes under the broader subject area of “Ideas, political power, industry and empire: Britain, 1745-1901”. The Black Curriculum suggests a broader historical approach, with black history taught through topics such as the pre-colonial black presence in Britain, migration from 1910 to 1960 and assimilation, and a closer look at 21st-century geopolitics, including migration patterns and deportation."
2020-06-10T18:43:12Z,politics,Politics,Sloth-like Boris Johnson escapes capture during fleeting appearance | John Crace,"Wednesday is Boris Johnson’s take your inner child to work day. The day when he falls out of bed, puts on a suit, uses a brush to turn his hair into a total state and rides out of his Downing Street flat to first face prime minister’s questions in the Commons before doing his weekly coronavirus press briefing at 5pm. Quite what he does in the intervening six days, almost no one has a clue as he is rarely spotted in the wild and there is no visible evidence of any action. Though many of us – including a large number of Tory MPs who are beginning to think they might have backed the wrong man as his approval and competency ratings plummet – would dearly love to know. Perhaps he has been taking time out to catch up with the third series of Ozark. Fair to say that until now Boris has taken a hammering from Keir Starmer at PMQs. Exposed for the petulant narcissist he so clearly is. Yet on Wednesday he escaped with his pride more or less intact. Not because he was any better at responding to the questions – Boris has yet to answer any question directly or truthfully – but more because the Labour leader seemed vaguely distracted and not at the top of his game. Perhaps it had all got too easy for Starmer and he had come to believe that all he needed to do was turn up, do his surgical QC schtick and wipe the floor with the prime minister. After an unsatisfactory opening skirmish on racism in the UK – surely now would have been the time for Starmer to ask if Boris regretted his own use of the terms “picaninnies” “watermelon smiles” and “letterboxes” and whether that might have normalised racist attitudes to people from BAME communities – in which Boris was allowed to suggest he had already implemented the Lammy and Windrush reports in full, the Labour leader did land a telling blow on the coronavirus death rate. Which bit of the excess 63,000 deaths was the PM proud of? Boris’s reply that it was too early to make international comparisons fell hopelessly flat. How many people does he need to die – 100,000? 200,000? – before he admits the UK response to the pandemic has been far worse than almost every other country in the world? If we had the mortality rates of South Korea or Germany, Boris would be the first person to sing his own praises. World-beating only cuts one way for Johnson. You could tell that Boris sensed he was getting away with it as Starmer moved on to the government’s failure to plan for children returning to school. The familiar entitled confidence and swagger began to shine through. Out came the long words (“tergiversation” was reminiscent of a wannabe Will Self, only without the smack) as first he accused Starmer of being a rent-a-gob lawyer – a bit rich coming from someone who has been sacked from several jobs for lying – and then brazenly insisting it was basically Labour’s fault that most children would not go back to school before September at the earliest. By now Starmer had run out of questions, so he had to just suck it up as Johnson began to ad lib like some bloated Mr Toad. The two-metre rule was under review – as in would be dispensed with ASAP regardless of what the scientific advice happened to be – and the world would be returning to some kind of order. What was the point of reopening zoos and theme parks if kids were stuck in schools unable to enjoy them? The Labour leader shook his head. He had missed a trick, but wouldn’t be making the mistake of underestimating his opponent again. In the end it was the SNP’s Kirsty Blackman who landed the most telling blow by asking the prime minister to condemn Donald Trump’s response to the death of George Floyd. Boris couldn’t even bring himself to equivocate, instead calling the US “a bastion of peace and freedom”. A response that confirmed what many people think he really believes: that when push comes to shove, Black Lives Don’t Really Matter. After a couple of hours’ shut-eye, Johnson was back on view – he’d make a good exhibit in the sloth enclosure for next Monday’s zoo reopenings – for the Downing Street press briefing. Here, once he had waffled his way through his big announcement that single people were now free to resume their affairs – who could he have had in mind? – things got noticeably more tricky for Boris than they had been at PMQs. Why had he been so disorganised in getting children back to school? “Um ...” said Boris. He’d have liked to get children back sooner but that would have meant a level of planning and preparation of which his government was completely incapable. Besides, it had been impossible to predict you could only get 15 kids in a classroom even though everyone had been saying just that for months. In any case, the UK wasn’t doing noticeably worse on schools than any other countries. Here was one international comparison he was happy to make. Boris initially dodged the more telling question raised by Prof Neil Ferguson earlier in the afternoon that the UK could have halved its death rate by introducing lockdown a week earlier, instead letting Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty take the flak. Both advisers are now showing worrying signs of having gone over to the dark side. Vallance merely played for time by talking of a range of different scenarios while Whitty initially answered a completely different question to the one asked, before his integrity kicked in. Eventually, though, after repeated questioning on the same subject, Boris was backed into a corner by Sky’s Beth Rigby, who asked if there was something he regretted. Anything he might have done differently. The prime minister merely hummed and hawed. “But you take the decisions,” Rigby insisted. This seemed to come as news to Boris. He hadn’t realised that was part of the job description and scuttled out of the room as soon as was indecently possible. Not to be seen again for another week."
2020-06-10T15:46:11Z,politics,Politics,Labour calls on Robert Jenrick to make statement over billionaire's donation,"Labour has called for Robert Jenrick to make a statement to parliament after it emerged a billionaire developer donated to the Conservatives two weeks after the communities secretary intervened in a planning decision to potentially save the businessman millions of pounds. The shadow communities secretary, Steve Reed, said Jenrick should also agree to publish all correspondence connected to his decision about the huge property development in east London led by Richard Desmond. Reed has been granted an urgent question in the Commons on Thursday to pursue the issue. In January, Jenrick overruled the local council and the government’s planning inspectorate to approve the 1,500-apartment, 44-storey complex for Desmond, the former owner of the Express newspapers, on the site of a former newspaper print works on the the Isle of Dogs. He made the decision on 14 January, a day before the introduction of a community infrastructure levy (CIL) imposed by Tower Hamlets council, which would have charged Desmond’s company at least £40m, to be used for local education and health projects. Jenrick’s department has since said that the approval of the project will be looked at again. The minister accepted the decision letter did show “apparent bias” and recused himself from any future decisions over Desmond’s project. New donation figures published by the Electoral Commission show that two weeks later, on 29 January, Desmond gave £12,000 to the Conservative party. A previous Tory donor, Desmond has also given money to Ukip in the past. Reed tweeted that Jenrick should “publish all correspondence related to this decision”. He added: “After this latest revelation he must make a full statement to parliament.” It has previously emerged that in November, Jenrick had sat on the same table as Desmond at a Conservative party fundraising event in London. Jenrick, who has denied any bias, says the pair did not discuss Desmond’s east London project. Documents disclosed last month from the consent order for the development showed Jenrick was aware that the CIL would have been introduced on 15 January. These can be imposed to tax on large property developments per square metre. Labour has already called for an investigation into the matter. In May, the shadow housing and planning minister, Mike Amesbury, wrote to the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, to say the Cabinet Office should investigate Jenrick’s actions. In a statement released after news of the new donation emerged, Amesbury said: “Robert Jenrick should come clean and publish all correspondence with Richard Desmond about this case – otherwise the public will be entitled to think it’s one rule for the Conservatives and their wealthy friends, and another rule for everyone else.” A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokeswoman said the donation was a matter for the Conservative party. She said: “While we reject the suggestion that there was any actual bias in the decision, we have agreed that the application will be redetermined.” A Conservative party spokeswoman said: “Government policy is in no way influenced by party donations – they are entirely separate. Donations to the Conservative party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law.” Desmond was contacted for comment."
2020-06-10T15:39:24Z,politics,Politics,Director of public prosecutions threatened with legal action over failure to investigate Dominic Cummings,"The director of public prosecutions, Max Hill, is being threatened with legal action over the failure to investigate Dominic Cummings for alleged breaches of the lockdown rules. A legal team, headed by the barrister Michael Mansfield, has twice written to Hill, expressing concern that no action has yet been taken against Cummings after a Guardian and Daily Mirror investigation revealed the prime minister’s chief adviser travelled with his family to Durham and Barnard Castle during the lockdown. The letters were sent on 3 and 8 June on behalf of Martin Redston, a 70-year-old London engineer who is concerned that the lockdown laws should apply to everyone irrespective of their position in government. Replying to Redston’s second letter, Hill’s office confirmed his complaint had been passed to a special crime division of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and a full response would follow in “due course”. But it stopped short of saying the matter was being actively considered, as requested by Redston’s legal team, which also includes the firm Hackett & Dabbs. In a new letter to Hill sent on Tuesday, Redston’s lawyers claim the failure to provide a substantive response were grounds for a judicial review. And it threatened to begin proceedings if no action is taken by Hill by 4pm on Thursday 11 June. The letter said the demand for urgency was “proportionate” given “a very serious loss of public confidence in the due process of the rule of law” at a time of a continued public health emergency that requires public compliance. It also warned any delay risked losing evidence such as CCTV footage and credit card records relating to Cummings’ movements in the north-east. The letter also pointed out that in his statement from the rose garden of Downing Street, Cummings admitted returning to work at No 10 on 27 March after tending to his wife who was displaying symptoms of coronavirus. He then admitted travelling to Durham with his wife to seek childcare for their four-year-old son, the letter pointed out. A spokesman for Hill and the CPS said: “We have responded to the letter today referring those involved to the relevant police force as investigating alleged offences is a matter for the police not the CPS.” Redston’s lawyers point out that under the CPS’s own policy it may receive an allegation of an offence from a member of the public and can refer such cases to the police. Redston, whose complaint is being funded by donations to Crowd Justice, said: “The prime minister was absolutely unequivocal when he said people needed to ‘Stay at home, Protect the NHS and Save Lives’. The rules were entirely clear and should apply to everyone.” He said he was prevented from attending a friend’s funeral due to the lockdown restrictions. And he has also been unable to see his grandchildren since the start of the outbreak. After recovering from coronavirus, Cummings admitted travelling to Barnard Castle with his family on 12 April to test his eyesight. An initial three-day investigation by Durham police into Cummings’ travels found that he might have breached health protection regulations when he took a 52-mile round trip to the town. But it said Cummings’ 516-mile round trip from London to Durham and back had not broken health protection regulations. The force decided to take no further action after making no finding in relation to “stay at home” government guidance. On Sunday, a separate campaign for a new investigation into Cummings over alleged breaches was launched, by lawyers with the backing of health workers and some families of coronavirus victims. • The headline of this article was amended on 11 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to the director of public prosecutions as the “UK’s top prosecutor”.

2020-06-10T14:53:47Z,politics,Politics,Switch from public transport could put 1m more cars on English and Welsh roads,"A million more cars could be on the road in England and Wales each day if public transport commuters with cars switch to driving, research has warned. The government has told the public to avoid buses, trams and trains and to walk, cycle or drive instead, with some estimates suggesting public transport capacity will be cut to a sixth or less of its former rate to accommodate physical distancing. Research from Rachel Aldred, a professor of transport at Westminster University’s active travel academy, says that unless local authorities make it significantly easier and more pleasant to cycle to work safely, the percentage of people who drive to work will increase from 60% to 70%, with an estimated 1.06m more cars on the road. However, the analysis also found that with rapid changes to road layouts and new policies to make walking and cycling safer and more attractive, up to half of all public transport journeys – those of 10km (6.2 miles) or less – could be made by bike or on foot, resulting in up to 2m more active journeys than before the pandemic. Such a big switch would aid physical distancing, and the increase in physical exercise alone would avert at least 500 premature deaths annually. Such a move would also prevent a post-lockdown rise in carbon emissions that could jeopardise climate change goals. Last month the government announced £225m for local authorities in England to create pop-up cycle lanes with protected space for cycling, wider pavements, safer junctions, and bike and bus-only corridors. On Wednesday it also announced that from 22 June, local authorities will have new powers to use CCTV to issue penalty charge notices to drivers who park or load illegally in mandatory cycle lanes – those demarcated with a solid white line, meaning motorists are not allowed to enter – thus putting cyclists at risk of a serious accident. Some councils have already announced ambitious plans to get people cycling and walking during the pandemic, while others have been paralysed by infighting. The West Midlands combined authority said on Tuesday it was spending £3.4m on various temporary measures, including a pop-up cycle lane from Coventry city centre to Birmingham canal basin and shutting much of Wolverhampton city centre to cars. Leicester has introduced a key workers corridor for people cycling to work and Transport for London recently announced a new protected bike lane on Euston Road. In Greater Manchester, a row kicked off at the weekend after it emerged Manchester city council had refused to build any pop-up cycle lanes to help commuters from the surrounding nine districts get into the city and was instead concentrating on pedestrianising parts of the centre. The Guardian understands that the nine boroughs all want to install segregated bike lanes on key routes into Manchester, but that the city council’s refusal to cooperate means they all stop abruptly at the Manchester border. Andrew Gwynne, the MP for Denton and Reddish – which straddles the Greater Manchester boroughs of Tameside and Stockport – has accused the city council of “endangering lives and potentially increasing air pollution” by refusing to help people cycling in to Manchester from those districts. On Friday the city council said it did not support temporary cycling infrastructure, saying: “Long-term, sustainable modal shift to bikes is best supported through investment in creating safe, durable cycling infrastructure.” But on Wednesday it softened its position, saying: “Where neighbouring local authorities are planning to create temporary pop-up cycle lanes which approach Manchester, the council will work with partners in each case, to ensure that safety for all road users is prioritised.” At his weekly press conference on Wednesday. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said the region had submitted a £21.5m bid to the government for temporary measures to improve walking and cycling, including 200km of pop-up bike lanes, 94km of which are on “strategic routes”."
2020-06-10T12:14:44Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer tells PM to take responsibility for his failures on schools,"Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson have clashed at prime minister’s questions over the delay to the full reopening of schools, with the Labour leader saying Johnson should take “responsibility for his own failures” on the issue. In an increasingly heated exchange, Starmer repeatedly accused the government of having no coherent plan for the return of all pupils, after it emerged that the bulk will remain at home until September at the earliest due to the coronavirus. In response, Johnson accused Starmer of inconsistency on the subject, and insisted he had sought to take a consensual approach. The Labour leader challenged Johnson about why he had not replied to a letter seeking a cross-party taskforce on the return of schools, castigating what he said was ministerial chaos on the subject. “What it required for that to happen was a robust national plan, consensus among all key stakeholders and strong leadership from the top,” Starmer told the Commons. “All three are missing. The current arrangements lie in tatters. Parents have lost confidence in the government’s approach. Millions of children will miss six months’ worth of schooling, and inequality will now go up.” Johnson replied that he had been “in contact with the right honourable gentleman via a modern device called the telephone”, an apparent reference to a previous conference call with all opposition leaders, which was not in response to Starmer’s letter. “Last week he was telling the house that it was not yet safe for kids to go back to school,” the prime minister said. “This week he’s saying that not enough kids are going back to school. I really think he needs to make up his mind.” Starmer responded: “The taskforce has never been the subject of a conversation between him and me, one to one or any other circumstance on the telephone. He knows it, so please drop that.” He said the government had instead tried to push ahead with its plans for schools with no consultation. “It’s no good the prime minister flailing around, trying to blame others. It’s time he took responsibility for his own failures.” Starmer demanded the government look at the possibility of erecting temporary school buildings to provide more space for pupils to return. Johnson replied: “He still can’t work out whether he’s saying schools are not safe enough, or whether we should be going back more quickly. He can’t have it both ways.” This was wrong, Starmer argued. “I want as many children to go back to school as possible, as soon as possible, when it’s safe. I’ve been saying that like a broken record for weeks on end.” Earlier in the exchange, Johnson had insisted it was not yet possible to compare the UK’s high coronavirus death rate with that in other countries. Starmer noted death totals ranging from more than 40,000 to above 60,000, saying: “Those overall numbers haunt us. “These are amongst the highest numbers anywhere in the world. Last week the prime minister said he was proud of the government’s record. But there’s no pride in those figures, is there?” The PM replied: “The best scientific evidence and advice is that we must wait until the epidemic has been through its whole cycle in order to draw the relevant international comparisons.”"
2020-06-10T11:43:39Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit: EU may veto UK trade deal lacking safeguards, leaked report reveals","The European parliament could veto any trade deal between the UK and the European Union that lacks “robust” safeguards to ensure fair competition and strong standards on the environment and workers’ rights, according to a leaked document. A draft resolution, seen by the Guardian, which will be put to a vote on Friday, underlines the implicit threat to block the EU-UK trade deal. Urging the British government to “revise its negotiation position”, the text states that a level playing field is the “necessary condition for the European parliament to give its consent to a trade agreement with the UK”. The level playing field – common standards on environment, workers’ rights and state subsidies for companies – is one of the main stumbling blocks of Brexit talks that has contributed to the current deadlock. The parliament’s text underlines the narrow room for manoeuvre available to the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who last week hinted at a possible concession on state aid – the rules that limit government subsidies for companies. Barnier declined to back publicly the EU’s opening demand that European rules on state aid must be written into UK law. The parliament resolution, however, states that EU standards must be safeguarded to avoid a “race to the bottom”, while revealing little slack to escape the EU’s opening position of matching EU rules on state aid – so-called “dynamic alignment”. Brussels sources have played down talk of imminent compromise on the crucial issue of state aid.
EU officials want to see a common approach on state aid that means the UK and EU would move together in adapting rules in response to the economic outlook. In recent weeks, many EU restrictions on company bailouts and subsidies have been lifted in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Brussels wants to ensure similar coordination between EU and UK state aid rules in future. “But the substance doesn’t exist right now,” an EU official said. “We made important commitments in the political declaration. The UK has not followed up on this. And it is also worrying that we have no idea what the UK state aid control system will look like as of 1 January 2021.” State aid was one of the most difficult issues, said an EU diplomat, who added it was too early to speak of a compromise. EU sources said the absence of strong international rules makes state aid especially complex. “You have the [World Trade Organization] agreement on subsidies but it is an old agreement and it is not easy to use. So it’s not really enough. You would need to find something else.” British officials have also played down talk of a breakthrough on state aid – and there were no detailed discussions in the latest round of talks. In a recent letter to Barnier, the UK chief negotiator, David Frost, described the EU’s demand that the UK accept state aid rules as “egregious”. Sources say the government cannot be constrained in its ability to run its own rules on state aid. “We cannot accept any alignment with EU rules, the appearance of EU law concepts, or commitments around internal monitoring and enforcement that are inappropriate for [a free trade agreement],” Frost has said. Meanwhile, Brussels has low expectations of a reset emerging from a meeting between Boris Johnson and the EC president, Ursula von der Leyen, expected later this month. Attention is focusing instead on whether the next round of talks – pencilled in for early July – can proceed in a different way to help the search for compromise. The European parliament’s trade and foreign affairs committees will vote on the draft resolution on Friday, while all MEPs will be able to have their say next week."
2020-06-09T17:50:08Z,politics,Politics,Williamson can hardly fiddle the science when he can't count to two | John Crace,"There are limits to how you can fiddle the science. Only yesterday Matt Hancock had come up with the brilliant idea that the reproduction rate – the R rate – didn’t much matter anyway after it had stubbornly refused to drop from between 0.7 and 0.9. Today, though, Gavin Williamson had to bow to the inevitable. No matter how he looked at it 2 metres was never going to be less than 2 metres. Not even if, as Jacob Rees-Mogg had suggested, you try turning it into feet and inches. The education secretary had even pleaded with his scientific advisers, begging them to say that 2 metres were actually only 1 metre. Or at a push 1.5 metres. But after months of finding their work being corrupted by the government to suit its own ends, the scientists dug their heels in. The social-distancing requirement would still be set at 2 metres. On a few occasions in the past, Williamson has given flashes of the panache that won him fireplace salesman of the year in two consecutive years in 2006 and 2007, but today he was very much the bullied chemistry supply teacher as he had to explain to the Commons that he had badly miscalculated how quickly some children would be returning to school. His promise that all primary school children would get at least some time in school before the summer holidays had been an error. When Gavin had done the maths, he had been certain he could get at least 30 children into a classroom; but that was before he had learned that it wasn’t practical to suspend at least half the class from the ceiling in order for all the children to maintain a safe social distance from each other. So now he was having to work on the basis of just 15 children at most in any one classroom at any given time, which meant that at least half the rest of the kids would have to stay at home. Which rather put the kibosh on the rest of the summer term for all those year groups not in the first wave of returnees. Not that all those who had been due to restart school the previous week had done so, but that was another story ... Let’s deconstruct the extent of Gavin’s idiocy a little further. Donald Rumsfeld struggled with both the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns. The education secretary failed to even get to grips with the known knowns. Williamson knew back in March that there was a coronavirus pandemic that had caused all schools to close. He knew that meant that all children would have to be home-schooled after a fashion and that the vulnerable and less well-off would be likely to fall behind their peers. Gavin also knew that at some point the lockdown measures would be eased gradually. The only thing he didn’t know was that 2 metres could not be rounded down to 3ft. Which is the one thing that almost every primary school-aged kid did know. So how did the education secretary use the two-and-a-half months to prepare for schools reopening? By doing next to nothing. All Ga had to say for himself was that he would be following the science, he hoped more kids would get back to school once teachers had had more time to prepare and that with any luck all schools would be fully open again by September. Though nobody should bank on it. The shadow education secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, was almost lost for words in reply. Where to start? An apology to the teaching unions who the government had blamed last week for so many schools failing to open on time for the three years groups due back. Headteachers had been screaming about the difficulties of social distancing for weeks but no one had listened. Even parents had been more clued up than the department of education and had refused to allow their kids back until they were sure it was safe. But we were where we were, so Long-Bailey did try to offer some useful tips on what to do next. More localised support for children whose schools might be locked down again if the R rate went above 1 in their areas. A full programme of summer schools, free access to the internet, free school meals over the summer holidays. Anything to reduce the inevitable growth in inequality that six months and more of missed formal education would bring about. A few sycophantic stooges, such as Tory Danny Kruger, apart, MPs from all sides piled in. Just how had the education secretary let things get this bad? This wasn’t just bad management, it was a national humiliation that would affect kids for years to come. Ga looked more crest-fallen than apologetic. The natural response of someone who still wasn’t quite aware of just how awful things really were. There would be some kind of summer school but he probably wouldn’t be able to say what exactly until the autumn. He wouldn’t be offering free school meals because it would be good for kids to either lose weight or learn useful shoplifting skills. And exams would definitely be taking place next summer regardless of how much schooling anyone had got. The GCSE maths syllabus would include a question on what percentage of children could be expected to know stuff they hadn’t been taught. But all was not lost, Gavin said desperately. He had already handed out 100,000 free laptops and was planning to dole out another 230,000 in the coming months by which time it would hopefully be too late for some kids to catch up on lessons they had missed. “That’s great,” said Lib Dem Layla Moran. But the chair of the education select committee had already pointed out there were 700,000 children with no access to laptops. So by her reckoning that still left 370,000 kids education-free. Ga opened and closed his mouth, before saying nothing. Moran just shook her head. She was wasting her breath. Given that the education secretary can barely count to two, it was expecting far too much of him to cope with subtracting large numbers."
2020-06-09T17:31:41Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: non-essential shops in England to open from Monday; UK death toll rises by 286,"Alok Sharma, the business secretary, has confirmed that non-essential shops in England can open from Monday, saying the move will “allow high streets up and down the country to spring back to life”. Hundreds more deaths from Covid-19 in the north-west of England and in care homes have driven up the number of excess fatalities since the UK went into lockdown to more than 63,000, a toll believed to be greater than anywhere else except the US. Only one in four children returned to schools in England last week, wrecking Boris Johnson’s ambitions for a phased reopening of schools to allow parents back to work to boost the economy. The Department for Education released the figures as Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, confirmed that primary schools will not have to take any more pupils before the end of the summer term. Williamson also told MPs that it would take a year or more to repair the damage done to pupils’ education by the time spent in lockdown. (See 2.30pm.) Ministers need to rebuild public trust in their handling of the coronavirus outbreak and compensate people for lost earnings when asked to self-isolate to prevent a resurgence of the epidemic, leading scientists have warned. The UK government’s testing and contact-tracing system is not fit for purpose and will not be able to keep coronavirus in check as other countries have done, according to an independent group of scientists. That’s all from us for tonight. But the coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog."
2020-06-09T17:13:11Z,politics,Politics,"Local lockdowns will require local furlough schemes, say mayors","Local furlough schemes must be put in place to compensate workers and businesses in the event of any local lockdowns, regional politicians and business leaders have said. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, announced last month that “we will have local lockdowns in future where there are flare-ups” of coronavirus. But the government has yet to issue any detailed guidance, prompting consternation across local authorities about what such lockdowns will look like and how they will be enforced. Ben Houchen, the Conservative mayor of Tees Valley, said he could only support “micro lockdowns” to respond to an outbreak in a school, business or institutional setting, for instance. “I don’t see how you would enforce regional lockdown,” he said. “Teesside is actually split between the north-east and North Yorkshire. Are we putting the army on the border if one locks down and the other doesn’t?” He said micro lockdowns could only work “if we get track and trace right and proper testing”.
Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram, the mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool city region respectively, are both highly sceptical about local lockdowns. In a joint statement they called on the government to introduce a local furlough scheme for people whose workplaces may be closed down or who are unable to get to work. They said local authorities must be provided with sufficient funding to provide food and humanitarian assistance to the community for the duration of the lockdown. Businesses say that if they have an outbreak and are required to shut down, the government should cover their costs and commit to testing all employees quickly. “If we had to close down, we would expect coverage of our costs – that means total wage bills, total costs of the company to close,” said Richard Swart, the chief executive of Berger Closures in Peterlee, County Durham, which makes clamps and seals for the packaging, food and nuclear industries. “If we got an order to close down, they would have to have pretty strong grounds and it’s got to be proven that infections had happened.”
Berger’s sister company in Houston, Texas, had an outbreak of Covid-19 and shut its factory. “But they tested everybody within three days and were then able to open up again. That’s what should happen here, not people being told they should just self-isolate for two weeks without being tested,” Swart said. Jamie Driscoll, the mayor of the North of Tyne combined authority, said localised lockdowns could only work with proper testing and tracing, with results delivered “as close to real time as possible”. Peter McCall, the police and crime commissioner for Cumbria, noted that police already have the powers to enforce local lockdowns. McCall, a former army officer who served in Sierra Leone during an Ebola outbreak, suggested that ensuring people get enough food was arguably more important than policing on what he called “the bumpy road to zero”. In Sierra Leone, the army delivered food and water to those told to isolate. In a local coronavirus lockdown, he said, “it wouldn’t be beyond the wit of man to ask for x-postcode to get a priority for supermarket deliveries”."
2020-06-09T12:21:14Z,politics,Politics,"Britain will not seek to extend Brexit transition period, says minister","The UK government will tell the EU on Friday it is not going to seek an extension to the Brexit transition period, the paymaster general, Penny Mordaunt, has said. She told the House of Commons in an update on Brexit talks that she and Michael Gove would “emphasise that we will not be extending the transition period” when they meet EU counterparts at a Brexit joint committee meeting on Friday. It led to an immediate accusation of the government behaving recklessly, with the Scottish National party MP Pete Wishart accusing the Conservatives of trying to “heap misery upon misery” with Covid-19 and Brexit “the twin horsemen of the economic apocalypse” denying any prospect of recovery. Mordaunt insisted the country would not be “barrelling off a cliff edge” and hoped to have a deal by autumn. It said the government would be able to divert money from the EU coffers to to “level up” the British economy. Mordaunt also strongly hinted that no-deal planning was back on the table. Asked what preparations the government was making for a collapse in talks she told the House it “would be prudent and wise for us to prepare for every scenario”. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, pressed the government to honour the “oven-ready” deal Boris Johnson promised in his general election campaign. She was speaking as the former environment secretary Theresa Villiers said the government would not succumb to EU demands to access British fishing waters. “We are not going to see the compromises coming from Boris’s government,” Villiers said, arguing that the common fisheries policy (CFP) was “grossly unfair”. Her comments came days after Brexit talks over a future trade deal hit the buffers with four major areas of disagreement, including access to British seas for EU boats. “I just don’t see that the UK government is going to just shift in any substantive way from what is put on the table already,” Villiers told an Institute for Government webinar on Tuesday.
She said the government was “intensely conscious of how crucial fisheries are to the Scottish economy” and fishing communities and would defend them.
The impasse over sharing British fishing waters has thrown the prospects of a Brexit deal into disarray, with the UK and the EU calling for an acceleration of talks to try to break the logjam in July. The UK has consistently said it will not extend the transition period, which ends in December. Catherine Barnard, a senior fellow at the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, said in a briefing launching a separate report published on Tuesday that the threat of no deal raised the prospect of ugly fish wars in addition to trouble over the jurisdiction of the European court of justice in disputes over trade and state aid. The EU, she said, also wanted the UK to stay committed to the European convention on human rights, the international treaty between Council of Europe members (a 47-member non-EU body). Salmon exports, a significant part of Scotland’s fishing economy, would become a more expensive option for EU diners with a 2% tariff on fresh salmon and 13% on smoked salmon. A recent study by the Wageningen University in the Netherlands suggested that while UK fishing would gain $420m (£400m) from having exclusive access to UK waters, it would lose $500m from the imposition of tariffs and non-tariff barriers on its exports, said James Kane, an associate at the independent thinktank the Institute for Government. Villiers, who campaigned for Brexit, said the fishing communities “were sacrificed” when the UK joined the European Community in 1973 and would be defended. “It is not the stated intention that we would keep our own British waters exclusively free for our boats, but I think many people including myself believe that that historic share of resources to which British vessels have had access on CFP is grossly unfair, and we do need to remedy that.” Two weeks ago, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, consulted 11 fishing ministers about his mandate but UK hopes of a “more realistic” approach from the EU failed to materialise in the fourth round talks last week. While fishing remains one of the most emblematic issues for Brexiters, the report by UK in a Changing Europe warns of the wider implications. Crashing out would strain future relations with the EU and according to Barnard would present “significant legal trouble”. While some believe Johnson is minded to bury the economic and business pain of no deal in the coronavirus crisis, Jonathan Portes, one of the report’s authors, said he did not think the economic shock of the pandemic would “provide much of a smokescreen, as it were for the economic impacts of what happens in January”.
“Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit are major shocks for the UK economy. The interaction of the two is complex and unpredictable, with the potential to amplify some impacts while moderating others,” he said. “On balance, the pandemic probably does make the economic risks of exiting transition on January 2021 without a trade deal larger, but considerable uncertainties remain.” The senior fellow Jill Rutter said the politics of crashing out at the end of the year without the trade deal promised “are a bit underplayed at the moment” with a price expected to be exacted by Keir Starmer’s Labour party if a deal does not emerge in the autumn. • This article was amended on 12 June 2020 to name the body behind the European convention on human rights, the Council of Europe."

The former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King, who now leads the Independent Sage group, is calling for a new approach, warning that the measures in place in England will not be enough to pick up 80% of the contacts of people with the virus, which they say is needed to prevent the infection rate rising. “The government has placed huge emphasis on their test, track and trace system in recent weeks, even labelling it ‘world-beating’. It is clear from our research that this simply isn’t the case – indeed, the system as it stands is not fit for purpose,” King said. “This is the critical moment for the government to act now or risk further spikes. We believe that a new approach is required, one that moves away from a centralised system that utilises a local-first approach. We are calling on the government to urgently rethink their course to ensure that we have a system in place that will help and not hinder the country’s recovery.”
Independent Sage is a group of 12 leading scientists who have been critical of the government’s handling of the pandemic. It was set up partly in response to a lack of transparency around the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The membership of Sage and minutes and documents relating to its meetings have since been published. The independent group’s report points out that the epidemic is still growing in some parts of the country, such as north-west England. They say erosion of trust in the government in recent weeks will make it less likely that people will comply if they are called by contact-tracers and told they must self-isolate. “If Covid‐19 is to be eliminated, as New Zealand has shown is possible, then at least 80% of all close contacts of those with Covid‐19 infection (the index case) must remain isolated for 14 days so that they are unable to pass on infection to others. This is clearly not happening,” says the report. It argues for a more comprehensive system than just test and trace. The report says it should be “find, test, trace, isolate and support”. Speed is vital: the scientists point out that Sage itself advised that the aim should be to isolate as many contacts as possible within 48 hours. Test results should be available within 24 hours, says Independent Sage. Those who are isolated should have financial support and accommodation provided if they need it. And the scientists say the system depends on a high level of trust and should be run by the local authority directors of public health who know their communities."
2020-06-08T21:57:02Z,politics,Politics,'I hear you': Boris Johnson to Black Lives Matter protesters,"Boris Johnson has responded to the Black Lives Matter protests with an article acknowledging the “incontrovertible, undeniable feeling of injustice” motivating the rallies, while condemning those who have flouted social distancing to attend them during a “time of national trial”. The prime minister used the piece in The Voice, and a subsequent video in which he read the text aloud, to set out his response to the protests that saw the statue of slave trader Edward Colston torn down in Bristol and resulted in more than 100 arrests across the UK. “The death of George Floyd took place thousands of miles away – in another country, under another jurisdiction – and yet we simply cannot ignore the depth of emotion that has been triggered by that spectacle, of a black man losing his life at the hands of the police,” Johnson said. “In this country and around the world his dying words – I can’t breathe – have awakened an anger and a widespread and incontrovertible, undeniable feeling of injustice, a feeling that people from black and minority ethnic groups do face discrimination: in education, in employment, in the application of the criminal law. “And we who lead and who govern simply can’t ignore those feelings because in too many cases, I am afraid, they will be founded on a cold reality.” Johnson added: “You are right, we are all right, to say Black Lives Matter; and to all those who have chosen to protest peacefully and who have insisted on social distancing – I say, yes of course I hear you, and I understand. “But I must also say that we are in a time of national trial, when for months this whole country has come together to fight a deadly plague. After such sacrifice, we cannot now let it get out of control.” The home secretary, Priti Patel, has said official estimates suggest 137,500 people have attended the marches. Johnson said BAME communities had “been at the forefront of the struggle against coronavirus – whether in healthcare or transport or social care or any of the other essential services that have kept our country going” – and acknowledged that “it is BAME communities, tragically, that have paid a disproportionate price”. “So no, I will not support those who flout the rules on social distancing, for the obvious reason that we risk a new infection at a critical time and just as we have made huge progress,” he added. He also echoed the insistence of Patel that those involved in what she called “hooliganism” would be brought to justice. “Those who attack public property or the police – who injure the police officers who are trying to keep us all safe – those people will face the full force of the law,” he said. Labour has supported the aims of the protesters, while condemning the minority who resorted to violence. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, told MPs on Monday: “I condemn those who have attacked the police, and I want to pay tribute to the police officers putting themselves in harm’s way over the weekend.” • This article was amended on 9 June 2020 to clarify that the 100 arrests made during the Black Lives Matter protests were across the UK, not in Bristol."
2020-06-08T18:56:55Z,politics,Politics,Hancock continues to play hide-and-seek behind an ever-changing science | John Crace,"Well silly old me. Having listened in on more of the Downing Street daily coronavirus briefings than I care to remember, I could have sworn that the R value – which measures how many people a Covid patient goes on to infect – was a vital factor in any plans for easing lockdown. I distinctly recall only last month – and the month before that – Matt Hancock, Boris Johnson and other government ministers saying that R was stuck at between 0.7 and 0.9 and was far too close to 1 to allow any relaxation of the guidelines. Other than for Dominic Cummings who was free to do exactly as he liked. How things change now that the government has eased some lockdown restrictions and is hellbent on easing a whole lot more as soon as possible, having begun to concentrate as much on the long-term economic implications of the pandemic as on the nation’s health. Not that the health secretary was keen to frame the argument in those terms when Labour brought him to the Commons to answer an urgent question on R and the government’s handling of the crisis. Rather he was at pains to hide behind the science that it is increasingly obvious he doesn’t understand any better than most of the rest of us. As so often these days, Matt’s natural enthusiasm couldn’t quite paper over a general sense of fatigue and tetchiness. More and more he is reverting to type: a junior account executive at a large firm of management consultants who tries to conceal his ignorance in jargon – “I’ve been very front foot,” he said in irritation at one point – and gets easily narked when people pick holes in his ideas. Today he sounded like someone who had spent the entire weekend trying to come to grips with a stack of academic papers but had struggled to make head or tail of any of them. Matt began with his default mantra that he was proud of the government’s record. A death rate of nearly 60,000, when the chief medical officer had said 20,000 would be “a good result”, and a YouGov poll showing the UK joint bottom with Mexico in an international survey of approval ratings for its handling of the pandemic seem strange things of which to be proud, but he said the country had done the right thing at the right time. The rest of Europe must be mightily relieved that it had chosen to do the wrong thing at the wrong time instead and somehow avoided the UK’s disastrous public health outcomes. Having got all that off his chest – it’s become a kind of daily affirmation for him to remind himself that he could possibly have done worse – Hancock moved on to the more substantive detail. The number of new infections was going down, the coronavirus was in retreat and all that stuff he had said in the past about significantly bringing down R could now be ignored. All he had really meant was that as long as it stayed stable at just under 1, the government was free to relax its lockdown guidelines. At a stroke, R had just been reduced to near zero. At least in the level of importance to which the government attached to it. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, was understandably sceptical. Hadn’t Prof John Edmunds, one of the government’s scientific advisers, only said at the weekend that the government had locked down too late and was taking a huge gamble on easing restrictions so soon? And hadn’t the health secretary also once said that another key instrument in relaxing health guidelines was to get a proper track and trace system in place? Something the track and trace programme director had said wouldn’t be ready for at least another three weeks. But Matt was adamant. He was being guided by the science. Because what he had learned from the whole pandemic was that if one scientist disagrees with you, it’s fairly straightforward to find another who will support whatever you want to do. So even though some epidemiologists were reporting R was higher than 1 in parts of the UK, he had some others who said it wasn’t. The time had come to take a punt on the nation’s health and go with the most optimistic science. Something he was sure the brand new Joint Biosecurity Centre would agree on when it finally came into existence. Inevitably it wasn’t long before Tory MP Harriett Baldwin brought up the Black Lives Matter protests. Shouldn’t the protesters have made more effort to socially distance rather than get so up close and personal with one another? Matt nodded enthusiastically. If there was a spike in infections in two week’s time then we would all know who to blame. At which point R will presumably be wheeled out of retirement and allowed to take centre stage once more. The protests were also the subject of a ministerial statement from Priti Patel. It’s always a hard sell saying the government finds racism abhorrent when the prime minister once made a good living out of dashing off Daily Telegraph columns about picaninnies with watermelon smiles and women in burkas resembling letter boxes, but the home secretary did her best to gloss over the hypocrisy. She then – through gritted teeth – defended people’s right to protest before condemning violence against the police and criminal damage. There were no arguments from Labour on any of these last points. Violence and tearing down statues had no place in our society. And yet you couldn’t miss the faint whiff of hypocrisy on both sides of the house. Almost all those who were appalled by Edward Colston being dumped in the river had cheered when the statue of Saddam Hussein had been torn down. Nor was anyone calling for Colston to be reinstated on its plinth. Quite the reverse in fact, as many people in Bristol and elsewhere were rethinking the importance of figures with a murky colonial past in their cities. It was almost as if the protesters had done everyone a favour. They had got rid of a statue no one wanted and allowed the politicians to sound high-minded about the way in which it had been done. In Westminster they call that a win-win."
2020-06-08T18:42:31Z,politics,Politics,Labour's left uneasy with leader's view on tearing down Colston statue,"The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, sparked unease among some on the left of his party on Monday, as he condemned as “completely wrong” the tearing down of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol at the weekend. Starmer and the shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said they shared the sense of injustice that had brought more than 100,000 people out on to the streets of the UK to join Black Lives Matter protests in recent days. But in a clear shift in tone from Jeremy Corbyn’s attitude to civil disobedience, Starmer told LBC radio: “It shouldn’t have been done in that way, [it was] completely wrong to pull a statue down like that.”
He added: “Stepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. We can’t, in 21st century Britain, have a slaver on a statue. A statue is there to honour people. “That statue should have been brought down properly, with consent, and put, I would say, in a museum.” Some leftwing Labour MPs privately expressed concern at what they felt was an unfortunate departure from Corbyn’s approach. Speaking in the House of Commons later in the day, Thomas-Symonds used a similar phrase to Starmer, saying, “I do not condone an act of criminal damage to remove it, but I will not miss a public statue of a slave trader.” Thomas-Symonds was responding to the home secretary, Priti Patel, who insisted: “Black Lives Matter, but police brutality in the US is no excuse for the violence against our brave police officers at home. So to the quiet, law-abiding majority, who are appalled by this violence, and have continued to act within the rules, I hear you.” The shadow home secretary made a series of demands of the government, including calling for Patel to act on the recommendations of the Wendy Williams review into the Windrush scandal, and the 2017 David Lammy review into the experience of BAME people in the justice system. But his measured tone contrasted with passionate interventions from prominent leftwing Labour MPs, including Lloyd Russell-Moyle, Nadia Whittome and Zarah Sultana. Whittome had earlier tweeted, “I celebrate these acts of resistance. We need a movement that will tear down systemic racism and the slave owner statues that symbolise it. And we need to win a government that will always be on the side of this movement.” Thomas-Symonds’ predecessor, Diane Abbott, also sounded a note of caution about Labour’s approach. “Nobody supports criminal damage. But we need to be careful not to sound as if we care more about the vandalism than the horrors of the Atlantic slave trade,” she said. “The truth is that the community in Bristol tried for years to even get a plaque on the statue that mentioned slavery. They were blocked. The statue should have been taken down years ago. There is an excellent museum of slavery in Liverpool. That would be the right place for this statue, if it is eventually fished out of the water.” One Tory, representing a former “red wall” Labour seat said Starmer had a significant amount of work to do to eradicate the perception that Labour was soft on law and order. They said: “If there’s one thing my voters can’t stand, it’s rioting. To them, it’s an anathema to the democratic process.” They said their inbox was full of messages, including from ex-Labour voters, on the protests over the weekend. “People don’t want soft-touch policing.” Ben Bradley, the MP for Mansfield, which turned Tory after 100 years in 2017, said: “99% of my feedback from constituents is horror at the lack of law and order and at the lack of care for others by those breaking lockdown. Many have said they were sympathetic but not now, following the violence.” A group of seven “blue collar” Tory MPs also posed for pictures as they offered help to clean up the statue in Parliament Square of Winston Churchill, which had “is a racist” spray painted on it during the protest. One Labour MP in a red wall seat said: “These are the sorts of things that do test the fragility of the voter coalition that used to be very successful for us. Where we see divisions on issues like Brexit, law and order, immigration and so on – these do become our test points. I thought Keir navigated that very well.”"
2020-06-08T17:15:25Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel condemns minority at Black Lives Matter protests as 'thugs and criminals' â€“ as it happened,"Priti Patel, the home secretary, has said she backs the idea of a new law to make it easier to prosecute people who damage war memorials. She was speaking in the Commons during a statement on the Black Lives Matters protests and responding to the Conservative MP Jonathan Gullis who said residents in his Stoke-on-Trent North constituency were â€œoutragedâ€� at the Cenotaph graffiti and attempts to burn the Union flag. He asked Patel if she would back a desecration of war memorials bill. Patel replied: I completely support the sentiment and the point [Gullis] has just made. Earlier she said the â€œhooliganismâ€� of a minority of people attending the protests at the weekend was â€œutterly indefensibleâ€�. (See 5.16pm.) Patel said that she would not â€œtake lecturesâ€� from the opposition about racism because she had been a victim of it herself. (See 5.42pm.) She made the comment in response to claims that her hardline opening statement implied that she did not fully understand the anger felt by people about structural racism in Britain. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, adopted a more empathetic tone in his own statement about the protests. Like Patel and other government colleagues, he condemned the violence. But he was better at expressing what sounded like genuine commitment to the ongoing cause of building â€œa better societyâ€�. (See 4.45pm.) Sir Keir Starmer has said that it was â€œtotally wrongâ€� for BLM protesters in Bristol to pull down the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol yesterday. The toppling of the Colston statue has emboldened those seeking to replace other monuments or names associated with the slave trade or imperialism. In Oxford the campaign to get rid of a statute of Cecil Rhodes has been revived. In Bristol the Colstonâ€™s girlsâ€™ school has taken down its own Colston statute, and the Colston Hall is removing external signage ahead of a formal name change later this year. (See 3.23pm.) That is all from me for today. There is more politics coverage on our UK coronavirus live blog, which has been covering Matt Hancock at the UK governmentâ€™s daily press conference.

2020-06-08T14:05:36Z,politics,Politics,Green party joint leaders to stand again for their roles,"The two joint leaders of the Green party, Siân Berry and Jonathan Bartley, are to stand for their job-shared role again, declaring the time is right to seize the moment and become a mass-membership movement. Berry and Bartley have held the leadership since 2018, but the party holds a contest every two years to allow others to challenge for the top job. Bartley previously held the role jointly with the party’s only MP, Caroline Lucas, who stepped aside in 2018 saying it was time for the party to widen the pool of its prominent figures. The party will accept nominations until the end of June and then online voting will take place between 3 August and 31 August. In a joint statement announcing their intention to stand again, Berry and Bartley said it was a pivotal moment for their party.
They said: “The country is in crisis and at a crossroads, and the decisions being taken now will determine what our world looks like for decades to come. We face the fundamental question of whether we will address the climate and ecological emergency, and whether we will deal with the rampant inequality, racism and poverty that scars the lives of millions – or return to business as usual. “The Green party must seize this moment. We need to be bigger and better and become a mass-membership movement that demonstrates the new kind of leadership this country so desperately needs.” The party failed to add any seats at the 2019 election, winning just 2.7% of the vote, but Lucas increased her majority in Brighton Pavilion. The overall vote share was down on its 2015 performance of 3.6%, but up on the 2017 result of 1.6%, when the party was squeezed by the surge in support for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour. Berry and Bartley said: “When we were elected, we did so on a platform of working with the wider party leadership team to take the Greens to the next level. Over this time the party has grown its membership by over 50%. “Together we have more than doubled our number of councillors, and gone from being the official opposition on five councils to playing a part in running 18 councils. And the clarity and passion of our policies and values meant we had our most successful European elections ever, electing seven MEPs last year.” They said they would continue to put a green new deal policy and the climate emergency at the heart of the party’s agenda."
2020-06-08T10:00:59Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer: pulling down Edward Colston statue was wrong,"Keir Starmer said it was “completely wrong” for Black Lives Matter protesters in Bristol to pull down a statue of a slave trader and dump it in the harbour, while saying the monument should never have been there in the first place. Answering listeners’ questions on LBC radio, the Labour leader said the statue of Edward Colston should have been “brought down properly, with consent”, and placed in a museum. On Sunday, Boris Johnson said the weekend of protests, which also saw a few violent scenes in London, had been “subverted by thuggery” and promised police action.
However Marvin Rees, the mayor of Bristol, said he felt no “sense of loss” after the statue was pulled down, and the statue was a “personal affront” to him. The elected Labour mayor told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “As an elected politician, obviously I cannot condone the damage and I am very concerned about the implications of a mass gathering on the possibility of a second Covid wave. “But I am of Jamaican heritage and I cannot pretend that I have any real sense of loss for the statue and I cannot pretend it was anything other than a personal affront to me to have it in the middle of Bristol, the city in which I grew up.” Priti Patel, the home secretary, called the removal of the Colston statue “utterly disgraceful”. Kit Malthouse, the policing minister, said on Monday that those responsible should be prosecuted. “A crime was committed, criminal damage was committed. There should be evidence gathered and a prosecution should follow,” he told BBC Breakfast. Asked about the incident in the first of a regular series of phone-in sessions for LBC, Starmer condemned the scenes in Bristol, but stressed the context of Colston’s actions as a slaver. “It shouldn’t have been done in that way, completely wrong to pull a statue down like that,” he said. “Stepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. We can’t, in 21st century Britain, have a slaver on a statue. A statue is there to honour people. “That statue should have been brought down properly, with consent, and put, I would say, in a museum.” Starmer continued: “This was a man who was responsible for 100,000 people being moved from Africa to the Caribbean as slaves, including women and children, who were branded, on their chests, with the name of the company that he ran. Of the 100,000, 20,000 died en route and they were chucked in the sea. He should not be on a statue in Bristol, or anywhere else.” Responding to another question, Starmer condemned Barry Gardiner, the Labour MP and former shadow international trade secretary, for attending an earlier Black Lives Matter protest during the coronavirus lockdown. “No, he shouldn’t have done it. He was wrong to do it,” Starmer said. “If you’re a member of parliament, you lead by example, and that means we maintain social distancing, in accordance with the government’s guidance.” In a tweet on Sunday evening, Johnson had said: “People have a right to protest peacefully and while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police. These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery – and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve. Those responsible will be held to account.” Rees praised Avon and Somerset police’s decision to not intervene and try to stop the statue being pulled down. “I think our police were incredible actually, and this is intelligent, nuanced policing, not Trumpian militarisation domination,” he told BBC Breakfast."
2020-06-08T04:00:09Z,politics,Politics,UK diplomats fear end of special relationship if Trump re-elected,"The UK’s special relationship with the US may end if Donald Trump wins a second term, some of the UK’s most senior retired diplomats and Conservative foreign policy specialists have said. They also say that if the Democrat Joe Biden wins, Washington may view the EU rather than the UK as its primary partner. The anxious assessment of what is at stake for Britain in the US presidential election in November has been made on and off the record in a variety of seminars over the past month, and underlines concerns at Trump’s performance during the coronavirus pandemic. It also reflects diplomatic outreach to the UK by Biden’s chief foreign policy adviser, Antony Blinken. UK diplomats have instead been looking to form a broader alternative alliance of democracies that dilutes dependence on the US. Rory Stewart, the former Conservative international development secretary, said in one assessment: “If Trump comes in for another four years that will be very challenging for the global system and for Britain’s relationship with the US. If we were to move away from the US, and Trump obviously poses the challenge that that may have to happen, we are going to find ourselves in a situation in which much of our Foreign Office infrastructure had been predicated on working very closely with the US for a very long time. “If we have to move away from the US, it will involve a much bigger shift in national security infrastructure than we have ever experienced. Almost since Suez, they have been our default.”
The UK had taken for granted for years that it would fall into line with US foreign policy position, he said. Any change to that would require a rethink by the Foreign Office because it “sometimes had no idea what an independent policy would feel like”. Sir John Sawers, the former head of M16 and a former UK ambassador to the UN, also said Trump’s re-election would be problematic. “There is no doubt President Trump is the most difficult president for us to deal with,” he said. “He does not really feel that sense of being part of that transatlantic community, he does not really believe in alliances. He does not really believe in American leadership in the world. We are seeing in this pandemic for the first time what a crisis is like without American leadership. It is the first time in our lifetime we have experienced that. “If he gets elected for a second time some of the changes we have seen in the past few years will become embedded and entrenched and then, absolutely Britain will not be so much a bridge between the US and Europe. We will need to be bounding closely together with our European partners” . Speaking before the Black Lives Matter protests, he said the election was poised 50-50, and that if Biden were elected the UK would not simply be able to get back into bed with the US as it had been in the past. He called for “middle-level powers to come together to tackle China and climate change”. Both men were speaking at Cambridge University’s Centre for Geopolitics. In a sign of British diplomats’ despair with Trump, Sir Peter Westmacott, a former ambassador to Washington, said: “I would love to say, as we look to the future, would it not be nice to see political leadership also addressing old-fashioned principles such as accountability, respect for the rule of law, independent judiciary, telling the truth, institutional independence and indeed the importance of a free press? “That may not be what public opinion is crying out for, but they are not very far removed from the principles that … Biden believes in. Otherwise the chances of the western world retaining any sort of moral leadership and giving itself the right to call out other people when they behave badly will be gone forever.”
Debate is fierce in British diplomatic circles about whether Trump merely marks the acceleration of a pre-existing trend to a more disengaged US, and whether Biden is either willing or able to reverse the trend. Blinken has tried to reassure British diplomats that Biden will re-engage with multilateral institutions, and told the London thinktank Chatham House that US leadership would return. “When Joe Biden looks at the world, one thing stands out. Whether we like it not, the world tends not to organise itself and, for 75 plus years, the US played the leading role in working to organise the world, establishing the institutions, writing the rules and setting the norms,” he said. “If we are not doing that, then one of two things happen. Either someone else is, and probably not in a way that advances our interest and values, or no one is, and that can be even worse. Then you have a vacuum which tends to be filled by malevolent things before good things. So the US has a responsibility and self-interest in leading with humility.” Many senior former UK ambassadors are desperately hoping Washington will lead again. One said: “I think that if you have a different, more internationally minded leadership in the US then a lot of what has happened over the past few years can be reversed. If we get another four years of this leadership, then some of the bonds and some of the cement that holds the west together, and holds Europe and America together will be broken forever. If things change in November then we can recapture things if we get the right sort of leadership in Europe.” The same diplomat also said, however, that Biden might – like Barack Obama – see Europe and particularly Germany as his primary interlocutor: “If you get a Joe Biden presidency in the US, then the relationship will focus again on Europe, on Germany and France, and we may feel a little neglected.”
He said that although Boris Johnson was closer to Trump than most European leaders, the importance of the special relationship was overrated. “If I’m brutally frank it has not been that special for awhile,” he said. “If Obama wanted to know what Europe thought about something his first call was to Merkel.” Another ambassador from Tony Blair’s time as prime minister said: “It’s possible to imagine restored American leadership to a multilateral world. I do not think it is all over, but it does make the November election incredibly important. I cannot see that happening under a Trump II administration. It’s possible, however, to imagine Joe Biden trying to lead us back to a more normative, multilateral and cohesive world.” He pointed to Trump’s decision to withdraw 9,500 US troops from Germany as a sign of the pressure likely to be placed on Nato if he is re-elected. In his address to Chatham House, Blinken gave the impression that the US under Biden would seek to revive the Iran nuclear deal Obama signed but which Trump abandoned. Although he was unremitting in his criticism of Iran’s behaviour in the Middle East, he stressed that the original deal was designed to constrain Iran’s nuclear ambitions and not its wider behaviour. Blinken was also critical of China for its lack of transparency over the coronavirus, and called on Beijing to be a responsible stakeholder, a phrase first used in 2005 by the then US assistant secretary of state Robert Zoellick."
2020-06-07T19:00:02Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: UK fears EU chief negotiator has lost grip on fishing talks,"Downing Street fears that Michel Barnier has lost his grip on the fishing negotiations, throwing doubt over Boris Johnson’s hopes of a summer of swift and definitive progress towards a trade and security deal with the EU. The bloc’s chief negotiator had been expected to present a compromise proposal on access to British waters during the talks last week but was blocked at the last minute by member states with large fishing communities. British sources said an unexpected decision by fisheries ministers at a meeting with Barnier to reject a move away from their hardline position had “skewed things late in the process”, preventing a middle ground being found. Despite four rounds of talks on fisheries by videoconference call last week, a time commitment unmatched for any other issue, both sides confirmed on Friday that there had been no progress towards a deal. Barnier said “the EU wants the status quo, the UK wants to change everything”, but called for discussions “somewhere between”. As a result of the surprise logjam, recent discussions between the sides on moving the negotiations into a new intensive phase of face-to-face talks between Barnier and his counterpart, David Frost, in July have become more difficult. Downing Street wants to swiftly enter a “tunnel phase” over the summer during which member states would entrust Barnier to thrash out a trade and security deal without constant intervention by the EU capitals. France, the Netherlands, Spain, Ireland, Denmark, Belgium, Germany and Sweden have not yet offered their negotiator any flexibility on the key issue of fishing rights despite Barnier’s public calls for both sides to move from their “maximalist” positions. The EU now expects the talks to drag into October, a suggestion that senior UK sources insist is unacceptable given the need for businesses on both sides to prepare for the new trading environment that will come from any deal. Downing Street hopes Barnier will try again to move the EU capitals towards compromise. “We are now at an important moment for these talks,” a government spokesman said. “If we are to make progress, it is clear that we must intensify and accelerate our work. Any such deal must of course accommodate the reality of the UK’s well-established position on the so-called level playing field, on fisheries, and the other difficult issues.” When it comes to fishing rights, the EU wants to emulate the strictures of the common fisheries policy (CFP) from the end of 2020 when the UK leaves the transition period during which it has remained in the bloc’s single market and customs union. Under the CFP, the total allowable catch figures for different species of fish are negotiated annually by fisheries ministers. The respective share that each member state’s fleet then takes is based on catches recorded in the 1970s. British fishing communities have long claimed that the policy has left them with far too few fish to catch with notable inequities including that French fishermen have 84% of the cod quota in the English Channel. The UK is insisting it will be an independent coastal state from the end of 2020 and that there needs to be a new relationship with the EU in this area, similar to that enjoyed by Norway. The British negotiating side wants fishing rights to depend on where the fish live – a model known as zonal attachment. Frost has informed Barnier, however, that other factors such as the effect on coastal communities and longstanding rights could be a factor in annual negotiations to ensure that European fishing communities are not left bereft. Barnier had been expected to provide some data on how such external factors would affect the rights to catches but sources said that failed to materialise in the last week. “Until they give us some more, there is no way of using that to derive hard information about the numbers,” one UK source said. “That appears to be the difficulty. If they could do it we would happily talk to them about it and see what could be done.”"
2020-06-07T15:45:56Z,politics,Politics,UK death toll rises by 77 but no new deaths in Scotland or Northern Ireland – as it happened,"Hereâ€™s a roundup of todayâ€™s key UK coronavirus updates. The UKâ€™s coronavirus death toll has risen by 77 â€“ the lowest daily figure since the lockdown began. The official death toll of people who tested positive for Covid-19 across all settings now stands at 40,542, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Scotland and Northern Ireland have reported no new coronavirus deaths. However, the Scottish health secretary warned people that it was â€œvery likelyâ€� that more deaths would be recorded in the coming days, reiterating that there is often a lag in the registration of deaths over the weekend. Thousands of people have continued to attend anti-racism protests across the UK. In London, demonstrators gathered outside the US embassy before marching towards Downing Street. Protests also took place in cities including Edinburgh, Glasgow and Nottingham. The Met police confirmed that 29 people had been arrested at protest in the capital yesterday. Protesters in Bristol have pulled down a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston and dumped it in the River Avon. It happened after at least 5,000 people packed into the College Green area to hear from speakers and hold an eight-minute silence in memory of George Floyd, who was killed by police in the US. The nationwide lockdown â€œshould have started earlierâ€�, according to a Sage expert. The epidemiologist professor John Edmunds said he believed the governmentâ€™s â€œsituational awarenessâ€� in March would have made it difficult to impose measures sooner, but that the delay had â€œcost a lot of livesâ€�. In response, Matt Hancock said he was â€œsureâ€� the decision to impose lockdown on 23 March had not cost lives. Hancock said the government had â€œmade the right decisions at the right timeâ€�, but said lockdowns could be reimposed locally or nationally if infections rose significantly."
2020-06-07T07:15:44Z,politics,Politics,Covid-19 in the Commons: ‘How can you plot and keep two metres apart?',"Tuesday I get in to parliament early for a remote TV interview with Sky TV’s Kay Burley. She cuts me off saying “Chris Bryant loves to have the last word but I’m not going to let him!” Afterwards Twitter points out the record of Eartha Kitt singing I’m Still Here behind my left shoulder. I then battle with uncooperative IT before remotely chairing the standards committee. Then to the chamber. There are signs everywhere saying “keep left” (insert your own joke here) and “keep moving”. So the corridors of power are transitory. No huddles allowed. One of the whips quips: “How can you plot when you have to keep two metres apart?” The big issue of the day is whether MPs should be allowed to participate remotely from in front of their bookcases. Those with shielding responsibilities understandably don’t want to be excluded, but the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, winds us all up by saying we have to “return to work”, as we all feel as if we’ve been working 24/7 for weeks. We have two votes – on how to vote – which involve MPs traipsing round the bend for more than kilometre. Kevin Brennan calls it the “Mogg Conga” but none of us will qualify for Strictly. We lose the votes, but afterwards two members of the cabinet scold me: “We hoped you’d win.” Another tells me: “Keep on calling votes all the time, and they’ll give in pretty quickly.” Back home, I catch the appalling news from America. Wednesday Everyone looks about a decade older than when I last saw them. Or maybe it’s just their hair. Edward Timpson is sporting a bouffant in search of a medallion. Robert Courts boasts that his wife has cut his hair rather beautifully. Ed Miliband says his wife has had three goes at his, but he still looks very Desert Island. My No 4 clipper-cut doesn’t seem to impress anybody.
Since only 50 of us are allowed in the chamber at any one time, I sit in my office for a series of video meetings via Zoom, Teams and Skype. One is about the local after-effects of Storm Dennis. Lots of homes were flooded and parts of a coal tip slipped into the river. The council now have to find a new home for 60,000 tonnes of slag. I also catch up with local police, who tell me the Cummings saga has made enforcement of the lockdown 10 times more difficult. The rest of the day is taken up with trying to overturn the previous day’s votes. Ten minutes after I leave the Commons I hear the government has caved in. Some MPs can now participate remotely after all. Thursday I spend most of the morning in the chamber, asking questions about support for theatres and how coronavirus has hit the poor. Rees-Mogg tells us no MP should be too grand to queue, which makes me wonder when he last queued at Lidl. The Commons tearoom is open because it’s classed as a staff canteen. It’s a real luxury to eat food that I haven’t cooked myself. I drive back to the Rhondda. Friday I am inundated with emails and Facebook messages. Should people be camping on the top of the Rhigos mountain? Why is there a 5-mile limit in Wales? Should people cancel their summer holiday? One good thing. The Welsh government is giving a £500 bonus to care workers. Initially that left out ancillary staff, but now cooks and cleaners are getting it as well, so we just have to persuade Rishi Sunak not to tax it. I chat to a lady who is desperate to visit her husband, who is in a local care home. My heart goes out to her. The weekly catch-up with the council leader focuses on reopening schools and the campaign to keep the local A&E. In the 1st Trealaw Scouts Zoom meeting I am asked about chlorinated chicken and whether Boris Johnson needs a haircut. My mother-in-law Jo hasn’t seen a soul since lockdown began, so she was really looking forward to popping round to sit in the garden with us. It rained, so we huddled under separate trees."
2020-06-07T06:30:44Z,politics,Politics,Britain ‘absent from world stage’ by failing to condemn abuses by Trump and China,"Britain is “absenting itself from the world stage” by refusing to show leadership over Hong Kong residents, confront China or condemn President Trump over his handling of the fallout from George Floyd’s killing, the shadow foreign secretary has warned. In her most stinging attack on Britain’s foreign policy, Lisa Nandy said that the government was now displaying “a pattern of behaviour that is becoming very, very troubling”, and that the UK’s actions were being noted by leaders around the world. In an interview with the Observer, Nandy suggested that the offer made by Boris Johnson to hand “a route to citizenship” to around three million Hong Kong residents eligible for a British National (Overseas) passport was too vague to be taken seriously by Beijing. Britain’s reluctance to confront China was, however, part of a wider issue, she said.
“This is a pattern of behaviour that is really deeply worrying,” she added. “We have had the appalling scenes emerging from the US after the murder of George Floyd. Last weekend, the foreign secretary was asked what he made of that, and the way in which those protests have been handled. He said it wasn’t appropriate for him to comment. The prime minister has been remarkably silent about that as well. “It seems to me that we lose all moral authority to talk about police brutality in Hong Kong and elsewhere if we are not prepared to apply those standards equally to other parts of the world. This is a pattern of behaviour that’s becoming very, very troubling – that the UK is absenting itself from the world stage at precisely the moment when we need to show global leadership.” Nandy praised the work of former Tory foreign secretary William Hague, but warned that British foreign policy had been “entirely framed through the lens of growth and trade” since his departure in 2014. “That has led us into a position where we have been courting the Chinese government, praising the golden era of Sino-British relations, without paying due attention to the need to have strategic independence and to be able to speak from a position of our values. And it seems to me that we are repeating those mistakes in the bilateral relationships we are trying to strike up across the world in the wake of Brexit.”
Nandy said that while the prime minister’s offer to Hong Kong residents last week was “a big step forward from a standing start of absolutely nowhere”, there was a lack of clarity that meant anywhere between 350,000 and seven million Hong Kong residents could be affected. The offer was made as he urged China to rethink its controversial security law, which pro-democracy campaigners say threatens rights in Hong Kong. However, Nandy did not commit Labour to backing a scheme that would allow eligible Hong Kong residents to settle in the UK. “There’s a moral case for ensuring that people who want to leave Hong Kong can and that they’re provided with a safe haven elsewhere. But there is also a moral case to make sure that any sanctions that we pursue, while they have an impact on China, don’t unduly harm the people of Hong Kong.” She warned that the government’s approach to the threat to Hong Kong was part of its wider reluctance to confront Beijing: “We need a strategy at home and we need a strategy abroad in relation to the rise of China … and at the moment, we’ve got neither.” She also criticised the decision to involve Huawei in the UK’s 5G network, saying that a failure to develop domestic technology meant Britain was not in a “position of greatest strategic independence”. “The government is likely to bring forward a bill before the summer recess to chart a path forwards that will reduce dependence on Huawei in the 5G network. We would support that – we’ll obviously have to see the detail. “After Huawei, there will be other issues. I think there’s been a naivety about Britain’s approach to China in the past decade. I think perhaps we’re starting to see that change. And that is long overdue.”"
2020-06-06T19:35:30Z,politics,Politics,Cabinet unrest over U-turn on animal welfare in US trade talks,"Downing Street has been accused of reopening the door to imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef, after a leaked memo instructed ministers to have “no specific policy” on animal welfare in US trade talks. The letter from No 10 states that the ministerial mandate for the US negotiations was “being updated to reflect” the fact that the UK was to have no policy position on animal welfare. The revelation will raise more concerns about the government’s commitment to upholding “high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards”. The note, seen by the Observer and dispatched at the start of last month, gave approval for the US trade talks to go ahead and set out the conditions of engagement. It reveals serious cabinet unrest over the shape of a US deal and appears to suggest UK regulations could be changed to accommodate an agreement. It also makes clear that talks were to be used to “maximise leverage” in trade negotiations with the EU. “Consultation and agreement from relevant colleagues is sought before agreeing to change domestic policy or regulations as part of the negotiations,” it states. “In the context of preserving the integrity of UK domestic law, any decisions taken in sensitive areas … must take into account the potential legal implications for the UK and be agreed by the relevant ministers.” The memo reveals how contentious the US trade talks are regarded as being within the cabinet. Issues were raised by 11 cabinet ministers, including health secretary Matt Hancock, environment secretary George Eustice and Mark Spencer, the chief whip. “Written responses were received from the health secretary, foreign secretary, the chief whip, the business secretary, the environment secretary, the chancellor of the exchequer, the justice secretary, the defence secretary, the culture secretary, the Welsh secretary and the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,” it states. “All other members of the committee were content.” The briefing also states that a cabinet committee would return to the animal welfare issue “in June to settle all outstanding agriculture issues”, suggesting an unresolved split. Meanwhile, it demands that “ministers receive regular progress reports of concurrent EU and US negotiations to help maximise leverage and allow policy tensions to be resolved as they emerge”. A government spokesperson said that it had been “very clear since the outset that we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards”. Campaigners want legal guarantees on those standards to be enshrined in an agriculture bill currently being debated in parliament. The issue has already prompted a Tory rebellion in the Commons. It comes after reports last week that the government was proposing a “dual scheme” that would see higher tariffs on US foods with lower animal welfare standards. It is not clear whether higher tariffs would also be linked to environmental standards. Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesperson, said: “People can now see that promises made by Johnson and Gove were worthless.” Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said: “It is unacceptable for the government to allow our high food standards to be compromised and our farmers undercut in any future trade deals. Attempts by ministers to use tariffs and tax rates to get around their manifesto commitment on food standards won’t wash.” Nick von Westenholz, director of EU exit and international trade for the National Farmers Union, said: “The government made a manifesto commitment not to compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards in trade negotiations, and this commitment is explicitly stated in the government’s specific objectives for the US negotiations. We would expect UK trade negotiators to be rigorous in upholding these commitments.” A government spokesman said: “We will always stand up for British farming and are determined to use trade negotiations to secure new opportunities for farmers. “Having left the EU, we will get to decide how we set and maintain our own laws, standards and regulations, upholding our food, environmental and animal welfare standards. Our food regulators will continue to provide independent advice to ensure that all food imports into the UK comply with those standards.”"
2020-06-06T15:03:16Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus live: thousands defy warnings to join anti-racism protests - as it happened,"Thousands of protesters rallied in solidarity with Black Lives Matter across the UK. Defying calls from government officials to avoid mass gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic, crowds wore face masks and gloves creating powerful scenes as they demonstrated for an end to systemic racism and demanded racial justice. NHS chiefs complained of being left ‘completely in the dark’ about new face mask policy. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said trusts were not consulted or given notice on government plans for all hospital visitors and outpatients in England to be required to wear face coverings from 15 June and all hospital staff to need to wear surgical masks. Schools in parts of the north-west of England are being ‘strongly advised’ not to reopen amid fears the R value is above 1 in the region. Both Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, and the Liverpool city region metro mayor, Steve Rotheram, have questioned whether lockdown relaxation was being lifted too soon, driven from London, with the regions and the north not being listened to. Sunday trading laws could be suspended for a year in a bid to stimulate the economy post-lockdown. Unions said the move was “grossly unfair” and “misguided” as it would disrupt the lives of retail workers by increasing workloads and pressure from working longer hours. The plans could also see cafes and pubs given fast-tracked approval to serve food and drink outside. The UK death toll rose by 204 to 40,465. That’s it from us on the UK side.

2020-06-06T11:17:07Z,politics,Politics,Labour accuses government of cover-up over BAME Covid-19 report,"Labour has accused the government of “covering up vital recommendations” that could help prevent black, Asian and minority ethnic people dying from coronavirus. Concerns about censorship mounted this week after third-party submissions, which reportedly highlighted structural racism and social inequality, were left out of the government-commissioned report on the disproportionate effects of Covid-19 on BAME people. People of Bangladeshi heritage in England are twice as likely to die if they contract the virus than white people, while other BAME groups face an increased risk of up to 50%, the Public Health England (PHE) report found, after claims it was due to be delayed because of fears it could stoke racial tensions.
On Saturday the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, demanded the report be published in full. “We know BAME people are more likely to die from Covid and more likely to fall seriously ill with Covid,” he told Sky News. “This report needs to be published in full. “Covering up vital recommendations is completely unacceptable. Action must be taken to protect those disproportionately at risk from this horrific virus.” After the partial release of the report, PHE was criticised for simply restating the increased mortality highlighted by other research without explaining the reasons for the stark disparity or making recommendations to tackle it. In a webinar on 22 May, Prof Kevin Fenton, the PHE regional director for London, who led the review, said the public health body had engaged almost 1,500 people as part of an “extensive exercise”, which included steps already being taken because “we shouldn’t be waiting to act when we know what to do”. Black, Asian and minority ethnic MPs have warned a failure to tackle the disproportionate number of deaths of BAME people from coronavirus risks fuelling simmering tensions over racial injustice in Britain at a time of anti-racism protests following George Floyd’s murder in the US. They said the absence of discussion about structural racism, as well as practical measures to protect BAME people, from the report made a mockery of the health secretary, Matt Hancock’s, statement in the Commons that “black lives matter”. Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the MP for Streatham, said the fact the review overlooked factors arising from structural racism and wrongly focused on comorbidities including obesity and diabetes sent a message that “we don’t matter”. Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, the MP for Slough, who has lost three relatives to coronavirus, said: “It’s all very well saying black lives matter but if you’re not going to be taking any action to make sure that, yes, those lives do matter, then those are just hollow words.” The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) again refused to comment on whether a section of the report had been removed before its publication. A government spokesperson said: “The government commissioned a review to analyse how different factors can impact on people’s health outcomes from Covid-19. This is what was published on Tuesday. “Prof Fenton has engaged with a significant number of individuals and organisations within the BAME community over the past couple of months, to hear their views, concerns and ideas about the impact of covid-19 on their communities. “The valuable insight he has gathered so far is informing the work the equalities minister is now taking forward.” PHE did not deny that a “qualitative assessment” with recommendations for the government was issued as part of the findings, Sky News reported. It has been approached for further comment."
2020-06-05T18:04:59Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: face coverings and masks to be mandatory in English hospitals – as it happened,"The UKâ€™s equality watchdog is launching an inquiry into the â€œlong-standing structural racial inequalityâ€� thrown into the spotlight by the pandemic. The Equality and Human Rights Commission said analysis and evidence-based guidance is needed to tackle entrenched racism and Covid-19 death rates among BAME groups. It comes after Public Health Englandâ€™s review came under criticism for not explaining the reasons for already known disparities in health outcomes and not making recommendations for tackling them. The R value in England has risen to between 0.7 and 1. The latest data suggests the north-west and south-west are areas of concern, and Matt Hancock confirmed the R was higher in those regions than the rest of the country. National easing of lockdown measures would go ahead, he said, with a focus on localised lockdowns to address flare-ups. All hospital staff, patients and visitors in England must wear face coverings from 15 June. Hospital staff will be required to wear type one or type two surgical masks at all times, while patients and visitors will need to wear face coverings, the health secretary said. The UKâ€™s death toll passed the grim milestone of 40,000. The DHSC confirmed a rise of 357 deaths, bringing the total of reported deaths following a positive test to 40,261. Thatâ€™s it for today from the UK. If youâ€™d like to continue following the Guardianâ€™s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture."
2020-06-05T16:03:30Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Barnier hints in talks of EU concessions on state aid rules,"Michel Barnier has signalled that he is ready to drop the EU’s most contentious demand that its rules limiting government subsidies to businesses are inserted into British law after another week of stuttering negotiations over a future trade and security deal. In a move immediately welcomed in Downing Street, the bloc’s chief negotiator declined to publicly back the EU’s opening demand that the UK incorporate Brussels’ state aid rules into its domestic legislation. Speaking to reporters via a video conference call, Barnier said he would not “speculate where we’ll end up” on the issue. State aid rules did not form part of the discussions in the most recent talks between the two negotiating teams, he said. When pressed on whether he was standing behind the EU’s opening position, Barnier appeared to concede that a “toolbox” would need to be devised for ensuring fair competition when it came to state aid. The demand until now has been that the EU’s rules on state aid should be incorporated in British law as they develop with the European court of justice acting as the final arbiter. Barnier said: “We need to work together in order to come up with the appropriate toolbox, the robust commitments that we are clear about is how effective these mechanisms will be so they can ensure long-term, fair sustainable competition between the EU and the UK, but we haven’t got there yet.” Last month the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, wrote to Barnier arguing that it was “not a provision any democratic country could sign”. The EU negotiator warned, however, that the bloc expected the talks to go deep into October given the lack of progress so far, a timeline rejected by the British side. A source senior source on the UK negotiating team said: “We’re not up for a long negotiation over the next months, well into the autumn where nobody knows what’s going to happen. October is too late for us”. In an attempt to spur the talks along, London has made a veiled threat of imposing tariffs on agricultural goods such as beef, tomatoes and diary products that would have a high impact on exports from the likes of Ireland, France and Spain. This follows Michael Gove’s declaration last month that it would be prepared to move away from the zero-tariff goal if the EU was not prepared to budge on a level playing field. ”We’d rather not,” said a senior source. During his press conference appearance, Barnier made repeated references to the political declaration, the 27-page document agreed by Boris Johnson and the EU last year as a guide to the negotiations on the future relationship. He accused Downing Street of backtracking on key parts of that agreement including on the joint desire to agree “robust commitments to prevent distortions of trade and unfair competitive advantages” and ensuring the continue level of cooperation to maintain existing levels of nuclear safety. Speaking shortly afterwards, Frost rejected any suggestion that Downing Street would seek to weaken levels of safety but pointed out that the British side would not be tied to EU rules and that other vehicles for agreement would need to be found. “Our view of the political declaration is that, as it says in the title, it is a framework. And in para three says ‘it establishes the parameters of an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership’ … and we are fully committed to that vision. That doesn’t mean that everything in the declaration must go into a legally binding treaty.” The two sides also failed to make the expected progress on fishing rights, despite spending two days discussing more than 100 shared stocks that swim in UK and EU waters, the most time given to any of the 11 negotiating topics in the latest round. Barnier, a former French fisheries minister, accused the UK of not showing “any true will” to move beyond its starting position. The UK wants annual negotiations on fish quotas, based on a system of “zonal attachment”, meaning agreeing shares based on the percentage of fish inside each side’s exclusive economic zone (a 200-mile area round the shore). But Barnier said an annual negotiation was “not even technically possible” because of the complexity of reaching an agreement on so many fish. But while voicing disappointment over the failure to reach a deal on fisheries by 1 July, as both sides had promised, he indicated the EU was willing to compromise. “The EU wants the status quo, the UK wants to change everything. If we want an agreement we have to discuss somewhere in between these positions. We are prepared to discuss what needs to be discussed.”"
2020-06-05T15:08:30Z,politics,Politics,UK experts call for coronavirus inquiry to prevent deadly second wave,"Leading medics and scientists have called on Boris Johnson to order a public inquiry to prepare Britain for a second wave of the coronavirus this winter, warning that many more will die unless the country improves its response. The 27 experts, of which more than half are professors in virology, public health, epidemiology and other relevant fields, said there was an urgent need to fix shortcomings in Westminster’s coronavirus response, which have contributed to the UK suffering one of the highest death rates in the world. Signatories to a letter to the Guardian include Prof Anthony Costello, a former World Health Organization director and a global health expert at University College London; Prof Trisha Greenhalgh, a primary care expert at the University of Oxford; Prof Deenan Pillay, a former member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies and an expert in virology at UCL; and Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.
In the letter – organised by March for Change, a grassroots campaign group supported by science and health professionals – they wrote that it “seems probable” that there will be a second wave of coronavirus this winter. They say that “many more will die unless we find quick, practical solutions to some of the structural problems that have made implementing an effective response so difficult”. They said the death rate in the UK has been high despite “strenuous efforts by health professionals and scientists inside and outside government … with the poor and certain minority ethnic groups affected especially badly”. The experts listed the problems that need addressing as “the fragmentation of the NHS, public health and social care in England; the failure of those in Westminster to engage with local government and devolved nations; the channels by which scientific evidence feeds into policy; and an inability to plan for the necessary goods and services and procure them. “We call on all political parties to commit to a rapid, transparent, expert inquiry to address these issues,” they wrote. “This must avoid diverting the efforts of those responding to the crisis or apportioning blame but should propose feasible ways to overcome the obstacles faced by those on the front line of the response and help them to save lives.” Other signatories include professors Helen Ward, Karl Friston, Mark Gilthorpe, Ruth Gilbert, Sir Ian Gilmore, Raj Bhopal, Nuala McGrath, Susan Michie and David McCoy. The editors of two leading medical publications have also signed – Fiona Godlee of the British Medical Journal and Richard Horton of the Lancet. Johnson’s government has not yet committed to a public inquiry into the coronavirus response, but some ministers have conceded there will be a time for “lessons to be learned” after the crisis is over. However, the experts in their letter made clear that they believe such an exercise is necessary now, so that the response can be improved if the virus resurges later this year. Many of the signatories have been high-profile critics of the government’s response so far, which some public health professionals in particular believe has failed to draw sufficiently on their expertise. Johnson insisted this week that he was “very proud” of the government’s record on reducing the spread of the virus, but the death toll has now topped 50,000 – more than twice the total that his chief scientific adviser said would be a “good result”. The government’s difficulties have been compounded by a revolt among Johnson’s own Tory MPs over the new policy of a 14-day quarantine for inbound travellers, which they argue will destroy the aviation industry and prevent foreign holidays for Britons. Many backbench Conservative MPs are already restive over Johnson’s backing for his senior aide, Dominic Cummings, over his breaches of the lockdown, which prompted a deluge of mail from angry constituents. Their discontent was then compounded this week when No 10 insisted that the virtual parliament must be scrapped and MPs return to work as normal, with socially distanced queues snaking around the Palace of Westminster estate and MPs who are shielding initially denied the right to participate. They will now be allowed to vote by proxy. The government is also under pressure over its contact tracing operation, which one executive suggested would not be fully “world-beating” until the autumn, and the non-appearance of its tracing app, which was promised by June. There is further uneasiness among scientists and the public about the speed at which the government is unwinding the lockdown in England while the infection threat level remains at 4 – meaning cases of the virus are still high or rising exponentially. Many parents and teachers have raised concerns about children returning to school in England from this week, and non-essential shops are supposed to be opening from 15 June. To facilitate this greater return to work, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, unveiled a further U-turn on face masks, saying coverings will be mandatory on public transport in England from 15 June to coincide with shops reopening. At the beginning of the epidemic, the government had insisted that face masks provided little benefit and did not encourage their use."
2020-06-05T15:00:00Z,politics,Politics,"Lack of response to BAME Covid-19 toll risks fuelling tensions, say MPs","A failure to tackle the disproportionate number of deaths of black, Asian and minority ethnic people from coronavirus risks fuelling simmering tensions over racial injustice in Britain, BAME MPs have warned. They say the absence of practical measures to protect BAME people or any discussion of structural racism from the government-commissioned report this week on Covid-19 disparities makes a mockery of Matt Hancock’s statement in the Commons that “black lives matter”. The Guardian attempted to contact more than 40 BAME MPs and peers, including every BAME Conservative MP. None of the Tories agreed to speak about the Public Health England (PHE) review. The 13 Labour MPs who responded expressed concern that its lack of an action plan added to BAME people’s frustrations at a time of protests against racism, prompted by the US police killing of George Floyd. Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the MP for Streatham, said: “With George Floyd, because of the protests, initially, there were actually attempts to explain that the knee on his neck wasn’t necessarily the cause of death, it was his underlying health conditions, and we see with Covid now in this review that they’re attempting to say: ‘Oh, it’s all of these comorbidities like obesity and diabetes,’ so it’s [as if it’s] not really that black people are facing a particular issue [of structural racism]. “It just sends a message that we don’t matter, and that’s why people are protesting. And I think that the strength of the protests has been even more than it might usually be because of what’s happening with Covid-19, because there’s a lot of pain in the community.” Concerns about BAME people being disproportionately affected by Covid-19 surfaced in early April. The terms of reference for the PHE report included to “suggest recommendations for further action that should be taken to reduce disparities in risk and outcomes”. Instead, the final version was limited to stating the existence of disparities, which had already been established by numerous studies, prompting allegations that that the government had censored the report. Yasmin Qureshi, the MP for Bolton South East and shadow equalities minister, said the lack of recommendations was a “massive failure”, adding: “I think if the government does not look properly at the causes and say what they’re going to do, then I think they’ll have missed a golden opportunity to put things right [at a time when] BME communities already feel under the cosh.” MPs also raised concerns that the PHE review did not address the high toll on BAME healthcare workers and concerns that they are placed in riskier environments and feel less able to speak out. And they highlighted the disproportionate use of lockdown powers against black people, who have been more likely to be fined. Against that background, many felt that Hancock, the health secretary, saying “black lives matter” when launching the PHE review in parliament left a bitter taste. Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, the MP for Slough, who has lost three relatives to coronavirus, said: “It’s all very well saying black lives matter, but if you’re not going to be taking any action to make sure that, yes, those lives do matter, then those are just hollow words. “People have been talking about these injustices for so long, and if the government doesn’t take action, I think that that anger and exasperation will only increase, and that doesn’t benefit anybody.” Chi Onwurah, MP for Newcastle Central, said: “To use the phrase ‘black lives matter’, then to go on to not do anything about the clear outstanding case of black people dying disproportionately, reeks of hypocrisy and will undermine faith in the government’s desire or intention to take action.” MPs also raised concerns about the risks to themselves, their families and the largely black support staff posed by the Commons reopening. Tulip Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, said: “I really noticed it when I went in the other day because everyone was talking about the impact on black communities, so all the people who served me, from the tearoom to everywhere, everyone’s black. All the cleaners I bumped into were black.” Among the practical measures MPs said the government could recommend were wider provision of personal protective equipment, workplace safety audits and advice to multi-generational families living under the same roof, or offering to put some up in a hotel while they shield. In the longer term, many support demands for a race equality audit across Whitehall. Mark Hendrick, the MP for Preston, said: “Racism has bedevilled our societies through the generations; but the economic, social and health inequalities highlighted by the coronavirus pandemic have exposed racism in a way humanity has never seen before. Long after this crisis is over, we will be judged on how we sought to eradicate the virus of individual and structural racism by dealing with the conditions that have created it.” The government referred the Guardian to comments by the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, in which she said: “Much more needs to be done to understand the key drivers of the disparities identified and the relationships between the different risk factors.”"
2020-06-05T06:00:07Z,politics,Politics,Business leaders demand delay to Irish Sea border checks,"Northern Ireland business groups are calling for a six month delay to Brexit checks in the Irish Sea saying that Boris Johnson’s late admission that he is legally obliged to implement them has left them no time to prepare for the December cliff edge. They have also hit out at Downing Street secrecy, saying they are refusing to discuss the plans with the very people that needed to implement them. Their call for a six month “adjustment period” falls short of the extension to the transition period that the Stormont assembly unexpectedly agreed to call for earlier this week. But they warned Northern Ireland businesses will go to the wall unless they are given more time by the UK and the EU to set themselves up for the unprecedented changes to the way they trade with Britain. Responding to the government’s command paper on the Northern Ireland protocol with a list of 60 unanswered questions they urged Michael Gove, who is charged with implementing the withdrawal agreement to urgently engage with them. “The level of engagement we have with the UK government across a raft of policy areas is really good. But when it comes to this Brexit issue, it’s really locked down and controlled. There is no real defined engagement from them,” said Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland. He said engagement levels were worse than during Theresa May’s reign and were completely “unacceptable” as the Northern Ireland protocol kicks in on 1 January whether there is a trade deal or not. Although Theresa May’s approach to the Irish border cost her her premiership, business groups said there was at least discussion. “The current approach is very much ‘hold it tight and don’t be telling anyone anything unless they really have to hear it’. It isn’t acceptable … it isn’t appropriate. At the end of the day, we are the only people that will deliver this Brexit thing. We’re the ones that will be asked to make this a success,” said Kelly. Fourth round talks on the trade and future relationship deal the UK and the EU want to strike finish on Friday but there is little expectation of any breakthrough. A deal will have little impact on the new trading environment that must swing into place in Northern Ireland on 1 January as part of the deal to avoid checks and risk peace on the Irish border. Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said businesses were realistic and knew the UK government was not looking to extend the transition period. Businesses were willing to help the government make the new Brexit protocol work but it was “mission critical” to involve them with just seven months to go. They warn that there is little capacity for planning with delays on the British side compounded by the Covid crisis. Even if they had the “bandwidth” they couldn’t prepare because the government has kept them in the dark on the details of customs and regulatory checks that will be imposed. “We had said from January that this was going to be a Herculean task to get everything done in time for 1 January, it has only gotten harder,” said Connolly. Business groups have already asked for financial compensation for the extra costs they will incur. The government conceded just two weeks ago that there would be checks in the Irish sea when Michael Gove, who is charged with implementing and enforcing the withdrawal agreement on behalf of the UK, revealed the command paper on Northern Ireland protocol. The paper was welcomed by Northern Ireland businesses at the time and by Michel Barnier’s senior adviser Stefaan de Rynck last Friday as it was the first step in “unlocking” the process of setting up a unique trading operation for the region."
2020-06-04T20:45:07Z,politics,Politics,British Airways shuns Priti Patel meeting over quarantine plans,"A row has broken out between Priti Patel and British Airways over the plans to quarantine travellers for 14 days as the airline refused to meet her, and a government source branded the company “not serious about getting Britain working again”. Tensions between the government and the airline escalated on Thursday, as Alex Cruz, the chief executive of BA, declined to join an industry call with Patel, the home secretary, and Kelly Tolhurst, the aviation minister.
Conservative MPs are up in arms about the quarantine proposals, arguing they will harm airlines and dash people’s hopes of summer holidays, but Boris Johnson insisted this week that the policy will go ahead from Monday as an essential way of stopping new outbreaks of coronavirus. Earlier on Thursday, Cruz had warned employees that BA’s parent company was haemorrhaging cash and accused the government of dealing “another blow” by pressing ahead with the plan to quarantine inbound travellers for 14 days at a time when many other countries are lifting such measures. Airports, aviation bodies and almost every other major airline apart from Ryanair were on the call with Patel. A source said the industry made the case for the quarantine rules to be in place for three weeks only until the first review date on 29 June. A source close to the talks said that BA’s team had advised Cruz that it “wasn’t worth his time engaging”. The approach appears to have gone down badly with the government, with a Whitehall source saying: ‘It’s a shame that British Airways don’t want to directly make their case to the home secretary and the aviation minister. Clearly they aren’t serious about working with the government to get Britain moving again.” It comes the day after Tolhurst had already criticised BA for its move to cut thousands of jobs and change terms and conditions while workers are on the government-funded furlough scheme. One person with knowledge of the call said the home secretary made no promises but had been in “listening mode”. She told the airlines that she understood the urgency and would work together with other government departments, having already told Tory rebels against the plan that it was a “temporary, time-limited policy” to help reduce the spread of transmission. The source said: “It was the meeting she should have had months ago.” During the meeting, Patel told the airlines: “Protecting lives will always be our top priority, but I am alive to the impact on your sector and I’m asking you to work with us on this … I know you share my commitment to protecting passengers and the whole of our country from a second wave of coronavirus … We’re listening and we want to find solutions together, that’s why we’re here today.” Many Tory MPs opposed to the plans and the airlines believe the quarantine measures will be shortlived – possibly three or six weeks – before being replaced by so-called air bridges involving reciprocal arrangements with other countries that have similar infection rates. No 10 is cautious about promising air bridges just yet as some countries are not keen to allow in British travellers without quarantine when the UK’s transmission rate is still high. However, some cabinet ministers and dozens of Conservative MPs are pushing for the quarantine to be as short as possible because of the economic impact of the policy on the aviation industry and worries about job losses. Treasury sources said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, believes a time-limited quarantine period for travellers will have a “negligible” economic impact but if the policy were to continue for a longer period of many months, then “that would be another matter”. Scientists have already criticised the quarantine arrangements for not having enough of an impact. Unions also have deep concerns about the consequences of the plan. Lucy Moreton, from the Immigration Services Union (ISU), which represents around 4,000 Border Force members, branded the system “farcical” and said passengers could fill “complete rubbish” into the address form and there is no way for Border Force officers to verify whether it is correct. She said: “That data is passed on to PHE who then determine how many will be contacted by phone. It’s widely believed to be about 10% will be telephoned. “But they will be phoned on the number they provide … Police forces have been clear they don’t have resources to be chasing around after this. The chances of them visiting, unless there’s another criminal contact, is zero to nil.”"
2020-06-04T20:11:53Z,politics,Politics,Alok Sharma receives negative coronavirus test result,"Alok Sharma, the business secretary who showed symptoms of coronavirus, has received a negative test result amid opposition warnings that the scare showed how easily Downing Street and Westminster could be thrown by a fresh outbreak. Sharma was tested after feeling unwell on Wednesday while delivering a statement in the House of Commons. It emerged that over the previous 24 hours he had attended a meeting with Boris Johnson and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and stood close to other MPs as he queued to vote in the Commons. At the time of his statement MPs were sitting at least 2 metres apart and afterwards the area around the dispatch box was given a deep clean. “This was done as a precaution,” a House of Commons source said.
However, Sharma’s suspected illness raised concerns about the government’s decision to bring back parliament in its physical form, after weeks of allowing MPs to attend via video link. Amid concerns that cabinet members and MPs could be asked to self-isolate, Sharma disclosed on Thursday evening that his test had come back as negative and they could return to work. “Huge thanks to everyone for their really kind messages over the last 24 hours and my grateful thanks also to the parliamentary authorities and Speaker for their support yesterday. Just had results in and my test for Covid-19 was negative,” he wrote on Twitter. His spokeswoman did not immediately respond when asked if the cabinet minister would have to continue to self-isolate; there are concerns that tests may not come back positive in the early stages of infection. Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs welcomed the result, but said the scare had shown the weaknesses in a return to a physical parliament where MPs have to queue to vote. Footage showed Sharma in the Commons standing close to the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, and voting just before the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock. Barry Sheerman, the Labour MP for Huddersfield, said on Twitter that he was relieved Sharma had tested negative, but that “doesn’t mean that the reintroduction of physical presence voting is not stupid”. Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem MP for St Albans, also welcomed the negative result, but added: “This should still be a wake up call for Rees-Mogg. Govt should lead by example: support ppl2 work from home where they can (as per its own guidance), embrace digital & stop needlessly risking health of MPs& staff.” MPs on Thursday challenged the Commons Leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, for ending virtual voting, with Labour criticising the “shambolic” long queues MPs have to form to vote, which have been dubbed the “coronavirus conga” and take up to 90 minutes to complete.
Senior Conservatives, opposition groups and the equalities watchdog raised concerns that the decision to end digital voting would prevent many MPs, particularly elderly and vulnerable politicians who are shielding, from being able to vote. In a further development, Sharma, the minister responsible for workplace safety, is facing an industrial dispute in his departmental office over coronavirus fears.
The PCS union has told members who are cleaners, security guards and postroom workers in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) that the department has failed to provide sufficient evidence of safety measures, and advised them not to return to work. Sharma had attended the departmental office in Westminster on the day he fell ill and neither BEIS nor the outsourcing firm told the workers, the union claimed. The business department has been approached for comment."
2020-06-04T19:57:37Z,politics,Politics,Fall guy Shapps takes turn to promote UK as 'world beater' in stupidity | John Crace,"A few days ago, the prime minister announced that he was doing away with the daily coronavirus briefings at weekends. It was just getting too hard to find cabinet ministers who were prepared to give up their Saturdays and Sundays – even the ever loyal “cut out and keep” Tory boy pastiche, Robert Jenrick, was playing hard to get – and Boris Johnson sure as hell couldn’t be bothered to do it himself. It can’t be long before No 10 pursues its dream of reducing the number still further, if Thursday’s showing is anything to go by. One – two at a push – a week would be just about ideal. A win-win situation that would cut the workload and save the daily embarrassment of a minister having to explain that the government really didn’t have much of a clue what it was doing and was just making up policy on the hoof. This is no reflection on Grant Shapps, the delegated fall guy for Thursday’s press briefing. Shapps may not be the brightest kid on the block, but he’s always been one of the more enthusiastic and by cabinet standards has so far had a reasonable coronavirus war. He’s by and large managed to curb his natural tendency to smile when reading out the death statistics and he’s put in more than his fair share of shifts in trying to make news out of something that is either a non-event or a government PR disaster. But even the transport secretary is now running on fumes. The sheer pointlessness of his existence is now getting to him. And understandably so. Though he tries to maintain the jaunty, upbeat exterior of a man who just can’t wait to upgrade the A66, his shoulders are now permanently slumped and he looks dead behind the eyes. Too much more of this and he’s going to crack and do a runner. Luckily he’s got plenty of aliases lined up for his new life. Bye, bye Grant. Hello Michael Green. Having rattled through a few slides – astonishingly the one that showed that on the previous day the UK death total had been higher than the rest of the EU27 combined had gone missing – Shapps moved on to his “breaking news” announcement. It had just come to his attention that there was a nasty disease called coronavirus going round, so from 15 June – might as well let a few more people die rather than doing it immediately – everyone on public transport was going to have to wear face coverings. Well, hello. Not only had many people, including London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, been calling for such measures for weeks now, most other countries had made it law a month ago. But Grant was adamant. The UK had a reputation to maintain as the country that took measures long after they had become blindingly obvious to everyone else. It was this kind of inaction that made the UK a “world beater” in international stupidity. Still, Shapps could see some light at the end of the tunnel. One way out of these daily press briefings would be simply to broadcast those of other European countries that had taken place weeks ago. Just imagine the possibilities. Rather than wasting his time today, we could have replayed the press conference of a month ago in which the Spanish transport secretary announced the compulsory wearing of face masks on public transport only dubbed into English with Grant’s voice. Put like this, no minister would ever need to appear in public again. There was a caveat, though. Face coverings alone wouldn’t be enough to stop the coronavirus, so it was still necessary for people not to make unnecessary journeys, and to work from home wherever possible. This from a man who had literally queued for 90 minutes on Tuesday afternoon to take part in a vote to deny fellow MPs from having a vote or taking part in parliamentary proceedings because they had health issues, caring responsibilities, large distance to travel or were self-isolating. And all this just to indulge Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ongoing public school fantasies of entitled omnipotence. Even when challenged on this by journalists, Shapps didn’t seem to think there was anything wrong in the government implementing a three-line whip to break its own public health guidelines and put MPs and parliamentary staff at risk. “Er,” said Shapps. “We were getting behind with secondary legislation.” Then learn to use a Zoom meeting like almost everyone in the country. There’s nothing to stop a committee of MPs from scrutinising legislation online. But what Jakey wants, Jakey must have. After all, whose fault is it if you don’t have a second London home and a fleet of nannies? Grant had no answer to any of the other questions. He didn’t know what advice the government may have for BAME people. He didn’t know why we had still been sending hospital patients into care homes without being tested in the middle of April. There was just time for the transport secretary to make it clear that no one was going anywhere anytime soon. Either home or abroad. For a start, people were forbidden from staying overnight in another home so UK holidays were out the question. And there was no point in people getting worked up about Priti Patel having introduced a quarantine on air travel at least six weeks too late at a time when it would be largely ineffective, because government advice was that no one should go anywhere by air anyway. So all summer holidays were cancelled and no harm had been done. That was the brilliance of having someone really stupid as home secretary. Shapps quickly curtailed any other questions. The Italian transport secretary was due on TV in a few minutes and it would be handy for him to know what he would be announcing in a month or so’s time."
2020-06-04T18:02:23Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: business secretary Alok Sharma tests negative for Covid-19 â€“ as it happened,"Wearing face masks is to be made compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June. The move was welcomed by the unions, with Unite saying this should become the â€œnew normalâ€�, though Labour said this should have been done two months ago and the government had been far too slow to act. Grant Shapps said he expected the devolved administrations to introduce a similar face covering rule. Earlier today, Nicola Sturgeon said she was considering making the wearing of face masks mandatory on public transport and in shops in Scotland and reminded Scots that this is already advised. The governmentâ€™s coronavirus economic measures are set to cost Â£132.5bn, according to the OBR. That is a rise of 7.5% on estimates made last month on the expected cost of measures including the furlough scheme and grants for the self-employed. The business secretary Alok Sharma received a negative test result for Covid-19. The R number in Scotland has dropped to between 0.7 and 0.9. It was previously between 0.7 and 1. Sturgeon said however that it was â€œfragileâ€� and stressed the need for caution with easing lockdown measures as new cases continue to be recorded every day. The UK death toll approaches 40,000 as a further 176 fatalities were recorded, bringing the total to 39,904. Thatâ€™s it from us here in the UK.

2020-06-04T12:36:47Z,politics,Politics,"Too little data for recommendations in Covid-19 BAME report, says minister","Public Health England was unable to make any recommendations in its report on BAME people and coronavirus because some of the data needed to do so was not available, a minister has said. Kemi Badenoch, the minister for women and equalities, told the Commons she wanted any action the government takes to be driven by evidence, and it was not “easy to go directly from analysis to making recommendations”. The government-commissioned investigation found that people of Bangladeshi background in England are twice as likely as white Britons to die if they contract Covid-19, and other BAME groups face an increased risk of up to 50%. The report, published on Tuesday, was quickly criticised for failing to investigate possible reasons for the disparities or make recommendations on how to address them. Responding to a Commons urgent question on the matter, Badenoch said that while it was important that the government understands the key drivers of these disparities, it was also vital that “we’re not taking action which is not warranted by the evidence”. Gill Furniss, the shadow women and equalities minister, was one of several politicians to criticise the report for failing to make any recommendations. She asked Badenoch whether she agreed that “it is now time to address underlying socioeconomic inequalities facing BAME communities” and confirm that the government would take action to do so. Last month Labour urged all employers to risk-assess their workers to give them appropriate work or protection given the higher Covid death rates among black and other minority ethnic groups. Furniss asked whether the government would be backing that call. “Coronavirus thrives on inequality and there is no more important time to tackle racial injustices in our society to save lives during this crisis. It is now up to the government to take action and show its commitment that black lives matter,” she said. Badenoch replied: “The PHE did not make recommendations and that’s because they were not able to do so. Some of the data needed is not routinely collected and acquiring this data will be extremely beneficial, and as I said in my response that’s why I’m going to be taking the work forward to fill the gaps in our understanding and review existing policies, develop new ones when needed, off the back of this.” She added: “This is a review conducted in a short period of time which sets up firm conclusions. As the author of the report said on Tuesday night, there is a great deal of background and detailed information we think will be helpful. It is not easy to go directly from analysis to making recommendations and we need to get the report widely disseminated and discussed before deciding what needs to be done.” On Wednesday there were Black Lives Matter protests near parliament. Badenoch said: “As a black woman and the equalities minister, it would be odd if I did not comment on the events in the US and protests in London yesterday. Like all right-minded people, regardless of their race, I was profoundly disturbed by the brutal murder of George Floyd at the hands of the police.” She told the Commons that “during these moments of heightened racial tension, we must not pander to anyone who seeks to inflame those tensions. Instead we must work together to improve the lives of people from BME communities.” Badenoch’s statement came as a group of 15 race equality organisations , the Coalition of Racial Equality (Core) has written to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, expressing its dismay at the report’s lack of recommendations about how to tackle disparities. It says any recommendations from the promised second phase report being led by the junior equalities minister “will almost certainly be too late and could amount to the government kicking the issue into the long grass”. Core has put forward its own recommendations, including ensuring all key workers have access to personal protective equipment, scrapping the no recourse to public funds condition imposed on migrants with limited leave, or those without leave to remain, and abolishing data sharing between the NHS and Home Office. Separately, Black Lives Matter UK has called for people to take part in a doorstep protest at the disproportionate death of BAME people from Covid-19 by playing Jimmy Cliff’s The Harder They Come at 7pm on Thursday."
2020-06-04T12:29:57Z,politics,Politics,Alok Sharma was at No 10 day before displaying coronavirus symptoms,"Alok Sharma, the business secretary, spent 45 minutes with Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak in a meeting in No 10 the day before he fell ill with suspected coronavirus, raising the prospect they might have to self-isolate for two weeks. Sharma has not had his test result back but he started feeling unwell at the House of Commons dispatch box on Wednesday afternoon and he has since gone into a 14-day isolation period.
Downing Street said Sharma was in a face-to-face meeting with the prime minister and chancellor about the economy before cabinet on Tuesday morning. The cabinet room has been deep-cleaned. Johnson’s official spokesman said the men were physically distanced, sitting at least 2 metres apart at all times, but did not wear face masks during the meeting. He refused to say explicitly that Johnson would re-enter self-isolation if the business secretary had a positive result, and Johnson was asked to by the new test and trace service. He said only that the prime minister would “follow medical advice”.
Johnson has already had coronavirus but the guidelines for test and trace state that people have to self-isolate for 14 days if they have had contact with someone who has tested positive, regardless of whether they have been ill before or not. The prime minister and chancellor may be able to avoid that outcome if the ministers are adamant that they were at least 2 metres apart at all times, but a refusal to do so could also undermine trust in the system. The No 10 spokesman could not say whether Sharma’s test result would be returned on Thursday. The test and trace system only kicks in to find contacts of someone who is ill when a positive outcome is recorded. Whether or not Sharma tests positive, his suspected illness is likely to cause concern about the government’s decision to bring back parliament in its physical form, after weeks of allowing MPs to attend remotely via video link.
Many MPs have protested against the new arrangements, which have resulted in them queuing around the parliamentary estate while complying with the physical distancing rules in order to vote. During the debate, after Sharma was seen wiping his face with a handkerchief several times, his Labour shadow, Ed Miliband, passed him a glass of water. Sharma also appeared sweaty and sounded hoarse on Tuesday, according to one fellow MP, when he voted to abolish hybrid parliamentary measures. During one vote, the minister voted straight after the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, and immediately before the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock. In another vote on the substantive motion, Sharma queued to vote immediately after Saqib Bhatti, the Conservative MP for Meriden, and just before Paul Scully, a Tory business minister. Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, said the development was “just awful”, adding: “The government stopped MPs from working from home and asked us to return to a building where social distancing is impossible. MPs are travelling home to every part of the country tonight. Reckless doesn’t even begin to describe it.” Digital voting in the Commons was ended on Tuesday after MPs approved a government motion introduced by the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, despite widespread objections. The Labour MP Karl Turner said he had asked the Health and Safety Executive to conduct an urgent risk assessment of working conditions in parliament. He said MPs having to “huddle together” on escalators on the parliamentary estate while lining up to vote were among a number of “unsafe practices”. A string of cabinet ministers and senior officials have come down with coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, including Johnson, who was treated in intensive care. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, Chris Whitty, the chief medical adviser, Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, Dominic Cummings, the senior No 10 adviser, and Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, were also all unwell with coronavirus in late March or early April. The first MP to fall ill with the virus was Nadine Dorries, a health minister, who tested positive in March. A House of Commons spokesperson said: “The house’s priority is to ensure that those on the estate are safe while business is facilitated. We have closely followed guidance from PHE on action to take following a suspected case of Covid on site, including additional cleaning. Our risk assessment outlines the measures we have already put in place to reduce the risk of transmission in parliament.”"
2020-06-04T11:58:07Z,politics,Politics,UK parliament union threatens to strike after MPs' queueing chaos,"A union representing hundreds of clerks, security guards and kitchen staff in parliament is threatening strike action following chaotic scenes on the parliamentary estate as MPs queued to vote on Tuesday. Officials from the PCS union have told parliamentary authorities that they could recommend balloting their members following the failure of MPs to distance themselves from staff as some waited for more than an hour to cast their votes. The union is especially concerned because more than a third of their members in parliament are BAME. People from ethnic minorities are at a higher risk of dying from coronavirus according to Public Health England.
The development came as ministers come under increasing pressure to ditch its return to a physical parliament after weeks of allowing MPs to attend remotely via video link. Critics rubbished the government’s current arrangements on Wednesday night after the business secretary, Alok Sharma, confirmed he was being tested for Covid-19 after appearing to be unwell while delivering a speech to the Commons. Government sources confirmed that the house authorities are looking at alternative methods of allowing MPs to vote that could speed up the voting process.
Chaotic scenes unfolded in the Commons on Tuesday when MPs formed a long queue snaking through parliament so they could maintain physical distancing while voting on the motion. Union officials said it resulted in a series of complaints from members.
One member complained about a lack of physical distancing at and around the underground entrance to the Commons, where MPs were photographed by colleagues standing less than a metre away from each other. “It was a breeding ground for infection. Supermarkets have better Covid management in place,” the source said. A security source said that the risk assessment shown to some staff showed that the parliamentary authorities do not have a method of controlling the number of people on the estate. “The risk assessment is only there to facilitate a poor decision by the government,” the source said. PCS officials wrote to the parliamentary authorities saying that a failure to comply with five tests, could result in industrial action. The five tests include a promise to track and trace those in contact with an infected person, regular Covid-19 tests for staff, and a pledge to carry out a Covid-19 risk assessment including an equality assessment to examine the impact on BAME workers. Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of PCS, which claims to have around 800 members across the Palace of Westminster, said: “The decision to scrap the hybrid parliament has been a disaster. “We will support our members wholeheartedly if they decide to take action and the blame will squarely lie with [the leader of the Commons] Jacob Rees-Mogg.” Sharma’s potential case of Covid-19 in the chamber came a day after MPs approved the government’s plan to end virtual voting in the Commons. MPs are due to debate a motion laid by Rees-Mogg on Thursday to allow those who are shielding and those aged over 70 to vote by proxy. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said it would be premature to suggest Sharma had the virus. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Lewis said: “I don’t want to be premature because Alok, who I wish well and hope he recovers quickly, may well have had severe hay fever, we’re not sure yet.”
Government sources said MPs could abandon the system of filing through the chamber to cast their votes, which led to long queues. According to the BBC’s Newsnight, one option being examined would be to let MPs swipe their security cards on a reader in the division lobbies, where they traditionally assemble. A House of Commons spokesperson said: “Our priority is to ensure that those on the estate are safe while parliamentary business is facilitated. We are taking every step possible to limit the number of staff who have to physically return to the building and are meeting regularly with representatives of the trade unions.”"
2020-06-04T10:01:34Z,politics,Politics,"EU leaders will intervene in Brexit talks in autumn, says German official","Britain must give away some sovereignty to secure free trade with the EU but Europe’s leaders will intervene in the negotiations in the autumn with the aim of sealing a compromise deal at a summit on 15 October, Germany’s ambassador in Brussels has said. Michael Clauss, whose country will take over the rolling presidency of the EU for the second half of the year, said there had been “no real progress” in the talks so far but predicted they would become the EU’s main political focus in September and October. “Is a deal possible? Yes, definitely. But I think it also means that UK needs to have a more realistic approach,” Clauss said at an event hosted by the European Policy Centre thinktank. “To put in short, I think you cannot have a full sovereignty and, at the same time, full access to the internal market. So this Brexit issue is going to absorb a lot of political or most of the political attention we expect in September and October.” The signal that the EU’s 27 heads of state and government are prepared to turn their focus to the stalling talks will be a boost to Downing Street, where officials have emphasised the need for a resetting of Michel Barnier’s negotiating position. The two sides are in a stalemate on access for European fishing fleets to UK waters and whether in return for a zero-tariff trade deal Britain needs to tie itself to the EU’s developing state aid rules and common environmental, social and labour standards. British negotiators have voiced fears that the talks have fallen down the EU agenda, with UK officials repeatedly calling for political involvement to break the stalemate. Clauss said that the last few months of 2020 would be “dominated” by the talks, and Berlin regarded securing a deal as a top priority alongside agreeing on the EU’s pandemic recovery fund. A greater cause of concern will be the German ambassador’s insistence that a trade deal will require the abandonment of the UK’s sovereign right to set its own domestic laws without recourse to Brussels. In contrast, Barnier has repeatedly rejected British claims that the trading away of sovereignty is implicit in the EU’s stance on standards and rules on subsidies to business. Clauss, who as Angela Merkel’s key representative in Brussels is key figure in communicating Berlin’s position on the negotiations to Barnier, said Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, Charles Michel, the president of the European council, and Boris Johnson would meet this month to take stock. “So far as all of you are aware, no real progress has been made in the negotiation. It’s more like both sides, highlighting and stating their positions,” he said. “As you know, the issues are the future access of the United Kingdom and its companies to the internal market, which are connected to the issue of level playing field: do they have to apply ... state aid, and environmental standards and so on and so on, or not? “Another issue that is very important for some member states is the issue of fish quotas – in these countries it has a high visibility. This means whether EU member states keep their fish quotas – fish in the UK waters after Brexit has been done – and then another issue of governance. So, what if there is a disagreement on how to read the treaty and what can be done? “We hope that we will have a deal by the European council [summit of leaders] in October, and confirm,” the ambassador said. “That means we envisage to be there around the second half of October. We cannot be much later because [the deal] would need to be ratified at least by the European parliament, which needs some time.” Meanwhile Labour has said it will be holding the government’s feet to the fire on its Brexit promises insisting it will not let it away with a deal that will wreck the economy further just because of its hard Brexit line. “That commitment to an “ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership” is what the country expects and deserves,” said Rachel Reeves the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. As Michael Gove’s opposite, she is now the key figure in the party, on the Brexit portfolio, previously held by Keir Starmer. “We have left the EU, but need a future relationship with our European neighbours that safeguards jobs and businesses, maintains environmental and employment standards and provides a close security partnership to keep people safe,” she said. She said this weeks talks were a “key step in the government delivering what it promised at the general election in December with the Prime Minister’s ‘oven-ready deal’”."
2020-06-04T05:00:53Z,politics,Politics,Ed Davey: my experience as a carer can help rebuild Britain after coronavirus,"Ed Davey has accused Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings of lacking the compassion and empathy needed to rebuild the UK after coronavirus, as he launched his campaign to become Lib Dem leader with what he called “a caring agenda”. In an interview to open his bid formally, Davey said his long personal experience as a carer meant he had a deeply personal stake in valuing the sector after Covid-19. While he talked about Labour’s Keir Starmer as a leader with whom he could cooperate, Davey condemned the prime minister and his chief adviser, saying they were entirely unsuited to shaping a new approach to society after the pandemic. “Those ideas have got to be of a different tone and a different moral compass to what we’ve seen before,” Davey said. “And I don’t think Cummings and Johnson are capable of doing that. “I just don’t think they have the compassion that is needed. I think they just see it as a weakness. They don’t see looking after each other as a strength. I see it as a strength, because it’s tough. Caring is tough.”
Davey’s father died when he was four, and eight years later he and his brothers cared for their mother when she became terminally ill. He and his wife have a 12-year-old son, John, who is disabled. “I feel huge empathy with those people who are carers, and who need that care,” Davey said. The Covid pandemic showed the lack of investment in the care system, he said: “It’s not acceptable for people who are doing the toughest of jobs, either unpaid at home for their loved ones, or in our care homes or in domiciliary care, to be treated in the way they’ve been treated for so long. “That would be a very big part of what I’d like to see the Liberal Democrats talking about – how we build a more caring society. And if we can make common cause with others for a caring agenda, I’d like to do that.” He highlighted the government’s decision to end the system of allowing MPs to speak and vote remotely in the Commons as a sign of their lack of care for more vulnerable groups. The return to a physical-only chamber saw MPs wait in long queues to vote on Tuesday, with many older members, or those who were shielding or were carers, unable to attend. “We should be standing up for all workplaces, because there are people out there who will be under pressure to go back to work when they feel it’s not safe for them or their family,” he said.
“I think we should be having a debate not just about parliament, but about the whole economy, about those people and ensuring that there are protections for them. My worry is if you are vulnerable or you live with someone who is vulnerable, you’re going be the first person to be sacked. How fair is that?” Davey has been the interim Lib Dem leader since Jo Swinson lost her seat in December’s election, in which the party returned just 11 MPs. Davey, an MP since 1997 – with a brief break from 2015-17 – is by far the most experienced of the candidates. The two declared so far, Layla Moran and Wera Hobhouse, both entered parliament in 2017. Davey, who lost to Swinson in the last contest, faces another tough contest, with Moran seen as a joint frontrunner. The leadership race had been postponed owing to coronavirus, but will now run over the summer without any physical hustings, with the winner announced in August. While Davey is careful to not blame Swinson for the election debacle – “It would have been completely wrong if everyone had just blamed Jo and just blamed the last few months” – he endorsed the findings of a brutal internal party review that called the campaign “a high-speed car crash”.
Davey, whose policy platform includes a green-based economic recovery from coronavirus, said he wanted to move the Lib Dems to a broader policy focus after a period dominated by Brexit. “People need to understand what a party is about. And you can’t define a party by an issue which will go, which is transitional,” he said. Under Paddy Ashdown, the Lib Dem leader Davey says he most wants to emulate, the party was “the champions on education and the environment, and I fear we’ve lost that”. While Davey has been in politics for a long time, serving as energy secretary in the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition, his profile remains somewhat technocratic. His leadership campaign therefore aims to push both his experience and his backstory, for example his experience as a carer. During the interview, Davey’s aides prompt him to recount a tale which for many politicians would probably be better-known: about 20 years ago he received a bravery award for rescuing a woman, who had fallen on to rail lines at Clapham Junction station, from the path of an approaching train. “A lot of my backstory I’ve not told before,” Davey said. “I didn’t really talk about it last time. But I want the party to know that I’m three-dimensional.”"
2020-06-03T19:25:01Z,politics,Politics,The Tories stumble from one shambles to another over coronavirus,"For the second time in a week, Dominic Cummings is incurring the wrath of Tory backbenchers: this time over No 10’s belated decision to impose a quarantine on travellers who come to the UK. After withstanding the fury of Conservative MPs over his lockdown road trips last week, they are now on the warpath against Cummings since the controversial imposition of 14-day blanket quarantine requirement for those entering the country from abroad. Not only are the backbench malcontents questioning the scientific and economic basis for imposing it, but they are having to field queries from annoyed constituents. They have heard government messaging about the easing of restrictions – and now want to know if they can go on holiday. Even some cabinet ministers, such as Grant Shapps, are believed to have argued for the idea of “air bridges” – reciprocal arrangements with other countries that have similar infection rates that would allow for quarantine to be waived. For the time being, the quarantine policy has won. Both Boris Johnson and Priti Patel, the home secretary, robustly defended it on Wednesday, saying it was essential to bring down the risk of new infections from abroad. However, they didn’t get much help from the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who refused to say that the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies endorsed a blanket quarantine policy for all travellers. Instead, he said only that “measures like this are most effective when the number of cases is very low in this country and when applied to countries from higher rates”. To add to the general sense of confusion, the Daily Mail – highly hostile to the quarantine idea – reported on Wednesday that it was Cummings’ pet plan that had been briefed to the Times newspaper as a “dead cat” to distract from the care homes crisis. A No 10 source rubbished that suggestion, saying it was untrue and that the policy was in circulation long before that point. The Times did not respond to a request for comment. With its majority of 80 and just six months after an election, Johnson’s government is supposed to be still in its honeymoon phase. But the mood of the backbenchers no longer feels that way. Many Tory MPs – especially those with a libertarian bent – are clamouring for a quicker easing of the lockdown, with the quarantine revolt a sign they are unhappy with any new stricter measures that have economic consequences. At the same time, there is a sense of unease about whether their own government is sufficiently competent – something exploited this week by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, with his accusation that Johnson is “winging it” and needs to “get a grip”. Backbenchers have watched and defended the government as it has been accused of bungling the timing of the lockdown, the distribution of personal protective equipment, the decision to stop community testing for the virus, the failure to produce a track and trace app, and the belated quarantine. But the postbags from their constituents complaining of Cummings’ behaviour during the lockdown has felt for many Conservative MPs like the last straw that caused them to break ranks and criticise one of the most senior people at the heart of the government. Many have no love for Cummings – and most have told constituents they have never met or spoken to the aide – and they are already seizing on his moment of weakness to undermine some the policies that No 10 espouses, including the quarantine for travellers.
The sense of a government not entirely in control of events has been exacerbated by Johnson’s sporadic invisibility, amid regular speculation he has yet to fully recover from his very serious bout of Covid-19. On Tuesday, No 10 announced a new plan for the Downing Street press briefings, which will go from daily to five days a week – but with Johnson due to lead only one. No 10 is once again launching a fightback against this perception of drift, with its overhauled system of ministerial committees to tackle the crisis. But there is a familiar feel to the messaging that Johnson is taking back control – an idea that surfaced when he was under pressure to order a lockdown and then again after his illness. Tory backbenchers have already forced a U-turn this week on the new arrangements for a return to physically voting in parliament, with the government now allowing proxy votes for the most at risk. They are also flexing their muscles over the Huawei decision, applying pressure on No 10 to phase out the Chinese company from the 5G network as soon as possible. Johnson’s defence of the quarantine plans at his daily press conference shows he is not backing down on that just yet, but the signs are there that it may not last for long before being replaced with another solution – mostly likely the “air corridors” or screening at airports. At that point, it is likely to be added to the growing list of policies that the government has mishandled over the course of the epidemic, giving another reason for concern among Tory MPs that Johnson has not been at the top of his game during this crisis and a sense that Cummings is not unassailable."
2020-06-03T18:30:54Z,politics,Politics,Pressure grows on Priti Patel after Vallance avoids full backing for UK quarantine move,"Priti Patel faces mounting calls to publish the scientific advice behind the 14-day quarantine period for new arrivals to the UK, after the government’s chief scientific adviser declined to fully endorse such a blanket policy. Speaking at the regular No 10 press conference, Sir Patrick Vallance said the advice from the Sage advisory committee was that quarantines worked best when infection rates inside a country had dropped, but also when applied to countries with high rates of coronavirus. The quarantine plan, unveiled by the home secretary in the Commons to a sometimes hostile reception from Conservative MPs, does not distinguish between countries of varying infection rates, with the only exceptions being for certain professions, such as freight drivers. Asked about the issue at the press conference, Vallance stressed the decision was ultimately one for ministers. “The Sage advice from the experts in this area is that the measures like this are most effective when the number of cases is very low, and they’re most effective when they’re applied to countries from higher rates,” he said.
He added: “And the judgment of that time is, of course, not something for us, it’s something for politicians to make. They make the policy, and they make the timing decisions.” With a number of Tory MPs, among them the former prime minister Theresa May, expressing concern at the quarantine, both from the point of view of its effectiveness, and its impact on the travel and aviation sectors, Patel told the Commons the measures would be in place from 8 June and would be reviewed in three weeks. A breach of self-isolation could result in a £1,000 fixed penalty notice in England or potential prosecution. Under the quarantine plans, self-isolating arrivals are permitted to leave the house to buy food and medicine for themselves or others in the household, including pets, where it is not possible to obtain the provisions in any other manner, as well as to attend funerals, court hearings and to access critical public services, such as social services. Critics have challenged the government over its decision to introduce such a stringent policy at this stage of the pandemic, particularly as there was no enforced quarantine for any arrivals in late February and early March when the virus was raging in countries such as Italy and Spain. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, called for the government to publish the scientific advice, saying there was concern the quarantine plan was a “fudge to try to spare the government embarrassment for failing to grip this issue at the right time”. The Conservative former international trade secretary Liam Fox said: “I’m afraid I simply cannot get my head around the public health mental gymnastics of this policy. If such a barrier was required, why was it not introduced earlier in the outbreak?” Patel told MPs that Sage would publish advice in due course, while advice from within the Home Office would be provided to the home affairs select committee. May expressed her concerns earlier, during an urgent question on the aviation industry, sought by Huw Merriman, the Conservative MP who chairs the transport select committee. “International air travel is necessary for trade,” the former prime minister said. “Without it there is no global Britain. So instead of bringing in measures to close Britain off from the rest of the world, why is the government not taking a lead in developing an international aviation health screening standard, to save jobs and ensure that Britain is open for business?” Discontent among Conservatives has also been fuelled by being unable to answer questions from constituents about whether they might be able to go abroad this summer.
“There’s lots of scepticism around the quarantine plans,” one Tory MP. “Many MPs don’t want to stop their constituents going on foreign holiday after their sacrifices during lockdown.” One Conservative MP expressed frustration at the quarantine plan: “Most people think it’s mad: slamming the stable door after the horse has bolted. It has only gone down well with the ‘Blame Johnny Foreigner’ brigade.” Asked at the press conference whether people should book holidays, Johnson only pointed to Foreign Office plans warning against such travel for now. While a number of Tories have urged the use of “air bridges”, mutual quarantine-free agreements with other nations, Johnson urged caution: “We will explore the possibility of international travel corridors with countries that have low rates of infection – but only when the evidence shows that it is safe to do so.” Whereas countries such as Portugal and France have sent positive signals that they are open to some form of travel arrangement, others have underlined the challenges raised by approving travel to and from the UK. Denmark said on Friday it would not consider opening its border to travel to or from the UK until 31 August at the earliest. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Given the vast majority of people have already complied with pandemic measures, we expect those entering the UK will do the right thing and abide these measures – that means filling out their contact locator form before they reach the border. “If a passenger refuses to complete the form - for example if they have not provided an address - they could be fined or forced to return home. “Border Force will undertake checks at the border, Public Health England will contact people at random to ensure they are self-isolating and anyone failing to comply may face enforcement action, including a £1,000 fixed penalty notice or a unlimited fine.”"
2020-06-03T17:59:55Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: 'many, many job losses' are 'inevitable', Boris Johnson says â€“ as it happened","Here is a summary of the main points from the press conference (at the top), as well as our main stories from the day (lower down). Boris Johnson said it was â€œinevitableâ€� that there would be â€œmany, many job lossesâ€� this year because of the impact of coronavirus on the economy. Technically the UK has not yet reached the official benchmark for a recession - two successive quarters of negative growth - but in practice the economy is already shrinking considerably, with some forecasts saying the country is facing the deepest recession for 300 years. Johnson seemed to acknowledge this when he said: I am afraid tragically there will be many, many job losses. That is just inevitable. But he also said the government would be as â€œas activist and interventionistâ€� in helping people in the next phase of the crisis as it has been up to now. (See 5.41pm.) Sir Patrick Vallance, the governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser, refused to explicitly back the governmentâ€™s decision to impose quarantine on new arrivals to the UK from next week. He also implied that scientists are sceptical about the policy generally. Asked if Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, had endorsed this timetable, he said dates and policy were a matter for ministers. He also said quarantine works best when the infection rate is low in the country receiving visitors and high in those countries sending them in. This is not the case with the UK at the moment vis-Ã -vis arrivals from most EU countries. Prof Chris Whitty, the governmentâ€™s chief medical adviser, said it would take â€œquite some timeâ€� before the new test and trace system was working at full capacity. He said: The new thing that has been brought in - and it is definitely, as you imply, in the early stages of its development, but it is definitely there, and definitely working, but it will work a lot better over time - is the new element of test and trace ... We are not yet at cruising altitude for this. The number of tests is going to keep on going up and our ability to use the tests we have got is going to carry on going up. This is going to carry on for quite some time before we get to the point where we are all satisfied we have got to the point we need. Johnson ducked a question about whether Britons would be able to take a foreign holiday this summer. Asked if it was safe to book one, he replied: Iâ€™m not going to give advice on individualsâ€™ travel arrangements, but you know what the Foreign Office guidance is... everybody at the moment should avoid non-essential travel. He claimed he was a Sinophile. Asked about Huawei and whether he would now exclude it from the 5G network, he said he wanted solutions that worked for UK security. But he went on: I want to stress one thing. I am a Sinophile. I think China is an incredible country and an extraordinary civilisation. And I deeply disapprove of anti-Chinese xenophobia - attacks on people of Chinese appearance that we have seen in recent months. We must stamp out such xenophobia. I see absolutely no contradiction with what Iâ€™ve said earlier about Hong Kong and high-risk vendors in critical national infrastructure and wanting a good, friendly, clear-eyed, working relationship with China and thatâ€™s what this country will have. He said the UK was talking to other European countries about setting up â€œair corridorsâ€� that could allow them to bypass the quarantine rules. Priti Patel, the home secretary, is facing mounting calls to publish the scientific advice behind the decision to enforce a 14-day quarantine period on all arrivals into the UK months after the pandemic began. The Metropolitan police are facing claims of bias after figures showed that officers enforcing the coronavirus lockdown were more than twice as likely to issue fines to black people as to white people Health and social care workers could be asked to volunteer to look after people with Covid-19 without wearing protective equipment in the event of extreme shortages, according to proposals seen by the Guardian. Theresa May has launched a double attack on Johnsonâ€™s government, speaking in the Commons to first warn about the security implications of a final no-deal Brexit, and then against the coronavirus quarantine plans. Johnson has announced a government U-turn to allow MPs who are shielding to vote by proxy following an outcry over the treatment of parliamentarians with medical conditions or those who are looking after vulnerable loved ones during the coronavirus pandemic. Thatâ€™s all from us for today. Thanks for the comments."
2020-06-03T16:54:32Z,politics,Politics,Censorship row over report on UK BAME Covid-19 deaths,"Concerns about censorship have been raised after third-party submissions were left out of the government-commissioned report on the disproportionate effects of Covid-19 on black, Asian and minority ethnic people Public Health England said it had engaged with more than 1,000 people during its inquiry. But the report, which has been criticised for failing to investigate the reasons for the disparities or make recommendations on how to address them, did not mention the consultations. Anger has been compounded by a report in the Health Service Journal claiming that before publication the government removed a section detailing responses from third parties, many of whom highlighted structural racism. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), which called in its written submission for “specific measures … to tackle the culture of discrimination and racism [within the NHS]”, said it had contacted PHE to ask why its evidence was not included. Its secretary general, Harun Khan, said: “To choose to not discuss the overwhelming role structural racism and inequality has on mortality rates and to disregard the evidence compiled by community organisations, whilst simultaneously providing no recommendations or an action plan, despite this being the central purpose of the review, is entirely unacceptable. It beggars belief that a review asking why BAME communities are more at risk fails to give even a single answer. “The MCB is seeking further clarification from PHE as to why the report removed the submission from the MCB and others. It is imperative that the full uncensored report is published with actionable policies and recommendations as suggested by community stakeholders, and a full Covid race equality strategy is introduced.” The report, which was published on Tuesday, found that BAME groups were up to twice as likely as white Britons to die if they contract Covid-19. But numerous studies had already established disproportionate mortality among BAME people, leaving many furious as to why PHE did not examine the reasons for the disparities or propose solutions. Dr Zubaida Haque, the interim director of the Runnymede Trust, who attended a Zoom consultation relating to the review, said: “It’s extraordinary, there’s nothing about that in the document at all. What was the point of carrying out that consultation exercise? It’s a partial review, in terms of the fact that it doesn’t have any written recommendations or plan of action, and it’s a partial review because it clearly hasn’t taken onboard any of the concerns of voluntary and grassroots organisations. In that sense it’s very difficult to have confidence and trust in the review.” In a webinar on 22 May, Prof Kevin Fenton, the PHE regional director for London, who led the review, said the public health body had “engaged more than 1,000 – almost coming up now to 1,500 individuals who have participated in briefings, lectures, discussions, listening sessions on this issue”. The “extensive exercise” included steps being taken already because “we shouldn’t be waiting to act when we know what to do”, he said. The British Medical Association’s written evidence included the need to take account of socioeconomic factors. Its council chair, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said: “It is further incredibly concerning, if true, to hear claims that parts of the review have not been published. We first pushed for this review two months’ ago and a number of concerns we have consistently raised are not reflected in the paper. While this review was being compiled, BAME workers were dying and will continue to do so unless the government engages in actions not words.” Neither PHE nor the Department for Health and Social Care responded to the Guardian’s question as to whether a section of the report had been removed before its publication."
2020-06-03T16:52:13Z,politics,Politics,No hiding place for Boris at PMQs | John Crace,"You can sense the growing disbelief and anger. All his life Boris Johnson has been told that he is the Special One. A person for whom all rules are there to be broken. He is a man who has consistently managed to fail upwards. Sacked from one job for lying or incompetence, he has always effortlessly moved on to a better one. Friends, family and children have only ever been collateral damage in a ruthless pursuit of an entitled ambition. Yet now there is no hiding place. Boris has achieved his narcissistic goal of becoming prime minister and from here the only way is down. And it’s a lonely place to be because even he can’t escape the fact that he’s just not cut out for the top job. It’s not just that it’s too much like hard work and he is basically lazy: it’s that he’s not that good at it. Lame gags, bluster and Latin free association just don’t cut it. Put simply, Boris isn’t as bright as he has come to believe he is. In fact, he’s quite dim. And nowhere is this more evident than when he’s up against Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions in front of a near empty chamber. During their first few outings, much was made of how Boris crumbled in the face of the Labour leader’s forensic questioning. But now it’s clear Johnson can’t cope with any kind of questioning at all. Because even when Starmer isn’t at his absolute sharpest, Boris begins to fall apart. It’s as if he knows he’s up against a man of greater intellect and morality and his only defence is to lash out. It doesn’t help that Boris has become his own worst enemy. The charmer turned charmless. Mr Happy turned Mr Angry. It also doesn’t help that even when his friends at the Daily Telegraph try to big him up with a story about how he was going to take direct control over the government’s handling of the coronavirus, they only succeed in teeing up Starmer with his first free hit. Who had been in charge of the government during the past three months? Apart from Classic Dom of course. Because we could all take that as read. Boris immediately became defensive and snappy. He had always been in control. All that was changing was that now he would be in total control. Besides, he stood behind what the government had done so far. There hadn’t been many other countries that had managed to kill so many of its citizens through negligence and indifference, so that was something of which we should all be proud. Besides why was the Labour leader standing up and asking him all these difficult questions when he could easily have been more supportive? This left Starmer rather perplexed as he had a copy of a letter he had written to the prime minister a fortnight ago offering to help find a solution on reopening schools to which he had not yet received a reply. “Um … er,” said the floundering Boris. He had rung him back. Except he hadn’t. He had merely spoken to all the opposition leaders on a joint conference call.
There was something almost pathetic about Boris pleading for people to trust him at the very moment he was lying. Starmer merely pointed out that trust had to be earned, and returned to the charge sheet. Why had Johnson eased lockdown restrictions when the woman in charge of track and trace on which the new guidance was predicated had said the programme wouldn’t be fully functional till the end of the month? Why had the guidelines been altered when the threat was still stuck at level 4? By now it was clear that Starmer had got under Boris’s skin, and Johnson began to visibly fall apart as he tugged at his hair, tried to prevent his chin from wobbling and angrily jabbed his finger. A prime minister unable to differentiate between being picked on and being subjected to the bare minimum of democratic scrutiny. For Boris even the most modest of criticism is interpreted as a personal betrayal. He might not be very good but he was doing his very best and it was about time the Labour leader and the rest of the country expressed their gratitude for that. As so often, the leaders’ exchanges ended with Boris doing a U-turn on government policy. If you had to guess from PMQs who was running the country then you’d have to say it was Starmer. Only the previous day, Johnson had insisted on a three-line whip in support of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s plans to institutionalise discrimination into the workings of the Commons. Now it sounded very much as if he had had a change of mind. Which had meant that much of Tuesday’s proceedings had been as big a waste of time as MPs queueing up for 90 minutes to deprive absent MPs of a vote. Not that queueing was necessarily a bad thing, Boris ad-libbed. The public had queued for Ikea so it was right for MPs to get their knees dirty and queue to vote as well. Even though there was a fully functional alternative up and running already. It’s getting harder and harder to know where satire ends and reality starts. Boris breathed a sigh of relief when Starmer’s six questions came to an end, but there was no let up. The SNP’s Ian Blackford twice asked Boris to condemn President Trump’s handling of the riots in the US – teargassing peaceful protesters to get a photo op in front of a church had been a particular low point – and twice the prime minister declined. Even Theresa May got in on the act by asking a Brexit question he couldn’t answer. How the Tory benches could do with her at PMQs right now. The truth is that Boris is a beaten man even before he stands up to speak at the dispatch box. He knows that. Keir knows that. Worst of all, the country knows that. The shouting is all just empty, white noise. A distraction from his own limitations. And at a time of national crisis you can’t get away with putting that on the side of a bus."
2020-06-03T16:38:17Z,politics,Politics,"Britons receiving German citizenship rose 2,300% last year","The number of Britons who gained German citizenship last year was up by approximately 2,300% compared with the year before the Brexit referendum, driving up the number of naturalisations in the country to a 16-year high. According to data released by the federal statistical office on Wednesday, the total number of citizenship applications granted in 2019 increased by 15% year on year to 128,900, with 14,600 granted applications from British citizens accounting for almost half the increase. Since Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, 31,600 Britons have acquired German citizenship. Most of them, the country’s office for statistics said, had chosen to keep their British passport, as remains possible during the transition period ending on 31 December 2020.
“Of those Brits that have managed to get a German passport, all of them reported Brexit as a key motivation,” said Daniel Tetlow, co-founder of the British in Germany association and co-author of a study by the Oxford in Berlin research partnership and the Berlin Social Science Centre looking at the impact of Brexit uncertainty on migration patterns. “For most of the people we spoke with, it didn’t mean any kind of rejection of Britishness but more the compliment of being British European. And it’s a plain insurance policy, a no-brainer for Britons who have their livelihoods here and want to continue to have the rights and freedoms that come with an EU passport.” While Brits can try to apply for German citizenship after living in the country for six years, most of those who were naturalised in 2019 had been away from the UK for longer: half of those who gained citizenship last year had been in Germany for more than 26 years. They also tended to be older than those applicants with a Turkish, Polish or Syrian background: half of the Britons who applied for a German passport were aged above 54 years old. The oldest applicants were aged 90. Tetlow said one of the reasons why the numbers of granted applications had risen so steeply was that German officials had also spotted the current circumstances as an opportunity to get British workers to commit to the country long term.
“One thing we have seen, for example, is German immigration offices committing more staff to deal specifically with British applications,” Tetlow said. “There has been no schadenfreude on the part of German officials, just a lot of solidarity in spite of the tone of the political debate around Brexit.” While the total number of people granted British citizenship over the same period were comparable, Germans in Britain appeared to be more reluctant to commit to a British passport. Out of 125,346 applications for naturalisation granted in the UK in 2019, only 3,269 were by German citizens."
2020-06-03T15:39:09Z,politics,Politics,Hong Kong visas: why is the UK standing up to China now?,"Boris Johnson’s promise to give millions of Hong Kong citizens a path to UK citizenship is a remarkable offer from a government that has spent four years wrestling with Brexit so as to end the free movement of people from Europe. For one door to be slammed shut only for another to be opened so wide is striking, especially since the policy’s popularity among the Conservative membership or pro-Brexit voters has yet to be tested. Recent polling by the Cabinet Office unearthed widespread ignorance about China. The argument in government circles is that Brexit was never about halting migration, but about sovereignty and the right for the UK to control its own migration policy, including by selecting those with the skills most needed in the UK. It can be argued that the quartet at the top of the Tories are the archetypal beneficiaries of migration. The family of the home secretary, Priti Patel, fled Uganda. The father of the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, came to the UK from Czechoslovakia aged six in 1938, following the Munich agreement, which gave parts of Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany. The grandparents of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, arrived in the 60s from east Africa. Even the prime minister, Boris Johnson, a product of Eton and Oxford, has both Turkish and American ancestors. They are not quite citizens of nowhere, the phrase used insultingly by Theresa May, the former prime minister, but all four have backgrounds that make them alive to the benefits of political asylum. There is also a streak of guilt that runs through the Conservative party about its treatment of Hong Kong citizens, and an admission that, under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher, the great cold warrior, it placed the people of Hong Kong into the hands of the Chinese Communist party in 1994. After the handover, Hong Kong citizens ended up with a jerry-built halfway house. They could hold a British national overseas passport, providing them consular assistance and protection through UK diplomatic posts, but they would not have the automatic right to live or work in the UK. Those born after 1997 would have no rights. In his memoirs, the last governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten, wrote: “Even in the 1990s many Conservatives and much of the British media resisted any idea we should be moderately generous in the award of citizenship to some of those who lived in Hong Kong (often serving directly the colonial power) and deserved a guarantee if necessary they could look to Britain for a home after 1997. Civis Romanus sum was not to be translated into a modern British obligation. Australia, Canada, both of course Commonwealth countries, were much more generous over the granting of citizenship to Hong Kong residents. They were a lot more maternal than the so-called ‘mother country’. Thatcher took some political flak at the time. In 1989, Paddy Ashdown, the Mandarin-speaking leader of the newly merged Social and Liberal Democrats, defined his new party in the wake of Tiananmen Square by campaigning for Hong Kong citizens to be given the right of abode. So how has Ashdown’s liberal view become the political consensus? There were, after all, influential migrants at the top of the May and David Cameron governments. Cameron, a Sinophile, confined himself to urging China’s president, Xi Jinping, on a state visit to the UK in 2015 to allowing Hongkongers to choose their own leader without Beijing’s prior vetting. Cameron had seen what had happened to Angela Merkel when she opened the door to Syrian refugees in 2015, and was not going there with Hong Kong.
Yes, individual cabinet members have played their part in the change of mind, but bigger trends forced Johnson into a choice. With protests growing ever more violent in Hong Kong and elections producing pro-democracy legislatures, the possibility that China would wreak revenge and end the “one country, two systems” arrangement had to be countenanced. A cross-government contingency planning group was set up in September. The contingency group was formed amid a broader rethink in the Conservative party about China. By last summer an influential group of Tory MPs, including Iain Duncan Smith, Damian Green and Tom Tugendhat, came to the conclusion that the rise of China under Xi was a threat to the west and needed to be resisted. Global Britain, a foggy concept for many years, came to be defined as a commitment to openness, democracy and a rules-based order. Hong Kong serendipitously became the rallying point for this foreign policy. China’s handling of coronavirus, and the controversy over Huawei, has further embedded this process.
The UK has few levers apart from moral persuasion with which to deter Beijing from pressing ahead with the security laws. A British-enabled mass exodus of the population of Hong Kong, the jewel in China’s economic crown, would leave that crown badly damaged. Johnson has taken a big gamble, both in confronting China and offering the UK as a safe haven to so many. Quite whether he knows the extent of the gamble is unclear."
2020-06-03T13:41:55Z,politics,Politics,Petition calls for ban on low-quality food imports in post-Brexit deals,"More than 250,000 people have signed a petition calling for a ban on cheaply produced low-quality food imports in post-Brexit trade deals. The National Farmers Union (NFU) is lobbying the government to ensure that imports from countries such as the US of food produced to lower standards than expected of UK farmers should not be allowed. Attempts last month to write a legal minimum standard into the agriculture bill failed, and the NFU has launched the petition to increase pressure on ministers. By Wednesday morning, 254,764 people had put their names to it. The petition says: “Farming throughout the UK has high standards of safety and welfare with an ambition to be net zero in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. There are very strict controls on farming methods allowed in the UK and I expect the same of all food which is imported here so the food I eat is as safe, traceable and produced to high welfare and environmental standards. “Before the UK begins to negotiate trade deals with countries around the world, I call on the UK government to put into law rules that prevent food being imported to the UK which is produced in ways that would be illegal here.” Imports that are of particular concern to UK farmers and producers include US poultry products, such as chlorinated chicken and eggs, and hormone-injected beef. The TV chef Jamie Oliver issued a plea on social media for people to sign the petition, saying if there was no law to protect standards, the market would be flooded with very low quality, high salt and sugar products, and that trade deals allowing these imports would be “traumatic” to the British farming industry. The agriculture bill is moving to the House of Lords. Neil Parish, the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee, who put forward one of the amendments to the bill in the Commons, said he hoped the Lords would amend the bill in order to protect against substandard imports in trade deals. A Defra spokesperson said: “We have been clear that in all of our trade negotiations – including with the US in our first round of negotiations – that we will not undermine our high domestic environmental protection, animal welfare and food safety standards by ensuring in any agreement British farmers are always able to compete.”"
2020-06-03T13:06:42Z,politics,Politics,MPs shielding from Covid-19 allowed proxy vote in Johnson U-turn,"Boris Johnson has announced a government U-turn to allow MPs who are shielding to vote by proxy following an outcry over the treatment of parliamentarians with medical conditions or those who are looking after vulnerable loved ones during the coronavirus pandemic. It follows a government move to drop the use of virtual measures in the Commons, as critics including 31 Conservative MPs voted to keep remote tools in place. On Tuesday, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the house, declined to endorse a proxy vote system, instead saying that vulnerable MPs could be paired. The government voted down virtual measures and was ridiculed over the “socially distanced conga” of politicians that snaked around parliament waiting to vote. At prime minister’s questions, Johnson said MPs who were vulnerable would be able to vote remotely.
Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, told the prime minster that the scenes of MPs either queuing to vote or unable to vote on Tuesday were shameful. “If any other employer acted like this it would be a clear and obvious case of indirect discrimination under the Equalities Act,” he said. Johnson replied: ‘I do not think it’s unreasonable that we should ask parliamentarians to come back to this place and do their job for the people of this country. “I know it is difficult and I apologise to all of those who are shielding or they are elderly. They should be able to vote by proxy,” he said. At present, pregnant MPs and those who are on maternity or paternity leave are allowed to use colleagues as proxy votes under reforms introduced in 2019. Robert Halfon, the chair of the education select committee, who is shielding, welcomed the move. “The good news is that the PM @BorisJohnson has just announced will allow #COVID19 affected MPs to vote via proxy,” he wrote on Twitter. Rees-Mogg’s office confirmed that a motion extending proxy voting arrangements to MPs who are shielding and those over the age of 70 will be tabled for Thursday. Karen Bradley, the chair of the procedures committee, and Labour’s Chris Bryant are expected to table amendments on Tuesday to the motion to allow for parts of the so-called “hybrid proceedings” to continue.
This would mean any MPs who cannot get to the Commons during the pandemic can take part in debates and committees over Zoom and vote online – as they have done since the middle of April. Bradley on Tuesday put forward an amendment to the government’s plan to allow remote voting. Despite getting the support of 31 Tory MPs – including select committee chairs including Tom Tugendhat and Greg Clark – it lost by 37 votes."
2020-06-03T13:03:04Z,politics,Politics,Cabinet Office ignored warning EU voters could miss out in 2019 elections,"The Cabinet Office ignored warnings that EU citizens living in the UK would be disenfranchised in the May 2019 European parliamentary elections if preparations were not made long before polling day, according to internal documents released during legal action against the government. Details of efforts made by officials to persuade ministers to prepare in advance of voting have been revealed in submissions to the high court in a case launched last year by the3million, a group campaigning on behalf of resident EU citizens. Pre-trial exchange of arguments before the judicial review hearing shows that a requirement to fill in a preliminary declaration form – not needed by EU citizens in another European country – added to the difficulties for potential voters. As early as 2016, according to Cabinet Office documents, an official in its electoral administration team wrote to colleagues stating: “I have been tasking DexEU [and others] about this to press the point that returning officers want to start preparing for the polls around 18 months out and we either need clarity on participation or a commitment to indemnify them for any nugatory expenditure. My thinking is that we need a decision by the end of 2017.” The following year, the official sent a memorandum in which he cautioned: “Ideally, we would have at least 6 months to prepare for the poll, i.e. from November 2018. After this point, there are increased risks to the successful delivery of a poll.” In May 2018, however, the Cabinet Office wrote to the Electoral Commission to inform it that it “is the government’s position that it would not be prudent for money to be spent preparing for the elections that the government is clear will not take place”. The following March an official said they were “very close” to a point at which it would be “irresponsible for [local authorities] not to start preparatory work”. In the end, according to lawyers for the3million, as many as 1.7 million EU citizens who had previously registered may have been unable to submit the declaration form in time to vote. The Cabinet Office says there was a higher voter turnout than in previous EU elections. Christiane Rée, a teacher and German national who had lived in the UK for 24 years, is one of those taking the action. She completed a declaration form but was told it had been lost. “When I arrived and asked to vote, I discovered that although my name was on the register it had been crossed out, and I was told that I would not be able to vote,” she said. “My first reaction was a combination of incredulity and shock.” Maike Bohn, a co-founder of the3million, said: “The only way to uphold our fundamental right to have a say is to [hold] this government to account.” If the group wins, those unable to vote could each be awarded thousands of pounds in compensation. John Halford, a solicitor at the London law firm Bindmans who is representing the claimants, said: “The documents brought to light thanks to this litigation reveal a Cabinet Office riven with conflict between officials and ministers about whether EU citizens should be enabled to vote here last year, as was their right. “Officials gave warning after warning that the UK’s system led to disenfranchisement and needed reform. They urged ministers to make contingency plans for the 2019 elections despite Brexit. Yet ministers abandoned proposed reforms to the system after the 2016 referendum, would not plan for the 2019 elections until it was too late to ensure those who wanted to vote could and, worst of all, adopted a policy that EU citizens should vote anywhere but here.” A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “The government put in place all the legislative and funding elements to enable returning officers to make their preparations required for the polls on 23 May – and did so in exceptional circumstances. We cannot comment on the details of an ongoing legal case.”"
2020-06-03T12:31:54Z,politics,Politics,PMQs verdict: Boris Johnson attacks Keir Starmer for doing his job,"Key points Sir Keir Starmer started by saying how shocked he was by the death of George Floyd. Referring to today’s Telegraph story, he asked who has been in charge of the UK’s coronavirus response up to now. Boris Johnson also condemned what happened to George Floyd. But he said people should protest in a peaceful way. He said he took full responsibility for the UK coronavirus strategy. He said people know that “with good British common sense” we can tackle this. Starmer said Johnson asks him to cooperate but didn’t reply to a letter he sent privately offering his cooperation on schools. He also said a survey at the weekend showed a huge fall in trust in the government. Johnson replied that he phoned Starmer after he got the letter and said Starmer did not criticise his policy. He said the public were following the government guidance. Starmer replied that he would publish his letter. Starmer said the government should have been working on a test and trace system for weeks. Dido Harding, who is in charge of the system, said it would not be fully ready until the end of June. Johnson accused Starmer of casting aspersions on the people behind the scheme and said it was up and running on 1 June. He said thousands of people were now self-isolating. Starmer said Johnson did not put a number on those being contacted and added that the number infected each day was far bigger than those tested. He said the system should contact 45,000 people a day. He quoted the UK Statistics Authority criticism of the government and asked the PM whether he could see how much damage was being done to trust? Johnson said Starmer continues to undermine trust in government and asked for some credit for the people involved. Starmer responded that Johnson was mistaking scrutiny for attacks. Starmer said he would like to support the government’s policy but Johnson made it difficult. He said the government said it would not relax the lockdown until the alert level was lowered. What was it now, and what was the R number? Johnson said the alert level did allow the lockdown to be relaxed, even though it had not been lowered. Starmer said scenes in parliament of MPs forming a kilometre-long queue to vote were “shameful” and excluded MPs who were shielding. If any other employer operated like this, it would be a clear and obvious case of discrimination. Will the PM stop this? Johnson said people around the country were having to queue. He said it was not unreasonable to expect MPs to do their job. He also said older MPs and those shielding should be allowed to vote by proxy. Snap verdict Sir Keir Starmer gave an interview to the Guardian that was interpreted by us, and others, as indicating a hardening of his stance against the government - less consensus-seeking, more condemnatory. Obviously in normal circumstances the Guardian is never wrong, but on the basis of what happened at PMQs today it is not clear that anything has changed. At PMQs Starmer has consistently presented himself as the most reasonable person at the dispatch box (more on that here, including why it worked for another opposition leader) and today he won the “talking sense” competition quite comfortably. It wasn’t as if the questions were, on their own, especially memorable. But Starmer does tend to specialise in loaded questions to which there is no safe or easy answer (“when did you stop beating your wife?” questions, as I think they are known at the bar), and Johnson has yet to develop any plausible response mechanism. At their last PMQs he tried responding with promises (the “world-beating” test and trace system). We had a flash of that when Johnson pledged to ensure all test results are turned around within 24 hours by the end of the month (there may well be some clarification of quite what this involves at the lobby briefing) but mostly, in his exchanges with Starmer, Johnson resorted to criticising the opposition leader for – well, opposing the government. He accused Starmer of launching “endless attacks on public trust and confidence” and of “casting aspersions” on the good character of people working on test and trace (some of whom are spending much of their time watching Netflix because they don’t have enough to do, according to the BBC). This is a lame form of parliamentary defence at the best of times. But given that the PM is facing criticism for not even doing his own job properly, it was unwise to invest so much in attacking Starmer for doing his."
2020-06-03T12:17:05Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson declares himself 'very proud' of coronavirus response,"Boris Johnson has said he is “very proud” of the government’s record on the coronavirus, during a prime minister’s questions at which Keir Starmer repeatedly pressed him on his leadership over the issue. Johnson, who announced a new commitment for the vast majority of Covid-19 tests to be processed within 24 hours, complained several times about what he called a negative approach from the Labour leader. In response, Starmer said the prime minister was “confusing scrutiny for attack”. Starmer – who began by expressing surprise that Johnson had not noted the death of George Floyd and the subsequent unrest in the US during his opening remarks – started his questions by referring to a Daily Telegraph article which said Johnson was revamping cabinet committees to “take control” of the response to the coronavirus. Starmer asked: “So an obvious question for the prime minister: who’s been in direct control up till now?” Johnson replied: “I take full responsibility for everything this government has been doing in tackling coronavirus, and I’m very proud of our record. If you look at what we have achieved so far, it is very considerable. We have protected the NHS, we have driven down the death rate. We are now seeing far fewer hospital admissions.” He added: “I think what the country would like to hear from him is more signs of cooperation in that endeavour.” Starmer responded to the latter comment by saying he had written to Johnson two weeks ago to ask whether he could “help build the consensus” on pupils returning to school, saying: “I did it confidentially because I didn’t want to make a lot of it. He hasn’t replied.” The Labour leader asked Johnson about a report that levels of trust in the government had dropped notably since revelations about the lockdown movements of Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s chief adviser, and about the new test and trace system. A sometimes irritated-sounding Johnson said he was “surprised” at Starmer’s approach. He accused the Labour leader of being obstructive, and diminishing the efforts of people involved in track and trace. “His attempts to distract the public from that have not been successful,” Johnson said. He added: “I really do not see the purpose of his endless attacks on public trust and confidence.”
Starmer replied: “The prime minister is confusing scrutiny for attack. I have supported the government, openly, and I’ve taken criticism for it. But boy, he makes it difficult to support this government over the last two weeks.” Starmer ended by asking why lockdown restrictions were eased on Monday when the government’s coronavirus warning level remained on four, something Johnson had previously said would not happen. Johnson replied: “He knows perfectly well that the alert level does allow it.” The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt later asked the PM if he could make a commitment to all Covid-19 tests being completed within a day. Johnson said: “I can undertake to him now to get all tests turned around within 24 hours by the end of June, except for difficulties with postal tests or insuperable problems like that.”"
2020-06-03T11:00:04Z,politics,Politics,Care home staff could be asked to work without PPE under council plan,"Health and social care workers could be asked to volunteer to look after people with Covid-19 without wearing protective equipment in the event of extreme shortages, according to proposals seen by the Guardian. Councils oversee a range of services which require PPE but which are outside the NHS supply chain. These include care homes, pharmacies, mortuary and funeral services, children’s homes and community mental health services. While these services have access to the national PPE stockpile there are sometimes shortages of key items. The PPE situation in NHS hospitals has improved since the start of the pandemic but gaps in community provision continue. Southampton city council has drawn up an ethical framework document to help councils plan for further waves of the pandemic. One proposal contained in internal documents marked “sensitive” from a council planning to adopt the Southampton blueprint, shows that in the event of extreme shortages using PPE that has not been approved by regulators could be considered. In the event of having no PPE available at all, staff could be asked to volunteer to care for people who have or may be infected with Covid-19, without protective equipment. The document suggests that health and care workers who have already had Covid-19 may be suitable volunteers for this high-risk practice although it states that staff should not be put under undue pressure and that human rights legislation should be taken into account. The Unison senior national officer Gavin Edwards condemned the proposals. He said: “Expecting care staff to work without safety kit would be a short-sighted and dangerous gamble. There would then be little, if anything, to stop the spread of the virus to staff, the people they care for and the wider community.” Jasmine Ho of Med Supply Drive, a group of doctors responding to requests to source PPE for staff in hospitals and community settings, said 81% of its requests had come from community and social care providers. “Some of the people who contact us requesting PPE sound quite desperate,” said Ho. “There is a strong likelihood that there will be a second wave of Covid and we should be prepared. We find it unacceptable that more than 200 healthcare workers have died. In this local authority guidance it is incredibly irresponsible to be thinking about asking people to volunteer to work without PPE in a situation where none is available.” Dr Jenny Vaughan, law and policy lead at the Doctors’ Association, said: “Nobody should be put at unnecessary risk just for going in and doing their job. We simply don’t know if having a positive antibody test confers safety and if it does, for how long. Asking staff, when there is no PPE, to expose themselves to risk in this way is not acceptable.” Councillor Lorna Fielker, cabinet member for health and adult care at Southampton city council, said: “We recognised in light of the national pandemic there would be significant challenges for government in ensuring local areas had sufficient PPE to protect their key workers.
“Southampton city council developed a robust and transparent framework that can be used by other local authorities and partner agencies … to help them determine how they can prioritise and allocate PPE, in the event that PPE supply is insufficient to meet demand. “The framework is informed by ethical principles and advises organisations to consider the limits and level of risks to all staff (including, but not limited to, health and social care staff) if the organisation is not able to provide appropriate safety and protection in relation to PPE. “The framework acts as guidance, has not been used to date and is only to be used as a last resort by local authorities and partner agencies.” Debbie Chase, interim director of Public Health at Southampton city council, added: “Southampton city council and the strategic coordinating group for Hampshire and the Isle of Wight took proactive steps to develop a carefully considered, ethically informed and transparent framework to support decision-making, in consultation with a range of stakeholders, including trade unions. “The prioritisation framework was developed in April during the national shortage of PPE and submitted to the secretary of state for health and social care as evidence of the unacceptable reality of what we were having to plan for. It highlighted that the potential actions contained in the framework would not be considered appropriate or safe, and recommended that PPE shortages needed to be addressed at a national level. “We have a duty to plan for the reasonable worst-case scenario – in this case a situation whereby we were unable to fulfil at least minimal obligations to provide appropriate safety and protection in relation to PPE. The framework explicitly states that working in conditions without adequate PPE cannot be imposed on staff, and that we would not, in any circumstances, pressure staff to provide care or services without adequate PPE.” This article was amended on 4 June 2020 to add the response from Debbie Chase, interim director of Public Health at Southampton city council."
2020-06-03T06:14:08Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer warns PM: get a grip or risk second coronavirus wave,"Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of causing a collapse in public confidence over the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, saying No 10 will be directly responsible if the infection rate starts to rise again. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, the Labour leader launched a stinging attack on the the prime minister, accusing him of “winging it” over the easing of the lockdown and making an already “difficult situation 10 times worse”. He also questioned whether the timing of some decisions over the relaxation of the lockdown rules had been taken “to try to deflect attention away” from the Dominic Cummings affair – an episode, he said, that showed Johnson was too weak to sack his chief adviser. In a significant hardening of his language, Starmer said Johnson had to “get a grip” of the crisis. “My [worry] is that after a week or more of mismanagement, I’m deeply concerned the government has made a difficult situation 10 times worse,” he said. “We’ve called for an exit strategy. What we appear to have got is an exit without a strategy. We want to see society reopen, we want to see more children back at school, obviously people want to see their families and we want to see businesses open. “But like many people across the country, there is a growing concern the government is now winging it. At precisely the time when there should have been maximum trust in the government, confidence has collapsed,” he said. Starmer blamed the fall in public trust on the “Cummings factor, the sense of one rule for them and one rule for everyone else” – a referenceto the furore provoked when the Guardian revealed Johnson’s chief adviser had breached the lockdown. But he also cited “mismanagement” in the government’s sudden decision to lift shielding restrictions for 2.2 million people without advance notice for public health directors or GPs, and concerns about the test and trace system that councils do not believe will be ready until the end of the month at the earliest. In addition, the Labour leader said there had been a failure of leadership over the decision to get schools to reopen without consulting widely enough with unions, teachers and parents. “I am putting the prime minister on notice that he has got to get a grip and restore public confidence in the government’s handling of the epidemic … if we see a sharp rise in the R rate, the infection rate, or a swathe of local lockdowns, responsibility for that falls squarely at the door of No 10. “We all know the public have made huge sacrifices. This mismanagement of the last few weeks is the responsibility of the government.” Starmer’s intervention came on another difficult day for the government as it emerged that: The death toll surpassed 50,000 for the first time, according to official figures, 10 weeks after the nation went into lockdown. Prof Neil Ferguson, the leading epidemiologist who advised the government until he quit over breaking the lockdown rules, warned that coronavirus infections in hospitals and care homes are spilling into the community and sustaining the outbreak to the point that cases will remain steady until September. An inquiry found that people of black and Asian origin are disproportionately affected by coronavirus, leading to calls for the government to take action to protect these groups. The head of the UK Statistics Authority accused the government of continuing to mislead the public over the numbers of tests carried out for Covid-19. It emerged that England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, was responsible for vetoing the government’s wish for England’s official coronavirus alert level to be reduced, ruling that it should remain at four – meaning “transmission is high or rising exponentially”. No 10 said it would be cutting back its daily press conference to just weekdays to secure bigger television audiences. Speaking from his parliamentary offices, the Labour leader said he would continue to engage constructively with the government, defending his approach of not making criticism for its own sake. However, he said he had become increasingly concerned about mistakes made by Johnson’s administration in the last week. On Johnson’s handling of the Cummings furore, Starmer said Johnson’s plans to loosen restrictions were laid out as the government was in the grip of a crisis. Last Thursday, Johnson was under pressure to sack Cummings over revelations he had driven from London to his parents home in Durham during the height of the lockdown – and then taken a 60-mile round trip to a beauty spot to test his eyesight. “They obviously took a decision to try and deflect attention away from the Cummings affair,” Starmer said. “There are questions that the government needs to answer about the precise timing of the measures it put in place. “It’s blindingly obvious to me that the prime minister is just too weak to sack [Cummings].”
Starmer added that this “loss of trust and confidence” was the “most troubling aspect of the whole Cummings affair”. “If you had said which is the week the government needed maximum trust and confidence, the answer is the week in which you start easing restrictions … that’s where you need maximum trust and confidence. That’s the thing the government has burned in the last few weeks,” he said. The Labour leader said he would now be asking for more meetings with Johnson, Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical adviser, to address his concerns about the mismanagement of the last few weeks. He also revealed he wrote a “private and confidential” letter to the prime minister two weeks ago offering to work constructively together to gain consensus for reopening schools, but Johnson has not replied."
2020-06-02T20:25:15Z,politics,Politics,Stormont backs calling for extension to Brexit transition period,"The Northern Ireland assembly has unexpectedly voted in favour of calling for an extension to the Brexit transition period, arguing that the UK government cannot impose complex border checks down the Irish Sea while Britain is occupied with the coronavirus crisis. In a surprise development, nationalist, green and social democratic parties held sway in Stormont, saying business cannot prepare for a no-deal Brexit in the middle of a pandemic. The motion proposed Matthew O’Toole, the SDLP’s Brexit spokesman, had not been expected to carry after opposition was expressed by the Democratic Unionist and the Ulster Unionist parties. O’Toole, a former Downing Street adviser, said London would have to take the vote seriously as the assembly was “uniquely recognised as a named party in the withdrawal agreement” and Stormont had a substantial role in the implementation of the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol. He said: “This is not about rerunning the referendum, it’s about accepting that we are in the middle of the most serious public health crisis in living memory. We are also facing a significant economic recession that will put businesses and jobs at risk. This is not the moment to attempt to rupture and renegotiate our largest trading relationship.” O’Toole added that the Stormont vote would “send a powerful message” to Boris Johnson in relation to his implacable opposition to extending the transition period without consent from Northern Ireland. The special protocol on Northern Ireland was agreed in January after a deal struck by the prime minister and his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, to avoid a border on the island of Ireland. It involves checks on trade crossing the Irish Sea which will come into effect as soon as the transition period ends, whether there is a trade deal or not. Under the withdrawal agreement, these checks would hold for at least six years. Businesses have said there is simply not enough time to put IT systems for new customs arrangements, VAT and regulatory checks in place. Both the DUP and the UUP voted against the motion, having argued on Monday that it would be better to postpone such a move until the outcome of this week’s Brexit talks between Brussels and London was known. Green party MLA Rachel Woods said businesses were already facing survival issues with the Bank of England foreseeing “the worst recession in 300 years”. The government “must take account of the shockwaves the Covid-19 crisis has sent throughout our entire society and the fact that Northern Ireland as a whole is not ready or adequately prepared for the protocol [Brexit arrangements] coming into effect in January”, she said. The EU and the UK embarked on the fourth round of talks on Tuesday but few expect any breakthrough with both sides sticking to their rpositions. Johnson has already made it plain that he will not seek an extension to the transition period by the legal 1 July deadline for such a request, raising the possibility of no deal at the end of the year."
2020-06-02T20:00:19Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer: 'Boris Johnson has to get a grip and restore public confidence',"For the last two months, Keir Starmer has been cautious about criticising the government’s coronavirus response. He has preferred to be forensic rather than furious, accepting that ministers have a difficult job. But it appears that his patience has finally run out. The calamitous events of the past week, from the Dominic Cummings affair to the mixed messages over the easing of the lockdown, has changed the mood of the new Labour leader. He has a tougher message now. “I am putting the prime minister on notice that he has got to get a grip and restore public confidence in the government’s handling of the epidemic,” he says. “If we see a sharp rise in the R rate, the infection rate, or a swathe of local lockdowns, responsibility for that falls squarely at the door of No 10. We all know the public have made huge sacrifices. This mismanagement of the last few weeks is the responsibility of the government.” Speaking to the Guardian via video link from parliament, Starmer said it was essential to “put down a marker” that Johnson needs to sharpen up, after a difficult week for the prime minister’s administration. He stresses that Labour, along with the whole country, wants the government to “get this right”. But he says there has been a loss in public trust. This has been caused in part by Cummings’ breach of the lockdown and Johnson’s decision to stand behind his senior aide without reprimand, which Starmer says has been damaging.
Add to that the mixed messaging over the lifting of the restrictions, a slow start to the contact tracing system and problems with daily testing figures and you have what Starmer describes as “an exit without a strategy”. “My [worry] is that after a week or more of mismanagement, I’m deeply concerned the government has made a difficult situation 10 times worse ... There is a growing concern the government is now winging it,” he said. “At precisely the time when there should have been maximum trust in the government, confidence has collapsed.” A major survey in the last week bears out that statement, showing trust in the government’s handling of the crisis has dropped and the gap in the polls between Labour and the Tories has narrowed – albeit four years out from another election. In terms of what has caused that shift, Starmer is clear. “It’s the Cummings factor of course, the sense of one rule for them and one rule for everyone else. But it is also the mismanagement of the lifting of restrictions – an example of that would be the decision on Saturday to change the position for those that were shielding without any mention of that in the press conference or without any preparation for it.” The Labour leader is sceptical about the way Johnson announced his easing of the lockdown measures in the week of the Cummings crisis, when police said the aide may have breached the rules and dozens of Tory MPs agitated for his removal.
“They obviously took a decision to try and deflect attention away from the Cummings affair. There are questions that the government needs to answer about the precise timing of the measures it put in place,” he says. Through the Cummings controversy, Starmer has taken a measured approach, saying he would have given him the sack, but stopping just short of demanding that Johnson forces his adviser out. But given Labour clearly believes the aide broke the rules in a way that has undermined public trust in the lockdown, why not simply call for him to go? Starmer’s answer is in line with his strategy of heaping responsibility on to the prime minister himself. “It’s blindingly obvious to me that the prime minister is just too weak to sack him,” he says. “I’ve laid out what I would have done as prime minister because of the impact on public trust and confidence. That’s the most troubling aspect of the whole Cummings affair. “We’ve all seen that loss of trust and confidence at precisely the wrong moment. If you had said which is the week the government needed maximum trust and confidence, the answer is the week in which you start easing restrictions … That’s where you need maximum trust and confidence. That’s the thing the government has burnt in the last few weeks.” Having won his job as Labour leader just two weeks into the lockdown, Starmer made a deliberate choice that he would try to be as constructive as possible towards the government. Some within his own party have wished for a less softly, softly approach, and more tub-thumping, anti-government rhetoric. But his calculation has been that the country wants cooperation rather than criticism for its own sake during such a serious national crisis. Starmer still believes that was the right strategy all along, even if it has not elicited much cooperation from the government in return, beyond an update meeting and a few phone calls.
On the issue of schools, Starmer says he wrote to the prime minister two weeks ago in “a private and confidential letter offering to help try and move this forward in a way that would ensure consensus and confidence and I haven’t even had a reply”. A toughening of his position has been inevitable, amid growing concerns among scientists, public health experts and others about Johnson’s handling of events and the surveys showing support for the government’s actions is increasingly being called into question. Now he is planning to ask for more meetings in person with Johnson, Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer. He still will not say, however, exactly what he would have done differently in terms of the timing of lifting the lockdown, or criticise the decisions to reopen schools and shops at this point in the epidemic. Part of the reason for this is that Labour does not have access to all the scientific advice that the government has received. “The important thing is that the government is transparent about taking the decisions it has. That’s why we have constantly called on No 10 to publish the scientific advice so that we can see the basis on which it is taking decisions,” he says. In light of that, he says it is a “backward step” that No 10 is cutting back press conferences to weekdays only, rather than daily. But Starmer also insists he wants to look to the future instead of past choices, suggesting it would be wrong at this stage to say the government has moved too fast on reopening society. “The problem is that the government has now done that and there’s no point putting the genie back in the bottle,” he says. “The question is how do we go forward now; it requires confidence building by the government, much more straightforward messaging.” The coronavirus epidemic has been all-consuming for his first eight weeks in the job but there are still tricky party issues to resolve that will also require his attention. The first is an Equalities and Human Rights Commission investigation into antisemitism within Labour, which former party leader Jeremy Corbyn suggested on Tuesday would be a product of the “part of the government machine”, casting doubt on its impartiality. Starmer made clear he disagreed with this analysis, saying: “I fully respect the independence of the EHRC. I was a champion of the EHRC being set up. I’ve been clear that under my leadership we will cooperate fully with the commission and implement all the recommendations it put forward.” The Labour leader will also have to deal with the continuing fallout of a leaked internal report into antisemitism, which angered those on the left of the party as it suggested some officials were working against Corbyn from within. Others were furious at the data breach caused by the leak. Starmer said he was determined that the independent inquiry he has ordered will report swiftly and “won’t be kicked into the long grass”. “People will see it is independent and I’ve no interest in anything that is not independent,” he says. Speaking from a big empty boardroom in the opposition leader’s parliamentary offices, with only a handful of Labour staff in the building and dozens of empty desks, Starmer has returned to vote in person in the House of Commons after weeks locked down in his north London constituency. It was a challenge running the end of a leadership campaign and then taking on such a big job that required setting up new teams remotely during a pandemic, he says. But there has been a silver lining in terms of his family. “I obviously started off running around the country trying to see as many people as possible and ended up doing an acceptance speech on my own in my living room,” he says. “Like everyone else, I’d love to get back to the stage where we will see each other physically; it’s had its challenges. But seeing more of my children has been one of the great advantages.” • This article was amended on 3 June 2020 because an earlier version misquoted Keir Starmer as saying “the EHRC”, where “we” was said in this sentence: “I’ve been clear that under my leadership we will cooperate fully with the commission …”."
2020-06-02T19:41:45Z,politics,Politics,MPs join 90-minute-long queue to vote to end virtual voting,"MPs are to return to parliament after a government motion was passed to prevent the resumption of virtual voting, despite what one MP called “absurd” scenes of a kilometre-long conga line of politicians trying to vote. The 527 MPs snaked through Westminster halls and courtyards for an hour and 23 minutes to vote on the proposal by the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, which was carried by 261 votes to 163. It incited a furious reaction from many MPs, including those who are shielding and black and ethnic minority (BAME) politicians. In a sombre moment in the debate that preceded the vote, the shadow Commons leader, Valerie Vaz, launched a blistering attack on the government, asking what “risk assessment” the government had done for both BAME MPs and workers in the parliament buildings. “We are twice as likely to die,” she said, adding: “Please stop peddling the myth that we only work when we are here [in the House of Commons].” Since 21 April a virtual parliament has allowed MPs to vote online or using their phones instead of cramming into backrooms in the House of Commons which divide the “ayes” from the “noes”. But Tuesday’s first physically-distanced voting demonstrated how the system risked being choked, despite Rees-Mogg’s claim it would be better for democracy. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary, described the queuing system as “genius level stuff” while Neil Coyle, the Labour MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark, asked if there were any “cat shepherds” in Westminster to move the queue through quickly.
“Queue two doesn’t even begin in courtyard. Welcome to what Johnson and Mogg think is acceptable for a 21st century modern democracy,” Coyle tweeted, photographing the queue weaving its way through the parliamentary building; through the lawned courtyard; the underground secure passage to the Portcullis House atrium where it ended.
“Government should be wholly embarrassed,” he added. Stewart McDonald, the Scottish National party MP for Glasgow South, said it was “absurd”, quipping that it might give the Conservatives “a practice run for the long airport queues post-Brexit”. He also complained that some MPs were not paying heed to social distancing. In a partial climbdown, Rees-Mogg said he would put forward a second motion on Wednesday to allow the hybrid parliament to continue to allow MPs to attend debates virtually. However, while he did not rule out a virtual or proxy vote, there were no plans to allow MPs who could not attend the house on medical grounds to have a vote on legislation. He pledged there would be a “pairing” arrangement that would ensure each MP unable to make the vote because of shielding issues would be matched by a non-voting government MP. But he faced an immediate backlash, with MPs living hundreds of miles from Westminster branding it “democracy for the elite”. The Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland, Alistair Carmichael, who took 18 hours to get to Westminster because of flight restrictions, said Rees-Mogg was giving a green light to a parliament for people “within driving distance of London”. The Democratic Unionist Ian Paisley said the move would “obstruct” the right to vote of the party’s eight MPs as there were flight restrictions in place between Belfast and London, while the SNP’s leader in the Commons, Ian Blackford, said it had taken him 16 hours to get to London because he had to get the sleeper train. “What a waste of time in the middle of a national health crisis when MPs should be attending to their overflowing postbags,” he said. Carmichael said it was also irresponsible. He would be staying in London “for the duration” because he felt he would have no choice but to self-isolate for 14 days if he returned to the islands from a potentially infectious environment. Rees-Mogg, who lives close to Westminster, questioned the democratic value of MPs who were voting on their phones or from their home offices. “Voting while taking a sunny walk or watching television does democracy an injustice,” he told the 30 or so physically-distanced MPs present in the chamber. Rees-Mogg claimed it was in voters’ interests to get parliament back up and running as legislation had been “clogged” with “no detailed, line-by-line consideration of bills that will affect people’s lives”."
2020-06-02T18:44:08Z,politics,Politics,The Tories turn parliament into the worldâ€™s worst theme park | John Crace,"Where to start? If it wasn’t already bad enough that the UK has the highest mortality rate in Europe and Dominic Cummings is given a free pass on his midnight flit to Durham and a 60-mile round trip eyesight test, the Tory government has now decided to turn the House of Commons into the world’s worst theme park. One where the only attraction is the kilometre-long queue itself for a ride that doesn’t exist. Some countries have used the global health crisis to discover the best of themselves. We have actively worked on becoming the worst possible iteration of ourselves. Still, at least the rest of the world can piss themselves laughing at our expense. So maybe look on it as a global public service.
To recap. Before the Whitsun recess, the Commons had a perfectly serviceable hybrid participation procedure, along with a fully functional remote voting system, to enable parliament to operate during the coronavirus pandemic. But Jacob Rees-Mogg wasn’t happy with that. Having spent several weeks trying to close down the Commons last year during the unlawful prorogation, the leader of the house has now decided he wants it to make it as inaccessible for MPs as possible. Anyone who is over 70, is pregnant or has health, childcare or travel issues is now effectively barred from parliament. With their constituents disenfranchised. Jakey likes to pretend to be the great parliamentarian – the master democrat steeped in centuries of tradition – but the reality is that Westminster is just a stage on which he gets to cosplay his public school fantasies in a suit that’s several sizes too big for him. Ideally the only people he wants in the Commons are people just like him: MPs with large London houses, a private income and an inherited nanny. For reasons best know to himself – perhaps he had forgotten the chamber was still restricted to 50 MPs so he would still be basically on his own during prime minister’s questions – Boris Johnson chose to indulge Jakey’s perversions by turning the vote into a three-line whip for Tory MPs. And as most of them are barely sensate lobby fodder with no mind of their own, they duly obliged by voting to deny other MPs a vote. Not for the first time in the past few weeks, the UK was putting on a good show of acting like a banana republic. Still, at least we got to enjoy the spectacle of Tory MPs having to suffer the humiliation of waiting for 43 minutes in a queue that snaked round Westminster Hall and back into Portcullis House. I shouldn’t think Jakey and Liam Fox can remember the last time they had to queue for anything. And even when they got to the front, dozens could barely manage to blurt out their names and what they were voting for. Tory Stephen Crabb first went down the “no” side while shouting aye, before changing direction and heading for the “aye” side where he promptly said no. It was low comedy performed by a cast of Tory grotesques who couldn’t even manage to observe the basics of physical distancing. As if they believed themselves immune to a disease that had already killed 60,000 people – with a lot of help from their own government – by virtue of their own importance. Some at least had the grace to look slightly ashamed to be participating in this profoundly undemocratic land grab but Maria Miller appeared unrepentant. Until earlier this year, Miller had been chair of the women and equalities committee but was now more than happy to trample all over those whom she used to pretend to care about. How she sleeps at night is anyone’s guess. Unfortunately for the opposition MPs and the handful of Tory MPs with a conscience, they also had to participate in the farce. Not once but twice, as the government had to first see off an amendment tabled by the Tory chair of the procedure committee, Karen Bradley, that proposed to maintain the hybrid status quo until the end of the summer. Some managed to maintain a modicum of good humour first time round, but as the exercise in futility extended towards the 90-minute mark many began to look seriously pissed off and their votes were cast with a definite edge in their voice. Kevin Brennan spat out the words “Mogg shambles”. Then the voting merely reflected the nature of the debate. Only this time we were seeing the “one rule for the elite, another for the rest of us” enshrined in law. It’s government policy for people to still work from home wherever possible, and here was Jakey and the rest of the cabinet actively making it impossible for MPs to work from home. If the government can treat its co-workers that badly, just imagine the contempt it has for the rest of us. Lou Reed had it about right. Give me your hungry, your tired, your poor I’ll piss on them. Your poor huddled masses, let’s club them to death. But it was all just water off Jakey and Boris’s back: Jakey even joked about the similarities to Alton Towers by telling MPs he had taken his sister Stigmata to the theme park. An opportunity for a cynical erosion of parliamentary democracy had been there for the taking and they hadn’t been able to refuse a gift horse. There had to be an upside of the coronavirus somewhere and it could make Brexit a little less hassle. And the donkeys had just gone along with it. From now on, every vote will be a 45-minute conga, with at least a hundred or more MPs effectively excluded. The Tories have effectively taken us from a modern voting system to one that would have been rejected in the Middle Ages. If I was an opposition MP, I’d tell any Tory asking for a pair to sod off. Make them all turn up and pray for the wettest June on record. Let it rain. Let them get soaked three times a day as the rest of the world sniggers at us. We used to pride ourselves on having the Mother of Parliaments. We’ve now just voted for the Mother of all Fuck-Ups."

2020-06-02T14:43:45Z,politics,Politics,Raab calls for alliance to force China to step back over Hong Kong,"Britain has vowed to build an international alliance of democracies going beyond “the usual suspects” to force China to step back from the brink over its plans for a new national security law in Hong Kong. In a statement to MPs, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said that by threatening Hong Kong’s autonomy, China “was inexplicably putting at risk what has long been regarded as one of [its] economic jewels”. He also accused Beijing of intimidation in building a pro-China global alliance, saying Britain was trying to build its own counter-alliance of democracies to defend Hong Kong freedoms. He said the alliance needed to stretch beyond ‘the usual suspects” in Europe and the Five Eyes alliance to include countries in Africa and Latin America so drawing together countries with “a likeminded attachment to the rule of law”.
Raab also clarified his offer last week of a path to citizenship through an extendable right to stay for periods of 12 months was applicable at this stage only to the existing 300,000 Hong Kong British Nationals Overseas (BNO) passport holders. The offer, including a right to work and study, will extend the right to stay from six months to an extendable 12 months. He said the offer would be formally made only if China wentahead with its as-yet-unpublished security laws. He told MPs the UK offer was confined to the existing 300,000 BNO passport holders and their dependents in Hong Kong, and not to those eligible for a BNO passport but who do not currently hold one. He said the UK government had to be realistic about the numbers Britain could credibly and responsibly absorb. If the offer was extended to all those eligible for the BNO passport, as many as 2.5 million people would be entitled to come to the UK. On Friday, there had been suggestions that the offer would definitely to be extended to all those eligible to apply for a BNO. Raab also ruled out calls from some MPs to offer a UK visa to those not eligible to apply for the BNO. Many of the younger Hong Kong citizens at the centre of the protests against Chinese rule have never been eligible for BNO status as it is only available to those born before 1997. Revealing he had been looking at the BNO issue with the Home Office since September, he said the UK’s offer met UK’s moral responsibilities as a former colonial power. “We, as the UK, have historic responsibilities, a duty I would say, to the people of Hong Kong,” he said. “We will stand by them, we will live up to our responsibilities,” and added: ”We have a proud tradition for standing up as a haven for those fleeing persecution”, Raab told MPs: “There is time for China to reconsider. There is a moment for China to step back from the brink and respect Hong Kong’s autonomy and respect China’s own international obligations. “If China continues down this current path, if it enacts this national security law, we will consider what further response we make, working with those international partners and others,” he said. “It can cross the Rubicon and violate the rights of the people of Hong Kong, or it can step back and understand the widespread concern of the international community”. He insisted the proposed new law breached Beijing’s international commitments to the “one country, two systems” principle in the former colony. A number of Conservative MPs demanded that the UK reset its relations with China, but Raab said he wanted to continue to cooperate with China on issues such as trade and climate change. Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, called for the UK government to “step up” its response. She told MPs: “It is time for an international democratic alliance to come together and speak with one voice.”"
2020-06-02T11:52:37Z,politics,Politics,UK fisheries accuse EU of using 'nuclear option' in Brexit talks,"The UK’s fishing industry has accused the EU of using a “nuclear option” to secure a Brexit deal, warning that it is prepared for blockades by the French if trade talks collapse. Fishing leaders have also revealed they do not support an extension to the transition period despite being hit badly by the coronavirus pandemic, with the closure of restaurants and hotels affecting sales. Barrie Deas, the chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations said the industry is relishing liberation from the common fisheries policy, claiming decades of injustices, such as French boats being allowed to catch 84% of the quota of cod in the Channel, for instance. Deas claims the EU’s “hardline position” involves zero compromise and “requires capitulation” by the UK over its demands for a fairer share of the catch from British waters. Fishing makes up 0.1% of the UK economy but it has found itself at the centre of the trade row because it is so emblematic of Brexit, with communities demanding the government “takes back control” of British waters. Talks are at a crunch stage, with the EU saying there can be no trade deal without an agreement on fisheries by the end of June to allow fresh quota levels to be set for January next year when the transition period is due to end. “This is something of a nuclear option … so far, there’s no sign of compromise from the member states, particularly the member states that benefit from the current arrangements, and the EU mandate doesn’t really provide any scope for compromise, what it requires is capitulation by the UK. My assessment is that that’s not very likely – fishing remains an emblematic issue for the government,” said Deas. His comments came as the fourth round of Brexit talks about trade and the future relationship between the UK and the EU began on Tuesday. In the past week, both sides have lowered their expectations, saying they think it is unlikely the impasse on fisheries and other issues will be broken. At a press briefing, Deas said the industry did not support an extension to the transition period and that skirmishes between English and French fishing leaders would be almost inevitable. “France benefits more than anybody else from relative stability from the current quota shares. If there’s any change to that, those quota shares or any other aspect that affects French fishermen, as day follows night there will be blockades, they have done it for much less in the past,” said Deas. He said other countries take “a much more pragmatic” view and recognise that “quota shares will have to change”. “There will be a reaction in France by the fishermen, that’s just the nature of the beast,” he said but added that that was not a reason “not to do what we’re doing” or to extend the transition period.
Two years ago, British and French boats clashed in the Channel in what became known as the “scallop wars”. Elspeth Macdonald, the chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation, warned that the French had much to lose if talks break down, with 5,000 jobs in Boulogne dependent on the business. She also pointed out that the fishing industry by value is worth “about £1bn in each direction”. However, this is split by 11 nations, with Ireland, France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and the Netherlands being particularly hit by any reduced access to British waters. Last week, the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he had spoken to 11 fishing ministers and there would be no change to his mandate."
2020-06-02T11:34:13Z,politics,Politics,UK government accused of 'power grab' over redrawing of boundaries,"Labour has accused the government of attempting a power-grab for the executive by pushing through a bill which that strip parliament of its role in approving the imminent redrawing of UK parliamentary boundaries. The decision to base the new boundaries on the electoral register as it stands in December this year would also greatly skew the process, Labour is arguing, as the chaos caused by coronavirus will depress numbers on electoral rolls, and many students might not be registered. The parliamentary boundaries bill, which sets the process in motion, will be scrutinised on Tuesday by the Commons for the first time, as it receives its second reading. The initial plan had been for boundaries to be redrawn through reducing the size of the Commons from 650 seats to 600, but this element has been abandoned, in part due to unrest among Conservative MPs whose seats would have vanished. The revised plan will keep the 650-seat total, but there still could be considerable changes, with the boundary commissions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland making recommendations to even up the constituency populations, given demographic changes over time. Under previous plans, the commissions’ plans would be scrutinised and voted on by the Commons and Lords. But in a government update in March, titled Strengthening Democracy, the Cabinet Office said this would no longer be the case. Instead the changes would automatically become law. This would, the Cabinet Office said, “provide certainty that the recommendations of the independent boundary commissions – developed through a robust and impartial process that is open to extensive consultation – would then be implemented without interference”. The only way MPs could stop this would be to amend the relevant laws to allow a vote. Labour has previously accused the government of seeking to use the constituency changes to its own advantage, and fears it could use the new power to change boundaries without a vote in the future. Analysis of the previous, 600-seat system showed that in the 2017 election it would have brought Theresa May an absolute majority, rather than a hung parliament. The party is also concerned at the use of 1 December as the electoral register on which to gauge the boundaries. Aside from the impact of Covid, Labour says the lack of an election in 2020 would depress numbers. It is also possible students will not have returned to universities by then, meaning areas with high student populations, which are often strongly pro-Labour, might be under-represented in the new boundaries. The Cabinet Office is understood to still be examining whether a register from another date might work better, given the impact of coronavirus. Cat Smith, the shadow Cabinet Office minister whose brief covers voter engagement, said: “The government’s decision to end parliamentary oversight by denying MPs the chance to vote on the boundary review process is yet another attempt to diminish scrutiny and concentrate power in the hands of the executive. “The new boundaries will be dangerously unrepresentative of the current electorate. Choosing the electoral register of 1 December 2020 as the basis for drawing new boundaries is politically motivated. The December 2020 register will be heavily affected by Covid-19 as local councils will struggle to update electoral registers whilst dealing with this crisis.” Chloe Smith, the Cabinet Office minister responsible for constitutional matters, said the bill “will strengthen the independence of the boundary review process, to prevent yet more delays and interference in updating our parliamentary constituencies - which are now 20 years old”. She said:“Parliament still has the opportunity to scrutinise our plans and parliament must still collectively decide to approve them. “We are, however, already considering potential alternatives to the data used for the next boundary review, to reflect the practical consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. We have and continue to engage with political parties and election administrators, and will update parliament in due course.”"
2020-06-02T10:48:13Z,politics,Politics,Rees-Mogg's plan to end remote voting in parliament condemned by rights body,"The Equality and Human Rights Commission has condemned the UK government’s plan to only allow MPs to participate in Commons debates and votes in person, saying it “cannot be right” to exclude older MPs or those with disabilities or illnesses. In a letter to Vicky Foxcroft, the shadow minister for disabled people, Rebecca Hilsenrath, the chief executive of the EHRC, said she wanted to raise concerns “that proceedings in parliament must remain fully inclusive during the coronavirus pandemic”. The concerns come as the government faces a potentially significant rebellion against its plans, with Conservative MPs including select committee chairs and a former cabinet minister tabling amendments to a motion on the issue being debated on Tuesday. Before last week’s recess, MPs had been able to speak via video and debate remotely if needed. But the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has allowed this system to lapse, meaning MPs must attend in person. This would require physically distanced voting, with long lines of MPs, an idea condemned by opponents as “beyond a farce”.
The Tory MP for Harlow, Robert Halfon, the chair of the Commons education select committee, who is shielding for health reasons, is among those who have called for virtual proceedings to continue. Jamie Stone, a Lib Dem MP, told the Guardian on Monday that because of the unavailability of carers to assist his wife, Flora, who had a stroke three years ago, he is unable to return to parliament in person. In her letter, Hilsenrath said the EHRC was worried at Rees-Mogg’s plan. She said: “This will place at significant disadvantage MPs who are shielding or self-isolating because of age, disability, health conditions or pregnancy, as well as other members who will struggle to attend the chamber in person due to travel restrictions and caring responsibilities. “It cannot be right for parliament to proceed without provision for remote participation, when many elected representatives cannot attend in person.” Hilsenrath said the government should “show leadership in championing equality and non-discrimination and to ensure that, when deciding future procedure, parliament remains inclusive and effective in making the decisions that affect us all”. MPs were due on Tuesday to decide on how to proceed, including methods for voting and whether to allow continued remote participation. Rees-Mogg has defended the plan in the House political magazine, saying the total numbers on the estate “will not increase significantly”, with MPs’ staff continuing to work from home. “For those MPs with underlying health conditions who have been told to shield or are receiving specific government advice about their health, the government is working with the house authorities to see how they can continue to contribute to proceedings,” he wrote. The former cabinet minister Karen Bradley is leading a rebellion against the ending of the hybrid Commons proceedings. Bradley, now the chair of the powerful procedure committee, has put forward amendments that would allow those MPs unable to travel to Westminster to keep participating in debates via video link and to vote remotely. She is backed by Tory MPs including Halfon, as well as Caroline Nokes and Julian Knight, who chair the women and equalities and the digital, culture, media and sport committees respectively."
2020-06-02T06:58:18Z,politics,Politics,'Flora needs me': MP caring for wife hits out at Jacob Rees-Mogg's plan,"Jamie Stone, the Liberal Democrat MP, hesitates before trying to explain why he is opening up about the running of baths, the opening of tins and holding of hands that he does for his wife, Flora, since she suffered a stroke 21 years ago. “Speaking about this is not easy. I am actually rather embarrassed to have to mention it. But I am so shocked by what Jacob Rees-Mogg is trying to shove through parliament that I am going to have to speak up,” he said. The House of Commons is poised to return on Tuesday after its Whitsun recess, but without the remote voting and video participation in debates that were introduced when parliament sat during the Covid-19 lockdown. Rees-Mogg, the leader of the house, has instead proposed a motion that requires voting to take place in person at the Palace of Westminster while MPs follow Public Health England distancing guidance. Critics have claimed the plan will disenfranchise those MPs who are shielding or have caring responsibilities for anyone who could be vulnerable to the disease. As MP for the Highland constituency of Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, Stone has flown back from Westminster for three-day weekends with Flora since his 2017 election. Now, amid the pandemic, he feels compelled to stay alongside her. “In previous times we had carers who came in at various times during the week. But now with Covid and with services stretched, I am the carer and I do it for the love of my wife, no problem,” he said. Since suffering a stroke, Flora is susceptible to falls. “She needs physical help doing things. I run the bath for her, I open tins, we have a bath lift,” he said. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Stone took on the entirety of her care as they were worried about carers coming in and inadvertently passing on the virus. There are other considerations too, Stone said, such as why should 650 potential carriers of a deadly disease be encouraged to travel from the cramped corridors of Westminster back to areas such as his constituency with a low incidence of the disease? “If I were to go to London and pick up a disease I could come back and start a hotspot. The alternative is to go to London and stay there until mid-July. But that is completely untenable for my wife. “Flora needs me and I have a duty to constituents not to bring the virus back with me from London. People have been incredibly kind and have been very grateful for that,” he said. If the house approves the government plan on Tuesday, MPs may have to form kilometre-long queues in order to obey physical distancing rules when voting – despite the Lords planning a move online. The former cabinet minister Karen Bradley is leading a rebellion against the ending of the hybrid Commons proceedings, which allowed for remote voting and virtual debates. Bradley, now the chair of the powerful procedure committee, has put forward amendments that would allow those MPs not able to travel to Westminster to keep participating in debates via video link and to vote remotely. Stone said Rees-Mogg’s proposals would abandon MPs with caring responsibilities. “He is putting me and others in a very impossible position. I am being told I have to choose between the health and wellbeing of my disabled wife or represent my constituents. “We shouldn’t be forced to compromise our family and our constituents when there is another way,” he said."
2020-06-02T05:00:02Z,politics,Politics,Gordon Brown urges G20 countries to back $2.5tn coronavirus plan,"Failure by the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations to organise a global Covid-19 recovery plan is a potential death sentence for the world’s poor, the former prime minister Gordon Brown has said. Brown, who pushed successfully for coordinated action during the financial crisis of 2008-09, said the lack of G20 action was disgraceful and risked a second wave of infection for rich countries. Writing in the Guardian, the last Labour prime minister said 225 past and present world leaders, academics and heads of civil society groups had written a letter demanding that the next meeting of the G20 be brought forward from late November. “For the first time this century, global poverty is rising and three decades of improving living standards are now in reverse,” Brown said. The “great reversal” would push an additional 420 million people into extreme poverty, he said. Brown was instrumental in giving the G20 more power in 2008-09, but said it had now gone awol – absent without lending – and had no plan to convene for six months. “This is not just an abdication of responsibility; it is, potentially, a death sentence for the world’s poorest people whose healthcare depends on enhanced international aid and on whom the richest countries depend to prevent a second wave of the disease hitting our shores.” In the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Monetary Fund estimated that emerging and poorer developing countries would require financial help worth $2.5tn (£1.98tn) to see them through the crisis. The G20 promised a swift response using all available policy tools, but Brown said promises had not been met. “With new Covid-19 cases around the world running above 100,000 a day, and still to peak, the vacuum left by G20 inactivity means that allocations from the IMF and the World Bank to poorer countries will remain a fraction of what they have said is required.
“The G20’s failure to meet is all the more disgraceful because the global response to Covid-19 should this month be moving from its first phase, the rescue operation, to its second, a comprehensive recovery plan – and at its heart there should be a globally coordinated fiscal, monetary and central bank stimulus driven forward with an agreed global growth plan.” The letter to the G20 said an immediate summit was needed to: Unlock $80bn of debt relief that would provide poor countries with a breathing space until the end of 2021 Organise global coordination of the development, mass manufacturing and equitable distribution of a universally and freely available Covid-19 vaccine as quickly as possible Provide extra resources from the IMF and the World Bank Agree a global plan based on green investment Brown said: “In the last financial crisis environmental investments formed less than 10% of the stimulus. To make this recovery sustainable the Green New Deal needs to go global, and to help pay for it, a coordinated blitz is required on the $7.4tn estimated to be hidden untaxed in offshore havens.” More than a hundred countries have sought help from the IMF since the crisis began, but the signatories to the letter – including former prime ministers Tony Blair and Sir John Major – said the poorest countries needed international aid within days not weeks or months. Helen Clark, New Zealand’s former prime minister, said: “The IMF has said emerging markets and developing countries need $2.5tn to overcome the crisis but only a fraction of that has so far been allocated.” The vaccine alliance Gavi is holding a funding conference in London later this week in which it is seeking pledges from governments so that it can continue to provide vaccines for poor countries. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a former vice-president of the World Bank and an ex finance minister in Nigeria, said: “We urge every G20 member to support in full the $7.4bn replenishment of Gavi – which between 2021 and 2025 will immunise 300 million children, saving up to 8 million lives.”"
2020-06-02T05:00:02Z,politics,Politics,Where's the catch in the Brexit fishing talks?,"European Union and British negotiators will face each other screen-to-screen as the latest round of Brexit talks get under way on Tuesday. During this four-day round, the most time has been allocated to one of the toughest issues: fishing rights. Why is such a small industry such a big problem? Fishing is a drop in the ocean of the UK economy (just 0.12% of economic output) but has become one of the most intractable issues of the Brexit talks. The reasons boil down to history, geography and politics. More than 100 categories of fish straddle EU-UK waters. Securing greater British control of these fish was a big promise of the 2016 Brexit campaign, one repeated by Boris Johnson ahead of his 2019 election victory. But the EU has eight member states with a lot to lose, including Belgium, Denmark and Germany, who say they can trace their exploits fishing in British waters back hundreds of years. What does the UK want? More fish is the short answer. The government believes the deal agreed on British entry into the European Economic Community in 1973 was unfair and needs to be unpicked. That agreement – later enshrined in the common fisheries policy (CFP) – is based on historic catches. The result is that EU-based fleets land about eight times as much fish in UK waters as British fishermen do in EU waters, according to UK government data. The UK wants to agree annual quotas with the EU based on the principle of “zonal attachment”, meaning agreeing shares based on the percentage of fish inside each side’s exclusive economic zone (a 200-mile area round the shore). British officials argue that this system would be fairer, more scientific and is already used by the EU in its annual quota-setting talks with Norway. What does the EU want? The EU wants the status quo, which allows member states to fish in British waters, with the most lucrative harvests for France, the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark. The negotiating mandate drawn up by the 27 member states instructs the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier – a former French fisheries minister - to “avoid economic dislocation” for European fleets, which have traditionally fished in British waters. For the EU this means “quota shares” that could be in place for as long as 25 years. EU officials say an annual negotiation is doable with Norway, where only six categories of fish are at stake. What does the fishing industry say? British fishing fleets were some of the most vocal supporters of Brexit. The Scottish Fishermen’s Federation is urging the government to stick to its guns and ensure “unfettered control over access” to UK waters, although it doesn’t rule out allowing in EU vessels. The shellfish sector, which is not covered by the CFP, wants to maintain access to EU markets and has warned that no-deal tariffs could cost £41m a year. Are there enough fish in the sea? Conservationists worry that Brexit is a big distraction from overfishing. Around 41% of commercial fish stocks in the north-east Atlantic, including the North Sea, are overfished, according to Oceana. The NGO thinks the British government’s fisheries bill does not go as far as the EU’s common fisheries policy in its intentions to prevent overfishing, although it and other conservationists have often criticised the EU for failing to meet promises to prevent the overexploitation of the seas. Who holds the cards? EU officials think that the UK probably has more leverage over fisheries than any other aspect of the Brexit talks. But the EU also has cards to play: 71% of British seafood exports go to the EU, while European fleets in UK waters often specialise in catching fish that are less popular with British consumers, such as herring. Former senior UK official Andy Lebrecht has warned that English fishing fleets risk losing access to French and Irish waters if talks sour. Will there be a deal? The two sides pledged to exert “best endeavours” to agree a fishing deal by 1 July to give crews time to adjust to changes from 2021. But hopes of an imminent breakthrough are low, despite hints of progress. Barnier has described both sides positions as “maximalist” and said fishing was “perhaps the only positive” outcome from the last round of negotiations. While the two sides are set to hold deeper technical discussions from Tuesday, the EU’s fishing member states have made it clear to Barnier that they are in no mood for compromise. What if there is no deal on fisheries? If the EU lives up to its oft-repeated threat, no deal on fisheries means no deal on anything. British-EU relations would fall into a more antagonistic phase that would stunt trade and cooperation, with tariffs levied on British fish being sold into the EU and many other goods. No deal on fishing could also lead to skirmishes on the seas similar to the 2018 “scallop wars”. Earlier this year, it emerged that the UK had been quietly increasing its maritime defences to prevent a repeat of the 1970s cod wars. Navy boats are just a small part of the armoury, which includes satellite tracking, although British officials concede that they cannot control every square kilometre of British waters. For now, both sides say they want a deal."
